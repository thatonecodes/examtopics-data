Database\n• NodePort – external service allows you to use worker node IP address\n• LoadBalancer – similar to NodePort except leverages Cloud Service Provider’s (CSPs) load balancer\n• ExternalName — a special service that does not have selectors and uses DNS names instead"},{"timestamp":"1727095260.0","poster":"miskill","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 4\n\nExplanation: Kubernetes supports four different service types:\n\nClusterIP: The default service type, which exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. It is accessible only within the cluster.\n\nNodePort: Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port. This makes the service accessible outside the cluster via <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.\n\nLoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. This service type automatically provisions a load balancer for the service.\n\nExternalName: Maps the service to a DNS name by returning a CNAME record, redirecting traffic to an external service outside the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThese are the four primary service types in Kubernetes.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1288118"},{"comment_id":"1283651","timestamp":"1726321440.0","poster":"jafg22","upvote_count":"2","content":"The correct answer its C\n\nClusterIP: The default type, exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP.\nNodePort: Exposes the Service on each Node’s IP at a static port.\nLoadBalancer: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.\nExternalName: Maps a Service to an external DNS name."},{"poster":"Darkren4eveR","content":"c\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726143660.0","comment_id":"1282620"}],"topic":"1","question_id":16,"question_text":"How many different Kubernetes service types can you define?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/147404-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-113-discussion/","choices":{"C":"4","B":"3","D":"5","A":"2"},"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2024-09-12 14:21:00","exam_id":281,"answers_community":["C (80%)","D (20%)"],"unix_timestamp":1726143660,"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"ohrugaZoyA6QrOJJ96Pa","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/157340-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-114-discussion/","question_id":17,"exam_id":281,"answer":"D","timestamp":"2025-03-01 16:18:00","choices":{"D":"A Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets.","A":"With a Deployment, you can’t control the number of pod replicas.","C":"A Deployment is basically the same as a ReplicaSet with annotations.","B":"A ReplicaSet does not guarantee a stable set of replica pods running."},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1363602","timestamp":"1740842280.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"shahy0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to applications."}],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1740842280,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"What is the difference between a Deployment and a ReplicaSet?","answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"oXpeJ03I1Viy1mGwjHm1","unix_timestamp":1740842400,"exam_id":281,"question_text":"The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) defines the protocol for the communication between:","answer":"A","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"The container runtime and the image registry.","A":"The kubelet and the container runtime.","C":"The kube-apiserver and the kubelet.","B":"The container runtime and etcd."},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_id":18,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/157342-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-115-discussion/","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-03-01 16:20:00","answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1363604","poster":"shahy0","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740842400.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe Container Runtime Interface (CRI) defines the protocol for communication between the kubelet and the container runtime.
