The permissions of a file or directory are divided into three parts: owner, group, and others. Each part has three types of permissions: read, write, and execute.\n\nThe first part of the chmod command specifies the permissions for the owner of the file (u for user). rwx means that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions. The second part specifies the permissions for the group of the file (g for group). rx means that the group has only read and execute permissions. The third part specifies the permissions for others (o for others). go= means that the group and others have no permissions.\n\nSo, chmod u=rwx,go=rx /bin/foo sets the file permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, read and execute for the group, and read and execute for others, making /bin/foo executable by everyone but writable only by its owner."},{"timestamp":"1710829320.0","comment_id":"672914","poster":"MoOshin","upvote_count":"1","content":"Which of the following commands makes /bin/foo executable by everyone but writable only by its owner?\n\nThis is a trick question, \nif you interpret is as the owner having just write permission, then none of the option is right, but if you interpret it as only the owner having write permission, then only option A meets that requirement."},{"content":"A is correct.\n\nuser (u) is set to read (r), write (w), execute (x)\ngroup (g) & others (o) are set to read (r) and execute (x)","poster":"Funkslinger","timestamp":"1692982800.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"556191"},{"content":"Given answer is wrong.
