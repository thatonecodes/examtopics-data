Here is the breakdown:\n\nKubernetes Control Plane Nodes: At least 3 hosts are recommended for the control plane components (kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler) to ensure high availability. This allows for redundancy and failover in case one or more control plane nodes go down.\n\netcd Cluster Nodes: At least 3 hosts are recommended for the etcd cluster to ensure high availability and data consistency. An odd number of etcd nodes is preferred to maintain quorum and avoid split-brain scenarios."},{"timestamp":"1736714580.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Six hosts.
