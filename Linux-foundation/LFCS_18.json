Option B is the correct answer.\n\nThe 'nice' command is used to set the niceness of a process, which determines the priority at which the process will run. A higher niceness value means that the process will have a lower priority and will run less frequently.\n\nBy default, a regular user can only set the niceness value to a maximum of '19'. This means that the process will have a lower priority and will run less frequently than processes with a lower niceness value.\n\nTo set the niceness value of a process to the maximum value of '19', you can use the following command:\n\nnice -n 19 command\n\nThis command will execute the 'command' with a niceness value of '19', giving it a lower priority and causing it to run less frequently.","comment_id":"764127","timestamp":"1719956460.0"},{"poster":"passnow","comment_id":"327209","content":"https://medium.com/@chetaniam/a-brief-guide-to-priority-and-nice-values-in-the-linux-ecosystem-fb39e49815e0","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1664783580.0"},{"content":"Answer correct.\nThe nice value range is -20 to +19 where -20 is highest, 0 default and +19 is lowest.","comment_id":"290782","timestamp":"1660541820.0","comments":[{"content":"0 is not the default, 10 is the default.\n\ncheck 'man nice'","timestamp":"1671897240.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"389669","poster":"jegga","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Funkslinger","comment_id":"556176","content":"To clarify...\n\n0 is the value of left alone.
