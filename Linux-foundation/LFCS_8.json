Without additional configuration, all users may have user specific crontabs.\n\nExplanation:\nThe existence of /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny files is a way to control which users are allowed to use the crontab command to manage their own cron jobs. However, these files are optional.\n\nIf neither file exists, the default behavior is to allow all users to create and manage their own crontabs.\nIf only /etc/cron.allow exists, only the users listed in that file are allowed to use crontab.\nIf only /etc/cron.deny exists, all users are allowed to use crontab except those listed in that file.\nIf both files exist, /etc/cron.allow takes precedence.\nIt's important to note that this behavior might vary slightly depending on the specific Linux distribution and its configuration. However, the general principle remains the same.","comment_id":"1236814","poster":"9866666","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719307740.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-06-25 11:29:00","topic":"1"},{"id":"CmfiuUvWarOak1d3gYue","timestamp":"2023-01-12 17:02:00","exam_id":282,"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1673539320,"choices":{"A":"grouprm","B":"groupmod","D":"usergroups","C":"passwd","E":"usermod"},"question_text":"Which of the following commands can remove a user from a group?","answer_ET":"E","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"mksarav","content":"generally admins mostly use gpasswd command for this. like:\n\ngpasswd --delete user group\n\nHowever, \nusermod -G \"\" username \nremoves all secondary/supplementary groups from username, leaving them as a member of only their primary group.

It organizes services and daemons into units and groups them into boot targets, which determine the set of units that are activated at boot time. The default boot target is the one that is activated by default when the system boots.\n\nTo change the systemd boot target, you can use the systemd.default kernel parameter on the kernel's command line. For example:\n\nsystemd.default=rescue.target\n\nThis will change the boot target to rescue.target, which activates a minimal set of units that are required to provide a rescue shell and access to emergency tools.\n\nOption E: The systemd.unit kernel parameter does not exist. It is not a valid option for changing the systemd boot target.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are also incorrect.
