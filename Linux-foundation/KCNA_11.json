There are three valid restart policies for containers in Kubernetes:\n\nAlways: The container will always be restarted if it stops, regardless of the exit status.\nOnFailure: The container will be restarted only if it exits with a non-zero exit status (indicating a failure).\nNever: The container will not be restarted, regardless of the exit status.\n\nThe valid container restart policies in Kubernetes are Always, OnFailure, and Never. The correct answer, OnFailure, specifies that the container will be restarted only if it exits with a non-zero exit status, indicating a failure."}],"answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/157521-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-161-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1741103580,"question_text":"Which of these is a valid container restart policy?","answer_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"adPs7VqbTYjdQ2KfCfKM","exam_id":281,"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Which of the following characteristics is associated with container orchestration?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/126496-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-17-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":52,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1700269320,"choices":{"A":"Application message distribution","D":"Virtual Machine distribution","B":"Dynamic scheduling","C":"Deploying application JAR files"},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-11-18 02:02:00","answer":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741053360.0","comment_id":"1364676","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nContainer orchestration involves the automated management of containerized applications, including their deployment, scaling, networking, and lifecycle management. One of the key characteristics of container orchestration is dynamic scheduling, which refers to the ability to automatically place containers on the most appropriate nodes in a cluster based on resource availability, constraints, and policies.","poster":"shahy0"},{"poster":"Train9","upvote_count":"2","content":"Yes B is correct","comment_id":"1085757","timestamp":"1733121060.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"fercho","timestamp":"1731891720.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","comment_id":"1073747"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"7wX5Hnn1S8PoBgIbLo8x","timestamp":"2023-08-28 15:17:00","question_text":"Which of the following workload require a headless service while deploying into the namespace?","answer_images":[],"question_id":53,"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1693228620,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/119240-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-18-discussion/","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1363084","timestamp":"1740753180.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA headless service is typically used in Kubernetes for workloads that require direct access to individual pods without load balancing.","poster":"shahy0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nHeadless services are not typically required for the other workload types listed:\nCronJob: Executes Jobs at a scheduled time, but doesn't necessarily require a headless service.\nDeployment: Manages stateless applications and can use a standard service for load balancing.\nDaemonSet: Ensures that a copy of a pod runs on each node in the cluster, but doesn't require a headless service for normal operation.","timestamp":"1727391360.0","poster":"dadaarce","comment_id":"1183761","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1179885","timestamp":"1726979580.0","content":"A. StatefulSet\n\nExplanation:\nStatefulSets are used for applications that maintain a persistent state or have a unique identity, such as databases. Each pod in a StatefulSet typically has a unique name, and it's necessary to ensure discovery and communication between these pods consistently, even when they are scaled up or down.\n\nAn analogy for StatefulSets could be managing a team of employees in an organization. Each employee has a unique name and a specific role. Even as the team grows or shrinks, it's important to maintain consistent communication among them. Therefore, you need a communication system (service) that can reliably locate each employee, regardless of changes in the team.","poster":"phcunha","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"pulsefire","timestamp":"1725666660.0","comment_id":"1167604","content":"A.\n\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#:~:text=StatefulSets%20currently%20require%20a%20Headless%20Service%20to%20be%20responsible%20for%20the%20network%20identity%20of%20the%20Pods.%20You%20are%20responsible%20for%20creating%20this%20Service."}],"choices":{"A":"StatefulSet","B":"CronJob","D":"DaemonSet","C":"Deployment"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":281},{"id":"jfCZ1PhtbgJ1ZJL18Cnb","question_id":54,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-08-28 15:16:00","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"shahy0","comment_id":"1363085","content":"Selected Answer: B\nHelm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications.

A package manager for Kubernetes applications.\n\nExplanation:\nHelm is a package manager for Kubernetes applications. It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and upgrading complex Kubernetes applications through the use of charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Helm allows users to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications with ease, managing dependencies and configurations in a standardized manner.\n\nAn analogy for Helm could be a delivery service for building projects. Instead of manually gathering all the necessary materials and tools for each project and setting them up individually, Helm acts as a package manager that organizes everything into convenient packages (charts) that can be easily delivered and installed wherever needed.","comment_id":"1179886","poster":"phcunha"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"nvtienanh","timestamp":"1709133360.0","comment_id":"992213","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct"}],"choices":{"A":"An open source dashboard for Kubernetes.","B":"A package manager for Kubernetes applications.","C":"A custom scheduler for Kubernetes.","D":"An end to end testing project for Kubernetes applications."},"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/119239-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-19-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"What is Helm?","unix_timestamp":1693228560,"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"exam_id":281,"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"552AsCmvQx8D1I256vCN","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/122254-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-2-discussion/","question_id":55,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1363048","poster":"shahy0","timestamp":"1740750900.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDeployment is for stateless applications"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1282258","content":"ReplicaSet for statefull applications\nDeployment is for stateless applications\nDaemonSet is for application that has to be on every node.\nPod is created as part of replicaset, deployment, daemonset","timestamp":"1726073760.0","poster":"Saireddybonthu"},{"comment_id":"1179791","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1711074720.0","poster":"JBangura"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Deployment","poster":"Anouar_Naggaz","timestamp":"1697527020.0","comment_id":"1045634"},{"comment_id":"1023924","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1696336200.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","poster":"nvtienanh"}],"unix_timestamp":1696336200,"exam_id":281,"answer_images":[],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-10-03 14:30:00","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"Which API object is the recommended way to run a scalable, stateless application on your cluster?","choices":{"D":"Pod","B":"Deployment","A":"ReplicaSet","C":"DaemonSet"},"isMC":true}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"id":281,"isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":138,"isImplemented":true,"name":"KCNA","provider":"Linux-foundation"},"currentPage":11},"__N_SSP":true}
