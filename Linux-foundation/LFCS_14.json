LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the environment variable that overrides or extends the list of directories holding shared libraries.\n\nIn Linux, shared libraries are compiled object files that are used by multiple programs. They contain code and data that can be shared among different programs, which reduces the size of the programs and speeds up the system.\n\nThe LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is used to specify the directories that the system should search for shared libraries. It overrides or extends the default search path that is specified in the ld.so.conf configuration file.\n\nFor example:\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\nThis adds the /usr/local/lib directory to the search path for shared libraries and prepends it to the existing value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\n\nOption A: LD_LOAD_PATH is not a recognized environment variable.\n\nOption B: LD_LIB_PATH is not a recognized environment variable.\n\nOption D: LD_SHARE_PATH is not a recognized environment variable.\n\nOption E: LD_RUN_PATH is not a recognized environment variable.","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","comment_id":"764065"},{"timestamp":"1664643300.0","comment_id":"326015","upvote_count":"1","content":"LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the predefined environmental variable in Linux/Unix which sets the path which the linker should look in to while linking dynamic libraries/shared libraries.","poster":"passnow"}],"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following environment variables overrides or extends the list of directories holding shared libraries?","exam_id":282,"question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"LD_LOAD_PATH","B":"LD_LIB_PATH","C":"LD_LIBRARY_PATH","E":"LD_RUN_PATH","D":"LD_SHARE_PATH"},"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1617296100,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/48675-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-28-discussion/"},{"id":"em8qaFLZJoj4OfnzGOaU","timestamp":"2023-01-02 23:17:00","answers_community":[],"isMC":false,"answer_description":"","question_id":67,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"To make this change permanent, you can add the following line to the /etc/fstab configuration file:\n\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,size=4G 0 0\n\nThis will mount the tmpfs filesystem at /tmp automatically during system startup.","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"764068","timestamp":"1719951480.0"}],"comment_id":"764067","content":"/tmp is the world-writable directory that should be placed on a separate partition in order to prevent users from being able to fill up the / filesystem.\n\nThe /tmp directory is a world-writable directory that is used to store temporary files that are created by users and programs. It is a good idea to place /tmp on a separate partition, because it is often used to store large files and it is not cleaned up automatically.\n\nBy placing /tmp on a separate partition, you can prevent users from being able to fill up the / filesystem by filling up /tmp. This is especially important if you have users who have the ability to create large files, or if you have programs that generate a lot of temporary files.\n\nFor example:\n\nmount -t tmpfs -o size=4G tmpfs /tmp\n\nThis mounts a tmpfs filesystem of size 4 GB at the /tmp mount point. Tmpfs is a filesystem that is stored in memory, and it is used to store temporary files. By mounting a tmpfs filesystem at /tmp, you can ensure that /tmp is always available and that it is not filling up the / filesystem.","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","timestamp":"1719951420.0"}],"answer":"/tmp -or- tmp -or- /var/tmp -or- /tmp/ -or- /var/tmp/","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"SIMULATION -\nWhich world-writable directory should be placed on a separate partition in order to prevent users from being able to fill up the / filesystem?
