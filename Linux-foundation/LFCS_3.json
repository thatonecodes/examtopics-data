The -R option tells shutdown to reboot the system, not to enter a maintenance state.\n\nOption B: The shutdown -single now command does not bring the system into a maintenance state. The -single option tells shutdown to boot the system into single-user mode, which is a minimal environment used for maintenance tasks.

It is a distribution neutral description of locations of files and directories.\nThe Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is a set of guidelines and standards that define the structure and organization of files and directories in a Linux or Unix-like operating system. It provides a common and consistent framework for different distributions to follow, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.\nThe FHS specifies the directory structure, file naming conventions, and the purpose of various directories such as /bin, /sbin, /usr, /var, and others. It defines where different types of files should be located, making it easier for users and administrators to locate and manage system files, configuration files, executables, libraries, logs, temporary files, and more.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Strib"}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-06-17 21:37:00","choices":{"C":"It defines a common internal structure of inodes for all compliant filesystems.","A":"It is a security model used to ensure files are organized according to their permissions and accessibility.","D":"It is a distribution neutral description of locations of files and directories.","B":"It provides unified tools to create, maintain and manage multiple filesystems in a common way."},"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"What is the purpose of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/112487-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-111-discussion/","question_id":13,"exam_id":282,"unix_timestamp":1687030620,"answer_description":"","answer":"D"},{"id":"Ox7dCCQ3ZPbRcNssxwt6","question_text":"SIMULATION -\nWhich umask value will result in the default access permissions of 600 (rw-------) for files and 700 (rwx------) for directories?
