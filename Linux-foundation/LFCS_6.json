The kernel message buffer is a system log that stores messages output by the kernel during the boot process and during system operation. These messages can include information about device initialization, driver loading, system errors, and other events.\n\nTo display the messages from the kernel message buffer, you can use the dmesg command with no options:\n\ndmesg\n\nThis will display the messages that were output by the kernel during the normal boot sequence, as well as any messages that were added to the buffer after the system was booted. To display only the messages from the normal boot sequence, you can use the dmesg command with the -T option to specify a timestamp for the oldest message to be displayed:\n\ndmesg -T\n\nThis will show only the messages that were output by the kernel during the normal boot sequence, starting from the time the system was booted.","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719947460.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1662805620.0","content":"dmesg (diagnostic message) is a command on most Unix-like operating systems that prints the message buffer of the kernel","comment_id":"307150","poster":"passnow"}],"question_text":"SIMULATION -\nWhich command will display messages from the kernel that were output during the normal boot sequence?"},{"id":"bZGsY2f06He2zmQxNVED","exam_id":282,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1236797","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nThe correct answers are:\n\nB. ~/.bashrc\nE. ~/.bash_profile\n\nExplanation:\n~/.bashrc: This file is read and executed by Bash whenever an interactive, non-login shell is started.
