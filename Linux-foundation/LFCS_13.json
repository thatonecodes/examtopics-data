File sizes are the information that is taken into consideration when using rpm --verify to check files created during the installation of RPM packages.\n\nThe rpm --verify command is used to verify the files that were created during the installation of an RPM package. It compares the current status of the files with the information that was stored in the package when it was installed, and reports any discrepancies.\n\nThe rpm --verify command checks the following information about the files:\n\nTimestamps: It checks the modification time of the files.\nMD5 checksums: It checks the MD5 checksum of the files, which is a cryptographic hash function that is used to verify the integrity of the data.\nFile sizes: It checks the size of the files.\nFor example:\n\nrpm --verify kernel\n\nThis verifies the files that were created during the installation of the kernel package.","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":282,"question_text":"When using rpm --verify to check files created during the installation of RPM packages, which of the following information is taken into consideration?

Every existing directory can be used as a mount point is correct when talking about mount points.\n\nIn Linux, a mount point is a directory that is used to access the contents of a filesystem. When you mount a filesystem, it is attached to a mount point and becomes accessible under that directory.\n\nAny existing directory can be used as a mount point. It does not have to be empty or have any special flags set. However, it is usually a good idea to use an empty directory as a mount point, because the contents of the mounted filesystem will be visible under that directory and might overwrite or conflict with any existing files.\n\nFor example:\n\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nThis mounts the filesystem that is stored on the device /dev/sda1 at the mount point /mnt."},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"558136","poster":"Funkslinger","content":"Can and should are different things.
