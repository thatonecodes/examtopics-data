The directories in which a Bash shell searches for executable commands are defined by the PATH variable. PATH is an environment variable that contains a colon-separated list of directories. When a command is entered in the shell, it looks for the command in each directory listed in PATH, in the order specified, until it finds the executable file. If the command is not found in any of the directories listed in PATH, the shell will display a \"command not found\" error.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1718624640.0","comment_id":"925938","upvote_count":"1","content":"A. BASHEXEC: This is not a standard environment variable in Bash. It does not define the directories for searching executable commands.\nB.

It does not define the directories for searching executable commands.\nE. PATHRC: This is not a standard environment variable in Bash.

The file command is used to determine the type of a file by using a definition database file which contains information about all common file types. The file command examines the contents of a file and matches it against patterns in the database to determine the file's type. It provides information such as the file format, encoding, and other relevant details.","timestamp":"1718624880.0","comment_id":"925940","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718624940.0","content":"A. magic: While the file command uses a \"magic\" database to determine file types, magic itself is not a command. It is the name of the file/database that contains the definitions and patterns used by the file command.\nB. type: The type command is used in Bash to determine how a command would be interpreted if executed. It displays whether the command is a built-in shell command, an alias, a function, or an executable file. It does not determine the type of a file based on its contents.\nD. pmagic: There is no standard command called pmagic related to file type determination in most common Linux distributions. It does not determine the type of a file based on its contents.\nE. hash: The hash command in Bash is used to remember the full pathnames of commands to avoid searching for the command in directories listed in the PATH variable. It does not determine the type of a file based on its contents.","poster":"Strib","comment_id":"925941"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Strib"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/112446-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-84-discussion/","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1687002480,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"file","D":"pmagic","B":"type","A":"magic","E":"hash"},"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-06-17 13:48:00","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following commands determines the type of a file by using a definition database file which contains information about all common file types?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","question_id":127,"exam_id":282,"isMC":true},{"id":"HytNS9E0iSB7L9UlHcFm","question_text":"Which of the following commands prints all files and directories within the /tmp directory or its subdirectories which are also owned by the user root?
