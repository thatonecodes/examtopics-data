The /etc/inittab configuration file should be modified to disable the ctrl-alt-delete key combination in systems that use the SysV init system. The inittab file is a configuration file used by the init program to determine the system's default runlevel and the processes that should be started at boot time. To disable the ctrl-alt-delete key combination, you can comment out the line in the inittab file that starts the process that handles the key combination.\n\nOption A: The /etc/keys file does not exist.\n\nOption B: The /proc/keys file is a virtual file that displays information about the kernel's key management. It is not used to configure the system's behavior.\n\nOption D: The /proc/inittab file does not exist.\n\nOption E: The /etc/reboot file is not used to configure the system's behavior. It is a script that is executed by the reboot and halts commands to stop the system."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Granddude","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-disable-the-ctrl-alt-del-shutdown.html","comment_id":"754619","timestamp":"1719182040.0"},{"timestamp":"1716373740.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"724317","poster":"exam67","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct. \nDisabling ctrl-alt-canc is a best practice on production servers.
