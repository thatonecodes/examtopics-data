The command kubectl explain deployment.spec.replicas specifically provides information about the replicas field within the spec of a deployment object.

However, it's not a standard way to access nested fields like spec.replicas.\nB. kubectl explain deployment.spec.replicas: This command is used to get documentation or information about a specific field within a Kubernetes resource definition. It will provide details about what the replicas field represents within the spec of a deployment.\nC. kubectl describe deployment.spec.replicas: This command describes an existing resource, such as a deployment, but it does not specifically explain the meaning or purpose of a field like replicas within the spec.\nD. kubectl explain deployment --spec.replicas: This command is close but not entirely correct.

NetworkPolicies allow you to specify how groups of Pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. By default, Pods are non-isolated, meaning they accept traffic from any source. When a NetworkPolicy is applied, it can classify Pods as isolated, meaning they only accept traffic that matches the specified rules.","timestamp":"1740800760.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"2211094","timestamp":"1736686080.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
