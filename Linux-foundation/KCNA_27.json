This approach adjusts the capacity of a single application instance, in contrast to horizontal scaling, which involves adding or removing multiple instances of the application.","timestamp":"1740838380.0","poster":"shahy0","comment_id":"1363560"}],"question_id":131,"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"The act of adding/removing applications to meet demand.","C":"The act of adding/removing resources to applications to meet demand.","D":"The act of adding/removing application instances of the same application to meet demand.","B":"The act of adding/removing node instances to the cluster to meet demand."},"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/157324-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-90-discussion/","question_text":"What does vertical scaling an application deployment describe best?","answer":"C","exam_id":281},{"id":"It1lALRqVuQncOYBKSap","timestamp":"2025-01-12 21:27:00","isMC":true,"exam_id":281,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"A computing method of providing backend services on an as-used basis.","C":"A computing method of providing services for quantum computing operating systems.","B":"A computing method of providing services for AI and ML operating systems.","D":"A computing method of providing services for cloud computing operating systems."},"question_images":[],"question_text":"What is Serverless computing?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/154442-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-92-discussion/","answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1740838500.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nServerless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. In this model, developers can build and run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
