To dynamically change the size of logical volumes.\nOption D. To create snapshots.\nOption E. To dynamically create or delete logical volumes.\n\nThe Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a software utility that is used to manage logical volumes in Linux systems. It allows you to create, resize, delete, and manage logical volumes, which are logical constructs that are used to organize and manage physical storage devices.\n\nLVM can be used for the following tasks:\n\nDynamically change the size of logical volumes: LVM allows you to increase or decrease the size of logical volumes on the fly, without having to unmount them or reboot the system.\n\nCreate snapshots: LVM allows you to create snapshots of logical volumes, which are read-only copies of the volume that are taken at a specific point in time. Snapshots can be used for backup, testing, or rollback purposes.\n\nDynamically create or delete logical volumes: LVM allows you to create and delete logical volumes as needed, without having to manually partition the underlying physical storage devices.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"764038","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","content":"Option A: LVM does not support RAID 9 arrays.
