Special Interest Group\n\nExplanation:\nSIG stands for Special Interest Group. In the context of Kubernetes, SIGs are groups of contributors focused on specific areas or domains within the project. Each SIG is responsible for overseeing and contributing to the development, maintenance, and improvement of its designated area, such as networking, storage, scalability, or documentation.\n\nAn analogy for SIGs could be departments within an organization. In a company, different departments (such as marketing, sales, or engineering) focus on specific areas of expertise and collaborate to achieve common goals. Similarly, SIGs in Kubernetes focus on specific aspects of the project and work together to advance the development and functionality of those areas.","poster":"phcunha","timestamp":"1726980300.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1179896"},{"timestamp":"1726489500.0","poster":"EzBL","comment_id":"1175012","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn the Kubernetes project, SIG stands for Special Interest Group. SIGs are responsible for focused areas of the project and coordinate efforts related to those areas. Each SIG has its own scope, responsibilities, and channels for communication, and they play a crucial role in the development, maintenance, and evolution of Kubernetes. Examples of SIGs include SIG-CLI, SIG-Storage, SIG-Network, etc.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1709551680.0","comment_id":"998421","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2019/09/12/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-application-delivery-sig/","poster":"aouihw","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1709134320.0","poster":"nvtienanh","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGiven answer is correct.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"992234"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"l3IYUC7afjRHUIvhUZwz","timestamp":"2023-08-28 15:33:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/119247-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-26-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1693229580,"choices":{"C":"Cluster -> Container -> Code -> Cloud","B":"Container -> Cluster -> Code -> Cloud","A":"Cloud -> Container -> Cluster -> Code","D":"Code -> Container -> Cluster -> Cloud"},"question_text":"What is the order of 4C’s in Cloud Native Security, starting with the layer that a user has the most control over?","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"exam_id":281,"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe 4C’s in Cloud Native Security:\nCode: Secure coding practices, code reviews, vulnerability scanning.\nContainer: Secure container images, runtime security, least privilege.\nCluster: Securing Kubernetes API, RBAC, secure communication.\nCloud/Infrastructure: Securing infrastructure, access controls, compliance.","timestamp":"1740754560.0","comment_id":"1363105","upvote_count":"1","poster":"shahy0"},{"timestamp":"1724851980.0","poster":"nvtienanh","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD make sense","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"992237"}],"question_id":62,"topic":"1"},{"id":"UNhbL7exup29gpIaJcSd","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-03-07 03:12:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/135364-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-27-discussion/","answer":"C","topic":"1","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740754620.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nKata Containers: Kata Containers combine lightweight virtual machines (VMs) with container technology to provide stronger isolation.

It provides HTTP and HTTPS routing to services based on incoming requests' hostnames, paths, or other criteria. Ingress exposes routes from outside the cluster to services inside the cluster, acting as an entry point for external traffic to reach services.\n\nAn analogy for Ingress could be a building's main entrance gate.
