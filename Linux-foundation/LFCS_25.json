It is typically initiated by the user pressing CTRL+C on the keyboard in the terminal. This signal can be caught by a process, allowing it to perform any necessary cleanup operations before exiting.\nSIGSTOP (signal 19) is sent to suspend a process temporarily.\nSIGKILL (signal 9) is sent to force a process to terminate immediately without performing any cleanup operations.\nTherefore, when a user presses CTRL+C, the operating system sends the SIGINT signal to the process running in the foreground of the terminal, allowing the process to perform any necessary cleanup operations before exiting. If the process does not catch the SIGINT signal, it will terminate immediately.","poster":"rona962"}],"unix_timestamp":1681351980,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-04-13 04:13:00","exam_id":282,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"SIGINT","C":"SIGSTOP","A":"SIGTERM","D":"SIGKILL"},"topic":"1","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/106078-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-80-discussion/"},{"id":"RaDhbfuA8KGsc33st6RG","timestamp":"2024-06-25 09:57:00","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","choices":{"B":"vi starts and requires the user to explicitly either create a new or load an existing file.","C":"vi exits with an error message as it cannot be invoked without a file name to operate on.","A":"vi starts and loads the last file used and moves the cursor to the position where vi was when it last exited.","E":"vi starts and opens a new file which is filled with the content of the vi buffer if the buffer contains text.","D":"vi starts in command mode and opens a new empty file."},"answer":"B","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"What happens after issuing the command vi without any additional parameters?","answer_description":"","exam_id":282,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/142895-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-81-discussion/","question_id":124,"unix_timestamp":1719302220,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719302220.0","comment_id":"1236754","poster":"9866666","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is B. vi starts and requires the user to explicitly either create a new or load an existing file.\n\nWhen you run the vi command without specifying a filename, it opens in command mode, but doesn't automatically load or create a file.
