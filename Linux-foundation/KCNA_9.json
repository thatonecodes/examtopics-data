It involves instrumenting application code to capture trace data, propagating trace context across service boundaries, and sending trace data to a tracing backend for analysis. This approach helps in understanding the performance and behavior of distributed applications, identifying bottlenecks, and diagnosing issues.","comment_id":"1364054","upvote_count":"1","poster":"shahy0"}],"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/157424-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-136-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":281,"question_images":[],"answer":"B","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_id":41,"timestamp":"2025-03-02 18:06:00","topic":"1"},{"id":"6RCkd2ZthpYfFrqEuK9V","question_text":"What framework does Kubernetes use to authenticate users with JSON Web Tokens?","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/157425-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-137-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-03-02 18:08:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1740935280,"topic":"1","question_id":42,"choices":{"A":"OpenID Connect","B":"OpenID Container","D":"OpenID CNCF","C":"OpenID Cluster"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1740935280.0","comment_id":"1364055","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of users based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the user. Kubernetes can use OIDC to authenticate users by validating the JWTs issued by an OIDC-compliant identity provider.","poster":"shahy0"}],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":281,"answer":"A"},{"id":"MqqSpXN8pxDcXE7HNhJC","unix_timestamp":1740935400,"question_id":43,"answer":"D","choices":{"C":"A container image registry.","A":"A portable operating system.","B":"File system redundancy.","D":"Automated rollouts and rollbacks."},"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/157426-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-138-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-03-02 18:10:00","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nKubernetes can automatically roll out updates to applications and roll back to previous versions if something goes wrong.
