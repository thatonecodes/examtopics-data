Services provide a stable endpoint (IP address and DNS name) to access a group of Pods, even as the underlying Pods are created, destroyed, or rescheduled. This abstraction allows for reliable communication between different parts of an application or between applications.","poster":"shahy0"}],"answer":"B","isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"xukeNrcWDK1stuNvFgNt","topic":"1","question_id":40,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/157429-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-135-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Security Profiles configure Pods and Containers at runtime.
