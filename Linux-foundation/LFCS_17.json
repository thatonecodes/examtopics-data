Option D is the correct answer.\n\nThe 'cut' command is used to extract specific fields or columns from a file. The '-d' option specifies the delimiter, and the '-f' option specifies the fields to extract.\n\nIn this case, the command will extract the first ('1') and seventh ('7') fields from '/etc/passwd', using a colon (':') as the delimiter. The '/etc/passwd' file contains a list of user accounts on the system, with each line representing a single user. The fields are separated by colons, the first field is the user name and the seventh field is the login shell.\n\nTherefore, the command will generate a list of user names from '/etc/passwd' along with their login shell."}],"question_text":"What command will generate a list of user names from /etc/passwd along with their login shell?","timestamp":"2023-01-03 00:11:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":282},{"id":"K5JxHlfdY6kxVzntvyc1","exam_id":282,"unix_timestamp":1672701360,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_id":82,"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"A":"-dirmax","B":"-maxdepth","E":"-s","D":"-n","C":"-maxlevels"},"question_images":[],"answer":"B","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/93616-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-42-discussion/","question_text":"In a nested directory structure, which find command line option would be used to restrict the command to searching down a particular number of subdirectories?","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-01-03 00:16:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"764112","content":"The other options do not accurately describe the behavior of the 'find' command:\n\nOption A: The '-dirmax' option is not a valid option for the 'find' command.\n\nOption C: The '-maxlevels' option is not a valid option for the 'find' command.\n\nOption D: The '-n' option is not a valid option for the 'find' command.\n\nOption E: The '-s' option is not a valid option for the 'find' command.","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","timestamp":"1719954960.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"764111","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn a nested directory structure, the 'find' command line option that would be used to restrict the command to searching down a particular number of subdirectories is '-maxdepth'.\n\nThe 'find' command is used to search for files and directories based on various criteria, such as name, size, type, and modification time.
