The -r option tells shutdown to reboot the system, but the command must also specify a time at which the reboot should occur.\n\nOption C: The telinit 6 command tells init to switch to runlevel 6, which is the runlevel used to reboot the system when using SysV init.\n\nOption D: The telinit 0 command tells init to switch to runlevel 0, which is the runlevel used to halt the system.
