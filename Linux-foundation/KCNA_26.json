DNS-based Service Discovery uses the built-in DNS server to provide DNS names for Services, while Environment Variable-based Service Discovery injects environment variables containing Service information into Pods. These mechanisms enable Pods to discover and communicate with Services within the cluster.","timestamp":"1740837900.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1363554","poster":"shahy0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nEnvironment variables and DNS is the answer.","comment_id":"1339522","timestamp":"1736688900.0","poster":"2211094","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"AbhishekJoshi","timestamp":"1718603580.0","comment_id":"1098724","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://www.densify.com/kubernetes-autoscaling/kubernetes-service-discovery/ .. please see conclusion"}],"unix_timestamp":1702799580},{"id":"cZx3kpqzhmgOQyOVXxHF","exam_id":281,"timestamp":"2024-03-07 04:15:00","question_id":127,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/135368-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-86-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1363555","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe Restricted policy in Kubernetes is designed to enforce strict security constraints on containers, but it does allow certain capabilities that are considered safe and necessary for common container operations.
