Therefore, the correct option is B.\n\nThis is known as a repetition factor, and it allows you to execute a command multiple times on a range of lines. For example, you can use 4l to move the cursor four characters to the right, or 2yj to copy the current line and the line below it into the buffer.\n\nNote that not all commands can be repeated this way, but many of the basic editing commands in vi support this feature.

For example:\nexport HISTFILE=~/.bash_history\n\nThis would set the history file to the default location of .bash_history in your home directory.\n\nSaving History: By default, Bash appends the command history to the HISTFILE when the session ends. You can also manually save the history at any time using the history -a command.\n\nLoading History: When a new Bash session starts, it reads the command history from the file specified by HISTFILE.
