This command provides real-time updates on whether the new Pods are being created correctly and whether the old ones are being terminated. It ensures that the rollout is proceeding as expected and alerts if any issues occur during the update.\n\nOther options like kubectl rollout watch, kubectl rollout progress, and kubectl rollout state are not valid Kubernetes commands for monitoring rollout progress. The proper command to use for tracking progress is kubectl rollout status"},{"poster":"SeaH0rse66","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1715960760.0","comment_id":"1212947","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption A (kubectl rollout watch) is not the correct choice because the kubectl rollout watch command is used to continuously monitor the rollout progress of a deployment, allowing you to watch for changes in the rollout status in real-time. However, it is specifically designed for monitoring deployments and does not directly apply to DaemonSets or StatefulSets.\n\nWhile you could use kubectl rollout watch for deployments, it may not provide accurate or relevant information for DaemonSets or StatefulSets. Therefore, option A is not the most suitable command for monitoring the progress of updates to DaemonSets or StatefulSets.\n\nOn the other hand, option D (kubectl rollout status) is a more generic command that works for all types of rollouts, including deployments, DaemonSets, and StatefulSets. It provides detailed information about the status of the rollout, making it a better choice for monitoring the progress of updates across different types of workload controllers in Kubernetes."}],"unix_timestamp":1713786420,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-04-22 13:47:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/139360-exam-kcna-topic-1-question-49-discussion/","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"B":"kubectl rollout progress","D":"kubectl rollout status","A":"kubectl rollout watch","C":"kubectl rollout state"},"exam_id":281,"answer_images":[],"question_id":87,"answers_community":["D (62%)","A (38%)"],"question_text":"How can you monitor the progress for an updated Deployment/DaemonSets/StatefulSets?","question_images":[]},{"id":"uJwSimJoFglqS8XvyOuW","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1693227120,"question_id":88,"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-08-28 14:52:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is B, is always allow by default","timestamp":"1741285860.0","comment_id":"1365976","poster":"jocasmen94"},{"poster":"shahy0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis means that by default, the API server allows all requests.
