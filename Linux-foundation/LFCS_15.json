It reads its configuration from a file called grub.cfg, which is usually located in the /boot/grub/ directory.\n\nThe grub.cfg file contains the menu entries and boot options that are presented to the user at boot time. It specifies the default boot entry, the timeout before the default entry is booted, and the options that are passed to the kernel.\n\nFor example:\n\n# Set the default boot entry\nset default=0\n\n# Set the timeout in seconds\nset timeout=5\n\n# Define a menu entry for the Linux kernel\nmenuentry 'Linux' {\n set root='(hd0,1)'\n linux /vmlinuz-4.19.0-13-amd64 root=/dev/sda2 ro\n initrd /initrd.img-4.19.0-13-amd64\n}\n\n# Define a menu entry for the Windows bootloader\nmenuentry 'Windows' {\n set root='(hd0,2)'\n chainloader +1\n}","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","comments":[{"poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","comment_id":"764080","timestamp":"1719952140.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"This is a sample grub.cfg file that defines two menu entries: one for the Linux kernel, and one for the Windows bootloader.

The options that are passed to the kernel are specified in the linux command, and the initrd image is specified in the initrd command.\n\nTo make changes to the GRUB configuration, you can edit the grub.cfg file manually, or you can use the grub-mkconfig command to generate a new configuration file based on the available kernels and boot options."}],"comment_id":"764078"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/93604-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-32-discussion/"},{"id":"9pJhFTw2pzMUHfhnskn0","answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-01-02 23:32:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1672698720,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/93606-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-33-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","question_id":72,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption C '--purge' will completely remove the package, including its configuration files.\n\nTo remove a package using dpkg, you can use the following command:\n\nsudo dpkg --purge package_name\n\nThis will remove the package and all its configuration files.\n\nOption A '--clean' option does not remove the package or its configuration files.
