It takes the output from the command on its standard input and writes it to both stdout and the specified file.\n\nTo send output from the program 'myapp' to both stdout and the file 'file1.log', you can use the following command:\n\nmyapp | tee file1.log\n\nThis command will execute the program 'myapp' and redirect its output to the 'tee' command.
