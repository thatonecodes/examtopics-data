It reads its configuration from the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file and uses it to create a menu that allows the user to select an operating system or boot option.\n\nIf you make changes to the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file, you must run the grub-install command to apply the changes and update the boot menu. The grub-install command installs the GRUB bootloader on the system and writes the configuration to the boot sector of the system's boot partition.\n\nFor example:\n\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\nThis installs the GRUB bootloader on the first hard drive ( /dev/sda ) and updates the boot menu with the new configuration.","comment_id":"764016","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","comments":[{"timestamp":"1688326200.0","content":"Option A: The kill -HUP $(pidof grub) command does not apply changes to the GRUB configuration file.
