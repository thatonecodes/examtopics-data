It will break the file into new files of 1,000 line pieces each.\n\nThe split command is used to split a file into smaller parts or chunks. By default, if no specific options are provided, the split command will split the input file into new files based on the number of lines.\n\nThe default behavior of split is to create output files with a maximum of 1,000 lines each. The resulting files will be named with a default prefix \"x\" followed by a two-letter suffix (e.g., \"xaa,\" \"xab,\" \"xac,\" and so on).\n\nTo specify a different number of lines or other criteria for splitting the file, specific options can be provided with the split command.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718543340.0","comment_id":"925191","poster":"Strib"},{"comment_id":"866738","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe default action of the split command on an input file in Linux is to break the file into new files of 1,000 line pieces each. Therefore, the correct option is B.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the behavior of the split command can be customized using command-line options. For example, the -b option can be used to specify the size of each output file in bytes, and the -l option can be used to specify the number of lines per output file. If no options are specified, the split command uses the default behavior of splitting the input file into 1,000 line pieces.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rona962","timestamp":"1712797320.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"290878","poster":"Borbz","timestamp":"1644921960.0","content":"B is correct."}],"unix_timestamp":1613385960,"exam_id":282,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-02-15 11:46:00","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"What is the default action of the split command on an input file?"},{"id":"YbCzffOjMkc4wLPYJyFe","answer":"B","question_images":[],"question_text":"What is the difference between the i and a commands of the vi editor?","exam_id":282,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/linux-foundation/view/44766-exam-lfcs-topic-1-question-57-discussion/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-02-15 11:47:00","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"i (insert) inserts text before the current cursor position whereas a (append) inserts text after the cursor.","D":"i (interrupt) temporarily suspends editing of a file to the background whereas a (abort) terminates editing.","C":"i (independent rows) starts every new line at the first character whereas a (aligned rows) keeps the indentation of the previous line.","A":"i (interactive) requires the user to explicitly switch between vi modes whereas a (automatic) switches modes automatically."},"discussion":[{"poster":"Strib","comment_id":"925195","timestamp":"1718543520.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. i (insert) inserts text before the current cursor position whereas a (append) inserts text after the cursor.\n\nIn the vi editor, the \"i\" command is used to enter the insert mode, which allows you to insert text before the current cursor position.
