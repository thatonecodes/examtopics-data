Doing so, the ML Skill will be accessible via an endpoint from outside of UiPath environment. This means that you can call it without the need to go through a robot connected to the specific tenant.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1225865"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":138,"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"9rCpXxAQaS8B8FFeB27n","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-12-28 04:57:00","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1735358220,"choices":{"C":"4","B":"3","A":"2","D":"5"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/153545-exam-uisaiv1-topic-1-question-40-discussion/","exam_id":138,"question_text":"How many types of synchronization mechanisms exist in the Document Understanding Process to prevent multiple robots to write in a file at the same time?","isMC":true,"question_id":82,"question_images":[],"answer":"C","discussion":[{"poster":"Karim_Seddik","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThere are three primary synchronization mechanisms designed to prevent multiple robots from writing to a file simultaneously:\n1. Semaphore Mechanism: This approach uses semaphores to regulate access, ensuring that only one robot can write to a file at any given time.\n2. Orchestrator Queues: By employing queues, each robot processes unique transactions, thereby avoiding concurrent write operations to the same file.\n3. File Locking: This method involves implementing file locks, so when one robot is writing to a file, others are prevented from accessing it until the operation is complete.","timestamp":"1741053360.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1364675"},{"poster":"lucky8921","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn a Document Understanding Process, typically C. 4 types of synchronization mechanisms are commonly used to prevent multiple robots from writing to a file simultaneously:\nFile locking:\nA simple method where a robot acquires an exclusive lock on a file before writing to it, preventing other robots from accessing it until the lock is released.\nDatabase locks:\nWhen storing document data in a database, utilize database-level locks to control access to specific records or tables related to the document.\nDistributed locks:\nFor large-scale systems with multiple robots across different servers, a distributed locking mechanism like Redis or ZooKeeper can be used to coordinate access to the file across the network.\nSemaphores:\nA more complex synchronization primitive that can be used to manage access to a shared resource (the file) by allowing a specified number of robots to write at a time.","comment_id":"1332755","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1735358220.0"}],"answers_community":["C (67%)","B (33%)"]},{"id":"4eHZD9byP43qNchL4yYA","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/142070-exam-uisaiv1-topic-1-question-41-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_text":"What does the Automation Suite installer enable?","exam_id":138,"question_id":83,"answer":"C","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAutomation Suite enables you to deploy the full UiPathÂ® automation platform in a Linux environment ranging from bare metal machines to on-premises Virtual Machine infrastructure, or cloud subscriptions to any of the major providers.\n\nManaging multiple server product deployments independently usually requires configuring integrations with enterprise systems for authenticating and managing users, as well as managing and monitoring each deployment from an availability and scale perspective.\n\nAutomation Suite contains everything in one package that you can deploy in multi-node HA-ready production mode with automatic scaling and built-in HA, and monitor, configure, and upgrade as a whole.
