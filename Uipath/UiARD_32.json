Each time an exception is caught in a Catch block:\n\nLogging exceptions should be done with a \"Warning\" or \"Error\" level, depending on the severity. Logging them at the \"Information\" level is not best practice, as exceptions indicate abnormal behavior.\nB. Every time the robot encounters an error on a Queue Item:\n\nErrors related to Queue Items should also be logged with a \"Warning\" or \"Error\" level, not \"Information\", because they represent failures that require attention.\nC. Every time a variable or argument value is used:\n\nLogging every variable or argument value would lead to excessive logs, reducing readability and making it harder to identify meaningful information. Logging at this level is unnecessary unless debugging is specifically required.\nConclusion:\nThe \"Information\" logging level is best used for significant, non-error-related events in the process, such as reading data from external sources.
