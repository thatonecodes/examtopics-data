Apart from this, you can use data labeling for human validation on model outputs.\n\nA common scenario is when you train an extractor or classifier model. When the model prediction falls below a set confidence threshold, that data can be sent to Action Center for human validation. The validated data can be used to retrain the model in order to improve confidence on subsequent model predictions.\n\nhttps://docs.uipath.com/ai-center/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/using-data-labeling-with-human-in-the-loop","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1733852760.0","poster":"Engineer24"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/142288-exam-uisaiv1-topic-1-question-179-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1718034360,"question_id":37,"answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"PjS3DPuE4lEivJrhCtSP","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2024-06-03 16:21:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/141815-exam-uisaiv1-topic-1-question-18-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"davidgoderre","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1320325","timestamp":"1732988940.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.uipath.com/document-understanding/standalone/2021.10/user-guide/du-in-as-deploy-an-out-of-the-box-ml-package"},{"comment_id":"1298221","poster":"Aplin","timestamp":"1728994260.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn my case it has always taken more than 15"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"correct answer is D.
