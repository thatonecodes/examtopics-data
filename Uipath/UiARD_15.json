Split the project into multiple workflows and use arguments when needed. \n\nThis is the recommended approach for improving the ability to independently test components. Breaking a complex process down into smaller, more manageable workflows makes it easier to test individual components and isolate errors. By using arguments to pass data between workflows, you can also make the process more flexible and reusable. This approach aligns with the best practice of modularizing processes for better maintainability and scalability.","timestamp":"1719384660.0","poster":"sakanank"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"909923","content":"The answer might be wrong","poster":"Shane1407","timestamp":"1717047120.0"}],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"exam_id":136,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Test only the activities that have shown previous errors and modify those activities","A":"Place the entire workflow into a single sequence and perform start-to-finish debugging","D":"Place the entire project on GIT and use libraries instead of built-in activities","B":"Split the project into multiple workflows and use arguments when needed"},"topic":"6","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1683074640,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/108346-exam-uiard-topic-6-question-71-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-05-03 02:44:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"RrFdYwgLnHnD9HNW6p52","question_text":"During the execution of a process, a button must be clicked to open an application.
