As this mode shows you predictions for a label with confidence scores ranging outwards from 50% (or 66% in the case of a sentiment-enabled dataset), accepting or correcting these predictions sends much more powerful training signals to the model than if you were to accept predictions with confidence scores of 90% or more. In this way, you can quickly improve the performance of a label by providing varied training examples that the platform was previously unsure about.","timestamp":"1736597940.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1736597940,"timestamp":"2025-01-11 13:19:00","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","exam_id":138,"question_id":114,"isMC":true,"topic":"1"},{"id":"MCUYqba6zHUPvLRfvVJW","choices":{"A":"The trainer's discretion is based on use case objectives and capacity to continue training.","D":"The proportion of data that has been annotated is at least 10% of total dataset volumes.","B":"There are at least 200 labels with at least a 70% MAP.","C":"There are at least 150 labels with at least an 80% MAP."},"exam_id":138,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1740816420.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://docs.uipath.com/communications-mining/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/when-to-stop-training-your-model","comment_id":"1363447","poster":"BenAndBen"}],"question_text":"In an analytics-focused model in UiPath Communications Mining, which factor determines the extent to which a model trainer should optimize their model's performance?","answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2024-06-03 02:00:00","question_id":115,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1717372800,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/141774-exam-uisaiv1-topic-1-question-90-discussion/","answer_images":[]}],"exam":{"name":"UiSAIv1","provider":"Uipath","isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":138,"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":121},"currentPage":23},"__N_SSP":true}
