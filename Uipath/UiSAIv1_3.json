For simpler scenarios with few regular fields and clear document layouts, good results may be obtained with datasets in low orange range. For complex scenarios, especially involving complex tables with many columns, good results may require datasets in high orange or even green range.\n\nhttps://docs.uipath.com/document-understanding/automation-cloud/latest/classic-user-guide/training-high-performing-models","poster":"Engineer24","timestamp":"1733652900.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nRegular fields: 20-50 samples per field\nColumn fields: 50-200 samples per field\nClassification fields: 10-20 samples per class\n\nSo the answer is B","comment_id":"1222002","poster":"MotherOfHarryPotter","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732959780.0"},{"poster":"Sajinn","comment_id":"1205330","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB should be the correct answer.\n\"Classification fields generally require at least 10-20 samples from each class.\"\nsource: \nhttps://docs.uipath.com/document-understanding/automation-cloud/latest/classic-user-guide/training-high-performing-models","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730537400.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Fly100","comment_id":"1201252","content":"B is correct","timestamp":"1729764300.0"},{"content":"I think the answer is not correct.
