The question mentions \"integer form\" as a distraction to trick you into picking \"integer\" as the answer.\n\nList of String versus Array of String? Which is better? Remember that only Lists have dynamic size. That means you can add employee ID's to them in a \"For Each\" loop, one by one. It's much more difficult to do that with Arrays, because Arrays have fixed size. You add a value to an Array of 5 items, so now you have 6 items total. Check the length of the Array, and it will tell you that you still have 5 items in there. You can write janky code to manually update the size of the array to 6, but it's obvious that is not ideal when Lists have this functionality built-in already.","poster":"noragrets","comment_id":"914920","timestamp":"1685911200.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"910818","poster":"MarioEmanuel88","content":"should be Int32 because those ID are intergers\nlist of string, for sure can't be because id is int32 not string","timestamp":"1685510220.0"},{"content":"Helllo fletchm58c.\ncould you please add your input on it?","comment_id":"869160","timestamp":"1681368420.0","poster":"AutomationMaster","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1680868560.0","comment_id":"863796","poster":"AutomationMaster","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSince X is an integer so ans should be Int32[].\nIf someone can clarify on it is appreciable."}],"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (78%)","D (22%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/105503-exam-uirpa-topic-1-question-35-discussion/","answer":"A","question_id":38,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","question_text":"A developer created an attended automation project to generate and store employee IDs within a company’s HR application.
