To cover multiple languages, then you need at least 200-300 samples per language assuming they cover all the different fields. So, for 10 header fields and 4 column fields with 2 languages, 600 samples might be enough (400 for the columns and headers plus 200 for the additional language), but in some cases might require 1200 or more.","poster":"BenAndBen","comment_id":"1364263","timestamp":"1740981600.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/157439-exam-uisaiv1-topic-1-question-112-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1740981600,"isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"100-200 document samples per column field.","A":"10-20 document samples per column field.","C":"50-200 document samples per column field.","B":"20-50 document samples per column field."}},{"id":"KIBs9yQk7UcSikBm2apU","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-06-09 12:44:00","answer":"B","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nML SKill","timestamp":"1740981780.0","comment_id":"1364264","poster":"BenAndBen","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"B is correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Phanindra_P","comment_id":"1230894","timestamp":"1718447760.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1718114400.0","comment_id":"1228487","poster":"Engineer24","content":"Selected Answer: B\nsorry B is Correct"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe answer is correct !","comment_id":"1227253","timestamp":"1717929840.0","poster":"Engineer24"}],"answers_community":["B (75%)","C (25%)"],"unix_timestamp":1717929840,"question_id":10,"exam_id":138,"choices":{"C":"Timeout.","D":"ApiKey.","A":"Endpoint.","B":"ML Skill."},"question_text":"What additional property does the ML Extractor have compared to the other types of extractors?","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/uipath/view/142213-exam-uisaiv1-topic-1-question-114-discussion/","answer_images":[],"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"name":"UiSAIv1","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Uipath","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"id":138,"numberOfQuestions":121,"isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":2},"__N_SSP":true}
