Of course, you can add Region to filters card but the question was about the parameter Choose Region and how to use it as a filter to interact with a chart. If we just add Region to filters card it has nothing to do with parameter and we can use this filter without parameter at all. That is why answer C is not the case. So we already have a parameter. Next we need to create a calculated field with formula [Region] = [Choose Region]. After that we put calculated field to filters card and set it to True. After we click show parameter and use it as a filter. This is how it works. So the right answer is B.","comment_id":"1210714"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/filtering-data-with-a-parameter?lang=fr-fr","poster":"Pdel","timestamp":"1717071900.0","comment_id":"1084446"},{"timestamp":"1710849540.0","comment_id":"1011173","poster":"JUT_TC","content":"c-Add region to the filters card","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":76,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-09-19 11:59:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/tableau/view/120959-exam-tda-c01-topic-1-question-42-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"You create a parameter named Choose Region that contains values from a field named Region.\nYou want users to be able to use the Choose Region parameter to interact with a chart by toggling between different regions.\nWhat should you do next?","topic":"1","answer":"C","choices":{"D":"Add the Choose Region parameter to the Pages card.","C":"Add Region to the Filters card.","A":"Set the Choose Region parameter to Single Value (list).","B":"Add the [Region] = [choose Region] formula to the Filters card."}},{"id":"b9KVoWTibyVrynwa57oA","question_id":77,"discussion":[{"content":"SELECT and WHERE are the correct answers.\nThis should be straightforward for those familiar with SQL","upvote_count":"2","poster":"roryor11","comment_id":"1352766","timestamp":"1738896600.0"},{"timestamp":"1738050900.0","content":"SELECT\nWHERE\nCast is not","poster":"RRR2504","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1347785"},{"comment_id":"1221186","timestamp":"1732912740.0","poster":"MonBouj","content":"Select \nWhere","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Select from *****\nWhere*****","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1011169","timestamp":"1710849360.0","poster":"JUT_TC"}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/tda-c01/image56.png"],"answers_community":[],"answer":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/tableau/view/120958-exam-tda-c01-topic-1-question-43-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database.\nYou need to create a custom SQL query that retrieves rows from a table named Students.
