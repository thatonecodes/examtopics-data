From the context menu of Sales over time, select Filters and then select Enable Auto Update.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe context menu likely refers to the options that appear when you right-click on an element in the dashboard.\nIn the image, you want to filter both \"Sales over time\" and \"Detail table\" by selecting a data point on the map. This suggests you want to see the details for a specific location on the map reflected in both tables.\nEnable Auto Update within the \"Filters\" menu of \"Sales over time\" would automatically update the \"Detail table\" whenever you select a data point on the map in the \"Sales over time\" section. This ensures both tables are aligned with the chosen location filter.","comment_id":"1208406"},{"comment_id":"1202987","poster":"ed03760","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730019780.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"From the context menu of Sales over time select Filters and then select Enable Auto Update","C":"From the context menu of Sales over time select Use as Filter and then deselect Use as Filter","B":"From the context menu of Detail table select Ignore Actions.","A":"From the context menu of Profits by state deselect Use as Filter and then select Use as Filter"},"question_id":107,"timestamp":"2024-04-27 09:03:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/tableau/view/139686-exam-tda-c01-topic-1-question-81-discussion/","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1714201380,"answer":"A","question_text":"You have the following dashboard.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nFrom the context menu of Sales over time, select Ignore Actions.\n\nSeveral days later, you decide that that you want to filter both Sales over time and Detail table by selecting a data point on the map.\n\nWhat should you do?","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":190,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/tda-c01/image111.png"],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"LZCbYPLWTjM313cIsoev","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":108,"timestamp":"2024-07-24 21:30:00","topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"nsathish11625","comment_id":"1254577","timestamp":"1721849400.0","content":"C is the correct answer according to me. this will color the top 10 bars even if data changes in the data source."}],"exam_id":190,"unix_timestamp":1721849400,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","question_text":"You have the following chart.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nYou need the top 10 values to appear in a different color.
