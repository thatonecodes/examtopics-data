Change the data source to an extract: An extract is a copy of the database data stored within the workbook itself. By using an extract, the workbook doesn't need a live connection to the SQL Server database, allowing users to view the data even if they don't have access to the original source.\nE. Embed the credentials when you publish the workbook: When embedding credentials, you provide the username and password for the SQL Server database within the published workbook. This allows Tableau Server to access the database on behalf of the users, enabling them to view the data despite not having individual access.","comment_id":"1221251","poster":"MonBouj"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB. Configure the local file permissions to the workbook file and then publish the workbook: By setting appropriate permissions to the workbook file locally before publishing, you ensure that all users on the Tableau Server site can access it.\n\nD.
