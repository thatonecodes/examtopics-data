IF there is an event where the instance is shut off, then it is restarted only if it is in Managed instance group. If you are not using managed instance group then using Non-preemptible instances makes sense. Even in that case if there is an maintenance event, google provides one hour advance notification before pre-emption. \nhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20a%20warning,hour%20advance%20notice%20before%20preemption.","poster":"getzsagar","comment_id":"332359"},{"comment_id":"325801","timestamp":"1664627040.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ausias18","content":"Answer is D"},{"poster":"lynx256","timestamp":"1663838340.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"317082","content":"I'll go with D.\nThey want stable app.\nWith preemptible VMs stability suffers.\nFrom https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-architect/casestudy-mountkirkgames-rev2\nFrom \"Business requirements\": \"Improve uptimeâ€”downtime is loss of players\"\nFrom \"Executive statement\": \"Our investors want more key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and stability of the game[...]\""},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1663838220.0","content":"I'll go with D.\nThey want stable app.\nFrom https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-architect/casestudy-mountkirkgames-rev2\nFrom \"Business requirements\": \"Improve uptimeâ€”downtime is loss of players\"\nFrom \"Executive statement\": \"Our investors want more key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and stability of the game[...]\"","poster":"lynx256","comment_id":"317079"},{"poster":"sekhrivijay","comment_id":"291086","content":"Game state/session is maintained in transactional database which most likely will be spanner.
