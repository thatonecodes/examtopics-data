App Engine and Cloud Load Balancer are parts of different solutions.\n\nC is correct because:\n-Google Kubernetes Engine is ideal for deploying small services that can be updated and rolled back quickly. It is a best practice to manage services using immutable containers.\n-Cloud Load Balancing supports globally distributed services across multiple regions. It provides a single global IP address that can be used in DNS records. Using URL Maps, the requests can be routed to only the services that Mountkirk wants to expose.\n-Container Registry is a single place for a team to manage Docker images for the services.\n\nD is not correct because you cannot reserve a single frontend IP for cloud functions. When deployed, an HTTP-triggered cloud function creates an endpoint with an automatically assigned IP.","poster":"Navin","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"104737","upvote_count":"1","content":"B is wrong because Network load balancer is regional load balancer .. and the question wants to deploy code to multiple regions","poster":"CoolCat","timestamp":"1591551900.0"}]},{"comment_id":"39992","poster":"sri007","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1579242480.0","content":"Ans is C correrct"},{"content":"C is correct because:\n-Google Kubernetes Engine is ideal for deploying small services that can be updated and rolled back quickly.

Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed service for creating data processing pipelines.B is not correct because a Cloud Load Balancer distributes traffic to Compute Engine instances.
