The cloud service provider\n\nIn a cloud environment, the cloud service provider (CSP) is typically responsible for securing the physical infrastructure of the data centers. This includes:\n\n- The physical servers, networking equipment, and storage devices.\n- Physical security controls, such as access management to data center facilities, environmental controls, and surveillance.\n\nCloud providers invest heavily in securing the underlying physical infrastructure to ensure reliability and safety for all customers using their services."}],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":126,"answer":"C","question_text":"An organization has migrated all workloads to the cloud and is reviewing their cloud security posture.

Hybrid cloud:\nA hybrid cloud is an IT architecture that combines on-premises infrastructure with public and private cloud resources. While this might involve IaaS, hybrid cloud itself is a deployment model, not a service model.\n\nB (Incorrect). Software as a service (SaaS):\nSaaS provides fully managed applications hosted by the cloud provider. The organization does not manage infrastructure or customization but simply uses software applications over the internet.\n\nD (Incorrect). Platform as a service (PaaS):\nPaaS provides a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without dealing with underlying infrastructure. While it involves cloud resources, it's more focused on development and deployment than simply leasing hardware resources."}],"timestamp":"1736020920.0","comment_id":"1336515","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\n\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the model where the cloud provider offers computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking on a pay-as-you-go basis. This enables organizations to lease the hardware and infrastructure resources they need without upfront capital investment.\n\nWith IaaS, the organization can scale resources up or down as needed, allowing them to avoid paying for hardware and only pay for what they use.","poster":"joshnort","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":127,"answer":"C","question_text":"An organization wants to lease the resources they need for their customized servers from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis, instead of paying one time for hardware.\n\nWhich service model should they use?","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-01-04 21:02:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1736020920},{"id":"jGtaQmCxrFav0sXEsObi","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Hybrid cloud environment","A":"Multi cloud environment","D":"Container environment","B":"Virtual machine environment"},"question_id":128,"timestamp":"2024-04-30 06:49:00","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":3,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (67%)","D (33%)"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"An organization has petabytes of data gathered from a wide range of sources.
