This can be a complex process and can introduce additional points of failure. Additionally, using an iptable rule to forward public traffic to the HAProxy pod is not a secure way of exposing the application over HTTPS.

Select the built-in IAM project Viewer role. Add the user's account to this role.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIAM Project Viewer Role: The IAM project Viewer role provides read-only access to all resources within a Google Cloud Platform project. This role allows the user to view project items, including resources and configurations, but does not grant permissions to modify them. This aligns with the requirement of allowing the auditor to read, but not modify, all project items.\n\nBuilt-in Role: The IAM project Viewer role is a built-in role provided by Google Cloud Platform. It is specifically designed for users who need read-only access to project resources.\n\nLeast Privilege: Selecting the IAM project Viewer role ensures that the auditor has the necessary permissions to perform their tasks without granting them unnecessary privileges.

Create a custom role with view-only project permissions. Add the user's account to the custom role.\n\nExplanation:\n- Creating a custom role allows you to define specific permissions tailored to your needs, in this case, view-only access to project items.\n- By selecting the necessary read-only project permissions for the custom role, you can provide the auditor with the appropriate level of access without allowing modifications.\n- Adding the user's account to this custom role will grant them the specified permissions.\n\nOption B refers to \"view-only service permissions,\" which may not provide the desired level of access to all project items.\n\nOptions C and D suggest using built-in roles, but they may have more permissions than needed for a read-only auditor role.
