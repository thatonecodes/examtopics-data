They have 200 meeting rooms defined for the main building and used daily by the 12,000 employees. Users are complaining they have difficulties finding a room available when searching within Google Calendar, even if several rooms are available (no one attending meetings in these rooms at that time).

Set the option \"Allow calendar-based room release\" for all targeted rooms.\n\nThe correct option in this scenario is C. By enabling the \"Allow calendar-based room release\" option for the meeting rooms in Google Calendar, rooms that are reserved but not actually used (all attendees decline) can be automatically released for others to book. This can help optimize the utilization of meeting rooms without the need for additional third-party solutions, scripting, or upgrades.\n\nEnabling this option ensures that rooms are automatically released when they are booked but not attended, improving the availability of meeting rooms for employees. This feature is designed to streamline the process and minimize operational effort.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"rune92"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"virat_kohli","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
