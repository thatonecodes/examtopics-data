Cloud Logging provides a central location for storing, analyzing, and monitoring logs from multiple Google Cloud services, including firewall activity logs. With Cloud Monitoring, you can create custom dashboards and alerts based on the logs' data to monitor and track firewall rules' deny hits.\nIn summary, both options are valid solutions, but option B offers greater flexibility and customization capabilities.","comment_id":"856448","timestamp":"1696032960.0"}],"timestamp":"1696032960.0","comment_id":"856447","upvote_count":"6","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption A is a valid approach, but it may increase operational overhead if you need to handle a large volume of logs or if you need to customize the display of the logs. Firewall Rules Logging captures firewall activity logs in real-time, and you can export these logs to other services like Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Pub/Sub for further analysis.
