If we go with C, lower the number higher the priority (1000) so the rule with this priority 1000 will overwrite (65534), so If we allow only appropriate ports it will be overwritten with the high-priority (1000) rule and all the egress traffic will be blocked.\nRemember the goal here is to block egress but not all of it since we still want to configure the fewest open ports and this is statefull meaning for open ports traffic will be both ways.\nA fits this condition where it is saying we block all traffic but the required ports are kept open with higher priority which will only allow the required traffic to leave the network.","poster":"bobthebuilder55110"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nDefault Egress Behavior: In Google Cloud VPCs, the default behavior is to allow all egress traffic.
