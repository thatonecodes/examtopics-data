Unlike structured data that follows a predefined format or schema, unstructured data does not have a fixed structure or organization. In the case of post comments, users can express their opinions, provide feedback, ask questions, or engage in conversations without any specific format or constraint.\n\nTagging, profile pictures, and location, on the other hand, can be considered as structured or semi-structured data. Tagging refers to the process of labeling or categorizing content, which typically follows a predefined set of tags or labels. Profile pictures are static images associated with user profiles, and while they may contain visual information, they are not typically considered as unstructured data. Location data, although it can have variations, is often structured or semi-structured and can be represented using specific formats such as latitude and longitude coordinates.","upvote_count":"13"},{"comment_id":"1356722","timestamp":"1739596680.0","poster":"ShivGupt","content":"Selected Answer: A\nHere's why:\n\nUnstructured data is information that doesn't fit into a pre-defined data model or format.

Tagging can be structured if user did the tagging in the post. Tagging can be unstructured if user did the tagging in the comments. \n\nProfile pictures or the actual image itself is unstructured data so it can be stored in cloud storage. However, I think the question means that profile pictures are referenced in structured format so it is associated to a user profile (ex. username, email) so it's structured.\n\nLocation can be location of a user or location in the post so it's either associated to user profile or post metadata (ex. likes, shares, timestamp, postID, userID) so it's also structured.\n\nPosting comments are unstructured data.","comment_id":"1243702"},{"content":"A is correct answer because in post comment we can use any thing like text, image and emoji etc which is not structure data","poster":"Cloudhungery","comment_id":"1231794","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718605800.0"},{"comment_id":"1222174","content":"Selected Answer: C\nUnsure between A and C, but since it's not a multiple-choice question I will say C because photos are definitely unstructured data, while written posts can sometimes be semi-structured.
