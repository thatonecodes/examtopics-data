For example, you can change access scopes to grant access to a new API, or change an instance so that it runs as a service account that you created, instead of the Compute Engine default service account. However, Google recommends that you use the fine-grained IAM policies instead of relying on access scopes to control resource access for the service account.\n\nTo change an instance's service account and access scopes, the instance must be temporarily stopped. To stop your instance, read the documentation for Stopping an instance. After changing the service account or access scopes, remember to restart the instance.
