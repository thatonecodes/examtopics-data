GCS storage is significantly cheaper than BigQuery storage. You pay for storage in GCS and minimal egress charges when exporting.\n- Complexity: Simpler. You schedule a daily export job. Restoring involves importing from GCS to BigQuery in another region.\n- Consistency: Easier to manage. The export process creates a consistent snapshot of the data at the time of export. You might have some latency (up to 24 hours in this scenario), but the data within the export is consistent.\n- RPO: Meets the requirement.
