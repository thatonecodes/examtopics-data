By ensuring data is reliable and accessible.\n\nIn Google's cloud security model, availability refers to ensuring that data is consistently accessible when needed. This is a key component of a robust security posture, as it ensures that users and systems can access critical data without interruptions, maintaining business continuity. High availability ensures that services and data are resilient to failures, minimizing the risk of downtime and ensuring reliability."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer D","timestamp":"1726739700.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Moin23","comment_id":"1286266"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":162,"choices":{"A":"By restricting data access to authorized users","C":"By checking that data is accurate and trustworthy","B":"By ensuring data meets industry standards","D":"By ensuring data is reliable and accessible"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"In Google’s cloud security model, how does availability contribute to a robust security posture for data?"},{"id":"2wFX62Ssd54itma61NqJ","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1737062400,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","choices":{"A":"Data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country where it resides.","B":"A country has the right to access the data generated within its borders.","C":"An individual has the right to control their personal data.","D":"Data must always be encrypted in transit and at rest."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/154750-exam-cloud-digital-leader-topic-1-question-245-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"How does the legal concept of data sovereignty affect data?","timestamp":"2025-01-16 22:20:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country where it resides.\n\nData sovereignty refers to the legal principle that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country where it is physically stored or processed. This means that if data is stored in a specific country, it must comply with that country's legal framework, including regulations related to privacy, security, and data protection.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1341880","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1341881","poster":"joshnort","timestamp":"1737062460.0","content":"D.

A country has the right to access the data generated within its borders: While it is true that governments may have the authority to access data within their borders, this is not the central focus of data sovereignty. Data sovereignty primarily addresses the jurisdictional authority over data rather than the right to access it. It concerns how laws apply to data based on its physical location, not necessarily governmental access.\n\nC. An individual has the right to control their personal data: This refers more to data privacy and individual rights (such as in the GDPR). While data sovereignty may touch on individual rights, the core concept is about the sovereignty of the nation over data stored within its territory, not individual control over personal data.","poster":"joshnort","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1737062460.0"}],"poster":"joshnort","comment_id":"1341878","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737062400.0"}],"answer_images":[],"question_id":163,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"exam_id":3,"topic":"1"},{"id":"cw43q35y5dleY4CWX3DC","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-01-16 22:43:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"An organization is concerned about their cloud costs.

Configure a budget threshold rule and alert.\n\nIn order to be informed when their spending exceeds a specific threshold, the organization can set up a budget threshold rule and alert in their cloud provider's cost management tools. This allows them to receive notifications when their spending approaches or surpasses a defined budget, giving them the opportunity to take action before the end of the billing period.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1341887","poster":"joshnort","timestamp":"1737063840.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"D. Use historical cost data to predict future overspend: While analyzing historical data is useful for forecasting trends and understanding past spending patterns, this option is not a proactive solution to immediately monitor and receive alerts for current overspend.

Pause virtual machines during non-business hours: While pausing virtual machines (VMs) during non-business hours can help reduce cloud costs, this is a more reactive approach rather than a proactive one. It doesn't address the need for real-time alerts when spending exceeds a threshold, and it's not a sustainable solution for organizations that need continuous monitoring and cost control.\n\nC. Adjust project resource quota policies: Adjusting quotas can limit the amount of resources a project can use, but it doesn't provide real-time alerts about spending. Quota policies are more about controlling resource consumption, not specifically about monitoring and alerting on costs.
