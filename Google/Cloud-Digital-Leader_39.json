Cyber resilience:\nThis refers to an organization's ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyberattacks. It is broader and does not specifically address user permissions.\n\nB. Zero-trust:\nZero-trust is a security model that assumes no user or device is trusted by default, even if inside the network. While it may include least privilege, it is a broader security philosophy.\n\nD. Security by default:\nThis means designing systems to be secure out of the box (e.g., secure default configurations). It does not specifically address permissions.\n\nConclusion:\nThe principle of least privilege is the security concept that describes granting users only the permissions required to perform their job responsibilities.","comment_id":"1344349"}],"comment_id":"1344348","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Least privilege\n\nThe principle of least privilege ensures that users, systems, and processes are granted only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job responsibilities or tasks.\nThis approach reduces the risk of accidental or malicious misuse of permissions and helps maintain security.","timestamp":"1737491280.0","poster":"joshnort"}]},{"id":"Ew5HgHnYeUU3Tr2ggEFG","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","question_id":192,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1737493440,"question_text":"An organization is concerned about the risk of data loss that may occur due to hardware failures or cyber attacks.

Back up data regularly.\n\nExplanation:\nRegular data backups ensure that an organization can restore its systems and recover critical information in the event of hardware failures, cyberattacks, or other disasters. Backups can be stored in separate, secure locations to further mitigate the risk of data loss.","timestamp":"1737493440.0","poster":"joshnort","comments":[{"poster":"joshnort","comment_id":"1344371","timestamp":"1737493500.0","content":"Why not the other options?\nA. Set service level objectives (SLOs):\nSLOs define performance and availability targets (e.g., uptime or response times). They help measure and ensure reliability but do not directly address data loss prevention or recovery.\n\nB. Use Cloud Monitoring:\nCloud Monitoring helps track system performance, usage, and incidents. While it can alert on potential issues, it does not provide a mechanism to restore systems or recover data.\n\nD. Enable autoscaling:\nAutoscaling ensures that applications can handle changes in workload by automatically adjusting resources. It does not address data recovery or protection against data loss.","upvote_count":"1"}]}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"v4RgDXtqJBfBFT8oOmeA","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1737493560,"exam_id":3,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/155126-exam-cloud-digital-leader-topic-1-question-272-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"A":"Change from a relational database to a NoSQL database.","C":"Switch from batch processing to stream processing.","D":"Process batch reports weekly instead of monthly.","B":"Filter the data so reports are generated faster."},"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"An organization processes batch sales data at the end of every month to analyze sales trends and derive business insights.

Change from a relational database to a NoSQL database:\nWhile NoSQL databases are suited for specific use cases (e.g., unstructured data, scalability), this change alone does not address the need for real-time decision-making.\n\nB. Filter the data so reports are generated faster:\nFiltering the data may speed up reporting but does not fundamentally address the organization's need for near real-time analysis.\n\nD. Process batch reports weekly instead of monthly:\nReducing the batch interval may improve timeliness slightly, but it still doesn't achieve near real-time decision-making.\n\nConclusion:\nTo achieve near real-time decision-making and improve accuracy, the organization should switch from batch processing to stream processing, allowing them to analyze and act on data as it is generated."}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Switch from batch processing to stream processing.\n\nStream processing processes data in real-time or near real-time as it arrives, enabling the organization to make timely decisions and improve accuracy by acting on the latest data.\nThis is a significant improvement over batch processing, which processes data at scheduled intervals (e.g., monthly or weekly) and may result in outdated insights.","poster":"joshnort"}],"timestamp":"2025-01-21 22:06:00"},{"id":"kYI7CmR1sYGSZElewM0v","unix_timestamp":1723238880,"answer_description":"","question_id":194,"choices":{"C":"Network Intelligence Center","D":"Cloud Monitoring","A":"Compliance Reports Manager","B":"Security Command Center"},"answer_images":[],"exam_id":3,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1737494580.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"joshnort","comment_id":"1344382","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"joshnort","timestamp":"1737494580.0","comment_id":"1344383","content":"Why not the other options?\nB.
