Since the device doesn't support BGP (which is commonly used in route-based VPNs for dynamic routing), you cannot use route-based VPN that typically relies on dynamic routing protocols like BGP. \nInstead, Policy-based VPN is a better fit here, as it uses static traffic selectors to determine which traffic should be routed through the VPN tunnel.\n\nWith Policy-based VPN, you can configure specific IP ranges (local and remote traffic selectors) to control the traffic flow. Additionally, you would set up static routes to ensure the traffic between your on-premises network and Google Cloud is correctly routed. This solution works well for non-BGP-capable devices, providing a straightforward method to connect to Google Cloud without the need for dynamic routing.","poster":"saraali","timestamp":"1739135880.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1354132"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI'll go with D\n\"operational overhead when your network grows\"","poster":"waelghaith","timestamp":"1736592180.0","comment_id":"1339121"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe choice is between B & D. while D maybe ideal for growth purposes, we're talking about Google-recommended practices and setting 0.0.0.0/0 traffic selectors may have some unintended traffic flows","timestamp":"1735362480.0","comment_id":"1332792","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ian_gcpca"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD - Because you can't update the traffic selectors after creating the VPN tunnel.
