Containerize the application, and deploy it as a Cloud Run service.\n\nCloud Run is a fully managed service that allows you to run containerized applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. This aligns with your goal of minimizing infrastructure management effort and provides scalability for your application.\nD. Configure Identity Aware Proxy, and grant the roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor IAM role to the users that need to access the application.\n\nIdentity Aware Proxy (IAP) secures access to your application by authenticating users using their Google Workspace credentials. By granting the roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor IAM role to the internal users, you ensure that only authenticated users can access the application. This method leverages existing Google Workspace accounts, simplifying user management.","timestamp":"1728704580.0"}],"answer_ET":"BD","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1728704580,"question_text":"You are developing a scalable web application for internal users.
