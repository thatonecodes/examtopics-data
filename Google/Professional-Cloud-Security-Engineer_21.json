Storing both the encrypted data and the KEK allows for the data to be decrypted using the KEK when needed. It's important to generate the DEK locally to ensure the security of the key, and to generate a new KEK in Cloud KMS for added security and key management capabilities.","comment_id":"870707","poster":"aashissh"},{"poster":"GCP72","comment_id":"652514","timestamp":"1677495600.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1657834560.0","poster":"minostrozaml2","upvote_count":"1","content":"Took the tesk today, only 5 question from this dump, the rest are new questions.","comment_id":"523828"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"501368","poster":"Bill831231","timestamp":"1655204580.0","content":"A sounds like the correct answer:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption#how_to_encrypt_data_using_envelope_encryption"},{"comment_id":"400538","content":"Answer A\nEnvelope Encryption: https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption\nHere are best practices for managing DEKs:\n-Generate DEKs locally.\n-When stored, always ensure DEKs are encrypted at rest.\n- For easy access, store the DEK near the data that it encrypts.\nThe DEK is encrypted (also known as wrapped) by a key encryption key (KEK). The process of encrypting a key with another key is known as envelope encryption.\nHere are best practices for managing KEKs:\n-Store KEKs centrally. (KMS )\n-Set the granularity of the DEKs they encrypt based on their use case. For example, consider a workload that requires multiple DEKs to encrypt the workload's data chunks. You could use a single KEK to wrap all DEKs that are responsible for that workload's encryption.\n-Rotate keys regularly, and also after a suspected incident.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1641543240.0","poster":"umashankar_a"},{"timestamp":"1634504460.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"I'm no sure what the answers is, but the answers to this question has changed.... be prepared","comment_id":"337809","poster":"desertlotus1211"},{"timestamp":"1632213660.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is A","comment_id":"316255","poster":"dtmtor"},{"poster":"DebasishLowes","timestamp":"1631722560.0","comment_id":"311643","upvote_count":"1","content":"Ans : A"},{"comment_id":"294566","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correction I change it to A after reading the question once again.","timestamp":"1629393840.0","poster":"CloudTrip"},{"poster":"CloudTrip","timestamp":"1629018480.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"290892","content":"Answer is B as after DEK encryption it's KEK (not encrypted DEK) which never leaves KMS"},{"timestamp":"1622843880.0","content":"A - Envelope Encryption ( DEK - to encrypt the data, KEK - encrypt the DEK , KEK resides in KMS and only the encrypted data and wrapped DEK will be stored back )","poster":"Bharathy","comment_id":"235309","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1619670120.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"208297","content":"Ans - A\nhttps://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption#how_to_encrypt_data_using_envelope_encryption"},{"timestamp":"1616671680.0","poster":"CHECK666","content":"The answer is A","comment_id":"186864","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"aiwaai","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"161189","content":"The Answer is A","timestamp":"1613706600.0"},{"comment_id":"148782","timestamp":"1612226820.0","content":"C is the correct option.
