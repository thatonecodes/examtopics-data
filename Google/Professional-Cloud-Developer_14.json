The service account key has been rotated but not updated on the application server.\n\nWhen a user-managed service account key is rotated in Google Cloud, the new key must also be updated on the application server that authenticates to the Cloud Storage API using that key. Failure to update the key on the application server will result in requests to the API failing with a 403 Permission Denied error code.\n\nOption B \"The permissions of the service account’s predefined role have changed\" would also result in 403 error, but it would be a role issue, not a key issue.","poster":"omermahgoub","comment_id":"772706","timestamp":"1673452980.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer B\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/troubleshooting#access-permission\nhttps://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/legacy/standard/python/googlecloudstorageclient/errors\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/reference-status#403%E2%80%94forbidden","poster":"TNT87","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"772707","timestamp":"1673453040.0","content":"The links you've provided are helpful resources for troubleshooting 403 \"Permission Denied\" errors when working with Cloud Storage.\n\nYou're correct, the 403 \"Permission Denied\" error can be caused by various reasons, such as an issue with the folder structure inside the bucket or an issue with the predefined role permissions, but based on the context and the error message it seems that the most likely cause is the service account key being rotated and not updated on the application server as I mentioned earlier.\n\nAdditionally, the links you provided provide more information about the possible causes for 403 error, such as the permissions that are associated with the object and the bucket, user authentication and role-based access control.
