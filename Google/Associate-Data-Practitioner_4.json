Create external tables over the files in Cloud Storage and perform SQL joins. External tables allow you to query data directly in Cloud Storage with SQL, avoiding the time and cost of loading a petabyte of data into BigQuery. This is ideal for a fast, one-time analysis. Options A (Dataproc/Spark) and B (Cloud Data Fusion) are more complex and slower for a quick analysis. Option D (bq load) is inefficient and slow as it requires loading a petabyte of data into BigQuery, which is unnecessary for a one-time analysis of external files. Therefore, Option C provides the most direct, efficient, and SQL-centric approach for this scenario.","comment_id":"1362638","poster":"n2183712847","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/157229-exam-associate-data-practitioner-topic-1-question-24/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"Your organization has a petabyte of application logs stored as Parquet files in Cloud Storage.

Use Cloud Composer with DAGs and appropriate operators. Cloud Composer, being a fully managed Apache Airflow service, is specifically designed for orchestrating complex workflows with dependencies and offers built-in operators to connect to Cloud Storage, Spark (via Dataproc), and BigQuery. Option D (Airflow on GKE) is not fully managed and adds operational overhead.

Configure a lifecycle management policy on each bucket. Lifecycle Management is designed to automate data tiering (moving data to cheaper classes as it ages) and data retention (deleting objects based on age or other rules), directly addressing the requirements for cost optimization and rule-based data management. Option D (Autoclass) helps with tiering based on access but doesn't handle retention rules. Option A (Archive storage) is too simplistic and inflexible, not addressing tiering or retention rules properly. Option C (Standard + Versioning) increases costs and is counter to the goal of optimization.
