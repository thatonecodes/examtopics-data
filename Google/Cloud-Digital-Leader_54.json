Since the rendering of individual scenes takes less than 12 hours and can be interrupted and restarted, you can leverage preemptible VMs to perform the rendering tasks. Preemptible VMs are available at a significantly lower cost compared to regular instances but can be preempted by GCP with a 30-second notice. By designing your rendering workflow to handle interruptions gracefully, such as checkpointing and resuming, you can take advantage of the cost savings provided by preemptible VMs.","poster":"cookieMr","timestamp":"1686397080.0","upvote_count":"15","comment_id":"919990"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nPreemptible VMs are cost-effective instances that can be used for short-lived and non-critical workloads","comment_id":"1335819","poster":"Waffle0906","timestamp":"1735863780.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Swollenbadger","comment_id":"1270973","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI had no idea what to say, but chose A because \"there is no service level agreement\" and because preemptible instances are both cost-effective and would likely lend themselves well to a situation where support is limited.","timestamp":"1724367780.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is A","comment_id":"1110377","timestamp":"1704009600.0","poster":"Surek"},{"timestamp":"1703605380.0","poster":"Lakshvenkat","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer","comment_id":"1106146"},{"content":"A is correct","comment_id":"1096629","poster":"GCPHERO1234","timestamp":"1702570380.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1062588","poster":"chai_gpt","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1699157040.0"},{"timestamp":"1695611220.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","poster":"mdsarfraz69","comment_id":"1016318","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"zambonini","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCan be interrupted at any time to restart later.","timestamp":"1685383500.0","comment_id":"909622"},{"poster":"Rafa_M","timestamp":"1682493960.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"881241","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer A:\n\"Preemptible VM instances are available at much lower price—a 60-91% discount—compared to the price of standard VMs. However, Compute Engine might stop (preempt) these instances if it needs to reclaim the compute capacity for allocation to other VMs\""},{"poster":"Sp4nner","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncan be interrupted = preemptible","comment_id":"872947","timestamp":"1681754760.0"},{"timestamp":"1679418660.0","comment_id":"846182","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA - Instances with deep savings but at the cost of being interrupted","poster":"MHx1","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"845766","upvote_count":"1","content":"A.
