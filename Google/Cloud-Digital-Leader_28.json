Decentralized because different departments or teams within an organization often have the autonomy to procure and manage their own cloud resources based on their specific needs. Variable because cloud costs are typically based on usage (pay-as-you-go pricing models), which means spending fluctuates based on how much compute, storage, and network resources are consumed over time.","timestamp":"1714453260.0","poster":"Vivek007"},{"comment_id":"1340609","upvote_count":"1","poster":"joshnort","comments":[{"content":"The other options are less common:\n\nB.

Decentralized and variable.\n\nDecentralized: In many organizations, different departments or teams are responsible for their own cloud spending, and they may manage their cloud resources independently. This often results in a decentralized approach to cloud costs.\n\nVariable: Cloud spending tends to vary depending on the needs of the business.

Reduced development costs: Serverless computing can reduce operational and infrastructure management costs, but the main benefit for addressing unpredictable demand is scalability, not development cost reduction.\n\nD. Built-in security: Serverless platforms may offer security features, but security is not directly related to the concern of paying for idle resources.

Scalability\n\nServerless computing offers automatic scaling, which means that resources are allocated dynamically based on the actual demand. When the application is launched, it will automatically scale up to handle increased traffic, and when demand drops, the system will scale down, reducing or eliminating the cost of idle resources. This flexibility ensures that the organization only pays for the resources they use, without having to provision and manage infrastructure for idle periods.","timestamp":"1736908620.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1340623"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Scalability is correct","timestamp":"1730593020.0","comment_id":"1205847","poster":"jjkjkkkk"}],"answer":"C","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1714688220,"topic":"1","question_id":137,"question_text":"An organization is developing a new container-based application.

Policies can be applied at the folder level and are inherited by projects inside the folder.\n\nHere's an explanation:\n\nIn Google Cloud, the resource hierarchy is structured as follows: Organization → Folders → Projects → Resources. This hierarchical structure enables organizations to implement security policies at various levels, and those policies are inherited by resources lower in the hierarchy.\n\n Policies (such as Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, organization policies, etc.) can be applied at the organization level, folder level, or project level.

A key aspect of this hierarchy is the inheritance of policies. When a policy is applied at the folder level, all projects and resources within that folder automatically inherit the policy. This feature simplifies security management by allowing organizations to apply broad policies at higher levels (like folders) and have them cascade down to all contained resources and projects.

Cost management will stay the same, but the total cost of ownership (TCO) will be lower: While TCO can be lower due to the efficiency of cloud resources, cost management typically changes because the nature of the costs shifts from CapEx to OpEx. Cloud services often introduce new cost management practices.\n\nD. Cost management will stay the same, but the total cost of ownership (TCO) will be higher: This is also unlikely.

Costs will primarily shift from CapEx to OpEx.\n\nHere’s an explanation:\n\nCapEx (Capital Expenditures) refers to upfront investments in physical infrastructure like servers, storage, and data centers.
