We don't know the actually design...but we know VOIP is best effort and is UDP....\n\nInternal TCP/UDP Load Balancing distributes traffic among internal virtual machine (VM) instances IN the same region in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. It enables you to run and scale your services behind an INTERNAL IP address that is accessible ONLY to systems in the same VPC network or systems connected to your VPC network....\n\nWith that said - a Cloud Router is needed to connect from the Internet to hit the ILB...BUT a Global LB is need to distribute the traffic correctly so a NetworkLB is required. The design should be a Hub-n-Spoke or a Shared VPC with a Service VPC to hold the Cloud router and Network LB....\n\nI will go with Answer b for now as in said INTERNET FACING VOIP Application.\n\nThoughts?","comment_id":"511516","comments":[{"timestamp":"1656437520.0","content":"https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal\n\nCheck out the 3 tier diagram","comment_id":"511518","poster":"desertlotus1211","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1656334320.0","comment_id":"510393","poster":"Tejtej","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/choosing-load-balancer\n\nExternal facing is internet facing .
