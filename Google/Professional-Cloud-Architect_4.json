This can happen with minimal downtime to the existing database.\nWhen you have a replica database, the two databases have different roles that are referred to in this document as primary and replica.\nAfter the data is synchronized, you promote the replica to be the primary in order to move the management layer with minimal impact to database uptime.\nIn Cloud SQL, an easy way to accomplish the external replica promotion is to use the automated migration workflow.

The MIG applies an opportunistic update only when you manually initiate the update on selected instances or when new instances are created. New instances can be created when you or another service, such as an autoscaler, resizes the MIG. Compute Engine does not actively initiate requests to apply opportunistic updates on existing instances.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"AnilKr","comment_id":"425686"},{"timestamp":"1628918580.0","poster":"Sandipcst","content":"Should be D","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"424632"},{"comment_id":"410846","upvote_count":"3","poster":"AshwathD","content":"the answer is D","timestamp":"1626867360.0"},{"comments":[{"content":"Hello Sir, May I know what does it mean? for the questions with dispute, you always commented on new Qs in Questions xxx, what does it mean and where I can find the correct information to secure the test? thanks","poster":"Jamson","comment_id":"478515","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1636962600.0"}],"comment_id":"409209","poster":"kopper2019","content":"hey guys new Qs posted as of July 12th, 2021, All 21 new Qs in Question #152","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1626651000.0"},{"comment_id":"408709","timestamp":"1626583500.0","poster":"Papafel","content":"The answer is D. In certain scenarios, an opportunistic update is useful because you don't want to cause instability to the system if it can be avoided. For example, if you have a non-critical update that can be applied as necessary without any urgency and you have a MIG that is actively being autoscaled, perform an opportunistic update so that Compute Engine does not actively tear down your existing instances to apply the update. When resizing down, the autoscaler preferentially terminates instances with the old template as well as instances that are not yet in a RUNNING state.","upvote_count":"5"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"D is ok","comment_id":"399776","timestamp":"1625561220.0","poster":"JeffClarke111"},{"content":"D is correct as per Google documentation.","timestamp":"1625375040.0","poster":"siddharthmehta72","comment_id":"398016","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1625290140.0","comment_id":"397334","content":"IMO answer D is correct.
