For example, if you have two applications, \"app1\" and \"app2\", each with a development and production environment, you would have four projects: app1-dev, app1-prod, app2-dev, app2-prod. This isolates the environments from each other, so changes to the development project do not accidentally impact production, and gives you better access control, since you can (for example) grant all developers access to development projects but restrict production access to your CI/CD pipeline. https://cloud.google.com/docs/enterprise/best-practices-for-enterprise-organizations","timestamp":"1692845100.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"338555","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Jane111","timestamp":"1666144680.0","content":"A - no VPC required\nB - yes - pre req\nC - Yes\nD - likely but C is first\nE - not scalable/feasible/advisable"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"DebasishLowes","content":"Ans : BC","comment_id":"311688","timestamp":"1663261500.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"208666","content":"Ans - BC","timestamp":"1651238160.0"},{"timestamp":"1648546500.0","content":"B,C is the answer.\nCreate a folder for each env and assign IAM policies to the group.","poster":"CHECK666","comment_id":"189570","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"MohitA","upvote_count":"1","content":"BC is the right answer, create folder for each env and assign IAM policies to group","comment_id":"165007","timestamp":"1645699560.0"},{"timestamp":"1645260780.0","content":"Correct Answer: CE","poster":"aiwaai","comment_id":"161292","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"167148","poster":"aiwaai","timestamp":"1645922280.0","content":"made correction CE -> BC","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"timestamp":"1633320600.0","content":"B&C\n\nD does not help efficiently manage IAM.
