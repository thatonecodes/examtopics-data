By setting the priority to 65500, this rule becomes one of the last rules to be evaluated, effectively serving as a catch-all rule after other rules have been checked.\n\nDeny All Traffic: This rule denies all traffic, including HTTP traffic, RDP traffic, and any other traffic.

This approach allows for the inspection of traffic between different projects, on-premises locations, and the internet using the same third-party appliances. It also allows for the export of custom routes from the hub VPC and their import on all projects’ VPC networks using VPC Network Peering. This solution provides a centralized management approach while ensuring the required level of security and isolation.","poster":"Ben756","timestamp":"1694799060.0"},{"timestamp":"1689342180.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"775631","content":"• D.
