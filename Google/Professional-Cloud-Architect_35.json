Use firewall rules based on network tags attached to the compute instances\n\nTo restrict communications between VM instances within a VPC without relying on static IP addresses or subnets, you can use firewall rules based on network tags attached to the compute instances. This will allow you to specify which instances are allowed to communicate with each other and on which paths and ports. You can then attach the relevant network tags to the compute instances when they are created, allowing you to control communication between the instances without relying on static IP addresses or subnets.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1719030540.0","content":"Option A, using separate VPCs to restrict traffic, would not be a suitable solution because it would not allow the instances to communicate with each other, which is likely necessary for the functioning of the web application.\n\nOption C, using Cloud DNS and only allowing connections from authorized hostnames, would not be a suitable solution because it would not allow you to control communication between the instances based on their IP addresses or other characteristics.\n\nOption D, using service accounts and configuring the web application to authorize particular service accounts to have access, would not be a suitable solution because it would not allow you to control communication between the instances based on their IP addresses or other characteristics.","comment_id":"753017","upvote_count":"5","poster":"omermahgoub"}],"poster":"omermahgoub","comment_id":"753016","upvote_count":"13","timestamp":"1719030540.0"},{"poster":"SureshbabuK","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1716851940.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAccess to specific ports and protocol can be controlled only by firewall rule - Hence B is correct.
