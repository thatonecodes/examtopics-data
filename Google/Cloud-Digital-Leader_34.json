BigQuery ML: BigQuery ML allows users to build machine learning models directly within BigQuery, typically for structured data like tabular data. It is not well-suited for image processing, which is the need here (analyzing photos for PII). This option is more appropriate for data analytics or predictions based on structured data rather than image-based PII detection."}],"comment_id":"1341907","timestamp":"1737070620.0","poster":"joshnort","content":"Why the other options are incorrect:\nB. AutoML: While AutoML allows developers to build custom models with machine learning, it requires more effort than pre-trained APIs. It involves training a model on custom data, which might be beneficial if the organization needs a model tailored to their specific use case. However, it’s not as quick or straightforward as using a pre-trained API, which is what the organization needs for fast integration.\n\nC. Custom training: Custom training refers to the process of creating entirely custom machine learning models from scratch. This option requires a deep understanding of machine learning and more time to prepare and train the model. Given the organization's need for a fast solution, this approach would be overkill and not as efficient as using pre-trained APIs.","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1341906","upvote_count":"1","poster":"joshnort","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Pre-trained APIs.\n\nPre-trained APIs are ready-to-use models provided by Google Cloud, such as the Cloud Vision API, which can detect a wide range of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (PII) like passports, credit cards, and other sensitive data in images. These APIs are quick to integrate into applications, as they don't require additional training, allowing the developer to focus on the application rather than building or fine-tuning models.","timestamp":"1737070560.0"},{"comment_id":"1321347","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCloud Vision API","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Ekramy_Elnaggar","timestamp":"1733225460.0"},{"comment_id":"1286264","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer A","poster":"Moin23","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726739520.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-09-19 11:52:00","choices":{"B":"AutoML","C":"Custom training","A":"Pre-trained APIs","D":"BigQuery ML"},"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/147833-exam-cloud-digital-leader-topic-1-question-248-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":166,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":3},{"id":"hwyw7BxbnWkSpZMaWgpn","discussion":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1341917","poster":"joshnort","comments":[{"content":"D.

Processing data records continuously.\n\nStreaming analytics refers to the real-time or continuous processing of data as it is ingested. The defining characteristic of streaming analytics is its ability to process data in real time, allowing organizations to gain insights or take actions immediately as data flows in from various sources.

Processing data records in batches: Batch processing involves processing data in large, discrete chunks or batches over a specific time period. This is the opposite of streaming analytics, which focuses on real-time processing. Batch processing is typically used for workloads where real-time processing isn't necessary and is more efficient for large-scale data processing at scheduled intervals.\n\nC. Processing a one-off data backfill: A one-off data backfill refers to a situation where historical data is processed to fill in missing information or to reprocess data after an issue has been detected. This is not a characteristic of streaming analytics, which is concerned with continuously processing data as it comes in, rather than handling historical or backlog data.","comment_id":"1341924","timestamp":"1737072840.0"}],"poster":"joshnort"}],"choices":{"C":"Processing a one-off data backfill","D":"Accessing data with high latency","A":"Processing data records continuously","B":"Processing data records in batches"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/154755-exam-cloud-digital-leader-topic-1-question-250-discussion/","question_id":169,"question_images":[],"exam_id":3,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"What is a defining function of streaming analytics?","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1737072720,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"xkZ2R8URuvNKsYzrShNQ","choices":{"B":"The policy will be inherited by the projects and their resources within the folder.","C":"The policy will be applied to all folders within the organization.","A":"The policy will be inherited by the projects in the folder but will not affect their resources.","D":"The policy applies to the folder only, and will not be inherited by any projects."},"isMC":true,"answer":"B","question_text":"An organization is deciding on the layout of their resource hierarchy in Google Cloud.

The policy will be inherited by the projects and their resources within the folder.\n\nWhen user access policies (IAM policies) are applied at the folder level in Google Cloud, these policies are inherited by all projects within that folder and also apply to the resources within those projects. This inheritance ensures that the access controls set at the folder level are enforced consistently across all the projects and their resources, providing centralized management of permissions.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1341942","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737079560.0","content":"Why the other options are incorrect:\nA.
