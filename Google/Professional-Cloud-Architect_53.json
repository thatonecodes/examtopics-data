Configure Workload Identity and service accounts to be used by the application platform.\n\nWorkload Identity is a feature of Google Cloud that allows you to map identities from your on-premises or Google Cloud identity provider to Google Cloud service accounts. By using Workload Identity, you can secure the connectivity of your application platform to Google Cloud by using the service accounts to authenticate and authorize access to Google Cloud resources.\n\nService accounts are Google Cloud resources that represent non-human users that your application platform can use to authenticate and authorize access to Google Cloud resources. By using service accounts, you can secure the connectivity of your application platform to Google Cloud by controlling which resources the service accounts can access and what actions they can perform.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"omermahgoub","timestamp":"1672237500.0","comments":[{"content":"To configure Workload Identity and service accounts, you will need to create a service account and bind it to the identity of your workload.

GKE (with or without Anthos) + Cloud Load balancing vs App Engine.\n\n\n\nFor the first point, there is no doubt that BigQuery is the preferred choice for analytics.

App Engine is a regional service whereas, with the other option, you can have multiple GKE clusters in different regions.
