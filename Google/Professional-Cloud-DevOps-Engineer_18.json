Create a development environment for writing code and a test environment for configurations, experiments, and load testing.\n\nCreating separate environments for development, testing and production is a best practice for software development. This will enable the company to have control over the changes that are made in each environment and reduce the risk of bugs, outages and slowness in production.\n\nA development environment would be used by developers to write code, test new features and do initial debugging. This environment should be isolated from production so that bugs or issues that occur during development don't affect the production systems or users.\n\nA test environment should be created to perform configurations, experiments, and load testing.
