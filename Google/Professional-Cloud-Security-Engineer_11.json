You can use the location property of a resource to identify where it is deployed and maintained by the service. For data-containing resources of some Google Cloud services, this property also reflects the location where data is stored . This constraint allows you to define the allowed Google Cloud locations where the resources for supported services in your hierarchy can be created .
