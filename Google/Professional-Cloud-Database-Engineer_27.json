Within a regional instance, the configuration is made up of a primary instance and a standby instance. Through synchronous replication to each zone's persistent disk, all writes made to the primary instance are replicated to disks in both zones before a transaction is reported as committed. In the event of an instance or zone failure, the standby instance becomes the new primary instance. Users are then rerouted to the new primary instance. This process is called a failover.","timestamp":"1687638000.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"755198"}]},{"id":"uD7C11NHmf4tQdGpmugE","discussion":[{"comment_id":"757315","timestamp":"1672047420.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn HA configuration standby instance can't be in another region","poster":"chelbsik","upvote_count":"7"},{"timestamp":"1692186660.0","comment_id":"982505","upvote_count":"1","poster":"pico","comments":[{"comment_id":"1313088","poster":"Zek","timestamp":"1731768240.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Your explanation support B as the answer.

A Cloud SQL instance configured for HA is also called a regional instance and has a primary and secondary zone within the configured region.\n\nWhen we say: regional Cloud SQL that already means that the instance has the configuration made up of a primary instance and a standby instance.\n\nIf we want to have the maximum availability If a replica is a cross-region replica, you can perform a failover to another region; specifically, you can promote a replica to a standalone instance"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"B.\nA is not HA. B would be HA. C doesn’t make sense and neither does D. Cloud SQL is a regional service which means the failover replica is in the same region as the primary - hopefully in a different zone.
