Put all commits inside a single repo would place lots of burden on branching and commit history. This not only makes checkout slower but also hard to manage - think about a small-mid size team (10 developers) creating 200 commits per day, roughly equals to 156,000 for 3 months. The maintainers of a repo would have a hard time to chase down and merge 156,000 commits. Not to mention the repo permission management would be a nightmare if the repo extends to enterprise level (200 - 500 developers / SRE / qa / SA) .Forking repo as opt B would be a better choice.
