This allows you to quickly test and validate changes to the template before committing them to the project. During the preview, you can observe the state of interdependent resources and ensure that their dependencies are properly met. This provides rapid feedback on your changes, without actually creating any resources or incurring any costs.","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","timestamp":"1708312500.0","comment_id":"813685","upvote_count":"14"},{"content":"D is right based on this part of doc: https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/deployments/updating-deployments#optional_preview_an_updated_configuration","upvote_count":"3","poster":"tmpcs","comment_id":"1086682","timestamp":"1733213580.0"},{"content":"The correct answer is D.","poster":"BAofBK","timestamp":"1730844780.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1063334"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct option is D\n\nThe `--preview` option will preview the changes that will be made to the deployment without actually making them. This allows you to see how the changes will affect the deployment and to identify any potential problems.\n\nThe other options are not as good:\n\n* Option A is not as good, because it requires you to add logging statements to your Deployment Manager template. This can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n* Option B is not as good, because it requires you to monitor the Stackdriver Logging page of the GCP Console. This can be difficult to do, especially for complex deployments.\n* Option C is not as good, because it requires you to create a separate project with the same configuration.
