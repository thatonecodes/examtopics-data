Health Checks are Essential: Load balancers rely on health checks to determine if instances in the backend pool are healthy and able to serve traffic. If the health checks fail, the load balancer assumes the instance is unhealthy and terminates it, leading to the constant cycling you're observing.\n2. Firewall Rules for Health Checks: Even though your instances don't have public IPs, the load balancer needs to communicate with them through internal IPs for health checks. Firewall rules must be configured to allow this communication.\n3. How Health Checks Work: The load balancer sends requests (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, TCP) to the instances on a specific port and expects a certain response.
