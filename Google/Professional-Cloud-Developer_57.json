It is used for event planning and organizing sporting events, and for businesses to connect with their local communities. HipLocal launched recently in a few neighborhoods in Dallas and is rapidly growing into a global phenomenon. Its unique style of hyper-local community communication and business outreach is in demand around the world.\n\nExecutive Statement -\nWe are the number one local community app; it's time to take our local community services global. Our venture capital investors want to see rapid growth and the same great experience for new local and virtual communities that come online, whether their members are 10 or 10000 miles away from each other.\n\nSolution Concept -\nHipLocal wants to expand their existing service, with updated functionality, in new regions to better serve their global customers. They want to hire and train a new team to support these regions in their time zones. They will need to ensure that the application scales smoothly and provides clear uptime data.\n\nExisting Technical Environment -\nHipLocal's environment is a mix of on-premises hardware and infrastructure running in Google Cloud Platform. The HipLocal team understands their application well, but has limited experience in global scale applications. Their existing technical environment is as follows:\n* Existing APIs run on Compute Engine virtual machine instances hosted in GCP.\n* State is stored in a single instance MySQL database in GCP.\n* Data is exported to an on-premises Teradata/Vertica data warehouse.\n* Data analytics is performed in an on-premises Hadoop environment.\n* The application has no logging.\n* There are basic indicators of uptime; alerts are frequently fired when the APIs are unresponsive.\n\nBusiness Requirements -\nHipLocal's investors want to expand their footprint and support the increase in demand they are seeing. Their requirements are:\n* Expand availability of the application to new regions.\n* Increase the number of concurrent users that can be supported.\n* Ensure a consistent experience for users when they travel to different regions.\n* Obtain user activity metrics to better understand how to monetize their product.\n* Ensure compliance with regulations in the new regions (for example, GDPR).\n* Reduce infrastructure management time and cost.\n* Adopt the Google-recommended practices for cloud computing.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\n* The application and backend must provide usage metrics and monitoring.\n* APIs require strong authentication and authorization.\n* Logging must be increased, and data should be stored in a cloud analytics platform.\n* Move to serverless architecture to facilitate elastic scaling.\n* Provide authorized access to internal apps in a secure manner.\nHipLocal wants to reduce the number of on-call engineers and eliminate manual scaling.\nWhich two services should they choose?

Use serverless Google Cloud Functions.\nD. Use Google Kubernetes Engine for automated deployments.\nHere's why:\n\nCloud Functions: Cloud Functions is a serverless platform that automatically scales based on demand. This eliminates the need for manual scaling and reduces the workload on on-call engineers.\nKubernetes Engine: Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes service that provides automated deployments, scaling, and self-healing capabilities. This reduces the need for manual intervention and frees up engineers to focus on other tasks.","poster":"thewalker","timestamp":"1721209020.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1249501","comments":[{"content":"Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:\n\nA.

App Engine is a fully managed serverless platform that supports deployment to multiple regions, ensuring that your application can serve users around the world with low latency. You can choose the regions where you want to deploy your application, and Google manages the underlying infrastructure to provide high availability and automatic scaling. Cloud Functions can be deployed in multiple regions, allowing you to run your functions close to your users and other services they interact with. This reduces latency and improves performance.","timestamp":"1720855020.0","poster":"d_ella2001","comment_id":"1247166","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AB\nA. Google App Engine: This is a fully managed serverless platform that automatically scales your application up and down while balancing the load. With App Engine, you don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure, and it scales automatically in response to the traffic it receives. This can significantly reduce the operational overhead and the need for on-call engineers to handle scaling issues.\n\nB. Google Cloud Functions: This is another serverless execution environment that automatically scales the number of instances running your function in response to the incoming event rate. This is ideal for applications that respond to events (e.g., HTTP requests, Cloud Pub/Sub events). Like App Engine, it abstracts away infrastructure management and auto-scales based on demand.","timestamp":"1709847960.0","comment_id":"1168379","upvote_count":"1","poster":"santoshchauhan"},{"poster":"__rajan__","timestamp":"1695114780.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nI Think It should be A nd B for serverless autoscaling.

Their requirements are:\n* Expand availability of the application to new regions.\n* Increase the number of concurrent users that can be supported.\n* Ensure a consistent experience for users when they travel to different regions.\n* Obtain user activity metrics to better understand how to monetize their product.\n* Ensure compliance with regulations in the new regions (for example, GDPR).\n* Reduce infrastructure management time and cost.\n* Adopt the Google-recommended practices for cloud computing.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\n* The application and backend must provide usage metrics and monitoring.\n* APIs require strong authentication and authorization.\n* Logging must be increased, and data should be stored in a cloud analytics platform.\n* Move to serverless architecture to facilitate elastic scaling.\n* Provide authorized access to internal apps in a secure manner.\nWhich service should HipLocal use for their public APIs?","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":""},{"id":"xq7qnPmAqve3tEGcNoWs","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":7,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2020-07-14 13:44:00","answers_community":["A (83%)","B (17%)"],"answer":"A","question_id":284,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Deploy the website on App Engine as three separate services.","A":"Deploy the website on App Engine and use traffic splitting.","D":"Deploy the website on Cloud Functions as three separate functions.","C":"Deploy the website on Cloud Functions and use traffic splitting."},"topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_text":"Your website is deployed on Compute Engine.

It is used for event planning and organizing sporting events, and for businesses to connect with their local communities. HipLocal launched recently in a few neighborhoods in Dallas and is rapidly growing into a global phenomenon. Its unique style of hyper-local community communication and business outreach is in demand around the world.\n\nExecutive Statement -\nWe are the number one local community app; it's time to take our local community services global. Our venture capital investors want to see rapid growth and the same great experience for new local and virtual communities that come online, whether their members are 10 or 10000 miles away from each other.\n\nSolution Concept -\nHipLocal wants to expand their existing service, with updated functionality, in new regions to better serve their global customers. They want to hire and train a new team to support these regions in their time zones.
