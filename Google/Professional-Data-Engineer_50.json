You can store the processed data in Cloud Storage for further analysis, and it is a scalable and durable storage solution.\n\nOption B is not ideal because Local SSDs are not a suitable storage option for persisting data that needs to be reliably stored.

They help businesses throughout the world manage their resources and transport them to their final destination. The company has grown rapidly, expanding their offerings to include rail, truck, aircraft, and oceanic shipping.\n\nCompany Background -\nThe company started as a regional trucking company, and then expanded into other logistics market. Because they have not updated their infrastructure, managing and tracking orders and shipments has become a bottleneck. To improve operations, Flowlogistic developed proprietary technology for tracking shipments in real time at the parcel level. However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.\n\nSolution Concept -\nFlowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:\nUse their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads\n//IMG//\n\n✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.\n\nExisting Technical Environment -\nFlowlogistic architecture resides in a single data center:\n✑ Databases\n8 physical servers in 2 clusters\n- SQL Server `\" user data, inventory, static data\n3 physical servers\n- Cassandra `\" metadata, tracking messages\n10 Kafka servers `\" tracking message aggregation and batch insert\n✑ Application servers `\" customer front end, middleware for order/customs\n60 virtual machines across 20 physical servers\n- Tomcat `\" Java services\n- Nginx `\" static content\n- Batch servers\n✑ Storage appliances\n- iSCSI for virtual machine (VM) hosts\n- Fibre Channel storage area network (FC SAN) `\" SQL server storage\n- Network-attached storage (NAS) image storage, logs, backups\n✑ 10 Apache Hadoop /Spark servers\n- Core Data Lake\n- Data analysis workloads\n✑ 20 miscellaneous servers\n- Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts,\n\nBusiness Requirements -\n✑ Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled panty of production.\n✑ Aggregate data in a centralized Data Lake for analysis\n✑ Use historical data to perform predictive analytics on future shipments\n✑ Accurately track every shipment worldwide using proprietary technology\n✑ Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources\n✑ Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud\n✑ Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements are met\n\nTechnical Requirements -\nHandle both streaming and batch data\n//IMG//\n\n✑ Migrate existing Hadoop workloads\n✑ Ensure architecture is scalable and elastic to meet the changing demands of the company.\n✑ Use managed services whenever possible\n✑ Encrypt data flight and at rest\n✑ Connect a VPN between the production data center and cloud environment\n\nSEO Statement -\nWe have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.\nWe need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.\n\nCTO Statement -\nIT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.\n\nCFO Statement -\nPart of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.\nFlowlogistic's CEO wants to gain rapid insight into their customer base so his sales team can be better informed in the field. This team is not very technical, so they've purchased a visualization tool to simplify the creation of BigQuery reports. However, they've been overwhelmed by all the data in the table, and are spending a lot of money on queries trying to find the data they need.

Create a view on the table to present to the virtualization tool.\n\nCreating a view in BigQuery allows you to define a virtual table that is a subset of the original data, containing only the necessary columns or filtered data that the sales team requires for their reports. This approach is cost-effective because it doesn't involve exporting data to external tools or creating additional tables, and it ensures that the sales team is working with the specific data they need without running expensive queries on the full dataset. It simplifies the data for non-technical users while keeping the data in BigQuery, which is a powerful and cost-efficient data warehousing solution.\n\nOptions A (exporting to Google Sheet) and B (creating an additional table) might introduce data redundancy and maintenance overhead, and they don't provide the same level of control and security as creating a view. Option D (IAM roles) doesn't address the issue of simplifying the data for the sales team; it's more focused on access control.","poster":"rtcpost","comment_id":"1050793"},{"poster":"Mathew106","timestamp":"1690187160.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
