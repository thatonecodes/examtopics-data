Schedule weekly snapshots and use them with time travel for recovery. Weekly snapshots provide regular, reliable backups. If deletion occurs, restore from the latest snapshot, potentially supplemented by time travel for very recent data if needed. Option C (Clones) is a decent backup alternative, but snapshots are generally preferred for backup purposes. Option A (Time Travel alone) is too limited by its 7-day window. Option D (Views) provides no data protection against table deletion. Therefore, Option B offers the most robust and comprehensive data protection strategy.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1362604","poster":"n2183712847","timestamp":"1740673080.0"}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"You manage a BigQuery table that is used for critical end-of-month reports.

Implement flow control on the subscribers. Flow control directly addresses the issue of subscribers being overwhelmed during activity spikes by regulating the rate of message delivery, preventing them from being overloaded and ensuring messages are acknowledged within the deadline. Option A (Retry) worsens overload. Option C (Dead-letter topic) is for handling failed messages, not overload, and risks data loss in this scenario. Option D (Seek back) is for reprocessing and would exacerbate the overload issue. Therefore, Option B is the correct and most effective approach to handle activity spikes and ensure continuous message processing.","poster":"n2183712847","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1362601"}],"unix_timestamp":1740672660,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"B","choices":{"C":"Forward unacknowledged messages to a dead-letter topic.","A":"Retry messages until they are acknowledged.","D":"Seek back to the last acknowledged message.","B":"Implement flow control on the subscribers."},"exam_id":2,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_id":32,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/157212-exam-associate-data-practitioner-topic-1-question-38/","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Your organization sends IoT event data to a Pub/Sub topic.

Use a BigQuery Cloud resource connection to Vertex AI Gemini. This method is optimal because it allows in-database processing within BigQuery, directly using Gemini for summarization via a Cloud Resource Connection, minimizing data movement and maximizing efficiency. Option A (Python Notebook) is inefficient due to data extraction from BigQuery. Option B (BigQuery ML + Cloud Storage) adds unnecessary complexity and data export to Cloud Storage. Option D (CSV Export + Cloud Storage) is the least efficient, involving multiple data export/import steps and being impractical for millions of records.

Cloud Data Fusion pipeline (Cloud Storage to BigQuery). Option A is best because Cloud Data Fusion is visual and fast for pipeline building, scalable, handles transformations visually, and provides data quality insights within the pipeline. Option B (BigQuery load + SQL) is incorrect because scheduled queries are less of a pipeline and offer fewer built-in data quality features. Option C (BigQuery load + Data Fusion BQ to BQ) is incorrect because it's inefficient and redundant to load to BigQuery before Data Fusion.
