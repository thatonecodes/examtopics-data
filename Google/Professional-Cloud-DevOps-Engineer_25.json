Store secrets in Cloud Storage encrypted with a key from Cloud KMS. Provide the CI/CD pipeline with access to Cloud KMS via IAM.\n\nBy storing secrets in Cloud Storage, you can take advantage of the security features provided by the platform and encrypt them using Cloud KMS, a GCP service that allows you to create, manage, and use encryption keys. This way you can control who has access to the secrets, and you can easily rotate the encryption keys in case of a security breach. Additionally, you can use IAM to give the CI/CD pipeline the necessary permissions to access the secrets and use them during the deployment process, without the need to store them in the source code or give access to them to specific developers.","timestamp":"1689212280.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"774072","poster":"JonathanSJ"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAns: C\n\nExam passed and taken on 19/12/2022, 50/50 from this dump without buying the full access and looking for 'devops' word here: https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/1/","timestamp":"1687670940.0","poster":"floppino","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"755489"},{"timestamp":"1674645900.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"GCP72","comment_id":"636594","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C"},{"timestamp":"1659091080.0","comment_id":"535456","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C , https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management","upvote_count":"2","poster":"vijaigcp"},{"comment_id":"535099","timestamp":"1659054600.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"cyrus86","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer"},{"poster":"alaahakim","timestamp":"1654436520.0","content":"Ans : C","comment_id":"494472","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"381018","content":"C is the best option.","timestamp":"1639397220.0","poster":"akg001"},{"comment_id":"372910","upvote_count":"4","content":"answer C storing secrets in cloud is better option","poster":"devopsbatch","timestamp":"1638472560.0"}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2021-06-02 19:16:00","answer_description":"","question_text":"Your application artifacts are being built and deployed via a CI/CD pipeline.
