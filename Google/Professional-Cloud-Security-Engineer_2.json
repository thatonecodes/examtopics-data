Enable Access Transparency logs with Access Approval requests for Google employees.

Access Transparency logs capture the actions performed by Google Cloud administrators, allowing you to maintain an audit trail and verify cloud provider access. Access Approval requests allow you to approve or dismiss requests for access by Google employees working to support your service.
