Even though the compute metadata server can hold sensitive values like ssh keys, there are limitations with respect to how much data you can put in there (reference A below). Secret manager also has a size limit on how much you can store. (reference B below). However, secret manager is explicitly said to be a good use case for Sensitive Configuration information (reference C below) which makes it the preferred answer.\n\nReferences:\nA- https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/setting-custom-metadata#limitations\nB- https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/quotas\nC- https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/overview#secret_manager","comment_id":"961890","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1667611800.0","comment_id":"711475","content":"D is correct","poster":"AzureDP900"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
