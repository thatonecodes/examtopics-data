This approach allows you to maintain control over the encryption keys and ensures that data is encrypted throughout its lifecycle.","poster":"Pime13","timestamp":"1734000000.0"},{"poster":"DattaHinge","timestamp":"1727280720.0","comment_id":"1289094","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB. Customer-supplied encryption keys: This is crucial for achieving true end-to-end encryption. By providing your own encryption keys, you maintain complete control over the data, even Google Cloud cannot decrypt it without your keys.\nC.

Customer-supplied encryption keys\n- Customer-supplied encryption keys (CSEK) allow you to use your own encryption keys to protect your data at rest in Google Cloud, ensuring that your data is encrypted with keys that you control.\n\nD. Confidential Computing and Istio\n- Confidential Computing provides a hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE) to protect data in use, ensuring that sensitive workloads and data remain encrypted while being processed. Istio can be used for securing data in transit within Google Cloud.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\n**B. Customer-supplied encryption keys**\n\n**D.
