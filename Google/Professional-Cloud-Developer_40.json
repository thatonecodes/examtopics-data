There's no need of historical values from a time series, so \"ordering\" does not make any sense in this scenario. This eliminates alternatives B and D.\n\n2. Next choice is between \"push\" and \"pull\". In a \"push\" subscription, whenever the topic is fed with a new value, it will keep pushing it to the application until an acknowledgement is received. Latency is lower in this case. In a \"pull\" subscription, there's an additional burden on the application to keep pulling from the topic. This increases latency.
