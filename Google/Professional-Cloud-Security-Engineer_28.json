You should create a perimeter bridge between Project A and Project B to allow the required communication between both projects.\n\nVPC Service Controls (SC) help to mitigate data exfiltration risks. They provide a security perimeter around Google Cloud resources to constrain data within a VPC and help protect it from being leaked.\n\nIn this case, a resource in Project B needs to access a Pub/Sub topic in Project A, but Project A is within a VPC SC perimeter that’s blocking API access. A perimeter bridge can be created to allow communication between the two projects. This solution adheres to the principle of least privilege because it only allows the specific communication required, rather than changing the perimeter settings or access levels which could potentially allow more access than necessary.\n\nthe principle of least privilege is about giving a user or service account only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function. Options A and B could potentially grant more access than necessary, which is why they are not the best solutions. Option C, creating a perimeter bridge, allows just the specific communication required, adhering to the principle of least privilege.","comment_id":"1077923","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1694380980.0","comment_id":"1004307","upvote_count":"1","poster":"desertlotus1211","content":"Answer B:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/use-access-levels#create_an_access_level\n\nTo grant controlled access to protected Google Cloud resources in service perimeters from outside a perimeter, use access levels.\n\nThe following examples explain how to create an access level using different conditions:\n\nIP address\nUser and service accounts (principals)\nDevice policy"},{"comment_id":"999629","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1693926420.0","poster":"Andrei_Z","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBy creating an access level, you can specify precisely who in Project B should have access to subscribe to the Pub/Sub topic in Project A, ensuring that access is granted to only the necessary individuals or service accounts.

By setting the organization policy constraint constraints/iam.serviceAccountKeyExpiryHours to one hour and inheritFromParent to false, you are specifically controlling the duration for which the service account keys (credentials) are valid. This directly addresses the issue of open sessions and the risk of exploitation by ensuring that the credentials used for these sessions expire after a shorter time, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers.\n\nIn summary, option D provides a more targeted approach to mitigating the risk posed by open Google Cloud CLI sessions by setting the service account key expiry duration to one hour and ensuring it doesn't inherit from parent policies.","timestamp":"1693401420.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/9368756?hl=en&ref_topic=7556597&sjid=4209356388025132107-AP","timestamp":"1693023180.0","poster":"anshad666","comment_id":"990504","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA and B both satisfies the question but the effective and easy to do will be A, BTW B does the same job","poster":"cyberpunk21","comments":[{"poster":"desertlotus1211","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694454360.0","comment_id":"1005053","content":"B is what you need to do...."}],"comment_id":"988099","timestamp":"1692779100.0"},{"timestamp":"1691942880.0","comment_id":"980126","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/9368756?hl=en","upvote_count":"3","poster":"RuchiMishra"},{"comment_id":"972155","content":"Selected Answer: A\nC,D serviceAccountKeyExpiryHours is for Service Account not human (users) - as in the question.\nB - reauthenticate it is not user frendly, to reautjhenticate user once every hour\n\nSo correct is A.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"gcp4test","timestamp":"1691152680.0","comments":[{"poster":"pfilourenco","upvote_count":"3","content":"The session-length control settings affect sessions with all Google web properties that a user accesses while signed in. \nI think B is the most appropriated:\n\" for Google Cloud tools, and how these controls interact with the parent session control on this page, see Set session length for Google Cloud services.\"\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/7576830?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/9368756?hl=en","timestamp":"1691253180.0","comment_id":"973170"}]},{"timestamp":"1691147580.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Mithung30","comment_id":"972056","content":"D.
