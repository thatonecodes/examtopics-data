However, limiting access to sensitive resources also creates friction for anyone who occasionally needs to access those resources. For example, a user might need break-glass, or emergency, access to sensitive resources to resolve an incident.\n\nIn these situations, we recommend giving the user permission to access the resource temporarily. We also recommend that, to improve auditing, you record the user's justification for accessing the resource.","comment_id":"1323963"},{"timestamp":"1732263540.0","poster":"MoAk","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1316208"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"I think it's B.","poster":"yokoyan","comment_id":"1279260","timestamp":"1725580440.0"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":9,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1725580440,"choices":{"B":"Create a workforce identity pool and federate the identity pool with the identity provider (IdP) of the temporary partner team.","A":"Create a temporary username and password for the temporary partner team members.
