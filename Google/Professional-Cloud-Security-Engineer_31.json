By creating curated tables in a separate dataset, you can control access to specific data. Assigning the roles/bigquery.dataViewer role allows the business user to view the data in BigQuery.\n\nWhile option A is also a good practice for a security operator, it doesn’t directly address the specific needs of the users mentioned in the question as effectively as option C does.
