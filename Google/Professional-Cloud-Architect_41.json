You need both service account (Authorization) and id token (Authentication)\nWhen building services that connect multiple functions, it's a good idea to ensure that each function can only send requests to a specific subset of your other functions. For instance, if you have a login function, it should be able to access the user profiles function, but it probably shouldn't be able to access the search function.\nTo configure the receiving function to accept requests from a specific calling function, you need to grant the Cloud Functions Invoker (roles/cloudfunctions.invoker) role to the calling function's service account on the receiving function.","upvote_count":"15","timestamp":"1651324440.0","comments":[{"poster":"MaxNRG","upvote_count":"8","comments":[{"poster":"MaxNRG","timestamp":"1651324500.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"470726","content":"Have the account you are using to access Cloud Functions assigned a role that contains the cloudfunctions.functions.invoke permission.
