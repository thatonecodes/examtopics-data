This suggests that the Ingress does not have a default backend defined to handle requests that do not match a specific path rule.\n\nWhy Option C is Correct?\nIngress controllers in GKE route traffic based on path rules. If a request does not match any defined path, it is sent to the default backend.\nA missing default backend results in a 404 error for unmatched requests, which is exactly what is happening here.\nSolution: Update the Ingress YAML to define a default backend that will handle requests for www.mountkirkgames.com when no specific path is provided.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1361312"}]},{"id":"SoMFm22qI4KcCLJeKe3o","exam_id":8,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","question_id":95,"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/157094-exam-professional-cloud-network-engineer-topic-1-question/","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1740455580,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nConfigure BGP associated with the VLAN attachments to use a base priority of 100 - first priority, and Global dynamic routing.","comment_id":"1361314","timestamp":"1740455580.0","poster":"RKS_2021"}],"timestamp":"2025-02-25 04:53:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Enable regional dynamic routing mode on the VPC.
