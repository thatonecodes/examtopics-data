Use the Dataflow Jobs page in the Google Cloud console and examine job and worker logs. The console provides immediate and direct access to job status and detailed logs, allowing for rapid identification of errors. Option A (Cloud Monitoring Dashboard) is for proactive monitoring, not immediate failure diagnosis. Option B (Custom Script) is for future alerting, not current troubleshooting. Option D (gcloud CLI) is powerful but slightly less quick and user-friendly than the console for initial log browsing and error identification in this scenario. Therefore, Option C offers the most direct and efficient path to quickly diagnosing a Dataflow job failure.","timestamp":"1740675480.0","poster":"n2183712847","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":2,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-02-27 17:58:00"},{"id":"swIPO54cCRbi4X8ffhva","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe optimal and Google-recommended solution is D.

Use the “Pub/Sub to BigQuery” Dataflow template with a UDF. Option C is best because Dataflow templates are managed, serverless, and designed for streaming Pub/Sub data to BigQuery. UDFs allow minimal code for transformations within the pipeline. Option A (Pub/Sub to BigQuery + scheduled query) is incorrect because scheduled queries are not real-time transformations. Option B (Pub/Sub to Cloud Storage + Cloud Run) is incorrect because it adds unnecessary complexity with Cloud Storage as an intermediary and is not truly streaming. Option D (Pub/Sub push + Cloud Run) is incorrect because while real-time, it requires more code in Cloud Run than using a Dataflow UDF and is less purpose-built for data pipelines than Dataflow.
