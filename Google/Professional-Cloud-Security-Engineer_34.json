Check Event Threat Detection in Security Command Center for any related alerts. Cross-reference your findings with Cloud Audit Logs.\nExplanation:\n\n Security Command Center (SCC) is Google Cloud's security and risk management platform. Event Threat Detection within SCC is specifically designed to detect suspicious activity, such as unauthorized logins, and generates alerts based on predefined threat patterns. This tool would help you quickly identify if the suspicious login attempt is part of a known threat pattern.\n\n After checking for alerts in Event Threat Detection, cross-referencing with Cloud Audit Logs will give you detailed insights into the actions performed by the service account, allowing you to investigate the extent of any potential breach.","timestamp":"1725823860.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think it's D.","timestamp":"1725520500.0","comment_id":"1278758","poster":"yokoyan","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"D"},{"id":"Xn7kFPQypfOqeS3uPpeS","answer_description":"","question_text":"Your organization has an operational image classification model running on a managed AI service on Google Cloud.
