This approach is cost-effective and scalable.\n- Data Catalog for Governance: Creating a taxonomy of policy tags in Google Cloud's Data Catalog and applying these tags to specific columns in your BigLake tables enables fine-grained, column-level access control. \n- Processing with Spark and SQL: The Spark-BigQuery connector allows data scientists to process data using Apache Spark directly against BigQuery (and BigLake tables). This supports both Spark and SQL processing needs.\n- Scalability into a Data Mesh: BigLake and Data Catalog are designed to scale and support the data mesh architecture, which involves decentralized data ownership and governance."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1155776","poster":"JyoGCP","timestamp":"1724257140.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nGoing with 'B' based on the comments"},{"comment_id":"1121926","poster":"Matt_108","timestamp":"1720885260.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption B, agree with comments explanation"},{"comment_id":"1116291","timestamp":"1720393020.0","poster":"Jordan18","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBigLake leverages existing Cloud Storage infrastructure, eliminating the need for a dedicated Dataproc cluster, reducing costs significantly."},{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[],"comment_id":"1113616","poster":"scaenruy","timestamp":"1720084500.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. \n1.
