A survey would not proactively identify at-risk customers based on historical data and behaviors.\n\nD.

To connect networks from different cloud providers:\nWhile APIs can be used to manage cloud resources, the purpose of APIs is not specifically to connect networks between cloud providers. APIs focus on enabling software interactions, not networking.\n\nD.
