This ensures that the production and test VMs are in separate subnets and that they can communicate with each other over Internal IP without creating additional routes. Since the subnets are in different regions, they will also have different internal routing tables, which can help isolate the traffic between the two subnets. This configuration provides the necessary network isolation and connectivity required by the production and test workloads.\n\nANSWER B suggests creating a single custom VPC with two subnets in the same region and with the same CIDR range. However, the requirement is that production VMs need to be in a different subnet than the test VMs. With the subnets in the same region and with the same CIDR range, it would not be possible to separate the production and test VMs into different subnets.

The first rule allows traffic from instances in Tier#1 with the Tier#1 service account to instances in Tier#2 with the Tier#2 service account. The second rule allows traffic from instances in Tier#2 with the Tier#2 service account to instances in Tier#3 with the Tier#3 service account. This ensures that only the appropriate instances can communicate with each other.","comment_id":"814840","comments":[{"content":"ANSWER A is incorrect because it creates ingress firewall rules to allow communication between instances based on the IP ranges of their respective subnets. However, this doesn't guarantee that only instances in the desired tiers will be able to communicate with each other. Other instances outside the desired tiers that happen to be in the same subnet ranges will also be able to communicate.\n\nANSWER C is incorrect because it also allows all protocols for communication between instances in the desired tiers. This may not be desirable from a security standpoint, as it can potentially allow for unauthorized access or communication between instances.\n\nANSWER D is incorrect because it creates egress firewall rules instead of ingress rules. Egress rules control outbound traffic from instances, whereas ingress rules control inbound traffic. In this case, we need to control inbound traffic to allow communication between tiers on TCP port 8080.","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","comment_id":"814842","timestamp":"1692501240.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"timestamp":"1692501240.0"},{"poster":"cslince","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer","timestamp":"1686049080.0","comment_id":"736820"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct obviously","comment_id":"703114","timestamp":"1682346480.0","poster":"leogor"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer","poster":"abirroy","timestamp":"1675285740.0","comment_id":"640817","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"B is right, We need to open firewall rules to allow port 8080 and It shouldn't be wide open... like /24 network.","poster":"AzureDP900","timestamp":"1671814680.0","comment_id":"621055","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"610459","content":"go for B","poster":"haroldbenites","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1669967760.0"},{"comment_id":"537118","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Jerickson","timestamp":"1659268080.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","comment_id":"517156","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1656986940.0"},{"comment_id":"482233","timestamp":"1653008520.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"B. 1.
