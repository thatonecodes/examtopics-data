Each Shared VPC service project belongs to a different team: TEAM_ONE manages SP_ONE_PRJ and TEAM_TWO manages SP_TWO_PRJ.\n\nYou must design a solution that allows each team to create their own DNS private zones and DNS records only in their respective Shared VPC service projects. Workloads in SP_ONE_PRJ must be able to resolve all the DNS private zones defined in SP_TWO_PRJ and conversely. Your design must have the least amount of set up effort.

You suspect that packets are getting lost somewhere. The application sends packets intermittently at a low volume from a Compute Engine VM to a destination on your on-premises network through a pair of Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments. You validated that the Cloud Next Generation Firewall (Cloud NGFW) rules do not have any deny statements blocking egress traffic, and you do not have any explicit allow rules. Following Google-recommended practices, you need to analyze the flow to see if packets are being sent correctly out of the VM to isolate the issue.
