Cloud SQL.\n\nCloud SQL is a fully-managed relational database service that is ideal for transactional workloads (OLTP—Online Transaction Processing) in applications such as ecommerce platforms. It supports SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, which are commonly used for cost-effective and transactional databases. Since the ecommerce application will serve customers in a single region, Cloud SQL is an optimal choice as it provides high availability within a region and is relatively simple to set up and manage.","poster":"joshnort","comment_id":"1341943","comments":[{"content":"Why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. BigQuery: BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse designed for large-scale analytics (OLAP—Online Analytical Processing), not transactional workloads. It's optimized for running complex queries over large datasets, rather than handling real-time transactional data. BigQuery is also not designed for typical transactional use cases like those required by ecommerce applications, making it unsuitable for the application described in the question.\n\nB. Cloud Bigtable: Cloud Bigtable is a NoSQL database designed for high-throughput, low-latency applications that require large-scale storage, such as time-series data, IoT data, and analytical workloads. While it is fast and scalable, it is not a relational database and is not suitable for transactional systems that require strong consistency and SQL support.

Firewall rules.\n\nFirewall rules are used to control the types of network traffic that are allowed to enter and leave a network. They can be configured to permit or block specific IP addresses, ports, and protocols, thereby controlling access to applications, services, and other network resources. Firewalls can be set up at various levels (e.g., perimeter, internal network, or cloud-based) to enforce these security policies.","comments":[{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"C.
