This role only has the following two permissions:\n\n- cloudsql.instances.connect\n- cloudsql.instances.get\n\nThis is great when following the pricinple of least privilege. However, according to the documentation: \"The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy currently does not support Unix sockets on Windows, so this option is only available for Linux and macOS platforms\". \n\nOption C gives the editor role which is too broad and not neccessary. \n\nOption D gives viewer role. This looks good at first thought, but it's missing the cloudsql.instances.connect permission that Cloud SQL Auth Proxy requires for connectivity.\n\nAs such the only answer that fits is A.","comment_id":"1300354","comments":[{"timestamp":"1741291920.0","comment_id":"1366003","poster":"09bd94b","upvote_count":"1","content":"Well explained"}]},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1296382","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB","timestamp":"1728716220.0","poster":"anshad666"}],"timestamp":"2024-10-12 08:57:00"},{"id":"7qY5Jdx8Md9ZGJOcHG2z","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"question_id":237,"question_text":"You are developing a secure document sharing platform.
