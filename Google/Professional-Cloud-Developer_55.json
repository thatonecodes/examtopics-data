App Engine backed by Cloud Storage: While App Engine can serve images from Cloud Storage, it's not as efficient as a CDN for serving static content. App Engine instances are designed for dynamic applications, and serving images can be resource-intensive.\nB. Compute Engine backed by Persistent Disk: This approach is more expensive and less efficient than using a CDN. Persistent disks are designed for persistent data, not for serving static content at high volumes.\nC. Transfer Appliance backed by Cloud Filestore: Transfer Appliance is for bulk data transfers, not for serving images. Cloud Filestore is a managed file system, not optimized for serving static content.\nIn summary: A CDN backed by Cloud Storage provides the best combination of cost-effectiveness, low latency, and scalability for serving images.

These source IP ranges (130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16) are used by Google Cloud load balancers for health checking. Without this rule, the health checks would fail because the load balancer could not communicate with the backend instances to verify their status, resulting in no traffic being routed to those instances.
