They are access-controlled and cannot be modified dynamically while a VM is running, providing stronger guarantees for isolation.\nFirewall Rules with Service Accounts:\n\nGoogle Cloud supports using service accounts as targets for firewall rules.

Run each tier with its own VM tags, and use tag-based firewall rules: This is the most recommended method for multi-tier applications. VM tags are a straightforward way to identify the role or purpose of a VM (like 'web', 'app', 'database'). When VMs are tagged appropriately, tag-based firewall rules can easily control which tiers can communicate with each other.
