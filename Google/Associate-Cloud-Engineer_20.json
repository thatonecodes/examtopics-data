You can use regional too.\n\nCloud Spanner: Cloud Spanner is an enterprise-grade, globally-distributed, and strongly-consistent database that offers up to 99.999% availability, built specifically to combine the benefits of relational database structure with non-relational horizontal scale. It is a unique database that combines ACID transactions, SQL queries, and relational structure with the scalability that you typically associate with non-relational or NoSQL databases. As a result, Spanner is best used for applications such as gaming, payment solutions, global financial ledgers, retail banking and inventory management that require ability to scale limitlessly with strong-consistency and high-availability."},{"poster":"akshaychavan7","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI had chosen cloud SQL as the option, but after reading the following points I have changed my mind to cloud spanner.\n\nThis page describes the PostgreSQL interface for Cloud Spanner and its components.
