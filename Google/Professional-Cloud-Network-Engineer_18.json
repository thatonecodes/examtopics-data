This solution is ideal for a lift-and-shift migration where you want minimal changes to your existing backend configuration. By adding the backend instances to a target pool and linking it to the load balancer, you can effectively distribute traffic without introducing the complexity of managed instance groups or third-party appliances. This approach leverages GCP's native load balancing capabilities and meets the requirement for a straightforward migration.","timestamp":"1739269860.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1094021","timestamp":"1718151600.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Create a target pool, add all backend instances to this target pool, and deploy the target pool behind your load balancer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTarget Pool: A target pool is a GCP-native resource that allows you to group related instances as target instances. All instances in the target pool are considered equivalent targets for load balancing.\n\nLoad Balancer: Placing the target pool behind a GCP load balancer allows you to distribute incoming traffic among the instances in the target pool.\n\nLift-and-Shift Migration: Option B aligns with the lift-and-shift approach by allowing you to group existing instances (backend servers) into a target pool without significant modification to their configurations.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"xhilmi"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689169560.0","content":"B: Google Cloud load balancing uses instance groups, both managed and unmanaged, to serve traffic.
