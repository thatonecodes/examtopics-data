Data can enable innovation because it's no longer siloed.\n\nA unified cloud data solution consolidates data from different sources into a single platform, which helps eliminate data silos. This allows organizations to access and analyze data more easily, fostering innovation, better decision-making, and more efficient operations.\n\nWhile the other options may be benefits in certain contexts, they are not guaranteed by a unified cloud data solution:\n- A: Data costs can vary based on the storage provider and volume, so it is not always cheaper.\n- B: While cloud providers offer security measures, automatic security from external threats is not always guaranteed.\n- C: Data is typically backed up, but it is not immune to loss or deletion in every case.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"joshnort","comment_id":"1341318"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"UZZqMiBEiZf5eQ1hEo4r","topic":"1","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Expose data through a chargeable API.","D":"Transfer data into a non-relational database.","B":"Offer chargeable downloads of archived data.","A":"Add third-party users to their database."},"answer_images":[],"question_id":149,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"An organization stores its important industry data in a relational database.

Creating customer recommendations.\n\nMachine learning is well-suited for tasks like creating customer recommendations. By analyzing large amounts of data (such as customer behavior, preferences, and past interactions), machine learning models can predict and suggest products or content that users are likely to be interested in. This is a common use case in e-commerce, streaming services, and social media platforms.\n\nThe other options are not ideal use cases for machine learning:\n\n- A. Classifying data with no prior examples: Machine learning typically requires training on labeled data or prior examples to classify new data.\n- B. Tasks that require human experience and intuition: While machine learning can automate certain tasks, some tasks requiring nuanced human judgment and intuition are not easily replaced by algorithms.\n- D.
