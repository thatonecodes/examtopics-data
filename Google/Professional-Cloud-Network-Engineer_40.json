This indicates that Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is not enabled for these instances.

Instead, it suggests using the built-in gcloud compute ssh command, which simplifies the SSH process.\n\nCloud Shell: Opening the Cloud Shell provides you with an environment where the Google Cloud SDK is pre-installed, including the gcloud command-line tool.
