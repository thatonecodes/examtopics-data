This action ensures that traffic is directed to the previous deployment, mitigating any issues introduced by the new version. It is a controlled and Kubernetes-native way to perform rollbacks, allowing for seamless transitions between different versions of the application without downtime. Using the kubectl rollout undo command (option A) is another rollback method, but updating the Service provides a cleaner and more declarative approach within the Kubernetes environment.","comment_id":"1089116"},{"timestamp":"1712459820.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"PrayasMohanty","comment_id":"1027049","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"PrayasMohanty","timestamp":"1712892420.0","comment_id":"1041319","content":"C appears more correct as it is a blue/green deployment."}],"content":"A appears correct answer"},{"comment_id":"1022358","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711981800.0","content":"Answer should be A","poster":"ManishKS"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/122062-exam-professional-cloud-devops-engineer-topic-1-question-117/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer":"C","choices":{"B":"Delete the new container image, and delete the running Pods.","A":"Run the kubectl rollout undo command.","D":"Scale the new Kubernetes Deployment to zero.","C":"Update the Kubernetes Service to point to the previous Kubernetes Deployment."},"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-10-01 16:30:00","question_id":21,"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1696170600,"answer_description":"","question_text":"You are building the CI/CD pipeline for an application deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

The Standard Tier offers lower-cost network services compared to the Premium Tier, which can result in lower network costs. However, the Standard Tier may not offer the same level of functionality and features as the Premium Tier, which can limit your ability to optimize your network for your specific needs.\n\nIn contrast, using a Google Cloud HTTP Load Balancer as Ingress, as suggested in option D, can provide more fine-grained control over network traffic, which can help you optimize your network usage and reduce network costs. Additionally, a load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances, which can help reduce the amount of network bandwidth used by each instance.","timestamp":"1699234320.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"772041","poster":"JonathanSJ","timestamp":"1689044640.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
