GKE provides features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and self-healing, which ensure that updates can be deployed with minimal disruption to the application's availability. This helps meet customer expectations by minimizing downtime during updates.\n\nGKE is primarily designed for containerized applications and microservices. It is not specifically tailored for monolithic applications.

By using an API, the hotel can expose certain functions of their legacy system to the mobile app, allowing users to make reservations without having to develop a brand new application from scratch. This saves time and resources for the hotel, as they do not have to invest in the development of a new application and can instead focus on improving the existing system to work with the API.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"SoftSami","timestamp":"1694794320.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nHow you are imagine to add API to existing legacy system without rewriting it?","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"The best answer for this question is D.
