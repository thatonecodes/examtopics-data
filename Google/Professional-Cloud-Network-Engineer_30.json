D is the right answer. A is wrong because the online documentation states the following:\n\"The presence of a Via header indicates that the request was forwarded by a proxy.

It is not related to compression of HTTP responses. Therefore, configuring web servers to compress responses even if the request has a Via header would not resolve the issue of Cloud CDN not compressing responses.\nThe correct answer is A. You have not configured compression in Cloud CDN.\n\nCloud CDN supports content compression, but it must be explicitly enabled through the use of the Accept-Encoding header in HTTP requests. By default, Cloud CDN does not compress cacheable content. To enable compression, you need to configure your origin server to send compressed responses, add the Accept-Encoding header to your client requests, and enable content compression in the Cloud CDN configuration.","poster":"Komal697"},{"poster":"pk349","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"773672","timestamp":"1673538720.0","content":"D: To enable compression, you may have to override your web server's default configuration to tell it to compress responses even if the request had a Via header."},{"poster":"GCP72","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"648807","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect answer is \n\"D\"","timestamp":"1660896720.0"},{"comment_id":"537593","timestamp":"1643682240.0","poster":"Luvero","upvote_count":"4","content":"D \n\nCompression isn't working\nCloud CDN does not compress or decompress responses itself, but it can serve responses generated by your origin server that are compressed by using encodings such as gzip and DEFLATE.\nIf responses served by Cloud CDN are not compressed but should be, check that the web server software running on your instances is configured to compress responses.
