Network latency\n\nNetwork latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel between two locations over a network.\nSince the application is hosted in Europe and the customers are in Asia, the physical distance between the servers and the customers causes high latency, resulting in slow response times.","poster":"joshnort","comment_id":"1344333","comments":[{"poster":"joshnort","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737490500.0","content":"Why not the other options?\nA. Not enough application servers:\nIf the issue were a lack of servers, users across all regions would experience slowness, not just customers in Asia.\n\nB. Network bandwidth:\nBandwidth refers to the capacity of the network to transfer data. Since the customers have fast internet connections, this is unlikely to be the issue.\n\nD. Misconfigured application servers:\nMisconfiguration would likely affect all users, not just those in Asia.\n\nSolution:\nTo reduce latency, the organization could:\n1. Deploy a replica of the application closer to Asia (e.g., in an Asian region).\n2. Use a content delivery network (CDN) to cache and serve content closer to users.","comment_id":"1344335"}]}],"topic":"1","question_id":186,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","question_text":"An organization is hosting an application in Europe, and customers in Asia are reporting slow response times despite their fast internet connection.\n\nWhat is the problem?","isMC":true},{"id":"cC8OjQ5I8v97dn4w65EI","question_id":187,"choices":{"C":"AutoML","D":"Discovery AI for Retail","B":"Document AI","A":"Pre-trained APIs"},"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1737490560,"question_text":"A manufacturing organization has a large collection of images labeled as intact or defective parts.

AutoML\n\nAutoML is a tool that allows organizations without data science expertise to build custom machine learning models. It can take labeled datasets, like the organization's collection of intact and defective part images, and train a model to automatically classify new images.\nAutoML Vision, in particular, is designed for image recognition tasks, making it ideal for detecting faulty parts based on labeled images.","timestamp":"1737490560.0","comment_id":"1344336","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"Why not the other options?\nA.
