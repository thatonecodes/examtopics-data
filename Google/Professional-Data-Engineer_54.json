A larger dataset typically reduces the chance of overfitting, as the model has more varied examples to learn from.\nC. Use a smaller set of features:\n\nWhy: Reducing the number of features can help prevent the model from learning noise in the data. Overfitting often occurs when the model is too complex for the amount of data available, and having too many features can contribute to this complexity.\nE.

Use a service account with the ability to read the batch files and to write to BigQuery\n\nIt is best practice to use service accounts with the least privilege necessary to perform a specific task when automating jobs. In this case, the job needs to read the batch files from Cloud Storage and write the results to BigQuery. Therefore, you should create a service account with the ability to read from the Cloud Storage bucket and write to BigQuery, and use that service account to run the job.","poster":"PolyMoe","timestamp":"1706274420.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"788744"},{"poster":"Mkumar43","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB works for the given requirement","timestamp":"1704442980.0","comment_id":"766378","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Least privilege principle.
