Autoscaling helps your apps gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduce costs when the need for resources is lower. You define the autoscaling policy and the autoscaler performs automatic scaling based on the measured load (CPU Utilization in this case). Autoscaling works by adding more instances to your instance group when there is more load (upscaling), and deleting instances when the need for instances is lowered (downscaling).\n\nRef: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler","poster":"gcp_world123"},{"poster":"RanjithK","timestamp":"1656739800.0","comment_id":"625952","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is B"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"AzureDP900","content":"B is perfect for given scenario.","comment_id":"620626","timestamp":"1655931000.0"},{"comment_id":"606104","timestamp":"1653311640.0","content":"option B is correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"jagan_cloud"},{"timestamp":"1653212340.0","content":"Go for B","poster":"haroldbenites","comment_id":"605322","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1637699460.0","poster":"sid0127","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect is B","comment_id":"485406","upvote_count":"5"},{"poster":"shawnkkk","comment_id":"481455","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1637307420.0","content":"B.
