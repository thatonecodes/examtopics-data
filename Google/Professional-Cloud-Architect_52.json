Now, they have again renamed \"Ingress for Anthos\" to \"Multi Cluster Ingress\".

Create Request Latency and Error Rate as service level indicators.\nRequest Latency measures the time it takes for a request to be processed by the game, and is an important indicator of the responsiveness of the game from the user's perspective. A high request latency can indicate that the game is experiencing performance issues or is under heavy load, which may negatively impact the user experience.\n\nError Rate measures the percentage of requests that result in errors, such as HTTP errors or timeouts. A high error rate can indicate that the game is experiencing technical issues or is not able to handle incoming requests effectively, which can also negatively impact the user experience.
