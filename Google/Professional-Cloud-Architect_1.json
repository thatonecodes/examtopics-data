Why would you use or create a whole new VM just because of a permission issue? If anything, just stop the instance and edit the scope of the default Compute Service Account and grant it the role through IAM. C) is the most appropriate answer since you can only set scopes of the default Compute Service Account, if you're using any other, there's no scope option - its access is dictated strictly by IAM in such scenario. So C) is the answer: Stop the VM, change the Service Account with the appropriate permissions and done. B) would still need to have permission the set through IAM & Admin, the scope isn't enough with the default Compute Service Account.","timestamp":"1597423140.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1605345960.0","content":"cloud guy1, relax. tartar is the hero for google cloud and if you read his answer, he explains the service account user's role granting on this one as that is the best practice","poster":"certificatores","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"219026"}]}],"timestamp":"1597391640.0","upvote_count":"15","poster":"tartar","comment_id":"157911","content":"Sorry, B is ok.

If processing fails, Cloud Pub/Sub will redeliver messages but the messages might be delivered to different workers than those that processed them originally and in a different order. This non-deterministic behavior means that Cloud Dataflow needs assistance for detecting duplicates because there's no way for the service to deterministically assign record ids that will be stable upon retry. (We’ll dive into a more detailed use case involving Cloud Pub/Sub later.)","comment_id":"163061"},{"comment_id":"156851","poster":"viiqdozal","timestamp":"1597280400.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"B is the correct answer - DataFlow helps with the correct ordering of the data and processing of duplicates before sending anywhere else"},{"comment_id":"147460","upvote_count":"1","poster":"dipenich","content":"I think the answer is B, CloudSQL is no legacy backend.
