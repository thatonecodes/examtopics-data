Limit the upload rate from your application clients so that the dormant bucket's peak request rate is reached more gradually.\n\nGoogle Cloud Storage buckets have throughput limits that ramp up as sustained traffic increases, especially for previously inactive buckets. When you start sending traffic to an inactive bucket, it takes time for Cloud Storage to automatically scale to accommodate the sudden increase in traffic. By gradually increasing the traffic to the bucket, you give the Cloud Storage infrastructure time to scale and handle the increased load without failing requests.","comment_id":"1168323"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGoogle Cloud Storage buckets have an initial limit on the request rate. If a bucket is inactive for a period of time, it will have a lower limit. As traffic increases, Google Cloud Storage dynamically increases the request rate limit. This process can take several minutes. If the traffic increases too quickly, you may see intermittent 5xx and 429 HTTP responses. By limiting the upload rate from your application clients, you allow the bucket’s peak request rate to increase more gradually, reducing the chance of receiving these errors.","poster":"__rajan__","comment_id":"1011086","timestamp":"1710842340.0"},{"poster":"omermahgoub","comment_id":"768305","content":"To decrease the failed responses from the Cloud Storage API, you should limit the upload rate from your application clients so that the dormant bucket's peak request rate is reached more gradually.
