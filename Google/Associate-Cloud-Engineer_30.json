Here's how each of the components is used:\n\n1. Cloud Pub/Sub: receives and distributes time-series data from different sources.\n2. Cloud Dataflow: processes the data by applying transformations and analytics.\n3. Cloud Bigtable: stores and manages the processed data as a NoSQL database.\n4. BigQuery: provides a SQL-like interface to analyze the data and extract insights.\n\nBy combining these components, you can create a scalable and reliable pipeline to process and analyze time-series data in real time.","upvote_count":"51","timestamp":"1708313040.0"},{"content":"Correct answer D","timestamp":"1730844840.0","poster":"BAofBK","comment_id":"1063338","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1019078","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is D\n\nThis diagram shows a typical pipeline for processing time-series data:\n\n1. **Cloud Pub/Sub:** A messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages between independent applications.\n2. **Cloud Dataflow:** A fully-managed service for transforming and processing data streams.\n3. **Cloud Bigtable:** A wide-column, distributed NoSQL database that is optimized for storing and analyzing large amounts of data.\n4. **BigQuery:** A fully-managed, petabyte-scale analytics data warehouse that enables businesses to analyze all their data very quickly.\n\nIn this pipeline, the following happens:\n\n1. Time-series data is sent to Cloud Pub/Sub.\n2. Cloud Dataflow reads the data from Cloud Pub/Sub and performs any necessary transformations or processing.\n3. Cloud Dataflow writes the transformed data to Cloud Bigtable.\n4.
