Functions as a service (FaaS): Allows users to execute code in response to events without managing servers.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources like virtual machines, storage, and networking. With IaaS, users still need to manage and configure the operating systems, applications, and code on top of the infrastructure (e.g., Google Compute Engine or AWS EC2). This is not the right fit because the organization would still be responsible for managing the software and services.\n\nB. Platform as a service (PaaS): Provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. However, users still need to write their own code and configure the platform (e.g., Google App Engine or AWS Elastic Beanstalk). This is not the right fit because the organization does not want to manage code.","comment_id":"1340637","poster":"joshnort"}],"timestamp":"1736909460.0","poster":"joshnort","comment_id":"1340635","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Software as a service (SaaS).\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) provides fully managed software applications that users can access directly over the internet, without the need to manage servers, infrastructure, or write code. The cloud vendor takes care of everything, including updates, security, and maintenance. Examples include Gmail, Microsoft 365, and Salesforce.","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true,"question_text":"An organization wants to access a software application from a cloud vendor without the need to manage their own servers or write their own code.\n\nWhich service model does this represent?","unix_timestamp":1736909460,"question_images":[],"exam_id":3},{"id":"P7vgzUKDoKiOeP0L5M3w","answer":"D","question_images":[],"question_id":142,"timestamp":"2024-04-30 07:08:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"question_text":"An organization wants to build a data pipeline to transform its data so it can be reconciled in a data warehouse.

Dataflow\n\nDataflow provides unified stream and batch data processing at scale. Use it to create data pipelines that read from one or more sources, transform the data, & write the data to a destination.\n\nTypical use cases for Dataflow:\n- Data movement: Ingesting data or replicating data across subsystems.\n- ETL (extract-transform-load) workflows that ingest data into a data warehouse such as BigQuery.\n- Powering BI dashboards.\n- Applying ML in real time to streaming data.\n- Processing sensor data or log data at scale.\n\nDataflow uses the same programming model for both batch and stream analytics. You can ingest, process, and analyze fluctuating volumes of real-time data. \n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/overview","timestamp":"1736910600.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736910660.0","comment_id":"1340646","content":"Incorrect options:\n\nA.

While it is useful for certain types of data storage and analysis, it is not specifically designed for building and managing data transformation pipelines.\n\nB. Cloud Storage: Cloud Storage is a scalable object storage service, ideal for storing large volumes of unstructured data. However, it does not offer direct functionality for transforming data or building data pipelines; additional tools or services like Dataflow would be required to transform data stored in Cloud Storage.\n\nC. Pub/Sub: Pub/Sub is a messaging service used for building event-driven systems and real-time messaging. While it is useful for ingesting data into a pipeline, it does not provide the data transformation or reconciliation capabilities needed for this use case. It is often used in combination with other services like Dataflow.","poster":"joshnort"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"joshnort"},{"comment_id":"1204343","poster":"Vivek007","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1730272080.0","content":"D: Google Cloud Dataflow is a fully-managed service designed to simplify the tasks of processing large amounts of data in both batch and stream modes. Dataflow is especially suited for data integration and ETL (extract, transform, load) tasks, making it ideal for preparing data for a data warehouse.

When it is at rest and in transit.\n\nGoogle Cloud automatically encrypts data both at rest (when it's stored) and in transit (when it's being transferred between systems or services). This is done by default for all data in Google Cloud, ensuring data security and privacy without requiring additional configuration from the user.\n\nAt rest: Data stored in Google Cloud (e.g., in Google Cloud Storage, databases, or other storage services) is automatically encrypted using encryption keys managed by Google, unless users choose to manage their own keys (via Customer-Managed Encryption Keys, or CMEK).\n\nIn transit: Data transferred between services, users, and other components in Google Cloud is automatically encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) to protect data during transfer.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1340648","poster":"joshnort","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736910840.0","content":"Incorrect options:\n\nA.

It doesn't directly involve verifying user identity but helps monitor the usage of the system once authentication and authorization are in place.\n\nD.
