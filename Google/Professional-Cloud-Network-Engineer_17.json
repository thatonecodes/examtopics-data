In this case, the question mentions that the packet loss investigation is for traffic flows starting in VPC A and terminating in VPC B.\n\nSince the traffic is originating from VPC A and terminating in VPC B, you should look in Project B for the reported metric, as this is where the traffic terminates. This makes options A and C incorrect.\n\nNow, you need to ensure that each zone in each of the VPC networks has at least 9 compute instances to provide a sufficient sample size for statistical analysis with a 90% confidence level.
