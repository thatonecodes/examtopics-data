When you examine the latency time along with the wall‐clock and CPU times, a minimal difference between wall‐clock and CPU times indicates that the code is CPU‑intensive (i.e. it isn’t waiting on I/O). If at the same time the latency is eroding the error budget, this signals that the application isn’t keeping up with user expectations and is a candidate for performance tuning.\n\nE. Low heap usage implies that the application isn’t heavily utilizing its available memory. In Java applications, if the heap usage remains low despite ample allocation, it suggests that increasing memory won’t improve throughput or latency. Instead, the code itself may be inefficient (for example, it might not be caching or reusing objects effectively) and therefore should be optimized.","poster":"cachopo","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1723721520.0","poster":"alpha_canary","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1151027","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nI asked Google's Gemini AI and this is what it answered. \n\nHere's why these options are correct:\n\nD:\n\nLatency time: High latency directly impacts user experience and can negatively affect your error budget.\nWall-clock time: This represents the elapsed time from start to finish of a request. A large difference with CPU time indicates bottlenecks outside the CPU, requiring optimization.\nCPU time: This represents the actual CPU processing time used by the application.
