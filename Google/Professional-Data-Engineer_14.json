As explained in a moment, tall and narrow tables are best suited for time-series data.\n\nFor time series, you should generally use tall and narrow tables. This is for two reasons: Storing one event per row makes it easier to run queries against your data. Storing many events per row makes it more likely that the total row size will exceed the recommended maximum (see Rows can be big but are not infinite).\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/schema-design-time-series#patterns_for_row_key_design","timestamp":"1588258680.0","poster":"psu","upvote_count":"35"},{"content":"C correct answer","poster":"madhu1171","timestamp":"1584297660.0","comment_id":"64416","upvote_count":"19"},{"poster":"shangning007","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1734601260.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nEven though I am sure the answer is C, but I am not sure why it will help avoid being charged for every query?","comment_id":"1328923"},{"comment_id":"1303873","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730102520.0","poster":"SamuelTsch","content":"Selected Answer: C\njust like psu said.
