Install the Stackdriver custom metrics adapter and configure a horizontal pod autoscaler to use the number of requests provided by the GCLB.\n\nTo scale the deployment of the application's frontend using an appropriate Service Level Indicator (SLI), we need to monitor the traffic coming to the application. One way to do this is to install the Stackdriver custom metrics adapter, which provides visibility into GCLB metrics such as request counts, bytes sent and received, and active connections. We can then configure a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to scale the number of pods based on the request count coming through the GCLB, which will help to ensure that our application is always available to handle the incoming traffic.","timestamp":"1710681000.0","poster":"Wael216"},{"comment_id":"703115","timestamp":"1698157740.0","poster":"zellck","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nI will go with C","poster":"pradoUA","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"702692","timestamp":"1698122280.0"},{"timestamp":"1695262560.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ramzez4815","comment_id":"674702","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the correct answer as per Google documentation"},{"content":"C is correct","comment_id":"607492","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1685081940.0","poster":"khushboo93s"},{"poster":"Murty549","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1673955360.0","comment_id":"525723","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption B is incorrect because there will be no benefit in vertically scaling the front end if the requests are very high.

Horizontal pod autoscaler will scale based on the custom metrics such as requests per second(i.e. no. of requests). but vertical autoscaling is also useful feature for the frontend application. as it requires more resource needs if the traffic is high. Since vertical autoscaling will first delete the pod and adjust the cpu and memory to recreate the pod, It can cause downtime for that duration and not recommended.
