To deploy a Docker container on Kubernetes Engine, you should first create a Docker image from the Dockerfile and push it to Container Registry, which is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for you to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Then, you can create a Deployment YAML file that specifies the image to use and other desired deployment options, and use the kubectl command-line tool to create the deployment based on the YAML file. \n\nOption A is incorrect because kubectl app deploy is not a valid command. \n\nOption B is incorrect because gcloud app deploy is used to deploy applications to App Engine, not Kubernetes Engine. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it involves storing the image in Cloud Storage rather than Container Registry.\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/deploying-a-container","upvote_count":"26","timestamp":"1672347600.0","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","comments":[{"timestamp":"1677148800.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"819076","poster":"ast3citos","content":"The link you provided has stopped working :_("}]},{"timestamp":"1739175780.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe file image should be created from the Dockerfile and pushed to the Registry and from there it should be deployed once it's YAML structure is in place.","poster":"Cloudmoh","comment_id":"1354337"},{"poster":"madzzzz","timestamp":"1727789760.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","comment_id":"1291978","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"subha.elumalai","timestamp":"1716484680.0","content":"Correct Answer: C\nReference -\nhttps://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app","comment_id":"1216799"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"The answer is C.","comment_id":"1063309","poster":"BAofBK","timestamp":"1699219980.0"},{"comment_id":"1040404","content":"C is Correct Answer","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1697014980.0","poster":"Evan7557"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1001098","timestamp":"1694051400.0","content":"C is correct. \nWe need to build docker image then push to Container Registry and setup yaml deployment in GKE to pull our registry image.","poster":"dookiecloud"},{"content":"c is correct ,, you have to first upload it in the continer registry","comment_id":"996177","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1693582140.0","poster":"Captain1212"},{"timestamp":"1678826100.0","comment_id":"839256","poster":"sajitv","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"ChristN","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct.","timestamp":"1669806660.0","comment_id":"731371"},{"comment_id":"701995","content":"c, u need to upload to Container Registry before deploying","poster":"leogor","timestamp":"1666512120.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct, cuz you need to upload to Container Registry at first","poster":"hiromi","timestamp":"1666253040.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"699674"},{"timestamp":"1656739620.0","poster":"RanjithK","comment_id":"625947","content":"Answer is C","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"620629","timestamp":"1655931180.0","poster":"AzureDP900","content":"C is right"},{"timestamp":"1655622840.0","comment_id":"618566","content":"C is correct answer","poster":"Biksthrow","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"609121","timestamp":"1653904260.0","poster":"wjtb","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct.\nA can be eliminated because kubectl app * is not a valid command\nB can be eliminated because gcloud app deploy deploys on app engine, not on kubernetes (also it still requires a config file pointing to the image).\nD is not correct, since you cannot deploy a container image directly from GCS","upvote_count":"6"},{"poster":"haroldbenites","comment_id":"605314","timestamp":"1653211680.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Go for C"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","poster":"Prassanth","timestamp":"1653125640.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"604784"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"C is correct","poster":"Chile","timestamp":"1650990960.0","comment_id":"592571"},{"comment_id":"555688","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1645753980.0","poster":"pgb54"},{"comment_id":"531352","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer: C\nWe cannot deploy directly dockerfile on k8s.
