It needs to run some queries against it.\n\nIn this case, the Data Viewer would not be required, as the App Engine service specifically targets the data to create visualizations from.

However, your image will be more reliable if you put the instance in a state that is easier for the image to capture. Use one of the following processes to prepare your boot disk for the image:\n\nStop the instance so that it can shut down and stop writing any data to the persistent disk.\n\nIf you can't stop your instance before you create the image, minimize the amount of writes to the disk and sync your file system.\n\nPause apps or operating system processes that write data to that persistent disk.\nRun an app flush to disk if necessary. For example, MySQL has a FLUSH statement.
