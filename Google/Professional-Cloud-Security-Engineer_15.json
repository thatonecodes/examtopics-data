All VM instances are missing the respective network tags.\nD. A VPC firewall rule is allowing traffic between source/targets based on the same service account with priority 999.\n\nIf all the VM instances in your Google Cloud environment are able to communicate freely despite tag-based VPC firewall rules in place, it is likely that the instances are missing the necessary network tags. Without the appropriate tags, the firewall rules will not be able to properly segment the traffic. Another possible reason for this behavior could be the existence of a VPC firewall rule that allows traffic between source and target instances based on the same service account, with a priority of 999. This rule would take precedence over the tag-based firewall rules with a priority of 1000. It is unlikely that all the VM instances are residing in the same network subnet or configured with the same network route, or that there is a VPC firewall rule allowing traffic with a priority of 1001.","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"zanhsieh","upvote_count":"1","content":"I hit this question on the real exam.
