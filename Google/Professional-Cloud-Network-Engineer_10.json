Which firewall rule should you configure to allow only this communication path?","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/89774-exam-professional-cloud-network-engineer-topic-1-question/","timestamp":"2022-12-02 12:05:00"},{"id":"fpodO37h7EoPDVTQV4XB","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/89781-exam-professional-cloud-network-engineer-topic-1-question/","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1669982160,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"ian_gcpca","comment_id":"1336612","comments":[{"poster":"ian_gcpca","comment_id":"1336614","timestamp":"1736044140.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"btw, there is no reply option in Network Intelligence Center Network Topology.
