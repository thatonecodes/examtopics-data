Here's why:\n\nVirtual Machines (VMs):\nVMs provide a way to run multiple instances of operating systems on a single physical server. Each VM operates as a separate and isolated environment with its own dedicated OS, applications, libraries, and resources. In this case, where each application requires its own OS, VMs align well with the existing architecture. \nContainers:\nContainers are designed to share a single OS kernel while isolating applications from one another.

As the organization continues to collect more data and gather feedback on the effectiveness of the suggestions, they can refine and improve the predictive models over time through a process known as \"learning.\"\n\nBy employing machine learning techniques, the organization can leverage the power of their data to provide personalized and relevant suggestions to their website users. These suggestions can be based on user behavior, historical data, preferences, and other relevant factors. The organization can continuously analyze and update their machine learning models to adapt to changing user preferences and improve the accuracy of the suggestions provided."},{"content":"C seems to be correct answer","poster":"Chayan_101","timestamp":"1699214160.0","comment_id":"890223","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
