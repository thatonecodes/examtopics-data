A Preemptible or Spot VM on Compute Engine\n\nPreemptible VMs (on Google Cloud) or Spot VMs (on AWS/Azure) are highly cost-effective instances designed for workloads that are fault-tolerant and non-time critical.\n\nThese VMs are significantly cheaper than standard VMs.\nThey can be preempted (terminated) by the cloud provider if resources are needed elsewhere, but since the workload can be restarted without losing work, this is ideal.\n\nOther options:\nB and C: Custom or standard VMs in pay-as-you-go models are more expensive and unnecessary for this use case.\nD: Cloud Functions are used for event-driven workloads, not for running batch data analysis on VMs.\nThus, Preemptible/Spot VMs provide the lowest-cost option for the described scenario.","timestamp":"1737484020.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":182,"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":3,"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1737484020,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/155095-exam-cloud-digital-leader-topic-1-question-262-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-01-21 19:27:00","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"An organization runs a batch data analysis workload on a virtual machine (VM).

Run a replica of the application in a region in the United States.\n\nHigh latency occurs because the application is hosted in a single region in Europe, and users in the United States experience delays due to the physical distance and network latency.\n\nThe best way to reduce latency for U.S. customers is to deploy a replica of the application in a region closer to them (in the United States). This allows the traffic from U.S. users to be served locally, reducing latency.","poster":"joshnort","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Why not the other options?\nA.

Run the application in additional regions in Europe:\nDeploying in multiple European regions might improve resilience for European users but will not reduce latency for U.S.-based users.\n\nDeploying a replica in the U.S. region directly addresses the root cause: geographic proximity.","timestamp":"1737484860.0","comment_id":"1344283","poster":"joshnort"}]}],"timestamp":"2025-01-21 19:41:00","question_text":"Customers are reporting very high latencies when accessing an application from the United States.
