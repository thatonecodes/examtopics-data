Lack of load balancer isn't preventing one of the BGP sessions from establishing. The second BGP session not being established is preventing load balancing to the alternate vpn.\n\nAs far as the wording of D, (BGP sessions are NOT established between BOTH on-premises routers and ...) think of it this way: Not both, only one.
