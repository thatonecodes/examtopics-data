They run software that cannot be deployed on standard servers: This is incorrect because purpose-built servers are not designed to run software that can't be deployed on standard servers.

The software they run can typically be deployed on standard servers as well, though it may not perform as efficiently without the specialized hardware.","timestamp":"1737087600.0","poster":"joshnort"}],"content":"Why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. They are backward compatible with legacy disk drives: While some systems may provide backward compatibility, purpose-built servers are not specifically designed with backward compatibility in mind. Their main goal is to optimize performance for specific workloads, not to maintain compatibility with older or legacy hardware components like disk drives. General-purpose servers, on the other hand, are more likely to be designed for compatibility with a wider range of hardware.\n\nC. They are cheaper to build than standard servers: Purpose-built servers are typically more expensive to develop and produce than standard servers. This is because they require specialized hardware and customization to meet the needs of specific tasks. While they can offer better performance for particular workloads, they are generally more costly to manufacture compared to general-purpose servers, which are designed to handle a wide variety of tasks."}],"timestamp":"1737087600.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"joshnort","comment_id":"1341988","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. They are optimized for specific tasks making them more efficient.\n\nGoogle's purpose-built servers are designed to handle specific tasks or workloads, such as machine learning, data analytics, or high-performance computing. By being optimized for these specific tasks, they can achieve better performance and efficiency compared to general-purpose servers. This optimization leads to faster processing, lower latency, and better overall resource utilization, which can be more cost-effective and powerful for certain use cases."}],"exam_id":3,"unix_timestamp":1737087600,"question_id":176,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/154764-exam-cloud-digital-leader-topic-1-question-257-discussion/","choices":{"A":"They are optimized for specific tasks making them more efficient.","D":"They run software that cannot be deployed on standard servers.","C":"They are cheaper to build than standard servers.","B":"They are backward compatible with legacy disk drives."},"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"OBvjN2GUErB1iSyqEijP","question_text":"What is the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) term for an organization s desired level of reliability and performance?","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1737087780,"question_id":177,"answer":"A","exam_id":3,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Service-level objective","B":"Enhanced support","C":"Scalable infrastructure","D":"Service-level indicator"},"discussion":[{"poster":"joshnort","comments":[{"comments":[{"poster":"joshnort","upvote_count":"1","content":"D.

Service-level objective.\n\nIn Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), a Service-Level Objective (SLO) defines the organization's desired level of reliability and performance for a service. SLOs are measurable targets for reliability that help guide the management and monitoring of services, ensuring that they meet the expectations of users and stakeholders. These objectives are often tied to specific Service-Level Indicators (SLIs), which are metrics that measure how well the service is performing relative to the SLOs.","comment_id":"1341993"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/154766-exam-cloud-digital-leader-topic-1-question-258-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-01-17 05:23:00","topic":"1"},{"id":"24HpDsZP6YcCWIkE8UpL","unix_timestamp":1737088020,"question_images":[],"question_text":"An organization is operating multiple workloads in containers and requires full control of how the workloads are configured.

Compute Engine: Compute Engine provides virtual machines (VMs) for running workloads, but it is not specifically designed for container orchestration.

Kubernetes Engine.\n\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a fully managed service for running and orchestrating containerized applications. It gives organizations full control over how their workloads are configured and managed by allowing them to define their containers' infrastructure, networking, scaling, and deployment strategies.
