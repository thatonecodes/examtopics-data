This indicates that the potential increase in revenue due to the higher availability is $900. Given that the investment cost is $2,000, the gain falls short of covering the investment, making the decision not to pursue the availability increase financially impractical.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice, aligning with a thorough cost-benefit analysis and demonstrating that the increase in availability is not worth the $2,000 investment for a single year of usage.","comment_id":"1088958"},{"poster":"khoukha","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1714655880.0","comment_id":"1060643","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSorry the answer should be A.\n99,99%-99,9%=0.09%\n0.09% of 1.000.000 is 900 dollar"},{"comment_id":"1060641","timestamp":"1714655760.0","poster":"khoukha","upvote_count":"1","content":"99,99%-99,9%=0.09% \n0.09% of 1.000.000 is 900 dollar, answer is B"},{"timestamp":"1711974600.0","poster":"ManishKS","comment_id":"1022240","content":"Answer Should be A","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2023-10-01 14:30:00","question_id":6,"isMC":true},{"id":"4kBCQf50uqf1O9ODhsvE","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1075768","timestamp":"1732129140.0","poster":"bhunias","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\n(D) is better choice, exemption of policy at Org level is always riskier than to exempt it at project level (B).
