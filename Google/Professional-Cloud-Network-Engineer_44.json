Enable VPC Flow Logs and send the output to BigQuery for analysis is the recommended approach to identify the virtual machine (VM) instances and type of traffic causing the spike in traffic utilization while minimizing the cost and management overhead required. VPC Flow Logs provides a way to capture and log network traffic metadata in your Google Cloud VPC. By analyzing VPC Flow Logs in BigQuery, you can obtain insights into network traffic, such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports, which can help you to identify the VM instances and type of traffic causing the spike in traffic utilization. This approach is cost-effective because VPC Flow Logs are priced based on the amount of data you generate, and it requires no additional hardware or software."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.\nOption B, enabling Firewall Rules Logging for all allowed traffic, would not necessarily capture all traffic, as not all traffic may be subject to firewall rules.
