Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):\nIaaS provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking, but it still requires users to manage the operating system, application runtime, and other infrastructure components. This would not meet the need to avoid managing infrastructure.\n\nC. Software as a service (SaaS):\nSaaS delivers fully managed software applications (e.g., email, CRM, productivity tools) over the internet. It does not allow for the deployment of custom applications.\n\nD.

Platform as a service (PaaS)\n\nExplanation:\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS) allows organizations to run their custom applications in the cloud without managing the underlying infrastructure (e.g., servers, storage, networking).\nPaaS provides a platform with the tools, runtime environments, and scalability options needed to develop, deploy, and manage applications efficiently.\n\nE.g.: \n- Google App Engine is a fully managed PaaS offering that allows developers to build and deploy applications without managing infrastructure. It provides automatic scaling based on traffic and integrates with other Google Cloud services for storage, databases, and machine learning.\nFeatures: Supports various programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, Go, Node.js), automatic scaling, built-in load balancing, and integrated monitoring tools."},{"timestamp":"1728411900.0","poster":"Dadadagreat","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1294837","content":"I agree answer is B for custom application PaaS"},{"poster":"7c3bc28","timestamp":"1725202080.0","content":"An organization wants to run their custom application in the cloud in a flexible and scalable way without managing any infrastructure.

Nothing. Sustained use discounts are automatically applied.\n\nSustained use discounts are automatically applied to Google Cloud Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) when they are used for a significant portion of the month (e.g., more than 25% of the month).\nThese discounts are automatic and do not require any action from the user, as long as the VMs are running for extended periods.","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1737504420.0","poster":"joshnort","content":"Why not the other options?\nA. Choose preemptible or spot instances when creating virtual machines:\nPreemptible instances offer a different type of discount (lower cost for instances that can be terminated by Google). However, sustained-use discounts are not linked to preemptible or spot instances.\n\nB. Choose low-powered virtual machines:\nWhile choosing smaller or less powerful VMs may reduce costs, the sustained-use discount applies regardless of VM size, as long as the instance runs for a significant portion of the month.\n\nD. Commit to virtual machine usage for a one or three-year period:\nThis describes committed use contracts, which are a separate discount model.

Commit to virtual machine usage for a one or three-year period.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\nSustained-use discounts: These discounts are offered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for consistent usage of virtual machines over a specified period.\nCommitment options: To qualify for sustained-use discounts, organizations can commit to using virtual machines for either one or three years. This commitment provides GCP with a predictable workload, allowing them to optimize resource allocation and offer discounted rates.","comment_id":"1291138","timestamp":"1727611440.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/148374-exam-cloud-digital-leader-topic-1-question-276-discussion/","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"R8own2fLnPeAllLXm8nD","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Phishing emails\n\nExplanation:\nPhishing emails are a common form of social engineering attack, where cybercriminals impersonate legitimate entities (e.g., a trusted organization or person) to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details. This is one of the most common methods used to exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.","poster":"joshnort","timestamp":"1737504720.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1344490","poster":"joshnort","content":"Why not the other options?\nA.
