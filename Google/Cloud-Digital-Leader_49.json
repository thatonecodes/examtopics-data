By creating a folder per department, you can logically group projects and enforce access controls and policies at the folder level. Within each folder, you can then create separate projects for each environment (development, testing, and production).

Create one project for the development environment and one project for the production environment.\n\nThis structure provides clear separation between the development and production environments, allowing for better management and control of resources. By having separate projects, you can enforce different access controls, configurations, and deployments for each environment. This ensures that changes made in the development environment do not impact the production environment.\n\nOption A and B suggest using a single project for all environments and relying on labels or tags to segregate resources. While labels and tags can be useful for organizing and categorizing resources, they may not provide the same level of isolation and control as separate projects.\n\nOption D suggests creating multiple projects for each environment, with separate projects for the development and production environments in each region.
