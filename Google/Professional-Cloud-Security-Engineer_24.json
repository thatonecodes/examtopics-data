This ensures consistent security policies and makes it easier to enforce changes uniformly.\n\nAllow Internal IP Ranges: By configuring the firewall policy to allow connections only from internal IP ranges, you are implementing a \"default deny\" rule for external traffic, which is a security best practice.
