Train a linear regression to predict a credit default risk score.\n\nHere's the rationale for this approach:\n\nAppropriate Model for Prediction: Linear regression is a common statistical method used for predictive modeling, particularly when the outcome variable (in this case, the likelihood of default) is continuous. In the context of credit scoring, linear regression can be used to predict a risk score that represents the probability of default.\n\nUtilization of Labeled Data: Since you already have a labeled dataset containing information on loans that have been granted and whether they have defaulted, you can use this data to train the regression model.

For example, consider a situation when you want to prevent a batch read job (workload A) from increasing CPU usage on clusters that handle an application's steady reads and writes (workload B). You can create an app profile for workload B that routes to a cluster group that excludes one cluster. Then you create an app profile for workload A that specifies single-cluster routing to the cluster that workload B doesn't send requests to.\n\nYou can change the settings for one application or function without affecting other applications that connect to the same data.\"\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/app-profiles","timestamp":"1702108380.0","comment_id":"1091501","upvote_count":"3","poster":"carbino"},{"comment_id":"870326","poster":"DevShah","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/replication-settings#batch-vs-serve","timestamp":"1681489200.0","comments":[{"poster":"A4M","comments":[{"poster":"zevexWM","content":"It actually addresses the issue of High availability in that same link if you scroll down a bit more. \nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/replication-settings#high-availability","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713950280.0","comment_id":"1201232"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1683187680.0","poster":"A4M","comment_id":"889284","content":"i meant single-cluster routing"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1683187620.0","comment_id":"889282","content":"I see what you say on C but the question states high availability how do you handle that with option C when you have a single region cluster hence answer needs to be with multi-region cluster - To configure your instance for a high availability (HA) use case, create a new app profile that uses multi-cluster routing, or update the default app profile to use multi-cluster routing."}],"upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"juliobs","comment_id":"849579","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
