Successful unit tests then prompt Cloud Build to construct and push the application container to a central registry. The pipeline subsequently orchestrates the deployment of the container to a testing environment, where comprehensive integration and acceptance tests are executed. Only when all tests pass successfully does the pipeline advance to deploying the application to the production environment, accompanied by the execution of smoke tests.\n\nThis systematic and thorough process ensures that any code changes undergo rigorous testing at various stages, ensuring high-quality standards and instilling confidence in the deployment process to production."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"PGontijo","timestamp":"1698084240.0","comment_id":"1052143","content":"You can use Cloud Build to build a container.
