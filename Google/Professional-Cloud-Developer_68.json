You can separate each tenant and their Kubernetes resources into their own namespaces. You can then use policies to enforce tenant isolation. Policies are usually scoped by namespace and can be used to restrict API access, to constrain resource usage, and to restrict what containers are allowed to do.","comment_id":"752481"},{"comment_id":"718541","poster":"ash_meharun","content":"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/multitenancy-overview#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a,the%20cluster%20operates.","timestamp":"1700029800.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/multitenancy-overview#network_policies\nAnswer B","poster":"TNT87","comment_id":"717785","timestamp":"1699949280.0"},{"comment_id":"649267","poster":"tomato123","timestamp":"1692511380.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct"},{"content":"B is correct","timestamp":"1684365120.0","comment_id":"603069","upvote_count":"1","poster":"szl0144"}],"timestamp":"2022-01-22 04:05:00","isMC":true,"question_id":336,"question_images":[],"question_text":"You are a SaaS provider deploying dedicated blogging software to customers in your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.
