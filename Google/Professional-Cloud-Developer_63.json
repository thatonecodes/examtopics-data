Configure the Cloud Storage bucket to trigger Cloud Pub/Sub notifications when objects are modified.\n\nHere's why:\n\nSimplicity and Ease of Implementation: This approach is the most straightforward and requires minimal effort. Cloud Storage offers built-in integration with Cloud Pub/Sub, allowing you to configure notifications directly within the bucket settings.\nNo Additional Code: You don't need to write any custom code or deploy additional applications. Cloud Storage handles the notification process automatically.\nScalability and Reliability: Cloud Pub/Sub is a highly scalable and reliable messaging service, ensuring that your notifications are delivered efficiently and reliably.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1721228940.0","content":"Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:\n\nB. Create an App Engine application to receive the file; when it is received, publish a message to the Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

In the Cloud Function, publish a message to the Cloud Pub/Sub topic. While Cloud Functions are a good option for event-driven tasks, this approach still requires you to write and deploy code, making it more complex than using built-in Cloud Storage notifications.\nD. Create an application deployed in a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster to receive the file; when it is received, publish a message to the Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

Configure the Cloud Storage bucket to trigger Cloud Pub/Sub notifications when objects are modified.\n\nThis solution is straightforward and requires minimal effort to implement. Google Cloud Storage offers native support for publishing messages to Cloud Pub/Sub topics in response to changes in your bucket, like uploading a new file. By configuring Cloud Storage to automatically send a message to a Pub/Sub topic when a new report is uploaded, you can easily set up a real-time notification system without the need to write and maintain additional code.","poster":"santoshchauhan"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1011908","timestamp":"1695184920.0","poster":"__rajan__"},{"timestamp":"1673170680.0","comment_id":"769244","upvote_count":"4","poster":"omermahgoub","content":"C.
