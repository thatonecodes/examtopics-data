Load Generation:\n • Compute Engine instance is preferred over local machine for scalability and network proximity to Google Cloud services.\n • Install Apache JMeter on the Compute Engine instance to generate controlled load on the Cloud Run service.\n 2. Logging and Data Capture:\n • Create a log sink to BigQuery for efficient structured, real-time ingestion of Cloud Run logs and metrics.\n • BigQuery is optimal for handling large volumes of data and supporting complex queries for performance analytics.\n 3. Analysis and Visualization:\n • Use Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to create interactive dashboards on top of BigQuery.\n • This enables custom, real-time analysis of latency, error rates, throughput, etc.","comment_id":"1399714","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742231100.0","poster":"saratk1984"},{"comment_id":"1296306","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSet up a Compute Engine instance, install JMeter on the instance, create a log sink to BigQuery, and use Looker Studio to analyze the results.","timestamp":"1728699840.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"anshad666"}],"question_id":206},{"id":"imSpEK6ZNZ5EytfWLFST","topic":"1","exam_id":7,"choices":{"D":"Configure BigQuery and use the BigQuery REST API in the app.","C":"Configure Cloud SQL and use the Google Client Library for Cloud SQL in the app.","A":"Configure Firestore and use the Firestore client library in the app.","B":"Configure Bigtable and use the Bigtable client in the app."},"question_id":207,"isMC":true,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2024-10-12 04:26:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/149108-exam-professional-cloud-developer-topic-1-question-285/","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1728699960,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_text":"You are designing a Node.js-based mobile news feed application that stores data on Google Cloud.
