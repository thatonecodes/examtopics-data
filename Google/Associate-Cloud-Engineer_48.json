As long as the VPC network is set up properly, the instances can communicate with each other using their internal IP addresses, regardless of the region.

The application is exposed using an internal load balancer, which allows the new instance to access the application using the load balancer's private IP address as the endpoint. This approach provides a secure and scalable way to connect instances across regions.
