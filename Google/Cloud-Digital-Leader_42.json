The refactored application is more efficient and scalable.\n\nExplanation:\nMoving to a microservices architecture involves breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services. This provides several key benefits, including:\n- Efficiency: Individual services can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently, which improves resource usage and operational flexibility.\n- Scalability: Services can be scaled based on their specific resource needs, enabling more efficient handling of varying workloads.","poster":"joshnort","timestamp":"1737508260.0","comment_id":"1344519","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1737508260.0","comment_id":"1344520","content":"Why not the other options?\nB.

This migration pattern provides the fastest path to the cloud:\nRefactoring to a microservices architecture is a time-intensive process, as it requires re-architecting the application.
