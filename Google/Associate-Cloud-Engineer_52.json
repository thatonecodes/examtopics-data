To test the new version with 1% of users, you can deploy the new version alongside the current version and then use the App Engine Traffic Splitting feature to gradually increase the percentage of users who are routed to the new version. This can be done easily using GCP Console.\n\nAnswers A and B are not the optimal solutions as Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine do not offer the same level of built-in traffic splitting and routing features as App Engine.\n\nAnswer C is also POSSIBLE but may not be the best approach since deploying a separate app requires additional configuration and maintenance.
