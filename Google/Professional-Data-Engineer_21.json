Instead, you can minimize storage costs by leveraging Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Cloud Dataproc seamlessly integrates with GCS through the Hadoop connector, allowing you to store your data cost-effectively in Cloud Storage and run ephemeral clusters that read data directly from GCS. This approach eliminates the need for each node to carry 50 TB of expensive persistent disk storage while still supporting your Hadoop workload.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1744286700.0","poster":"fassil"},{"comment_id":"1398857","poster":"Parandhaman_Margan","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742047140.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n.

Option B stores data in less efficient JSON format. Option C uses Dataproc which requires manual cluster management.\nSo leveraging Dataflow + Avro + Beam provides the most efficient way to stream proprietary flight data into BigQuery while using minimal resources."},{"poster":"Aman47","content":"Its talking about streaming? none of the options talk about triggering a load to begin.
