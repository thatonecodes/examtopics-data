IAM is Google Cloud's access control system for managing authentication and authorization for Google Cloud resources. You use IAM to grant users access to GKE and Kubernetes resources. RBAC is built into Kubernetes and grants granular permissions for specific resources and operations within your clusters.","poster":"CloudKida","timestamp":"1725611100.0"},{"timestamp":"1725373080.0","poster":"jacknguyen","comment_id":"997673","upvote_count":"1","content":"D is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption D is a good approach for creating the development and production environments for each team while minimizing costs and ensuring that different teams cannot access other teams' environments. This approach involves creating a Development and Production GKE cluster in separate GCP projects. In each cluster, a Kubernetes namespace is created per team. Then, Kubernetes Role-based access control (RBAC) is configured so that each team can only access its own namespace. This ensures that the teams are isolated from each other and can only access the resources they need, while minimizing costs by using the same clusters for different teams.","poster":"JonathanSJ","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"776904","timestamp":"1705341900.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"mudot","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAppeard in 7/11/2022 exam\n\nkeys : least no of clusters + separation","comment_id":"713785","timestamp":"1699443540.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"AzureDP900","comment_id":"703509","content":"D is correct","timestamp":"1698201780.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the answer.","comment_id":"702075","timestamp":"1698056460.0","poster":"zellck"},{"poster":"ssmb","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1697924940.0","content":"I vote for D as the correct answer, considering cost reduction is stated in the question.","comment_id":"701190"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"546455","timestamp":"1676293440.0","poster":"PhilipKoku","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD - Different project for Prod and UAT.
