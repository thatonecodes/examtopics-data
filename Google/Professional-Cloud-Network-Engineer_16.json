Create multiple Cloud VPN tunnels that use policy-based routing with 10 CIDR per tunnel as the remote traffic selectors.\n\nPolicy-based routing allows you to specify which traffic is sent over specific tunnels based on the local and remote traffic selectors (CIDR blocks). You can either create a single tunnel with 30 remote traffic selectors (option B) or create multiple tunnels, each with up to 10 remote traffic selectors (option D).\n\nOption A is incorrect because route-based VPNs require BGP, which your on-premises network does not support.\n\nOptions C and E are incorrect because they suggest creating a tunnel for each CIDR block, which would result in 30 tunnels. This is unnecessary and would increase complexity and management overhead.","timestamp":"1719856500.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nThe documentation points towards A+C: https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/concepts/choosing-networks-routing?hl=en#route-alignment\n\nFor A:\n\"Use a route-based VPN.

Create a single Cloud VPN tunnel that uses route-based VPN.\nThis method allows you to establish a single VPN tunnel between your on-premises network and Google Cloud. Route-based VPNs use static routes to determine which traffic should be sent over the VPN tunnel. You can configure static routes for each of the 30 CIDR ranges to ensure they are reachable.\n\nC. Create multiple Cloud VPN tunnels that use policy-based routing so that each tunnel has one CIDR block for its local traffic selector and one CIDR block for its remote traffic selector. Connect each tunnel to unique peer IP addresses.\nWith this approach, you create multiple VPN tunnels, each tunnel dedicated to a subset of the 30 CIDR ranges. Policy-based routing allows you to define specific routing policies for different traffic selectors. By connecting each tunnel to a unique peer IP address, you can ensure segregation of traffic and routing based on CIDR ranges.","upvote_count":"3"}],"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nThe correct methods are options A and C."}],"question_text":"You are configuring your organization's Google Cloud environment to connect to your on-premises network, which does not support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
