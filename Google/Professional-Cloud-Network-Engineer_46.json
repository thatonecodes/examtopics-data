However, Cloud NAT does not work if a VM has a route that directs its outbound traffic through a VPN tunnel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Add a default static route to the VPC with the default internet gateway as the next hop, the network tag associated with the Compute Engine instances, and a higher priority than the priority of the default route to the VPN tunnel. This option allows you to override the default route that directs all traffic through the VPN tunnel for only those instances that have a specific network tag.

The recommended approach is to have a Cloud Router in each region with one or more VLAN attachments connected to each metropolitan area.\n\nIn this case, you should create a Cloud Router in region 1 with one VLAN attachment connected to metro1-zone1-x and one VLAN attachment connected to metro1-zone2-x. Similarly, create a Cloud Router in region 2 with one VLAN attachment connected to metro2-zone1-x and one VLAN attachment to metro2-zone2-x.
