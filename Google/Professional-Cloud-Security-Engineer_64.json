However, it does not require encryption keys. This makes it possible for a malicious actor to use a brute force attack to determine the original value, by running all possible original values through the SHA-256 algorithm and seeing which one produces a hash that matches the hash returned by data masking.","timestamp":"1707711480.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1706263740.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD, as tokenization supports re-identification for the HR team","comment_id":"788601","poster":"pedrojorge"},{"comment_id":"776892","poster":"therealsohail","timestamp":"1705340940.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"B is okay\nData redaction, as opposed to data masking or tokenization, completely removes or replaces the sensitive fields, making it so that the operations teams cannot see the sensitive information.
