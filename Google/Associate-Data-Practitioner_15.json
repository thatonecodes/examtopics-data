Design the processing as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Cloud Composer. Clear the state of the failed task after correcting any stage output data errors. Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow) is specifically designed for orchestrating complex data pipelines, provides robust error handling with task-level rerun capabilities for efficient recovery, and offers a fully managed and scheduled environment, making it the most suitable choice for ensuring the final output is generated as quickly as possible in the face of occasional stage failures. Options A, B, and C are less efficient due to manual intervention, less granular error recovery, or lack of dedicated workflow orchestration features.","poster":"n2183712847","timestamp":"1740678840.0"}],"question_id":72,"exam_id":2,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1740678840,"question_text":"You are designing a pipeline to process data files that arrive in Cloud Storage by 3:00 am each day.
