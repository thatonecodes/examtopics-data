When adding new instances, it is important to ensure that only the necessary number of instances are added to the instance group and that the group size is properly maintained to prevent overprovisioning and unnecessary costs.\n\nIn this scenario, the instance group is adding more instances than necessary when autoscaling due to the initial delay of HTTP health checks. Increasing the initial delay to 200 seconds will ensure that the health check properly reflects the actual availability of the instances and prevent overprovisioning.\n\nAnswers A and B limit the maximum number of instances, which could cause issues when scaling to support higher levels of end-user traffic.\n\nAnswer C suggests using a TCP health check instead of an HTTP health check, but it does not address the issue of overprovisioning when autoscaling.","upvote_count":"10"},{"timestamp":"1666534620.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIncrease the initial delay","upvote_count":"1","poster":"leogor","comment_id":"702246"},{"comment_id":"667180","poster":"ale_brd_111","timestamp":"1662997380.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct answer."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1659798060.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIncrease initial delay","poster":"abirroy","comment_id":"643435"},{"poster":"GouseBasha","content":"D is correct one","comment_id":"626387","timestamp":"1656817680.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1655925900.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"620582","content":"D is more appropriate for this question","poster":"AzureDP900"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"haroldbenites","timestamp":"1654042860.0","comment_id":"609946","content":"Go for D"},{"timestamp":"1653557520.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"haroldbenites","comment_id":"607560","content":"Go for D"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nlogically first 3 options are out of context, so d is right","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Ram_krishna","comment_id":"570490","timestamp":"1647603480.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1637305500.0","content":"D.
