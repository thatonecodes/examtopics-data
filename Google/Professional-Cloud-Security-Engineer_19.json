Generate Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) level 3 assurance by using Cloud Build and view the build provenance in the Security insights side panel within the Google Cloud console.\n\nSLSA (pronounced “salsa”) is an end-to-end framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts throughout the software supply chain. The SLSA assurance levels provide a scalable compromise between the security benefits and the implementation costs. Level 3 is recommended for moderately to highly critical software and should provide strong, provenance-based security guarantees."},{"poster":"cyberpunk21","timestamp":"1708771320.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"989005","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD it is"},{"comment_id":"979945","poster":"akg001","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.","timestamp":"1707828540.0"},{"content":"D is correct, I think?","comment_id":"970490","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Sanjana2020","timestamp":"1706908440.0"}],"choices":{"A":"1.

By using VM Manager’s OS patch management service, you can ensure that your VMs are always up-to-date with the latest patches.","comment_id":"1098819","poster":"i_am_robot","timestamp":"1718614620.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nVM Manager is a suite of tools that can be used to manage operating systems for large virtual machine (VM) fleets running Windows and Linux on Compute Engine. It helps drive efficiency through automation and reduces the operational burden of maintaining these VM fleets. VM Manager includes several services such as OS patch management, OS inventory management, and OS configuration management. By using VM Manager, you can apply patches, collect operating system information, and install, remove, or auto-update software packages. The suite provides a high level of control and automation for managing large VM fleets on Google Cloud.","poster":"Xoxoo","comment_id":"1010928","timestamp":"1710814260.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"cyberpunk21","comment_id":"989006","timestamp":"1708771440.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct using VM manager we can patch all the VM's"},{"poster":"pfilourenco","timestamp":"1707083460.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the correct","comment_id":"972458","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1706899020.0","content":"A- validate egress firewall rules","poster":"Sanjana2020","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"970376"},{"comment_id":"970035","timestamp":"1706876520.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nVM manager is a suite of tools used to automate managing of the fleet of VMs (including OS patching)\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vm-manager","poster":"a190d62"},{"poster":"K1SMM","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"969958","timestamp":"1706871660.0","content":"D vm doesn’t need ip public on cloud nat"}],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_id":92,"isMC":true,"exam_id":9},{"id":"Gif4IiEaxcn7DzjFivVK","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1098823","poster":"i_am_robot","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1718614800.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe best option would be D.

It can provide information about the patch state of a VM, including which patches are installed, which patches are available, and the severity of the patches. This would allow you to quickly identify VMs that have critical OS security updates available but not installed."},{"comment_id":"1018679","poster":"gkarthik1919","timestamp":"1711540740.0","content":"D is correct. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vm-manager","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1708771860.0","poster":"cyberpunk21","comment_id":"989010","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.

Use date shifting with the context set to the unique ID of the test subject.\n\nDate shifting is a technique used to obfuscate date data by shifting all dates in a dataset by a random number of days, while preserving the intervals between the dates. By setting the context to the unique ID of the test subject, you ensure that the same random shift is applied to all dates for a given test subject, preserving the interval data. This method effectively obfuscates the specific dates, reducing the risk of bias, while still allowing for meaningful analysis of the data."},{"comment_id":"1010935","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption A and D works, but the focus here is to preserve the interval data. \n\nSo option A is more suited in this case.\n\n\"Date shifting techniques randomly shift a set of dates but preserve the sequence and duration of a period of time.
