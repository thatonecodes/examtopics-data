On the App Engine Versions page of the GCP Console, route 100% of the traffic to the previous version.\n\nTo immediately revert to the prior version of an application in App Engine, you can route 100% of the traffic to the previous version. This can be done through the App Engine Versions page of the GCP Console by selecting the desired version and selecting \"Migrate traffic\" and moving the slider to 100%. This will ensure that all traffic is directed to the prior version until the bug is fixed and the new version can be safely redeployed.\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/migrating-traffic\n\nANSWER A (Run gcloud app restore) and ANSWER B (Click Revert on GCP Console) are not valid actions to revert to the prior version of the application. ANSWER D (Deploy the original version as a separate application) is not necessary and would complicate the environment by requiring a split traffic configuration.","comment_id":"814503","upvote_count":"7","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","timestamp":"1676838600.0"},{"poster":"public_figure","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNO NEED OF REDEPLOY","comment_id":"759088","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1672177380.0"},{"comments":[{"poster":"Nikki2424","timestamp":"1715846460.0","comment_id":"1212341","upvote_count":"1","content":"The most voted"}],"content":"which ans need to take most voted or correct option pls suggest","timestamp":"1671614100.0","poster":"bhavyach","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"752055"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\ncorrect is C","comment_id":"736085","poster":"cslince","timestamp":"1670256540.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nroute 100% of the traffic to the previous version","upvote_count":"2","poster":"leogor","timestamp":"1666617060.0","comment_id":"703044"},{"comment_id":"663776","upvote_count":"2","content":"Correct option is C.\nAppEngine already creates a version for you.

CORRECT. Create an instance template for the instances. Set the 'Automatic Restart' to on. Set the 'On-host maintenance' to Migrate VM instance.

This will allow your instance to restart in the event of a crash. \n\nAdditionally, you should set the 'On-host maintenance' to Migrate VM instance so that VM instances are live migrated to another host in the event of an infrastructure maintenance event. \n\nThe instance group should have a health check configured to verify that the instances are healthy.

The VM needs to be stopped before making this change, and then it can be restarted.\n\nWhy not other options?\nA (Live migration): Live migration moves workloads during maintenance but does not change the VM's memory allocation.\nB (Metadata change): Adding metadata does not affect memory allocation.\nD (Directly increasing memory): You cannot manually increase only the memory of a VM; you must select a predefined machine type.","poster":"warbon","timestamp":"1737719280.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1307198","upvote_count":"1","poster":"martin2099","content":"C.

Then, you can increase the memory of the VM by editing the machine type and selecting a machine type with more memory. Once you have made the change, you can start the VM again.\n\nANSWER A is not the best approach as it relies on live migration which can be a risky operation.\n\nANSWER B is incorrect because adding metadata to the VM will not change the amount of memory allocated to the VM.\n\nANSWER C is incorrect because changing the machine type to n1-standard-8 would also increase the number of vCPUs to 8, which may not be necessary and could result in overprovisioning of resources. In addition, changing the machine type would also affect the cost of the VM instance, which may not be desired.
