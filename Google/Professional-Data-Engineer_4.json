When you subscribe to a listing, a linked dataset is created in your project.\n\n As an Analytics Hub viewer, you can browse through the datasets that you have access to in Analytics Hub and request the publisher to access the shared data.\n\n As an Analytics Hub administrator, you can create data exchanges that enable data sharing, and then give permissions to data publishers and subscribers to access these data exchanges.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction"}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-09-02 17:00:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1"},{"id":"S85ucUWl88rfxEhw0lhZ","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1662179100,"question_id":20,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/79672-exam-professional-data-engineer-topic-1-question-116/","answer_ET":"BD","choices":{"B":"Insert each new CDC record and corresponding operation type to a staging table in real time.","C":"Periodically DELETE outdated records from the reporting table.","E":"Insert each new CDC record and corresponding operation type in real time to the reporting table, and use a materialized view to expose only the newest version of each unique record.","A":"Perform a DML INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to replicate each individual CDC record in real time directly on the reporting table.","D":"Periodically use a DML MERGE to perform several DML INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations at the same time on the reporting table."},"question_images":[],"answer":"BD","exam_id":11,"question_text":"Your company is in the process of migrating its on-premises data warehousing solutions to BigQuery.
