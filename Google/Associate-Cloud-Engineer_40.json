This ensures that pods have enough resources to run efficiently without being over-provisioned, which can lead to wasted resources and higher costs.\n\nAutomated Optimization: VPA continuously monitors the resource usage of your pods and recommends optimal settings. You can choose to apply these recommendations automatically or manually, giving you flexibility and control over the process.\n\nMicroservice-Specific Tuning: By configuring a VPA for each microservice, you can fine-tune the resource allocation for each individual service based on its specific needs and usage patterns. This is more efficient than making blanket changes to the entire cluster or node pool.","poster":"RuchiMishra"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"It is A\nOption A: Configure a Vertical Pod Autoscaler for each microservice is the best solution because the VPA automatically adjusts the resource requests and limits for each microservice, ensuring that memory and CPU resources are correctly sized according to their actual usage patterns.

INFORMATION_SCHEMA Views: BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA provides metadata about datasets, tables, and jobs. Relevant views like JOBS_BY_PROJECT and JOBS_BY_USER can help you analyze recent queries, their resource consumption (bytes processed, slots used), and any errors encountered. This can reveal which queries are exceeding quotas and what type of quota (e.g., query size, daily limit) is being exceeded.\n\nD. Cloud Audit Logs: Audit logs record all API calls and administrative actions within your GCP projects.

When a new request arrives, a new instance is spun up, leading to a cold start. During this cold start, multiple API calls might be made to initialize the application and connect to the Cloud SQL database. If there's a sudden spike in traffic, a large number of cold starts can occur simultaneously, exceeding the Cloud SQL API quota.\n\nMinimum Instances: By setting a minimum number of Cloud Run instances, you can ensure that a few instances are always running, even during periods of low traffic.
