This gives you the opportunity to leave an older version of the application running while new indexes are being built, or to revert to the older version immediately if a problem is discovered with a newer version.\n\nWhen you are sure that old indexes are no longer needed, you can delete them by using the datastore indexes cleanup command. This command deletes all indexes for the production Datastore mode instance that are not mentioned in the local version of index.yaml.
