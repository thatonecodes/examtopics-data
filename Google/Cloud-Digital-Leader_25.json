Use BigQuery ML and create models using SQL.\n\nBigQuery ML is the best choice for organizations without a data science team but with in-house database administration skills. Here's why:\n\n- SQL-based modeling: BigQuery ML allows users to create and deploy machine learning models using simple SQL queries, which database administrators are already familiar with.\n- Ease of use: It eliminates the need to learn programming languages like Python or frameworks like TensorFlow.\n- Integrated with BigQuery: It works directly with data stored in BigQuery, making it easy to analyze and predict trends like property popularity.\n- Quick setup: Organizations can rapidly build, train, and deploy models without specialized expertise.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736016120.0"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Use BigQuery ML and create models using SQL.","D":"Build a model in AutoML using labeled data.","A":"Use custom training in Vertex AI with TensorFlow.","B":"Integrate pre-trained APIs into their application."},"question_id":121,"exam_id":3,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1714451820,"question_text":"A vacation home rental organization wants to predict the popularity of properties in their upcoming busy season.
