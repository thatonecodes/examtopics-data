It automatically scales the number of instances based on request rate, but it does not allow you to specify the minimum number of idle instances. This means that there is no guarantee that there will always be at least 3 instances available to handle new requests.\nC. The max_instances setting specifies the maximum number of instances to keep running. By setting max_instances to 3, you are limiting the number of instances that your application can scale to. This is not ideal, especially if your application experiences sudden spikes in traffic.","timestamp":"1727163120.0","poster":"YourCloudGuru"},{"comment_id":"783643","timestamp":"1727163120.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
