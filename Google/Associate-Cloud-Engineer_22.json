A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. Organizations can use folders to group projects under the organization node in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Google Cloud resources. Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies. While a folder can contain multiple folders or resources, a given folder or resource can have exactly one parent.\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders","comment_id":"690454","upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1696876500.0","poster":"Charumathi"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1061984","poster":"jimmydice","content":"B: Folders in Google Cloud provide a way to organize resources hierarchically and apply common IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies at the folder level.

It exchanges network topology information through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Cloud Router advertises subnets from its VPC network to another router or gateway via BGP. This is great for setting up VPN between the cloud and on-prem, as topology changes automatically propagate with no manual intervention and higher redundancy for your systems.\n\n\nYou now have:\n\nDiscovery of remote networks\nMaintaining up-to-date routing information\nChoosing the best path to destination networks\nAbility to find a new best path if the current path is no longer available\nAnd a great side effect can be lower latency because Cloud Router learns routes through BGP which allows for optimal data paths to reach its destination, whether that be another network or a VPN gateway to on-premise.
