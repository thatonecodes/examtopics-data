The SLI for availability is defined as follows:\nThe proportion of valid requests served successfully. (good request / total request)\n\nThe SLI for latency (sometimes called speed) indicates whether the service is fast enough. \nThe proportion of valid requests served faster than a threshold.\nLatency is commonly measured as a distribution. Given a distribution, you can measure various percentiles. For example, you might measure the number of requests that are slower than the historical 99th percentile. In this case, we consider good events to be events that are faster than this threshold, which was set by examining the historical distribution. You can also set this threshold based on product requirements. You can even set multiple latency SLOs, for example typical latency versus tail latency.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1642520160.0","comment_id":"408971","upvote_count":"3","content":"The correct answer is \"C\", you can confirm it here, https://sre.google/workbook/slo-document/\n\nLatency\n\nThe proportion of sufficiently fast requests, as measured from the load balancer metrics.\n\n“Sufficiently fast” is defined as < 400 ms, or < 850 ms.\n\ncount of \"api\" http_requests with\na duration less than or equal to\n\"0.4\" seconds\ndivided by\ncount of all \"api\" http_requests","poster":"Dark_Lord"},{"content":"and if this is not enough for you check how google calculate Availability and latency\n\nAvailability\n\nsum(rate(http_requests_total{host=\"api\", status!~\"5..\"}[7d]))\n/\nsum(rate(http_requests_total{host=\"api\"}[7d])\n\nLatency\nhistogram_quantile(0.9, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[7d]))\nhistogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[7d]))\n\nhttps://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/\nhttps://cloud.google.com/architecture/adopting-slos/","upvote_count":"1","poster":"francisco_guerra","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1658824080.0","comment_id":"532789","content":"The commands shared create a histogram that demonstrates the latency distribution for 90 and 99 % of the requests.
