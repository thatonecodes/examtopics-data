By changing the selector to include the version label, you effectively roll back the traffic to the working version, providing a quick and effective solution to address the user request failures observed after the update to app-green.\n\nThis enables developers to investigate and troubleshoot the issue in a controlled manner without affecting user experience, and it serves as an interim solution while further investigation and remediation are carried out.","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1731675000.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"pharao89","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's a simplified question from CKAD exam.

Subsequently, creating a logs-based metric allows you to define a metric based on the extracted information from the logs, specifically focusing on the number of requests from the suspicious IP address. This setup minimizes operational overhead by leveraging existing infrastructure and provides a streamlined way to monitor and analyze the targeted metric related to the suspicious activity, aiding in swift detection and response to potential security issues.","timestamp":"1717655280.0","comment_id":"1089083"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\na log based metric is nescessary","comment_id":"1189217","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728034740.0","poster":"R00tsr0ck"},{"poster":"LaxmanTiwari","timestamp":"1718897400.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/configuration#logging-receivers fluent_forward section","comment_id":"1101788","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1718733960.0","comment_id":"1100013","poster":"Raz0r","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nExactly what user xhilmi said."},{"poster":"pharao89","timestamp":"1715776260.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAs the question asks \"to view the number of requests,\" I would go with A since there is a crucial thing: \"Create a logs-based metric\".","comment_id":"1071543"},{"comment_id":"1070575","timestamp":"1715693760.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"khoukha","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/configuration#logging-receivers\nfluent_forward section"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nメトリクスレシーバーでは、hostmetricsしか選択することができない。これにはIPアドレスはふくまれていない。よってDは候補から外れる。私はAを選択する。\nhttps://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/configuration","poster":"YushiSato","timestamp":"1714939020.0","comment_id":"1063321","comments":[{"upvote_count":"4","content":"In the metrics receiver, only hostmetrics can be selected.
