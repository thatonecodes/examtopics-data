Open standards\n\nVendor lock-in occurs when an organization becomes dependent on a specific cloud provider’s technology, making it difficult to migrate to another provider without significant costs or effort. Leveraging open standards helps mitigate this concern because:\n\n- Open standards are platform-agnostic and ensure compatibility between different cloud providers.\n- They promote interoperability, allowing organizations to move workloads or data across providers without significant rework.\n- By using open standards, organizations avoid proprietary technologies that tie them to a specific vendor.\n\nWhile the other options (B, C, and D) may offer benefits, they do not directly address the concern of vendor lock-in."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nBy using Open Standards, a solution can easily be moved to other public cloud providers that support open standards.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732046220.0","poster":"IsraelDC1","comment_id":"1314888"},{"comment_id":"1204335","poster":"Vivek007","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1714452900.0","content":"A: Use Open Standards and Technologies\nAdopting open standards and technologies ensures that the organization's systems and data can be easily ported to different platforms.
