Create a Colab Enterprise notebook and connect the notebook to BigQuery. Share the notebook with your team. Analyze the data and generate visualizations in Colab Enterprise. Option A is best because Colab Enterprise provides a managed, collaborative Python environment directly connected to BigQuery, ideal for complex stats, Python packages, and visualizations. Option B (BigQuery ML & Looker Studio) is incorrect because BigQuery ML has limited statistical scope compared to Python, and Looker Studio is less suited for code-based analysis. Option C (Looker Studio dashboard) is incorrect because Looker Studio excels at dashboards, not complex Python analysis or statistical coding. Option D (Google Sheets) is incorrect because Sheets is not designed for large datasets or complex analysis requiring Python packages. Therefore, Option A, Colab Enterprise, best suits the need for a managed Python-based collaborative analysis environment for BigQuery data.","poster":"n2183712847","comment_id":"1365711","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741234080.0"}],"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/157630-exam-associate-data-practitioner-topic-1-question-64/","unix_timestamp":1741234080},{"id":"e2CQ6H8iBGy4sRypETun","exam_id":2,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/157631-exam-associate-data-practitioner-topic-1-question-65/","question_text":"Your organization has several datasets in BigQuery.

Use the existing data pipeline tool’s BigQuery connector. Option C is best because leveraging existing tools and their BigQuery connectors is generally the fastest migration path. Reconfiguring existing mappings is more direct than introducing new services or intermediate steps, optimizing migration speed. Option A (Temporary file system and Storage Transfer Service) is incorrect because adding Cloud Storage as an intermediary step slows down migration compared to direct transfer. Option B (Cloud Data Fusion) is incorrect because building new pipelines in Data Fusion adds complexity and time, less optimal for speed if connectors already exist. Option D (BigQuery Data Transfer Service) is incorrect because Data Transfer Service is for scheduled transfers, not necessarily the fastest for a one-time bulk migration compared to direct connector usage.

BigQuery Data Transfer Service (DTS) for both.

Option B (Storage Transfer + Dataflow) is incorrect because it's overly complex, involving multiple services and not low-code. Storage Transfer Service isn't for Google Ads data directly.
