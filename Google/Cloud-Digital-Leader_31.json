Establish an effective data governance program.\n\nA data governance program will help the organization ensure that its data is properly managed, secure, and compliant with regulatory requirements. It can help improve the value of the data by ensuring it's accessible and used appropriately, enhance cost controls by optimizing data storage and usage, and strengthen regulatory compliance by ensuring data is handled in accordance with legal and industry standards.","comments":[{"content":"The other options are not as comprehensive or appropriate for the goal:\n\n- A. Delete data stored for over a year: While this might help reduce storage costs, deleting data without a strategy could lead to the loss of valuable information and is not a comprehensive approach to governance or compliance.\n- B. Export relational data to modern NoSQL databases: This could be useful for certain use cases, but it's not necessarily tied to improving data value, cost control, or compliance.\n- C.

It’s important to distinguish between the latency of successful requests and the latency of failed requests. For example, an HTTP 500 error triggered due to loss of connection to a database or other critical backend might be served very quickly; however, as an HTTP 500 error indicates a failed request, factoring 500s into your overall latency might result in misleading calculations. On the other hand, a slow error is even worse than a fast error! Therefore, it’s important to track error latency, as opposed to just filtering out errors."}],"question_text":"An organization is concerned that one of their applications takes too long to return a result.
