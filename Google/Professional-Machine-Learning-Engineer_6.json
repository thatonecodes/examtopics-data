However, it might not be the sole or most appropriate metric for a complex task like image segmentation in self-driving cars.

Gradients become small and vanish while backpropagating from the output to input nodes.\n\nThis issue is known as the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur during the training of deep neural networks. In highly congested traffic scenes, there might be complex patterns and details that the image segmentation model needs to capture. However, if the model architecture is too deep and the gradients become very small during backpropagation, the model may struggle to update its weights effectively to learn these complex patterns. As a result, the model may fail to correctly segment objects in congested traffic scenes, leading to a decrease in performance.\n\nVanishing gradients can prevent the model from effectively learning representations and features in the deeper layers of the network. It's possible that the model is working fine in less congested areas because the patterns are simpler and easier to learn, allowing the gradients to propagate more effectively."},{"timestamp":"1683627540.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"892979","poster":"M25","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWent with A"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1681765440.0","comment_id":"873089","comments":[],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe most likely reason for this result is the model is overfitting in areas with less traffic and underfitting in areas with more traffic.\n\nProbably because the model was trained on a dataset that did not have enough examples of congested traffic.
