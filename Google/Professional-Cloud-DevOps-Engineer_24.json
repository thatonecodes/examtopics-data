The first step should be to roll back the experimental canary release.

Depending on your GKE cluster master version, either fluentd or fluentbit are used to collect logs. Starting from GKE 1.17, logs are collected using a fluentbit-based agent. GKE clusters using versions prior to GKE 1.17 use a fluentd-based agent. If you want to alter the default behavior of the fluentdagents, then you can run a customized fluentd agent or a customized fluentbit agent.\n\nCommon use cases include:\nremoving sensitive data from your logs\ncollecting additional logs not written to STDOUT or STDERR\nusing specific performance-related settings\ncustomized log formatting","comment_id":"727734"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"AzureDP900","comment_id":"707444","timestamp":"1682797980.0","content":"B is right answer"},{"comment_id":"702983","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.","timestamp":"1682337240.0","poster":"zellck"},{"content":"B is looks perfect","timestamp":"1682276880.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AzureDP900","comment_id":"702411"},{"content":"B is correct.\nC and D is wrong as it is against the SRE policy of Blameless postmortem.\nA is wrong as these actions cannot be shared with just manager","timestamp":"1676177040.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"645692","poster":"amanp"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"GCP72","timestamp":"1674537420.0","comment_id":"635861","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is B"},{"timestamp":"1668015300.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSubmitted B in the exam.
