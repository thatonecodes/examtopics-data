Depending on your GKE cluster master version, either fluentd or fluentbit are used to collect logs. Starting from GKE 1.17, logs are collected using a fluentbit-based agent. GKE clusters using versions prior to GKE 1.17 use a fluentd-based agent. If you want to alter the default behavior of the fluentdagents, then you can run a customized fluentd agent or a customized fluentbit agent.\n\nCommon use cases include:\nremoving sensitive data from your logs\ncollecting additional logs not written to STDOUT or STDERR\nusing specific performance-related settings\ncustomized log formatting","comment_id":"727734"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"AzureDP900","comment_id":"707444","timestamp":"1682797980.0","content":"B is right answer"},{"comment_id":"702983","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.","timestamp":"1682337240.0","poster":"zellck"},{"content":"B is looks perfect","timestamp":"1682276880.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AzureDP900","comment_id":"702411"},{"content":"B is correct.\nC and D is wrong as it is against the SRE policy of Blameless postmortem.\nA is wrong as these actions cannot be shared with just manager","timestamp":"1676177040.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"645692","poster":"amanp"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"GCP72","timestamp":"1674537420.0","comment_id":"635861","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is B"},{"timestamp":"1668015300.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSubmitted B in the exam.
