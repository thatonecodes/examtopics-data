Compression algorithms work by identifying and reducing redundancy in data, making it highly effective for backup files, which often contain large amounts of repetitive or static data.","comment_id":"1365354"},{"content":"B. User backups: User backups typically contain a variety of file types, many of which (such as text documents, spreadsheets, and other office files) can be highly compressible.

Generally, file types that contain repetitive patterns or redundant information benefit the most from compression because they can be significantly reduced in size. \n\nOut of all of the options only the relational database has data that is FOR SURE repeated (because its relational).","poster":"TheFivePips"},{"poster":"kuzummjakk","timestamp":"1709518440.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nChatGPT can get stuff wrong btw.

Small disk size, but more compute to read the data. Typically you only compress stuff that will be in storage and not read that much.
