Proxy\nReason: A proxy server can help anonymize user activity by routing requests through an intermediary server, thus providing a layer of privacy and often encrypting data in transit.\nB. Tunneling\nReason: Tunneling protocols (such as VPN) create secure, encrypted connections between the device and a remote server, ensuring that user data is protected and hidden from external observers.","poster":"ChopSNap"}],"timestamp":"2024-07-16 22:54:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following should be established when configuring a mobile device to protect user internet privacy, to ensure the connection is encrypted, and to keep user activity hidden?

It’s more of a reactive measure.","poster":"ChopSNap","comment_id":"1249241"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAddress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a security technique used to prevent exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, such as those exploited by return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. ASLR randomizes the memory addresses used by system and application processes, making it much harder for an attacker to predict the location of specific functions, system libraries, and other code that could be leveraged in an attack. This randomness forces attackers to guess memory locations, which significantly increases the difficulty of successfully executing an ROP attack.","poster":"isaphiltrick","comment_id":"1243403","timestamp":"1720275420.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_text":"A security team is concerned with attacks that are taking advantage of return-oriented programming against the company's public-facing applications.
