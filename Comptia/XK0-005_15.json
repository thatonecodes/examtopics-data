The keys are always strings, enclosed in double quotes, followed by a colon, and then the value.\n\nValues in JSON can be of several types, including strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects. String values are enclosed in double quotes, numeric values do not need quotes, and boolean values are true or false. Null values are represented as the null keyword.\n\nArrays are a collection of values, enclosed in square brackets [ ], and separated by commas. Objects are a collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces { }, and separated by commas. Objects can be nested within other objects, and arrays can contain other arrays or objects.","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"807944","timestamp":"1723587240.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1676333640,"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","exam_id":371,"timestamp":"2023-02-14 01:14:00"},{"id":"PDTRUfd13qSlkUJMebP4","topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"PKI","B":"SELinux","C":"PAM","A":"Kerberos"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"820943","poster":"nixonbii","upvote_count":"1","content":"C is correct, but so is A.

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)\n\nExplanation:\n\nPAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a framework that allows the integration of multiple authentication schemes for Linux systems. It provides a way for administrators to configure and enforce MFA for user authentication by enabling the use of multiple factors, such as passwords, smart cards, biometrics, and others.\n\nPAM allows the configuration of authentication policies for different services and applications running on a Linux system. This makes it possible to implement MFA for specific applications or services, rather than applying it to the entire system. Additionally, PAM allows administrators to configure different authentication methods for different users or user groups, depending on their access requirements.","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1723587360.0","comment_id":"807946","upvote_count":"4","comments":[{"poster":"linux_admin","content":"Kerberos is a network authentication protocol used for single sign-on (SSO), but it does not provide MFA capabilities.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723587420.0","comment_id":"807947"}]},{"poster":"KnifeClown1","comment_id":"803140","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723195860.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) enables administrators to configure and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on a Linux system. PAM is a modular architecture that allows system administrators to specify how authentication should be performed on their systems, including the use of MFA. This can be achieved by adding additional modules to the PAM configuration, such as modules for OTPs, smart cards, or biometric authentication. PAM can also be used to integrate with external authentication systems, such as LDAP, Kerberos, or RADIUS, to enforce MFA for authentication to various services on the Linux system."},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"730038","timestamp":"1716958860.0","poster":"Nvoid","content":"Selected Answer: C\nChoosing C here."},{"poster":"SaadiaS","timestamp":"1716378960.0","comment_id":"724357","content":"C is correct.
