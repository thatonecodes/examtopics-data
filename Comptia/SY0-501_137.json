It is one of the best-known software security vulnerabilities yet remains fairly common. This is partly because buffer overflows can occur in various ways and the techniques used to prevent them are often error-prone.\n\nThe software error focuses on buffers, which are sequential sections of computing memory that hold data temporarily as it is transferred between locations. Also known as a buffer overrun, buffer overflow occurs when the amount of data in the buffer exceeds its storage capacity. That extra data overflows into adjacent memory locations and corrupts or overwrites the data in those locations.","poster":"fonka","timestamp":"1625131440.0"},{"timestamp":"1620084600.0","comment_id":"349014","content":"B is correct.
