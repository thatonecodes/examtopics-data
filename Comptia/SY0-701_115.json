If the software has vulnerabilities, these can be exploited by attackers, especially when exposed to the internet or external networks.\n• Exploitation Potential: Known vulnerabilities in software can be easily targeted by attackers using automated tools to scan and exploit open ports.\n•Immediate Security Concern: The primary concern with opening ports is exposing internal systems to external attacks, making any vulnerabilities in the software a direct threat.","comment_id":"1259859","poster":"dbrowndiver"},{"timestamp":"1719127680.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1235718","content":"Selected Answer: D\nVulnerable software","poster":"f26ddcd"},{"content":"C......A supply chain vendor is a third-party entity that provides goods or services to an organization, such as a SaaS provider. A supply chain vendor can pose a risk to the new system if the vendor has poor security practices, breaches, or compromises that could affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system or its data. The organization should perform due diligence and establish a service level agreement with the vendor to mitigate this risk. The other options are not specific to the scenario of using a SaaS provider, but rather general risks that could apply to any system.","comment_id":"1232142","upvote_count":"1","poster":"geocis","timestamp":"1718663460.0"},{"timestamp":"1717670100.0","comment_id":"1225376","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Shaman73","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think D"},{"poster":"MAKOhunter33333333","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt asks about the risk inside the new system which makes me think what the new system is deploying,, software.","comment_id":"1214938","timestamp":"1716295380.0"},{"timestamp":"1715974320.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think the question is trying to figure out if you know what SaaS means and if you can figure out it's \"Software\" as a Service they expect you to pick \"Vulnerable software\".

Vulnerable software\nDeploying a new system supported by a SaaS (Software as a Service) provider can introduce risks related to vulnerable software. If the software being deployed has known vulnerabilities or weaknesses, it can expose the system to security threats such as exploitation by attackers. Therefore, ensuring that the software is up-to-date with security patches and configurations is crucial to mitigate this risk.","timestamp":"1715432400.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"name":"SY0-701","id":368,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":581,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":115},"__N_SSP":true}
