This is a source of vulnerabilities because updating this software cannot normally be done automatically or even centrally. The patching and updating, which is pretty infrequent to begin with, typically requires that the device be brought offline and manually updated by a qualified technician. Between the cost and effort involved and the effects of interrupting business processes, it should not come as a surprise to learn that many ICS components are never updated or patched. To make matters worse, vendors are notorious for not providing patches at all, even when vulnerabilities are discovered and made public. In its 2016 report on ICS security, FireEye described how 516 of the 1552 known ICS vulnerabilities had no patch available.\""}],"timestamp":"1593161220.0","comment_id":"120337"}],"content":"I think this is C.","upvote_count":"9","comment_id":"108217","timestamp":"1591924320.0","poster":"s3curity1"},{"content":"This question was on the exam (october-2020)","poster":"rodya2020","comment_id":"198827","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1602539040.0"}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/22279-exam-cs0-001-topic-1-question-363-discussion/","exam_id":345},{"id":"SR9RQ0vHtSlL2Tua35Ek","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-03-02 08:44:00","answer":"B","exam_id":345,"choices":{"B":"Government and industry regulations","A":"Total number of records stolen","C":"Impact on the reputation of the company's name/brand","D":"Monetary value of data stolen"},"answer_ET":"B","question_id":180,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/45778-exam-cs0-001-topic-1-question-364-discussion/","question_text":"A company office was broken into over the weekend.
