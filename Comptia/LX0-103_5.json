To dynamically change the size of logical volumes.\nD. To create snapshots.\nE. To dynamically create or delete logical volumes.\n\nLVM is a tool that provides logical volume management for Linux systems. It allows you to manage disk storage as a group of logical volumes, rather than as individual disk partitions. This makes it easier to allocate, manage, and resize disk storage dynamically.\n\nWith LVM, you can dynamically change the size of logical volumes, create snapshots (read-only copies of a volume that can be used for backup or disaster recovery purposes), and dynamically create or delete logical volumes as needed. This makes it easy to manage disk storage for growing data needs and to respond to changing requirements.\n\nLVM does not provide RAID functionality, so it cannot be used to create RAID arrays. It also does not provide encryption functionality, so it cannot be used to encrypt logical volumes. However, logical volumes managed by LVM can be encrypted using other tools and methods.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"805826","timestamp":"1676164500.0"}],"exam_id":353,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"E":"To dynamically create or delete logical volumes.","C":"To encrypt logical volumes.","B":"To dynamically change the size of logical volumes.","A":"To create RAID 9 arrays.","D":"To create snapshots."},"question_id":21,"isMC":true,"topic":"2","answer_description":"","question_text":"What can the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) be used for?

If a user creates a large number of files in /tmp, it could potentially fill up the / filesystem, which could cause serious problems for the system.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, it is a good practice to place the /tmp directory on a separate partition.
