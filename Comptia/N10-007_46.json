Of course it works. You plug the powered end of the tester into the wall jack using a short cable, plug the display end into the patch panel using another short cable, and confirm you get a reading on all 8 wires. Even the $5 ones that just light up the LEDs are still going to confirm you're plugged in to the right port. \n\nB isn't in any way wrong; I've used a cheap tester to do just this while trying to track back unlabeled ports when I didn't have a toner available. It's just that A is also a perfectly valid and frankly better answer as it's going to be faster than plugging and unplugging a patch cable into dozens of ports over and over again.","comment_id":"177694"}],"timestamp":"1596324780.0","poster":"Not_My_Name","content":"A terminated cable just means they've already attached the ends of the cable to their terminus point (in this case, a patch panel on one end and a wall jack on the other). \n You can use a short patch cable to attach the tone generator to the wall jack while you use the probe to locate the other end of the cable in patch panel.

You can either stick the other end of the cable tester in to each port on the panel and note the one that starts lighting wires up, or stick the probe near each port and look for the one that beeps. \n\nThey use this very scenario as an example on using tone generators.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHRIiw3OR6Y","poster":"Wyatt_Mann"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1599492480.0","poster":"sunnyh322","comment_id":"175290","content":"definitely A*"},{"timestamp":"1599492420.0","content":"definitely B","comment_id":"175289","poster":"sunnyh322","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"136856","content":"A cable tester is correct because the question states that the tech arrives and the cables have been terminated.
