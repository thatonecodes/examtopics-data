Creating a new resource requires the consumption of resources. Assets are created using either your resources or somebody else’s.\n\nExploratory Documents\nDuring the procurement process, the procurement specialist creates structured questionnaires that request information about potential solutions to a project’s problem. Then, they send the requests to vendors, who describe their products, services, strategies, and pricing. These exploratory procurement documents can help you select the right solution and vendor for your project.\n\nDirect information from Comptia Project + Online Study material","poster":"ArmorIT","timestamp":"1717841820.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1709933820.0","poster":"JohnLarsen","comment_id":"1002688","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOnce the need to procure goods and/or services is identified, the next document that a project manager should focus on updating is typically the \"Statement of Work\" (SOW) (Option C).

This approach directly addresses the issue at hand, which is that team members are uncertain about their daily activities.\nWhile a Gantt chart can help in understanding the project schedule and how tasks are related, a weekly review may not provide the daily clarity that the team needs. Additionally, a Gantt chart is often more useful for longer-term planning rather than short-term, day-to-day activities.","timestamp":"1694203260.0"},{"comment_id":"1357829","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe most effective step a PM can take is to provide clear, actionable direction.

Resend the scope of work to the team\n– The scope defines overall project objectives, not daily tasks. It won’t resolve confusion about specific activities.\n\nC. Review the Gantt chart weekly with the team\n– (1)The resources are unsure about DAILY activities....a WEEKLY response does not address a DAILY issue. Also, when is the 1st meeting? Today? in 2 days? In 6 days? Not good.\n– (2) A Gantt chart provides an overview of project timelines but may not detail individual responsibilities clearly enough.\n\nD.
