A sandbox is a controlled environment in which an application can be executed and observed without affecting the rest of the system. This allows the application to be run safely, even if it is unknown or potentially malicious. If the application is found to be malicious, it can be terminated without damaging the rest of the system. Configuring signature-based antivirus to update every 30 minutes can help protect against known malware, but it will not protect against custom malware that has not yet been detected. Enforcing S/MIME for email and automatically encrypting USB drives upon insertion can help protect against unauthorized access to sensitive data, but it will not protect against malware that is installed on a system.
