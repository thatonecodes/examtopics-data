Vishing\n\nExplanation:\nVishing (voice phishing) is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker uses phone calls or voice messages to impersonate someone else, often with the goal of tricking the victim into providing sensitive information or performing an action like resetting a password. In this scenario, the help desk employee receives a call from someone impersonating the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and asks for assistance with resetting a password, which is a classic vishing attack.","poster":"test_arrow","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1739239740.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"exam_id":368,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156342-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-570-discussion/","question_text":"A help desk employee receives a call from someone impersonating the Chief Executive Officer.

Improving security awareness training\n\nExplanation:\nFalse-positive phishing reports occur when employees incorrectly identify legitimate emails as phishing attempts. Improving security awareness training helps employees better recognize actual phishing emails, reducing unnecessary reports to the help desk. Training should include:\n✅ How to differentiate between real and phishing emails\n✅ Examples of common phishing tactics\n✅ When and how to report suspicious emails\n\nWhy not the others?\nA. Performing more phishing simulation campaigns – While simulations are helpful, they mainly test employee awareness rather than directly improving their ability to distinguish false positives.\nC. Hiring more help desk staff – This may address the increased workload but does not solve the root issue of frequent false-positive reports.\nD. Implementing an incident reporting web page – This could streamline reporting but would not necessarily reduce false positives."}]},{"id":"VaqGtg7R0luYcewNrh7o","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-02-17 23:01:00","unix_timestamp":1739829660,"choices":{"A":"Volume","C":"Full disk","B":"Partition","D":"File"},"answer":"C","question_text":"A systems administrator needs to encrypt all data on employee laptops.

Full disk\n\nExplanation:\nFull disk encryption (FDE) ensures that all data on the laptop, including the operating system, system files, and user data, is encrypted. This protects against unauthorized access in case the device is lost or stolen.\nVolume encryption applies to a specific logical volume, which may not cover the entire disk.\nPartition encryption encrypts a single partition but leaves other parts of the disk unprotected.\nFile encryption encrypts individual files, which may leave metadata or temporary files exposed","poster":"test_arrow","comment_id":"1357998","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"aNudDjm9LAy0dAfRg2pc","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156742-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-574-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Patching","B":"Segmentation","D":"Monitoring","C":"Decommissioning"},"timestamp":"2025-02-17 23:02:00","isMC":true,"question_id":525,"topic":"1","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"test_arrow","comment_id":"1357999","timestamp":"1739829720.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Patching\n\nExplanation:\nPatching involves applying updates or fixes to software to address security vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is found on a web server, installing the latest security patches is the most effective way to mitigate the risk.\nSegmentation helps limit the impact of a breach by isolating systems, but it does not directly fix the vulnerability.\nDecommissioning is only applicable if the server is obsolete or no longer needed.\nMonitoring is essential for detecting threats but does not resolve the underlying issue."}],"exam_id":368,"unix_timestamp":1739829720,"question_text":"Which of the following actions best addresses a vulnerability found on a company's web server?"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":581,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Comptia","isImplemented":true,"name":"SY0-701","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":368},"currentPage":105},"__N_SSP":true}
