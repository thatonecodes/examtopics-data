Utility\nA utility interface is specifically designed to monitor and manage database performance. It provides tools for analyzing database metrics, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing performance. Many database management systems (DBMS) include built-in performance monitoring utilities to track queries, CPU usage, memory consumption, and indexing efficiency.\n\nExplanation of Other Options:\nA. Direct – This refers to directly accessing the database, which is not an interface designed for performance monitoring.\nB. Programmatic – This typically involves using APIs or scripts to interact with the database, but it is not the best option for viewing performance data.\nC. Query – Queries retrieve and manipulate data but are not specifically designed for performance monitoring.\nThus, a utility interface is the best choice for viewing database performance information."}],"exam_id":352,"timestamp":"2025-02-26 14:56:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157129-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-508-discussion/"},{"id":"ZOPiVaaaDpaj2b9afSzN","unix_timestamp":1740578220,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following defines a reusable value that can be reassigned?","answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2025-02-26 14:57:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Variable\nA variable is a reusable value that can be reassigned during the execution of a program. It stores data that can change over time, allowing flexibility in programming.\n\nExplanation of Other Options:\nA. Method – A method is a function associated with an object or class that performs a specific action but does not store a reassigned value.\nC. Constant – A constant holds a value that cannot be changed after its initial assignment.\nD. Function – A function is a block of reusable code that performs a task but does not store values for reassignment like a variable does.\nThus, the correct answer is Variable (B) since it allows reassignment and reuse.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740578220.0","poster":"lexxone","comment_id":"1361971"}],"answer":"B","question_id":262,"choices":{"C":"Constant","A":"Method","D":"Function","B":"Variable"},"exam_id":352,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157130-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-509-discussion/"},{"id":"8j6KX68XwK2bwja4FXSE","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2020-05-27 05:00:00","answer":"D","choices":{"C":"DSL","D":"DVI","B":"NFC","A":"USB"},"topic":"1","question_id":263,"exam_id":352,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_text":"A technician is called to replace a display for a workstation.

Redundant equipment\nExplanation:\nRedundant equipment (e.g., backup servers, network devices, power supplies) ensures high availability by minimizing downtime in case of hardware failure. This is often the most cost-effective method compared to setting up a full disaster recovery site or implementing an extensive continuity plan.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nB. Disaster recovery site – While effective, setting up a separate recovery site is costly and typically used for mission-critical operations.\nC. Continuity plan – A business continuity plan is important for long-term resilience but does not directly increase availability in real-time.\nD.
