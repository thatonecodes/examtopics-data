Containerization would be the best implementation to prevent the issue from reoccurring. By containerizing the web application and its dependencies, the third-party libraries would be isolated from other applications, making it impossible for a developer to accidentally upload a newer version of the libraries that are shared among several applications. This approach would also enable the organization to manage the web application and its dependencies independently, which would minimize the risk of unintentional changes. CASB and SWG are security solutions that can help secure cloud applications and web traffic, respectively. Automated failover is a disaster recovery strategy that involves automatically switching to a secondary system if the primary system fails.

Image level backups is one option in using backup software/appliance that will backup the VM Image. Remember that a VM is simply a large file that is changed at the block level, just like a document. To reduce the time and size of the backup, a second option is available called block level incremental backups. This methodology allows a full image backup initially, then any block level changes.
