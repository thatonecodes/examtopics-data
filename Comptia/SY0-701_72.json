Physical Isolation provides redundancy and protection against failures, which is a fundamental aspect of high availability, ensuring that issues in one part of the network do not impact the overall availability of services. Physical isolation helps prevent a single point of failure from affecting the entire network. \nWhile responsiveness is important for performance, it is not specifically a high-availability consideration.
