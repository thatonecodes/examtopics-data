If \"The penetration tester decides to run an OS discovery and a full port scan to identify all the systems and any potential vulnerability\" then would this not rule out answer C as well? D, The type of Scan could be the right answer because the penetration tester stated that he wanted to identify ALL the systems so a full scan of the subnetwork can do this.

The tester need to be polite or normal with the timing on the legacy systems since they have older CPUs that cannot handle loads of request from the scanner.\n\nScanning options\nParanoid - T0\nSneaky - T1\nPolite - T2\nNormal - T3\nAggressive - T4\nInsane - T5\n\nOption B - Bandwidth limitations.

The inventory of assets and versions\n\nBefore running a scan, the penetration tester should consider the inventory of assets and versions on the subnetwork. This will help the tester to identify which systems and applications are running on the network, as well as any potential vulnerabilities associated with those systems. Knowing the inventory of assets and versions will help the penetration tester to tailor the scan to the specific systems and applications on the network, which will increase the chances of identifying any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, it will help the tester to make sure that no false positive results are reported, which can be misleading.","upvote_count":"5"},{"comment_id":"772849","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1673467140.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTiming of scan dealing with legacy systems is the answer.

Metasploit\n\nMetasploit is a widely used exploitation framework that provides a large number of payload modules that can target a broad range of system types. It is designed to be used by penetration testers to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access to systems. It supports a wide range of payloads and exploits, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS systems, as well as mobile devices and IoT devices. Additionally, Metasploit also provides a comprehensive set of post-exploitation modules that allows penetration testers to perform various actions on the target systems, such as gathering system information, escalating privileges, and creating backdoors. All of these features make Metasploit the most comprehensive exploitation suite and the best choice for pentesters who want to cover the broadest range of target systems types.","timestamp":"1705781700.0","poster":"RRabbit_111"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1698915300.0","poster":"som3onenooned1","comment_id":"709708","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1667379300,"topic":"1","answer":"B","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/86839-exam-pt0-002-topic-1-question-85-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Burp Suite","D":"Ethercap","A":"Nessus","B":"Metasploit"}}],"exam":{"id":362,"numberOfQuestions":445,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","name":"PT0-002","isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":86},"__N_SSP":true}
