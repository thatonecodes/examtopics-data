In Example 4.3, the scan is modified with four options. -p0- asks Nmap to scan every possible TCP port, -v asks Nmap to be verbose about it, -A enables aggressive tests such as remote OS detection, service/version detection, and the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). Finally, -T4 enables a more aggressive timing policy to speed up the scan.\n\nExample 4.3. More complex: nmap -p0- -v -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org\"\nhttps://nmap.org/book/port-scanning-tutorial.html\n\nI'm not 100%... based on NMAP documentation, both A and C seem to be viable answers. -p0 will not flag the IDS MOST LIKELY since they are T0 scans (paranoid) and running -Ss, this is common knowledge.
