UEFI settings allow the technician to configure various aspects of the boot process, such as the boot order, the boot mode, and the security options.

This includes hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, and network boot options.\n\nIn the context of the prompt, the technician would need to access the UEFI settings to modify the boot order and prioritize the new SSD as the primary boot device. This is typically done by pressing a specific key during the boot process, such as F2, F10, or Del.\n\nOnce in the UEFI setup, the technician would navigate to the Boot section and adjust the boot order to ensure that the SSD is listed as the first boot device.
