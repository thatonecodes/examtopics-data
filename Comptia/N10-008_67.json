The Zero Trust model works on the principle of least privilege, where users are granted only the necessary level of access required to complete their tasks, and all access is continually monitored and verified. This approach is designed to prevent lateral movement by attackers, even if they have breached the perimeter security. With Zero Trust, every user, device, and application must be authenticated and authorized before being granted access to the network or resources.

On a modern network, there are just too many opportunities for traffic to escape monitoring/filtering by perimeter devices. Zero trust uses systems such as continuous authentication and conditional access to mitigate privilege escalation and account compromise by threat actors. Another zero-trust technique is to apply microsegmentation. Microsegmentation is a security process that is capable of applying policies to a single node, as though it was in a zone of its own.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"487671","poster":"atrax","timestamp":"1637964240.0"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"502294","comments":[{"content":"Zero day is an exploitation of software that hasn't patched an unknown exploit yet.
