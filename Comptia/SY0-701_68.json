CRL\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a private key is stolen, the associated certificate must be revoked to ensure it is no longer trusted. Updating the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is necessary to inform systems that the certificate is invalid and should not be trusted.\n\nOther Options:\nA. SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol): Used for certificate enrollment but is not related to revoking or updating certificates.\nC. OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol): This protocol is used to check the revocation status of a certificate in real time, but the CRL must be updated first for OCSP to reflect the change.\nD.

When a private key is compromised, the corresponding certificate should be revoked to prevent its further use. By updating the CRL, the system can validate the authenticity of certificates and prevent unauthorized access.","comment_id":"1328554","timestamp":"1734532200.0","poster":"ProudFather"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. CSR (Certificate Signing Request).\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen a private key is compromised, the entire certificate needs to be reissued. This involves the following steps:\n\nGenerate a new CSR: A new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is generated, which includes the public key associated with the new private key.\nSubmit the CSR to the CA: The new CSR is submitted to the Certificate Authority (CA) for verification and signing.\nIssue a new certificate: The CA issues a new digital certificate that is bound to the new public key.\nOnce the new certificate is issued, it needs to be installed on the web server. The other options (SCEP, CRL, and OCSP) are related to certificate management and revocation, but they are not directly affected by the compromise of the private key and the issuance of a new certificate.","comment_id":"1323385","poster":"Cocopqr","timestamp":"1733636280.0"},{"content":"Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol\n*Certificate Revocation List\nOffensive Security Certified Professional\nCertificate Signing Request","timestamp":"1732222140.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"s_plus","comment_id":"1316005","comments":[{"comment_id":"1323049","content":"OCSP does not mean Offensive Security Certified Professional;\n\nIt means Online Certificate Status Protocol","upvote_count":"3","poster":"iliecomptia","timestamp":"1733560020.0"}]}],"unix_timestamp":1732222140},{"id":"XcAvj9uEwnECKqRmTlyj","answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"Fourgehan","timestamp":"1732796400.0","comment_id":"1319217","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAn Acceptable Use Policy outlines acceptable and unacceptable behaviors when using an organizationâ€™s resources, including IT systems, networks, and data","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Mitch717","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1731979920.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAUP is the most appropriate document for establishing and communicating expectations associated with integrity and ethical behavior within an organization.","comment_id":"1314325"}],"timestamp":"2024-11-19 02:32:00","answer_description":"","answer":"A","question_text":"Which of the following organizational documents is most often used to establish and communicate expectations associated with integrity and ethical behavior within an organization?","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"MOA","C":"EULA","B":"SLA","A":"AUP"},"exam_id":368,"unix_timestamp":1731979920,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/151573-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-402-discussion/","question_id":337},{"id":"8iBymUnLVtcTfn4KquaR","question_text":"Which of the following explains how to determine the global regulations that data is subject to regardless of the country where the data is stored?","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1733155500,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/152471-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-403-discussion/","question_id":338,"choices":{"D":"Data segmentation","A":"Geographic dispersion","B":"Data sovereignty","C":"Geographic restrictions"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1733155500.0","comment_id":"1321019","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Fourgehan","content":"Selected Answer: B\nData sovereignty refers to the concept that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is located or where it is collected, regardless of where it is stored.
