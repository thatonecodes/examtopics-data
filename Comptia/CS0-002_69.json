Running a dynamic code analysis (option D) is generally not used for locating issues related to web form manipulation or inconsistencies in public-facing web forms. Dynamic code analysis tools are typically used to find security vulnerabilities and issues in an application by analyzing its runtime behavior.\n\nTo locate issues related to web form manipulation and pricing inconsistencies in public-facing web forms, you would typically use methods like code review, security testing, or penetration testing to inspect the application's source code and test its behavior. Dynamic analysis (DAST) may be part of a broader testing strategy but is generally more focused on security vulnerabilities than uncovering issues like pricing inconsistencies.\n\nI appreciate your patience, and I hope this clarifies the situation."},{"poster":"Chilaqui1es","timestamp":"1698885960.0","comment_id":"1060158","content":"\"locate issue\" Dynamic analysis is the only option for locating.
