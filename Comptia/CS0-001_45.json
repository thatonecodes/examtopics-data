Vulnerability scan\n\nA vulnerability scan involves using automated tools to scan the web part and associated systems for known vulnerabilities. This process helps identify potential security weaknesses, misconfigurations, or outdated software versions that could be exploited by attackers. By conducting regular vulnerability scans, the analyst can stay informed about any vulnerabilities and take appropriate actions to mitigate or remediate them.","comment_id":"933859"},{"timestamp":"1679455920.0","content":"I will try B\nA vulnerability scan can be a part of a vulnerability management process, but it is not a remediation action in itself.
