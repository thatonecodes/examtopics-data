Hashing allows for verification of file integrity through checksums, while watermarking embeds ownership and authenticity information directly into the artwork, deterring unauthorized use and providing proof of ownership.

This process involves altering the code in a way that preserves its functionality but makes it much harder for someone to interpret or decompile the code to understand its logic and extract sensitive information. Here’s why obfuscation is the best choice in this scenario:\n• Protection Against Reverse Engineering: Obfuscation transforms the code into a version that is much harder to read, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to reverse engineer the application.\n• Intellectual Property Protection: By making the code difficult to interpret, obfuscation helps protect the intellectual property contained within the program from being stolen or misused by foreign entities.","poster":"isaphiltrick","comment_id":"1243512"},{"comment_id":"1246772","upvote_count":"2","content":"A - Obfuscation: This is the only option that addresses preventing theft.

The evidence could be deemed inadmissible because the continuity and integrity of its handling cannot be assured.
