Cable tester\n\nA cable tester is the most appropriate tool for determining the connectivity between a patch panel and an RJ45 drop. It allows the technician to verify the continuity of the cable and check for correct wiring, ensuring that the RJ45 jack in the CEO's office is properly connected to the corresponding port on the patch panel.","poster":"cartman01","comments":[{"timestamp":"1715212320.0","content":"In simple terms - you can do it with a cable tester, but you will need to check each switch port (connect the other end to each port and run a test), while with tone generator you just hover over switch ports and hear \"tone\" when you get the right one. \n\nI may be wrong as I am not an expert but I do wiring jobs occasionally so we use these tools a lot.","comment_id":"1208590","comments":[{"comment_id":"1295375","content":"You're not wrong. A cable tester is meant to test cables for continuity.\nIf you need to find where a port goes, you have to use a tone generator, which basically sends a tone over the wire, while you are on the switch scanning over until you hear said tone.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1728530100.0","poster":"ETQ"}],"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Roman_Kwo"}]}],"choices":{"D":"Spectrum analyzer","A":"Fusion splicer","B":"Cable tester","C":"Tone generator"},"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"exam_id":357,"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1712176860,"topic":"1"},{"id":"kXQbSDpU2xi5hbH5MEQE","exam_id":357,"answer_ET":"B","question_id":717,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-03-16 17:14:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/136233-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-744-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nTTL is how long something is stored in the cache","timestamp":"1729382040.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"priestb3","comment_id":"1198866"},{"timestamp":"1726496040.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\ntime to live","poster":"subaie503","comment_id":"1175087"}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1710605640,"question_text":"Which of the following is the DNS feature that controls how long a lookup is stored in cache on a server?","answer_description":"","answer":"B","choices":{"A":"CNAME","D":"SRV","C":"SOA","B":"TTL"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"DWxy0gBrXTpxiNqxNKXu","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nDuplexing refers to the ability of a data communication system to conduct two-way communication. If there’s a mismatch in duplex settings between the switch and the connected devices, it can lead to performance issues like slow data transfers or intermittent connectivity.\n\nReversed TX/RX pinouts (B) would typically prevent the connection from working at all. Cable crosstalk © could potentially cause interference and slow down the connection, but it’s less likely to cause intermittent connectivity. A failed transceiver (D) would typically cause a complete loss of connectivity, not just slow or intermittent connectivity.
