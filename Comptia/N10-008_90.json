First off:\n\nWireless Client Isolation is a security feature that prevents wireless clients from communicating with one another. This feature is useful for guest and BYOD SSIDs adding a level of security to limit attacks and threats between devices connected to the wireless networks.\n\nThis question I think assumes the guest network is coming from one building and not the other.

With a reduced power level, the signal will not travel as far. You can ensure the signal remains within the building's interior only by conducting a site survey and adjusting your power levels of each wireless access point. The other options, if changed, would affect the availability of the network. Adjustments for new wireless signal strength requires you to consider the following:\n* Client = Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) (decibel)\n* Access Point = Effective Equivalent Isotropic Radiate Power (EIRP) Decibels over Isotropic (dBi)\nWireless channel frequencies must meet the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) rules & therefore can still easily be accessed. Enabling wireless client isolation only protects the Internal network (Intranet). Port security would allow you to block external & internal network accesses, but would affect every client on the network lest you were to use a whitelisting protocol authentication service like RADIUS, this change would take time to implement however.","timestamp":"1714883640.0"},{"comments":[{"content":"Wireless client isolation is a security feature that prevents wireless devices connected to the same network from communicating directly with each other.
