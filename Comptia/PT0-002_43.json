The configuration required the penetration tester to not utilize additional files. This option suggests that the tester opted for a lightweight, straightforward method that uses available system tools without needing additional, potentially detectable software installations. This would be crucial in environments with stringent network security measures that could detect and block unfamiliar executables or scripts.","poster":"djash22","timestamp":"1720612620.0"},{"comment_id":"1242916","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis script uses nc (netcat) to scan a specified range of IP addresses (10.100.100.1 to 10.100.100.254) for open ports (22, 23, 80, and 443).\n\nThe question asks why this script might be used instead of another tool. The most appropriate explanation is:\n\nB. The configuration required the penetration tester to not utilize additional files: Using a Bash script like this allows the tester to create a custom tool on the fly without needing to install or configure additional software or files. This script is self-contained and does not require dependencies beyond the existing shell and nc (netcat).\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. This is not relevant here, as the script is running a network scan, which is platform-independent in terms of targets.\nC. While Bash scripts can be tailored to provide specific output, this is not inherently more thorough than using other tools.\nD. While it’s possible to set up scripts to run on reboot, this is not a compelling reason for choosing this particular script over another tool.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000","timestamp":"1720199400.0"},{"comment_id":"1242778","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNothing else makes sense","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Paula77","timestamp":"1720183500.0"},{"timestamp":"1715257200.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nElimination\nA - We know that's not true\nC - The output is based on NC, not BASH\nD - No, BASH isn't the only one.\n\nThus - B is the only correct answer.","comment_id":"1208838","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Sebatian20"},{"timestamp":"1711037760.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"According to AI - I retyped the scripted into a notepad and asked AI and this is what Bing Chat had to say about it: Again.. here we go assuming a pentester's intensions.

The configuration required the penetration tester to not utilize additional files.\n\nThe script provided is a simple bash script that uses the netcat command to scan a range of IP addresses (from 10.100.100.1 to 10.100.100.254) for open ports (22, 23, 80, 443).
