Both answers are correct, but I believe D is more specifically correct. If you can't open a PTY session, you won't be able to send the command. No PTY basically means you can only log in through a serial cable, it will disable ssh connections. No session means you can't send commands like reboot (even though reboot is specifically enabled in config file 1).","poster":"Trap_D0_r","comments":[{"timestamp":"1636035180.0","comment_id":"472612","poster":"cvMikazuki","content":"concur with D","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1613577180.0","comment_id":"292664","upvote_count":"2","content":"verified this question with some developers and answer is B.","poster":"Neo2020"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/45013-exam-cas-003-topic-1-question-132-discussion/","timestamp":"2021-02-17 16:53:00","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":342,"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"question_id":36,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1613577180,"choices":{"A":"The sudoers file is locked down to an incorrect command","B":"SSH command shell restrictions are misconfigured","C":"The passwd file is misconfigured","D":"The SSH command is not allowing a pty session"},"answer":"D"},{"id":"rQsQzWad4BE8w5pvZJtV","unix_timestamp":1626294480,"answers_community":[],"answer":"B","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":37,"exam_id":342,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/57864-exam-cas-003-topic-1-question-133-discussion/","question_text":"The director of sales asked the development team for some small changes to increase the usability of an application used by the sales team.
