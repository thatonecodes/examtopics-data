Almost all could be the answer:\n\nAnother vulnerability is due to lack of sufficient security checks in the MODBUS/TCP protocol implementation. The protocol specification does not include an authentication mechanism for validating communication between MODBUS master and slave devices. This flaw could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to issue arbitrary commands to any slave device via a MODBUS master.\n\nAn attacker creates a specially crafted packet longer than 260 bytes and sends it to a MODBUS client and server. If the client or server were programmed incorrectly, this could lead to a successful buffer overflow or denial-of-service attack.\n\nThe easiest attack to use against Modbus is to simply sniff the traffic on a network, find the Modbus devices and then issue harmful commands to the Modbus devices.\n\nhttps://www.radiflow.com/blog/hack-the-modbus/","timestamp":"1685112240.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"907453","poster":"nomad421"},{"poster":"2Fish","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
