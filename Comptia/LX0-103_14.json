This output is then piped to the tee command, which writes it to standard output (where it is displayed on the terminal) and to the file bar. Finally, the output is piped to the cat command, which reads it from standard input and writes it to standard output (again displaying \"foo bar\" on the terminal).\n\nTherefore, the output of the command line is just the string \"foo bar\".","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"806495"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98960-exam-lx0-103-topic-3-question-50-discussion/","question_text":"When given the following command line.\necho \"foo bar\" | tee bar | cat\nWhich of the following output is created?","choices":{"C":"tee bar","E":"foo","B":"foo bar","A":"cat","D":"bar"},"isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-12 16:28:00","answer_description":"","topic":"3","exam_id":353,"unix_timestamp":1676215680,"answer_images":[],"question_id":66},{"id":"6fSZhdd4su2ezrmKi1hc","answer_images":[],"question_id":67,"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"<<<","A":"<","C":">","E":"%>","D":">>>"},"answer_ET":"ABC","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/55927-exam-lx0-103-topic-3-question-52-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1624478100,"answers_community":[],"exam_id":353,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"806501","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676216100.0","content":"Yes, <<< is a valid stream redirection operator in Bash, known as a here-string operator.\n\nThe <<< symbol is used to pass a string as standard input to a command.
