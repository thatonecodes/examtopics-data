This is accomplished by encrypting the information as it is written to disk using a unique key per disk. If any drives are removed from the array (for example, due to drive failure or theft), the information on the drive is unintelligible. In addition, the VNX2 D@RE solution provides a mechanism to crypto-erase data because the associated keys on the storage system are deletedwhen theRAID group or Storage Pool is deleted.
