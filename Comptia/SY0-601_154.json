According to CompTIA, \"threat hunting is an assessment technique that utilizes insights gained from threat intelligence to proactively discover whether there is evidence of TTPs already present within the network or system. This contrasts with a reactive process that is only triggered when alert conditions are reported through an incident management system (Section 3C).\" \n\nThe question uses the word \"primarily,\" which I am using to make my inference. I find it more reasonable that threat hunters will use threat feeds to identify exploitable systems, rather than sifting through packet capture files. Obviously, both threat feeds and packet capture can be integrated into a SIEM, which is where my uncertainty comes into play. Also are threat feeds considered to be threat intelligence rather than threat hunting? The semantics causes me to overthink it almost every time, however considering the above excerpt from CompTIA, threat feeds just strike me as more proactive than reactive compared to packet capture.","upvote_count":"6","poster":"slapster"},{"comment_id":"1256292","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://blackcell.ae/why-packet-capture-is-an-important-tool-in-the-threat-hunting-toolbelt/","poster":"SM9","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722082800.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"xBrynlee","timestamp":"1720576680.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCOMPTIA says \"Where vulnerability scanning uses lists of patches and standard definitions of baseline configurations, threat hunting is an assessment technique that utilizes insights\ngained from threat intelligence to proactively discover whether there is evidence of\nTTPs already present within the network or system\". \n\nThis eliminates option A. Vulnerability scan. \n\nDarril Gibson mentions the tools used for threat hunting include OSINT, threat feeds, intelligence fusion (which combines all this data to create a picture of likely threats and risks for an organization. This helps the cybersecurity analysts understand how threat actors may maneuver through the network, how to detect them, and how to mitigate their efforts once they’re discovered)","comment_id":"1245227"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"AspiringNerd","content":"Selected Answer: B\nGonna go with Packet Capture here..

An important part of Threat Hunting is gathering data on the threat through threat intelligence. This knowledge comes from both internal and external sources.\n\nThreat Feeds provide subscribers with up-to-date information on current threats.
