Biometric lock - Biometric locks use unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to grant access to a secure area. This provides a high level of security and ensures that only authorized individuals can enter the server room.\n\nB. Access control vestibule - An access control vestibule is a small room or enclosure that is located between two doors. The individual must enter the vestibule, and then be authenticated before being granted access to the server room. This provides an additional layer of security and helps to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and E (Locking rack).\n\nBadge readers and USB tokens can also provide some level of security, but they are not as effective as biometric locks, access control vestibules, and locking racks.
