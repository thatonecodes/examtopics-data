Lift and shift\n\nLift and shift involves migrating applications and data from on-premises or existing infrastructure to the cloud with minimal changes to the application architecture. This method is often preferred for disaster recovery scenarios because it allows organizations to quickly replicate their existing infrastructure and applications in the cloud without the need for significant reconfiguration or redesign. By lifting and shifting their infrastructure to the cloud, organizations can establish a redundant environment that can be readily activated in the event of a disaster, providing continuity of operations and minimizing downtime.","timestamp":"1726586340.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nbook:\nLift and shift is a good choice for disaster recovery and is required for commercial applications that can’t be refactored.

To have protocols in place for notifying staff when a cloud outage occurs.\n\nEstablishing a communication policy between CSPs and clients is crucial for ensuring effective communication and collaboration during various scenarios, including cloud outages. In the event of a cloud outage, clear protocols and procedures for notifying clients about the outage, its impact, and the steps being taken to resolve it are essential for managing expectations, maintaining transparency, and minimizing disruptions to business operations. A well-defined communication policy helps foster trust, accountability, and effective problem resolution between CSPs and their clients during challenging situations like service disruptions.","poster":"Bluebird33","comment_id":"1175976"}],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"OlpF93n9AiLv5Ds133bi","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/126421-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-118-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":13,"answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-11-17 02:06:00","answer":"B","answer_description":"","topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1160143","poster":"Bluebird33","content":"Selected Answer: B\nYes, should be statement of work","timestamp":"1724708040.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"igorclapa","content":"B.

To ensure clients feel comfortable about the handling of any leftover data after termination of the contract.\n\nA data sanitization policy outlines the procedures and protocols that a cloud service provider (CSP) follows to ensure that any residual or leftover data is properly cleansed and sanitized after the termination of a contract or the decommissioning of services. By establishing and publishing a data sanitization policy, the CSP aims to provide assurance to its clients that their data will be handled responsibly and securely, even after the end of the business relationship.","poster":"Bluebird33"},{"comment_id":"1002658","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1709928180.0","poster":"CyberE9","content":"Never mind \"D\" is correct"},{"timestamp":"1709928120.0","poster":"CyberE9","comment_id":"1002656","content":"Shouldn't this be \"A\"","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2023-09-08 20:02:00"},{"id":"h8oeLLboDuD2WziDum2t","exam_id":344,"question_id":15,"question_text":"A small online retailer is looking for a solution to handle the high load on its servers during the holiday season.

Bursting.\n\nCloud Bursting is a strategy where a system is primarily run on-premises, but during peak demand (such as the holiday season), the overflow traffic is “burst” to the cloud. This allows the retailer to handle high loads without needing to permanently move all IT operations to the cloud. Bursting is ideal for situations where the workload is usually steady but occasionally experiences significant spikes, such as during holidays.\n\n • Elasticity and Scalability refer to general cloud concepts that allow resources to be dynamically adjusted to meet demand, but they imply more permanent cloud integration.\n • Self-service refers to the ability for users to provision resources on-demand, which is not specifically about handling peak loads.\n\nBursting directly addresses the requirement of handling high load during specific periods without a full commitment to the cloud.","comment_id":"1268082"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"macxsz","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think it is bursting:\n\"Cloud bursting is a configuration method that uses cloud computing resources whenever on-premises infrastructure reaches peak capacity.
