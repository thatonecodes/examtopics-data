When a device's CPU is overwhelmed with processing tasks, it may struggle to handle incoming network traffic efficiently, leading to packet drops. Therefore, option C, CPU usage, is the most likely cause in this situation.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1123734","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC and D are most likely correct but I think C fits better here because overloaded CPU could lead to encapsulation errors","timestamp":"1705357200.0","poster":"Bzero87"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nEncapsulation is the frame format expected on the interface.

If the device's CPU is overwhelmed, incoming or outgoing packets may be dropped, leading to performance issues."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nCHATGPT: D. Encapsulation errors\n\nEncapsulation errors occur when the data link layer framing is incorrect, causing the receiving device to drop the packet. This could be due to issues like mismatched frame formats, incorrect frame size, or corrupted frames. Even though the cable and physical interfaces might be in working order, if there are issues with the encapsulation of data, packets can be dropped during transmission.\n\nWhen a device's CPU is overwhelmed, it might not be able to process network data quickly enough to ensure proper encapsulation and transmission. This can lead to issues such as misaligned frames, incorrect checksum calculations, or improperly formed packets, all of which can result in encapsulation errors and dropped packets.\n\nSo, while CPU usage itself might not directly cause encapsulation errors, it can contribute to the overall degradation of network performance, potentially leading to errors in packet encapsulation and transmission.","comment_id":"992325","upvote_count":"3","poster":"caloke1","timestamp":"1693235520.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"948432","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGotta be encapsulation errors","timestamp":"1689029640.0","poster":"sukhmn"},{"timestamp":"1681713360.0","poster":"famco","comment_id":"872405","upvote_count":"2","content":"Network congestion could be the most likely cause along with cable issues.

Each managed device can include one or several managed objects, such as component temperature, a port interface, or physical resource utilization. Managed objects are assigned an OID, or object identifier. This isn't a likely source of dropped network packet issues. \n\nA MIB (Management Information Base) is simply a list of objects, performance info, and their descriptions (see above re: NMS) managed by an NMS. It's not likely to be relevant here either. \n\nEncapsulation errors are an likely cause in this situation. They can occur for a number of reasons, including failed arp command requests, and aren't commonly tied to chronic packet loss.\n\nWithout going into a lot of detail, its safe to say that CPU usage can be indicative.

Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP).\n\nMAC spoofing is a technique in which an attacker changes the source MAC address of a device to pretend to be another device on the network. This can be used to conduct malicious activities like stealing data or launching further attacks.\n\nReverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is a protocol used to map a MAC address to an IP address. When a device needs to communicate with another device on the network, it sends an ARP request to get the MAC address of the destination device. Similarly, when a device needs to communicate with a device whose MAC address is known, it sends a RARP request to get the IP address of the device.\n\nIn the case of a MAC spoofing attack, an attacker pretends to be another device on the network, so the IP address associated with that MAC address will be incorrect. By using RARP, the system can detect if the IP address returned in response to the MAC address is different than what is expected.
