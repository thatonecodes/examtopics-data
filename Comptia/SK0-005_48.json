IP address: 172.16.25.90/24 -\nDefault gateway: 172.16.25.254\n\nVLAN NAME: ACCOUNTING\nVLAN ID: 25\nIP ADDRESS: 172.16.25.1 - 172.16.25.254/24\nDEFAULT GATEWAY: 172.16.25.254\nEXCLUSION RANGE: 172.16.25.50 - 172.a6.25.100\n\nBased on the scenario provided, none of the options work (at a glance). Therefore, (unless there is a typo) I will make the assumption this question is not about IP addressing, it is about understanding the rationales behind administrative practices such as Exclusion Ranges. An exclusion range is typically created for use by only certain types of hosts, like servers or printers. Based on that rationale, assigning the server an IP address from the exclusion range is the BEST answer.","poster":"surfuganda","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1710348600.0","comment_id":"1172736"}],"answer":"A","topic":"1","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-03-13 17:50:00","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1710348600,"question_id":236,"choices":{"C":"IP address: 172.16.25.254/24 -\nDefault gateway: 172.16.25.1","D":"IP address: 172.16.26.101/24 -\nDefault gateway: 172.16.25.254","B":"IP address: 172.16.25.101/16 -\nDefault gateway: 172.16.25.254","A":"IP address: 172.16.25.90/24 -\nDefault gateway: 172.16.25.254"},"exam_id":365,"question_text":"A server technician is placing a newly configured server into a corporate environment.

Drive\n\nEncrypting the entire storage drive (such as a hard drive or solid-state drive) is the most comprehensive approach to achieving data-at-rest encryption. This method ensures that all data stored on the drive, regardless of the file type or location, is encrypted. It provides a high level of security by protecting the data at the storage level itself, making it inaccessible to unauthorized users even if the physical storage device is stolen or compromised.","poster":"surfuganda","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726249560.0","comment_id":"1172861"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":365,"answer_description":"","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1710359160,"question_text":"The management team has mandated the use of data-at-rest encryption for all data.
