Installed the software on the base operating system.\n\nWhen a virtualized application is installed directly onto the user's computer instead of running within a virtualized environment, it becomes dependent on the underlying operating system and hardware configuration. If the application was designed to run within a virtualized environment with specific dependencies and configurations, installing it directly onto the base operating system can cause compatibility issues, leading to the application not launching.","comment_id":"1210588","timestamp":"1715564220.0"},{"poster":"BKnows007","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732127580.0","content":"How is B the correct answer?","comment_id":"1315441"},{"poster":"ojones888","comment_id":"1260422","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think the answer is A","timestamp":"1722711600.0"},{"poster":"BubuG63","content":"D.

Run the printer’s alignment process.\n\nWhen print jobs contain shadowing after replacing ink cartridges, it's often indicative of misalignment in the printing process. Running the printer’s alignment process can help recalibrate the print heads and ensure that the ink is applied correctly onto the page. Reseating the ink cartridges could also be attempted, but alignment is typically the first step to address print quality issues like shadowing.","comment_id":"1210590","timestamp":"1715564220.0","poster":"Duke_CT","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1715564220,"timestamp":"2024-05-13 03:37:00","question_text":"After a technician replaced a printer's ink cartridges, all the print jobs contain shadowing.
