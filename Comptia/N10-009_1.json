Port mirroring\n\nExplanation:\nPort mirroring (also known as SPAN on Cisco devices) is the process of copying network traffic from one port (or a group of ports) on a switch to another port where a monitoring device, such as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), can inspect the traffic. This is the best method for deploying a passive IDS because it allows the IDS to analyze network traffic without interfering with or disrupting the normal flow of data.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1735670280.0","poster":"HeatSquad77","comment_id":"1335004"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"SuntzuLegacy","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is:\nB. Port mirroring\n\nExplanation:\nPort mirroring (also known as SPAN, Switched Port Analyzer) is the correct method for enabling a passive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to inspect network traffic. Port mirroring copies all traffic from one or more switch ports or VLANs to a designated port where the IDS is connected. This allows the IDS to analyze the network traffic without interfering with the normal flow of data, fulfilling the requirement for passive monitoring.","timestamp":"1732935960.0","comment_id":"1320027"}],"unix_timestamp":1732935960},{"id":"OVnXCC1EVPPA0DOr9MeF","discussion":[{"poster":"HeatSquad77","timestamp":"1736178060.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
