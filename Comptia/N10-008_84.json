When one firewall is active, the other firewall is passive and monitors the active firewall. In the event of a failure or high utilization, the passive firewall takes over as the active firewall to maintain continuity of service and reduce latency. This setup provides redundancy and ensures that network traffic is always being processed, even during periods of high utilization.\n\nOption A, Hot site, refers to a backup site that is ready to take over operations in case the primary site fails. This is not directly related to decreasing latency during high utilization of a firewall.\n\nOption B, Content inspection, refers to the process of examining network traffic for malicious content or unauthorized access attempts. While it can help improve security, it is not directly related to decreasing latency during periods of high utilization of a firewall.\n\nOption D, VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol), is a protocol used for providing redundancy in IP networks. While it can help provide redundancy, it is not directly related to decreasing latency during periods of high utilization of a firewall.","upvote_count":"6"},{"content":"HA in active-active mode","poster":"famco","comment_id":"875995","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1729457160.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following can be used to decrease latency during periods of high utilization of a firewall?","isMC":true,"question_id":416,"answer":"C"},{"id":"cFu89vquk5iKLmyppTGN","question_id":417,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"9","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. ipconfig is the command that the help desk technician should issue first to troubleshoot the issue with the Windows PC.
