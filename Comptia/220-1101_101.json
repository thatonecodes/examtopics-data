A 200W power supply may be sufficient for the workstation when the GPU is not heavily utilized, but may not provide enough power when the GPU is heavily tasked. This can cause unexpected reboots, stability issues, or other problems. The technician should verify that the power supply is providing enough power to support the workstation configuration and consider upgrading the power supply if necessary.\n\nThe other options listed, such as the UPS, graphics card, and motherboard, may also contribute to the issue, but are less likely to be the root cause based on the information provided.","poster":"freeman016","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"800839"},{"timestamp":"1691369340.0","comment_id":"800484","poster":"Amrsh","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. The power supply, as 200W is insufficient when the GPU is heavily tasked.\n\nThe technician should begin troubleshooting the power supply as it could be the cause of the unexpected reboots. The graphics card is a key component in the system, especially when rendering complex 3-D models, which puts a heavy load on the GPU and requires a significant amount of power. If the power supply is not able to provide enough power to the graphics card, it could cause the reboots. Checking the power requirements of the graphics card and ensuring that the power supply is able to provide sufficient power would be the first step in troubleshooting this issue.","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nit is always advisable to opt for something that has sufficient wattage.
