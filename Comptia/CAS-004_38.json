Deception\n\nThe analyst is most likely using deception techniques to deceive the malware and hinder its functionality. Deception involves creating an environment that misleads or confuses attackers or malware, making it harder for them to carry out their malicious activities.\n\nIn the given scenario, the analyst modifies the Windows server to respond to system calls as if it was a Linux server. This deceptive modification aims to confuse the malware, which might be specifically designed to target Windows systems. By presenting a different system environment, the analyst disrupts the malware's ability to execute its intended functionality.\n\nAdditionally, the analyst modifies the operating system to prevent the malware from identifying target files. This manipulation further adds to the deception strategy by hiding or altering the expected system behavior, making it challenging for the malware to locate and access its intended targets.\n\nOverall, these actions align with the concept of deception as a defensive technique to mislead and impede the functionality of malware.","poster":"fb2fcb1","timestamp":"1689298620.0"}],"answers_community":["B (62%)","D (33%)","3%"],"question_text":"A security analyst has concerns about malware on an endpoint.
