The \"4744\" options specify the access rights in binary form. The first number (4) represents the setuid (SUID) bit, which causes the file to run with the effective user ID of the owner of the file, rather than with the effective user ID of the user who is running it. The other three numbers (744) represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively. In this case, the owner has read, write, and execute permissions (7), the group has read and execute permissions (4), and others have only read permission (4).\n\nSo, the command \"chmod 4744 dev_team.txt\" sets the SUID bit and the access rights to 744 for the file dev_team.txt. The SUID bit allows the file to be executed with the owner's permissions, which can be useful for setuid scripts or other special purpose files.","poster":"linux_admin"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_id":204,"answer":"A","exam_id":371,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/99007-exam-xk0-005-topic-1-question-42-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1676243460,"answers_community":[]},{"id":"t9MJNgNYa3LdqM4T8uGs","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/86402-exam-xk0-005-topic-1-question-43-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-10-25 14:02:00","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1666699320,"exam_id":371,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/xk0-005/image23.png"],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A developer has been unable to remove a particular data folder that a team no longer uses.
