Block the URL shortener domain in the web proxy: Blocking the URL shortener domain in the web proxy is a good idea if you suspect that the malicious URLs lead to a harmful site, but in this case, the links are redirecting to a dead domain. The malicious domain itself is no longer active, so blocking the URL shortener might not address the immediate threat. Additionally, this step doesn't prevent other similar attacks with different shorteners or domains in the future.","upvote_count":"10"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741236300.0","comment_id":"1365735","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Block the URL shortener domain in the web proxy.\n\nExplanation:\nSince the attack uses URL shorteners to redirect users to potentially malicious domains, the most effective mitigation is to block the URL shortener domain in the web proxy. This prevents employees from clicking on similar links in the future, even if the attacker changes the final redirect destination.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. Create a blocklist for all subject lines – Not effective because attackers can easily modify subject lines to bypass filters.\nB. Send the dead domain to a DNS sinkhole – The domain is already dead, meaning it is no longer actively serving content. The threat lies in the URL shortener, which may redirect to different malicious sites in future attacks.\nC. Quarantine all emails received and notify all employees – While notifying employees is important, quarantining all emails may cause unnecessary disruptions. Blocking the URL shortener is a more effective preventive measure.","poster":"skg01"},{"poster":"mejestique","timestamp":"1741213320.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Block the URL shortener domain in the web proxy.\n\nExplanation:\nURL shorteners are often used in phishing attacks and malware distribution to obscure malicious links.

The dead domain may not do anything, but there can be several layers of redirects. You can place the dead domain on the DNS sinkhole, but that won't prevent users from clicking the links.
