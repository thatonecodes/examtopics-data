This type of reconnaissance is often more intrusive because it sends packets or requests to the target to elicit responses, allowing the tester to gather detailed information about the target's configuration and potential weaknesses.\nIn this Scenario Application:\nDirect Interaction: By performing port and service scans, the tester is \"actively\" sending packets to the target systems to determine which ports are open and what services are running.

It's typically applied at the network level to create boundaries between different parts of a network, such as separating internal networks from external ones or segmenting departments within an organization.\n\nIsolation, on the other hand, focuses on physically or logically separating a specific system, application, or resource from the rest of the network or environment. It involves placing the critical business application on its own server or within its own isolated environment to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or compromise.","timestamp":"1715945040.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nsegmentation because the device is STILL running a critical application. therefore it needs to be connected to the network. a compensating mechanism for this scenario would be segmentation as this would limit the ability of an attacker to pivot from the vulnerable server to the rest of the network.","poster":"e5c1bb5","comment_id":"1212605","timestamp":"1715898720.0"},{"timestamp":"1715428920.0","comment_id":"1209740","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Isolation\n\nIsolation would be the best approach for handling a critical business application running on a legacy server. By isolating the legacy server, you minimize its exposure to potential security threats and reduce the risk of compromising other parts of the network. This allows you to maintain the functionality of the critical application while also enhancing security.","poster":"Punjistetics"}],"unix_timestamp":1715296440,"answers_community":["A (44%)","B (40%)","Other"],"answer_ET":"A","question_id":50,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-05-10 01:14:00","choices":{"A":"Segmentation","C":"Hardening","D":"Decommissioning","B":"Isolation"},"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"name":"SY0-701","id":368,"provider":"Comptia","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":581,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":10},"__N_SSP":true}
