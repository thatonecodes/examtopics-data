Both traffic policing and traffic shaping tools can accomplish this objective. Collectively, these tools are called traffic conditioners.\nPolicing can be used in either the inbound or the outbound direction, and it typically discards packets that exceed the configured rate limit, which you can think of as a speed limit for specific traffic types. Because policing drops packets, resulting in re-transmissions, it is recommended for higher-speed interfaces. Shaping buffers (and therefore delays) traffic exceeding a configured rate.

This layer is where Ethernet protocols for wired connections and 802.11 protocols for wireless connections operate.
