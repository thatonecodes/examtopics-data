I'd go with B. \n\nPreparation—making the system resilient to attack in the first place. This includes hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and establishing confidential lines of communication. It also implies creating a formal incident response plan.\n\nIdentification—determining whether an incident has taken place and assessing how severe it might be, followed by notification of the incident to stakeholders.\n\nContainment, Eradication, and Recovery—limiting the scope and impact of the incident. The typical response is to \"pull the plug\" on the affected system, but this is not always appropriate. Once the incident is contained, the cause can then be removed and the system brought back to a secure state.\n\nLessons Learned—analyzing the incident and responses to identify whether procedures or systems could be improved.
