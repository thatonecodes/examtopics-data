This is a common security measure to prevent unauthorized access or network reconnaissance. This can be done by a firewall or an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) which is designed to detect and prevent malicious activity on a network.\nOption B, unsupported flags, is unlikely as Nmap is a widely used tool and the flags used in the command you provided are commonly used for performing an OS fingerprinting and service detection scan.\nOption C, The edge network device was disconnected, is unlikely as the response of all ports being filtered suggests that the device is actively responding and blocking the scan.\nOption D, The scan returned ICMP echo replies, is unlikely as the flags used in the command is for OS fingerprinting and service detection scan which does not use ICMP echo replies.","comment_id":"783853"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1682118420.0","comment_id":"701219","poster":"Lee_Lah"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1707162480.0","poster":"solutionz","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe Nmap command nmap -O -A -sS -p- 100.100.100.50 performs an OS detection (-O), enables advanced and aggressive scan options (-A), performs a SYN scan (-sS), and scans all 65,535 ports (-p-). If the result of this scan was that all ports were reported as filtered, it suggests that something on the network was blocking the scan attempts.\n\nAmong the options provided, the scenario that best explains this result is:\n\nA.
