The CIDR value /33 should be /32 instead."},{"comment_id":"807864","poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1691958360.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe cause of the issue is that the prefix length specified in the IP address/netmask is invalid. In the command ip address add 192.168.168.1/33 dev eth0, the prefix length is specified as /33, which is not a valid prefix length.\n\nIn IP networking, the prefix length specifies the number of bits in the network portion of the address. For example, a netmask of 255.255.255.0 corresponds to a prefix length of /24, because the first 24 bits of the address are used for the network portion.\n\nThe valid prefix lengths depend on the address class and type. For IPv4 addresses, the prefix length must be between 0 and 32. A prefix length of 33 is not valid, and that is why the command produced an error.\n\nTo fix the issue, the systems administrator should use a valid prefix length in the IP address/netmask, such as /32 if the address is a host address or /24 if the address is a network address. For example:\n\nip address add 192.168.168.1/32 dev eth0"},{"timestamp":"1688796360.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAAAAAAAA","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"769180","poster":"Pinnubhai"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/86822-exam-xk0-005-topic-1-question-128-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":33,"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"The CIDR value /33 should be /32 instead.","D":"The IP address 192.168.168.1 is already in use.","C":"The interface eth0 does not exist.","B":"There is no route to 192.168.168.1/33."},"question_text":"A systems administrator was tasked with assigning the temporary IP address/netmask 192.168.168.1/255.255.255.255 to the interface eth0 of a Linux server.\nWhen adding the address, the following error appears:\n# ip address add 192.168.168.1/33 dev eth0\nError: any valid prefix is expected rather than \"192.168.168.1/33\".\nBased on the command and its output above, which of the following is the cause of the issue?","exam_id":371},{"id":"ieybzuuuw76F8vNrRngL","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2022-11-25 04:20:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1669346400,"choices":{"D":"firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=22/udp","A":"firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=22","B":"systemctl enable firewalld; systemctl restart firewalld","C":"firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=ssh"},"topic":"1","exam_id":371,"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/88611-exam-xk0-005-topic-1-question-129-discussion/","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/xk0-005/image69.png"],"question_text":"A Linux user reported the following error after trying to connect to the system remotely: ssh: connect to host 10.0.1.10 port 22: Resource temporarily unavailable\nThe Linux systems administrator executed the following commands in the Linux system while trying to diagnose this issue:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich of the following commands will resolve this issue?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_id":34,"discussion":[{"poster":"Qubert2","upvote_count":"1","content":"C but it won't work until the firewall is reloaded with: firewall-cmd --reload","comment_id":"1300275","timestamp":"1729394940.0"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"linux_admin","content":"When the command is executed, the firewall configuration is updated to allow incoming SSH traffic on port 22 for the public zone, and the configuration change is made persistent across firewall reloads or system reboots.
