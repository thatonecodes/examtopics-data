There are many different authentication technologies.

These different ways of authenticating a subject are referred to as factors. Each factor has advantages and drawbacks.\n\"Something you are\" authentication means employing some sort of biometric recognition system. Many types of biometric information can be recorded, including fingerprint patterns, iris or retina recognition, or facial recognition.
