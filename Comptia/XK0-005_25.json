Finally, the administrator can merge the changes back into the main branch using git merge. This will allow the changes to be tracked and maintain version control of the IaC declaration templates.\n\nThe other options are not correct or do not achieve the desired effect. The git push origin command is used to push changes to a remote repository, but it should not be used before making changes. The git fetch New-Branch command is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository, but it does not create a new branch.
