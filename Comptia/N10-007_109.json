Explanation:\nEUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier) is a method we can use to automatically configure IPv6 host addresses. An IPv6 device will use the MAC address of its interface to generate a unique 64-bit interface ID.

However, the only thing that comes close to IPv6 link-local addresses is the IPv4 Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) method. When a host fails to obtain an IPv4 address with DHCP, it resigns itself to its fate of being incommunicado, and assigns its interface an APIPA address. You have surely witnessed (likely in a moment of exasperated troubleshooting!) a host with an IPv4 address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range (see RFC 3927). Like IPv6 link-local addresses, these APIPA addresses are usable addresses for unicast communications within a single broadcast domain on the LAN.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"371355","poster":"SheepHappens","timestamp":"1622491320.0"},{"content":"EUI-64","poster":"EDD09876","comment_id":"354010","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1620668760.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"this is what google says, and sounds like the best answer... \nEUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier) is a method we can use to automatically configure IPv6 host addresses.
