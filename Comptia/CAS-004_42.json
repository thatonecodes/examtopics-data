However, then I noticed it said \"initial compromise\" so the data alteration isn't even part of what we are worried about for the answer. So the answer is DNSSEC to protect against hijacked DNS responses, thus sending you to a site that isn't really the site you meant to go to, or a web proxy to check for malicious domains you may visit.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"ThatGuyOverThere"},{"comment_id":"1248390","upvote_count":"1","poster":"23169fd","timestamp":"1721051040.0","content":"Selected Answer: AF\nDNSSEC ensures the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses by using digital signatures.

By implementing DNSSEC, the organization can ensure that DNS responses are legitimate and have not been tampered with, thereby reducing the risk of employees' web traffic being redirected to malicious domains.\n\nSegmentation (C): Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to restrict the lateral movement of attackers and contain the impact of potential breaches. By segmenting the network and implementing strict access controls, organizations can prevent attackers from easily moving from one part of the network to another. In this scenario, segmenting the network would have prevented the compromise of the workstation from directly impacting the file server, reducing the attacker's ability to modify sensitive data.","comment_id":"1169064","poster":"HappyG"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AF\nA. DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) helps prevent DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of DNS data. If DNSSEC had been implemented, it would have made it more difficult for the attacker to redirect the employee's web traffic to a malicious domain.\n\nC. Segmentation involves dividing a network into separate segments or VLANs and controlling traffic flow between them. Proper network segmentation can help contain and limit the spread of attacks. If the network had been properly segmented, it could have prevented the attacker from easily moving from the compromised workstation to the file server.","poster":"Ariel235788","timestamp":"1696424520.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"hah selected the wrong answer on my comment","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1045997","poster":"Fragmenttt","timestamp":"1697546220.0","content":"The file server part is just fluff.

So i think we can safely rule out A. Let's look at Option B and just by looking at the one sample, we would be adding the 151.205.188.74 address. the Hostname section Hostname:pool-151.205.188.74-nycmny.isp.net. This is an isp provider and it is providing an ip addres, this is NOT NAT. So it is safe to say that malicious activity is coming from this address. Looking at option C and just our sample, we would be blocking all of the address range 151.196.0.0 - 151.205.255.255.
