Port ACL supports only inbound traffic filtering. Port ACL can be configured as three type access lists: standard, extended, and MAC-extended.\n\nProcessing of the Port ACL is similar to that of the Router ACLs; the switch examines ACLs associated with features configured on a given interface and permits or denies packet forwarding based on packet-matching criteria in the ACL.\n\nWhen applied to a trunk port, the ACL filters traffic on all VLANs present on the trunk port. When applied to a port with voice VLAN, the ACL filters traffic on both data and voice VLANs.\n\nThe main benefit with Port ACL is that it can filter IP traffic (using IP access lists) and non-IP traffic (using MAC access list). Both types of filtering can be achieved—that is, a Layer 2 interface can have both an IP access list and a MAC access list applied to it at the same time.","poster":"Rongupta","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1684812960.0","comment_id":"724911"},{"timestamp":"1682820540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"NICKJONRIPPER","content":"A. attacker can unplug users cable and plug his cable. \nC. it defends rogue DHCP, not attacker`s plug in.\nD. is right, there is layer 2 ACL.","comments":[{"content":"MAC ACL can prevent attacker`s cable","comment_id":"707593","poster":"NICKJONRIPPER","timestamp":"1682820600.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"707592"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1682382300.0","poster":"bengy78","content":"I should be turn on DHCP snooper.
