SDWAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network)\n\nSD-WAN provides a flexible and dynamic approach to wide area networking, allowing organizations to leverage multiple connection types, including MPLS, broadband, and cellular networks. It enhances the agility and efficiency of network operations by centrally controlling and managing the WAN connections through software. This makes it well-suited for supporting applications across various environments, including on-premises data centers, public or private clouds, and Software as a Service (SaaS) providers.","timestamp":"1717299000.0"},{"comment_id":"902574","timestamp":"1700490000.0","comments":[{"content":"forget this, because of the cloud SDWAN is the better one.","poster":"Dogster","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"902575","timestamp":"1700490120.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nboth work, depends on the needs. so gues this question has 2 answers that are ok?","poster":"Dogster","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"id say MPLS","timestamp":"1700489760.0","poster":"Dogster","comment_id":"902569"},{"timestamp":"1695530520.0","poster":"StellarSteve","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"849061","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. SDWAN\n\nSDWAN (Software Defined Wide Area Network) is a network architecture that enables the deployment of hybrid networks that can fully support applications hosted in on-premises data centers, public or private clouds, and SaaS services.

SDWAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network)\n\nSD-WAN is a software-based approach to managing and optimizing the performance of wide area networks (WANs). It allows organizations to connect users to applications through the most appropriate path, whether it's a private WAN, a public internet connection, or a combination of both. With SD-WAN, the network traffic is automatically routed over the best available link based on policies set by the organization, this allows fully support applications hosted in on-premises data centers, public or private clouds, and SaaS services.","comment_id":"791280","poster":"BeauChateau","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1690585680.0"}],"choices":{"C":"PAN","A":"SDWAN","D":"MPLS","B":"MAN"},"answers_community":["A (91%)","9%"],"timestamp":"2023-01-29 02:08:00","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":296,"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1674954480,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following topologies is designed to fully support applications hosted in on-premises data centers, public or private clouds, and SaaS services?","exam_id":357},{"id":"IvGePbv0QPHN5zcNk13d","discussion":[{"comment_id":"848694","content":"this aint even on exam objectives.
