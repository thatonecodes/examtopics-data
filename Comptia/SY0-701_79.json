Recovery Time Objective (RTO)\n\nExplanation:\nRecovery Time Objective (RTO) refers to the maximum acceptable amount of time that IT systems can be offline after a disruption before it significantly impacts the business. It helps organizations define how quickly systems need to be restored to minimize downtime and business disruption.\nOther Options:\nA. Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Refers to the maximum amount of data loss acceptable in terms of time (e.g., last backup point), not how quickly systems must be restored.\nB. Risk Appetite: Represents the level of risk an organization is willing to accept and does not measure recovery time.\nC. Risk Tolerance: Refers to the acceptable deviation from the risk appetite but is not specific to system recovery.\nE. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF): Measures the average time between system failures and is unrelated to recovery objectives.","timestamp":"1738021320.0","comment_id":"1347633","poster":"Anyio"},{"poster":"jennyka76","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA recovery time objective (RTO) is a time limit for how long a system, network, computer, or application can be down after a disaster or failure. RTOs are a key part of disaster recovery and data protection plans. They are based on the potential risks and impacts to a business, such as customer dissatisfaction, financial losses, regulatory compliance, and reputation damage.","comment_id":"1329367","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1734684840.0"}],"exam_id":368,"answer_ET":"D","question_id":393,"unix_timestamp":1734684840},{"id":"1zufHE3pjHZ3gwtWAxLS","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_id":394,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":368,"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-11-30 15:45:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732977900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHacktivist motivation is usually their ideological beliefs.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"e2ba0ff","comment_id":"1320249"}],"question_text":"Which of the following actors attacking an organization is the most likely to be motivated by personal beliefs?","choices":{"A":"Nation-state","C":"Hacktivist","B":"Organized crime","D":"Insider threat"},"answer":"C","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/152401-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-454-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1732977900},{"id":"aj4vqEzYBDssGnQQaFCC","exam_id":368,"answer_description":"","answer":"B","timestamp":"2024-11-20 10:07:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1732093620.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA risk register is a document used by organizations to track and manage risks, including persistent vulnerabilities.
