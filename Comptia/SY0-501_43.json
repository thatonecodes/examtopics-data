Volatility can be thought of as the amount of time that you have to collect certain data before a window of opportunity is gone. Naturally, in an investigation you want to collect everything, but some data will exist longer than others, and you cannot possibly collect all of it once. As an example, the OOV in an investigation may be RAM, hard drive data, CDs/DVDs, and printouts.\nOrder of volatility: Capture system images as a snapshot of what exists, look at network traffic and logs, capture any relevant video/screenshots/hashes, record time offset on the systems, talk to witnesses, and track total man-hours and expenses associated with the investigation."},{"id":"jHYInVLpQVuWskUX26hP","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"DNSSEC","D":"dig","C":"nslookup","E":"LDAPS","B":"SFTP"},"unix_timestamp":1554051360,"isMC":true,"question_id":215,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-03-31 18:56:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/783-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-237-discussion/","answer":"D","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"it should be DNSSEC.","timestamp":"1554051360.0","poster":"andev08","upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"1017"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nit seems like they just need a service performing DNS lookups like Dig. i dont see the correlation between DNSSEC and MX records lookup","upvote_count":"1","poster":"slackbot","comment_id":"1346875","timestamp":"1737887460.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1621015320.0","content":"A or AAA = DNS","comment_id":"357374","poster":"CTK246"},{"content":"https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/","timestamp":"1596016140.0","comment_id":"146402","poster":"vaxakaw829","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1584698760.0","poster":"Bidar12","content":"The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System (DNS) as used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks.","comment_id":"66228","upvote_count":"4"}],"exam_id":366,"question_text":"A company wants to host a publicly available server that performs the following functions:\n✑ Evaluates MX record lookup\n✑ Can perform authenticated requests for A and AAA records\n✑ Uses RRSIG\nWhich of the following should the company use to fulfill the above requirements?","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provides, among other things, cryptographic authenticity of responses using Resource Record Signatures (RRSIG) and authenticated denial of existence using Next-Secure (NSEC) and Hashed-NSEC records (NSEC3)."}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"name":"SY0-501","numberOfQuestions":1043,"id":366,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Comptia"},"currentPage":43},"__N_SSP":true}
