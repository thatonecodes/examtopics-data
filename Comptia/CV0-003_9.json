RAID 1\n\nTo set up mirroring on a storage array, you should configure RAID 1. RAID 1, also known as mirroring, duplicates data across multiple drives in the array. In a RAID 1 setup, every write operation is mirrored to two or more drives simultaneously. This redundancy ensures that if one drive fails, the data is still accessible from the mirrored drive(s), providing data protection and fault tolerance.","poster":"nmap_king_22"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"BeauChateau","timestamp":"1713202380.0","comment_id":"871167","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTo set up mirroring on a storage array, a systems administrator should configure RAID 1. RAID 1, also known as disk mirroring, uses two identical disks to store the same data. If one disk fails, the other disk can be used to recover the data. RAID 0 is not a mirroring RAID level but a striping RAID level that spreads data across multiple disks to enhance performance. RAID 5 and RAID 6 are parity-based RAID levels that provide fault tolerance and can recover data in the event of a single disk failure. However, they are not designed specifically for mirroring."}]},{"id":"WaP5drQsloqIh619HdeW","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nExplanation:\nSince the file server VM was moved to another region, the most likely cause of slowness is increased network latency due to geographical distance.\nLatency directly impacts file access and saving times in distributed environments, especially when large files are involved.\nChecking latency using tools like ping, traceroute, or cloud provider monitoring can confirm if high latency is the root cause.","comment_id":"1364892","poster":"BigM","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741091040.0"}],"question_text":"A systems administrator is working in a globally distributed cloud environment.
