Shadow IT\n\nShadow IT refers to the use of technology, systems, or services by employees without the approval or knowledge of the IT department. In this case, the research and development department is bypassing the company’s VPN, potentially using unauthorized methods to access company-related services and systems. This can pose security risks, as these systems may not adhere to the company’s security policies and protocols.","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1727836980.0","comment_id":"1292182","poster":"nillie"},{"poster":"ITExperts","comment_id":"1343797","timestamp":"1737398340.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD, espionage given here is crazy lmao","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"gingergroot","comments":[{"timestamp":"1733181120.0","content":"*concern","upvote_count":"1","poster":"gingergroot","comment_id":"1321132"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733181000.0","comment_id":"1321131","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

One shouldn't just assume they are using unauthorized software or hardware. Or I could assume since they aren't using a VPN to provide them a secure tunnel when accessing company resources, they were compromised causing data to be exfiltrated. They are just simply not using their VPN to access authorized company services and systems.

The scenario may imply the use of an unofficial VPN for the sake of carrying out Espionage or Data Exfiltration, but there is no sign of it. The threat is the VPN rather the user or the data.

HTTP does not provide encryption, meaning data transmitted between the user and the website can be intercepted and read by third parties.\n\nScenario Application: Identifying Non-Encrypted Sites: By scanning for the http:// string, the web filter can identify URLs that begin with this protocol, which signifies a lack of encryption. Blocking these URLs effectively prevents users from accessing non-encrypted websites.\nSecurity Enhancement: Prohibiting access to http:// ensures that users are only visiting websites that use HTTPS (https://), which encrypts data and provides a secure communication channel.\nScanning for http:// directly targets non-encrypted web traffic, making it the most appropriate choice for denying access to such sites.
