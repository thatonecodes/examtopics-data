Cloud providers take care of the underlying infrastructure, including security and compliance, allowing your development teams to focus solely on writing code and delivering features. This aligns well with the requirements mentioned.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Use cloud-native serverless services\n\nBy using serverless services, you can reduce the need for managing infrastructure and benefit from the security and compliance measures provided by the cloud provider, allowing your organization to focus on application development and speed to market.","poster":"Pongsathorn","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1694670000,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/120718-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-306-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_id":222},{"id":"j0R8cVv0SGY7zLRcnhgE","exam_id":349,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
