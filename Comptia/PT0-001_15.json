This allows consultants to view source code and be granted high-level privilege accounts to the network. The purpose of white-box testing is to identify potential weaknesses in various areas such as logical vulnerabilities, potential security exposures, security misconfigurations, poorly written development code, and lack-of-defensive measures. This type of assessment is more comprehensive, as both internal and external vulnerabilities are evaluated from a “behind the scenes” point of view that is not available to typical attackers.\n\nhttps://www.packetlabs.net/types-of-penetration-testing/","timestamp":"1638820860.0","poster":"contender"},{"content":"137.
