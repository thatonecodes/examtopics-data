They often operate at a low level in the system, making them resistant to many traditional anti-malware tools.\nSystem Integrity: Reinstalling the operating system ensures that any rootkit, along with any other potential malware or system modifications, is completely removed. This restores the system to a known good state.\nPrevention of Future Issues: A clean OS reinstallation eliminates any potential backdoors or malicious code that a rootkit might have installed, providing a fresh start and reducing the risk of re-infection.\nWhile anti-malware software can be effective against many threats, rootkits are particularly insidious and may evade detection. Application updates and file restores do not address the root cause and may not be effective against rootkits. Therefore, an OS reinstallation is the most reliable method to ensure the rootkit is completely removed.","timestamp":"1727083680.0","comment_id":"1223309","poster":"Jay23AmMonsIV"},{"poster":"SixGoddess","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTHE ANSWER IS C","comment_id":"1247497","timestamp":"1726811400.0"},{"timestamp":"1725178320.0","poster":"Philco","comment_id":"1275935","content":"Selected Answer: C\nReinstall Windows\nIf the rootkit is deeply embedded, you might need to reinstall Windows using a clean install from an external media.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1710424080.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.\n\nIf you suspect a rootkit on your device, it's so over.
