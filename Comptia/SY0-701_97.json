CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)\nExplanation:\n✔ CVSS provides a standardized scoring system to evaluate the severity of vulnerabilities, helping organizations prioritize which patches to apply based on risk and impact.\n✔ CVSS scores consider factors like exploitability, impact, and ease of remediation, making it a useful tool for prioritizing patch applications.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nB. SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) – SCAP is a set of standards for automating vulnerability management, but CVSS is the specific tool for prioritizing based on severity.\nC. OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) – While OSINT can provide useful information about vulnerabilities and threats, it does not specifically prioritize patches.\nD.

Baseline enforcement\n\nExplanation:\nBaseline enforcement refers to ensuring that systems comply with a predefined set of standards or configurations. In this case, the script validates the OS version, patch levels, and installed applications against a baseline to ensure consistency and security across all systems.\n\nResource scaling (A) involves adjusting system resources (e.g., CPU, memory) based on demand, which is unrelated to the script's purpose.\n\nPolicy enumeration (B) refers to listing or identifying policies, but the script is actively validating and enforcing compliance, not just enumerating policies.\n\nGuard rails implementation (D) typically involves setting boundaries or constraints to prevent unintended actions, which is not the primary purpose of this script."}],"unix_timestamp":1738076700,"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"A systems administrator creates a script that validates OS version, patch levels, and installed applications when users log in.

Firewall\n\nExplanation:\nFirewall logs are the most likely to provide information about the initial exploit, as firewalls monitor and log network traffic, including attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in IoT devices. These logs can show suspicious or unauthorized connections to the IoT device, which can help identify the time of the initial exploit.\n\nEndpoint logs (A) might provide details about the affected device, but they are less likely to capture the initial network-based exploit.\n\nApplication logs (B) are specific to applications and may not be relevant if the exploit targeted the IoT device itself rather than an application running on it.\n\nNAC (Network Access Control) logs (D) focus on device authentication and network access, which may not directly reveal the time of the exploit.\n\nThus, Firewall logs are the most appropriate starting point for identifying the time of the initial exploit.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Anyio"}],"question_id":485,"topic":"1","exam_id":368,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155568-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-536-discussion/","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1738076940,"question_text":"A security analyst learns that an attack vector, which was used as a part of a recent incident, was a well-known IoT device exploit.
