CSMA/CD works by checking for active communications and attempting to transmit when clear. If a collision occurs, then it will use the back-off timer.\nCSMA with Collision Avoidance is incorrect. Since it is not conventionally possible to determine if or when a device is transmitting, collisions are inevitable. To counter this, a timer mechanism is in place to regulate transmissions and will back-off pre-emptively, actively avoiding as many collisions as it can.\nMultiprotocol Label Switching is incorrect; this relates to labelling switched traffic of different protocols and has no relevance to collision aversion.\nOpen Shortest Path First is incorrect; OSPF helps find the shortest path through a network for fast and efficient delivery of data and has no relevance to collision aversion.","comment_id":"221261","upvote_count":"20","timestamp":"1605633180.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following will listen on the line to ensure there is no traffic transmitting and implement a back-off timer if a collision occurs?","question_images":[]},{"id":"7MTkhJh3jziV4NmU1yEC","exam_id":356,"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"Dirkster","timestamp":"1607002380.0","content":"I've personally seen this happen.
