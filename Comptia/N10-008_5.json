For example, when you sit at starbucks and connect to the wifi, you do do not want someone else to acess your device. Normally guest wifi SSIDs are configured with client device isolation so that one client cannot access another. But this does not stop rogue AP. \n\nThere are two types of Rogue APs. One in which you connect an AP and connect that AP to existing network. This normally happens by mistake (lack of knowledge). But the other is intentional called Evil-Twin. I do not think evil twin can be prevented except by monitoring for any rogue signals. Rogue-APs can be stopped by port security (which is about the switch so that nobody else can connect to the switch port, thus also not the rogue AP)","timestamp":"1680880860.0","poster":"famco","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"content":"Client isolation means, that the clients (wlan connected devices) can not communicate with each other but still have access to the ressources offered by the remaining network (internet, servers, printer etc.)","upvote_count":"3","poster":"lordguck","timestamp":"1667597580.0","comment_id":"711386"}],"timestamp":"1658501100.0","poster":"julia_jjj","content":"Can someone explain why it wouldn't be C?","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/71615-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-120-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","choices":{"A":"Password complexity","C":"Wireless client isolation","B":"Port security","D":"Secure SNMP"},"question_text":"A rogue AP was found plugged in and providing Internet access to employees in the break room.
