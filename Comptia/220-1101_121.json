If the fuser is not working correctly or is nearing the end of its life, it can result in improper toner bonding, leading to double images or ghosting on the printouts.\n\nIn this scenario, the fact that a maintenance kit has not been installed in more than a year suggests that the fuser might be overdue for replacement or maintenance. Over time, the fuser's components, such as the fuser roller or heating element, can wear out, leading to print quality issues like double imaging.","comment_id":"967861"},{"poster":"ZioPier","timestamp":"1682860380.0","comment_id":"885239","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe tranasfer roller is where the image is composed and then transferred to the paper. after every transfer, the roller is wiped by the cleaning blade so a new image can be composed.

Separation pad\n\nExplanation:\nThe separation pad is responsible for separating the pages of paper as they are fed into the printer. If the separation pad is worn or damaged, it may cause multiple sheets of paper to feed through at once, resulting in double images being printed. If a maintenance kit has not been installed in more than a year, it is likely that the separation pad is worn and needs to be replaced. Replacing the separation pad should resolve the issue of double images appearing on the printouts.","timestamp":"1676314980.0","poster":"ronniehaang","comment_id":"807726","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBased on the information given, it appears that the issue is most likely caused by a component that is in the laser printing process. Since this is a laser printer and not an inkjet printer, option C (Ink cartridge) is not applicable.\n\nThe most likely cause of the double images appearing on the printouts is a problem with the fuser. The fuser is responsible for fixing the toner particles onto the page, and if it is not functioning properly, the toner may not properly adhere to the paper, leading to a double image or other issues.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D (Fuser). It is recommended to have the printer serviced and have the fuser unit replaced to resolve the issue. Additionally, it is important to regularly maintain the printer by installing a maintenance kit to ensure its proper functioning and extend its lifespan.","poster":"Shah_Naaz","timestamp":"1675923960.0","comment_id":"802885"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1674488640.0","poster":"takomaki","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"785565","content":"So, i looked it up, and apparently the fuser is a very common cause of ghosting, since the fuser uses a roller as well.

If the fuser doesnt heat up the paper enough, it causes smudging, meaning it failed to FUSE the toner to the page. The whole point of the fuser is to keep the image from getting wiped off. Ghosting is caused by leftover toner on the drum or the transfer roller. The source of leftover toner is either a broken cleaning blade (which would leave it on the drum) or bad erasure lamps (which would leave the toner on the transfer roller)[side note: my source calls it a \"developing roller\" which im 99% sure is the same as the transfer roller since it only mentions transfer roller in irrelevant contexts]","poster":"takomaki"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nits d fuser","poster":"minx98","comment_id":"748793","timestamp":"1671364020.0"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1691521140.0","comment_id":"975941","content":"it something related to a double image and not replacing the maintenance kit for a long time","poster":"nhammoody"}],"poster":"DDM6486","content":"\"The printouts appear to have double images on them\"\n\nGhosting can be transfer roller OR fuser (or drum which isn't listed), but if it were the fuser you would have issues with the previous printout, but it specifies \"double image\".
