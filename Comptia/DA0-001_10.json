A static report is a report that is created using a snapshot of data at a specific point in time, and the data does not change unless the report is manually updated. In this case, the data analyst should create a static report for the second-quarter 2020 board meeting, which will be held on July 15, 2020, after the numbers are finalized. This means that the report will be based on data from the second quarter of 2020 that has already been collected and processed, and the data will not change unless the report is manually updated. The other options (real-time, self-service, and dynamic) are not applicable in this situation because the report is not being created for a live event or for real-time data, and it is not being created for self-service or dynamic use.","timestamp":"1704176580.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"763545"}],"answer_description":"","question_id":46,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/93524-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-14-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1672640580,"question_text":"A data analyst is asked to create a sales report for the second-quarter 2020 board meeting, which will include a review of the business’s performance through the second quarter.
