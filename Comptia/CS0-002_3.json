Placing the firewall behind the VPN, that way only authenticated traffic will reach the firewall, decreasing the firewall's exposure to the internet. \nPlacing a VPN server in front of the firewall can lead to greater security in some cases. Remember that a VPN allows users who are external to the network to feel like they are sitting on a machine inside the network. A hacker who hijacks a connection to a VPN server that is inside the firewall will be able to do some serious damage. However, if you have a dedicated VPN box that sits outside the firewall and that is only capable of sending VPN traffic through the firewall, you can limit the damage a hacker can do by hacking the VPN box. This option also allows you to limit the resources authenticated VPN users can access on the local network by filtering their traffic at the firewall.\n\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/configuring-vpn-connections-with-firewalls/","comment_id":"584549","poster":"Davar39","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"C is correct","poster":"Xyz_40","timestamp":"1647174960.0","comment_id":"566819","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nc is the answer","comment_id":"548092","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1644961620.0","poster":"cysa_1127"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Thantan","comment_id":"413357","content":"C.

Shutdown the virtual machine - It will stop the other files manipulation and spreading. It also preserves the server for investigation and no other changes will happen anymore. You don't want to do snapshots(aka BACKUP) on that server coz it will take a lot of time especially if this is a big server and has lots of files. If you want to back it up, you can clone it while it is shut down. If it happens that the compromise is a worm, then it will change the files while the server is still on, the time that the snapshots is done, you cant even recover any files coz the whole thing is encrypted. This applies also in removing the NIC. Compromise always needs immediate action not another problem.\n\nSecondly, which of the following should be the FIRST steps to confirm?\n\nE. Check the logs in the hypervisor on that specific VM to investigate. Even if the server is shut down, checking the logs of the hypervisor will still work since this is the host logs, this is your first step to confirm."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA and C","poster":"gwanedm","timestamp":"1669857720.0","comment_id":"732142"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1666066260.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"697866","content":"You do understand that analysis can be done through a snapshot, right?
