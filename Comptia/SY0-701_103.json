Which of the following would the organization consider to be the highest priority?","unix_timestamp":1739238900,"answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Availability\n\nExplanation:\nA fail-open configuration means that, in the event of a failure, the firewall will allow all inbound traffic rather than blocking it. This is typically done to ensure availability, meaning that the website or service remains accessible to users even if there are issues with the firewall. The priority in this case is to avoid service disruption, ensuring the website remains available to users even during a failure scenario.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive data is important, but in a fail-open scenario, the primary concern is ensuring that the service remains available, not necessarily confidential.\nB. Non-repudiation: Ensures that actions are traceable and verifiable, but it is less relevant to the firewall's configuration or availability.\nD. Integrity: While integrity is crucial to protect data from being tampered with, the fail-open configuration prioritizes availability, allowing traffic even in the event of failure.","comment_id":"1354784","timestamp":"1739238900.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"test_arrow"}],"question_id":511,"exam_id":368,"choices":{"B":"Non-repudiation","C":"Availability","A":"Confidentiality","D":"Integrity"},"topic":"1","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156332-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-560-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true},{"id":"4pNOJY1DBFp6sDP8mrpc","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Obfuscation","C":"Hashing","A":"Masking","D":"Encryption"},"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":368,"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1739238960,"question_text":"An engineer needs to ensure that a script has not been modified before it is launched.

Hashing\n\nExplanation:\nHashing creates a unique fixed-size output (hash value) from the script. By calculating the hash of the original script and comparing it with the hash of the script before launch, the engineer can confirm whether the script has been modified. If the hashes match, the script is unchanged; if they differ, the script has been altered.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. Masking: Typically used to hide sensitive data, like credit card numbers, rather than ensuring the integrity of a script.\nB. Obfuscation: Involves making code difficult to understand or read, but does not guarantee that the script has not been modified.\nD. Encryption: Protects data confidentiality but does not inherently check for modifications; it focuses on securing data from unauthorized access."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156333-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-561-discussion/"},{"id":"uO8XHdhTDMGQE79Qxn1v","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"exam_id":368,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1354787","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Assigning roles and responsibilities for owners, controllers, and custodians\n\nExplanation:\nOne of the most critical elements of effective security governance is ensuring that clear roles and responsibilities are assigned to individuals or groups within the organization, such as owners, controllers, and custodians. These roles define who is responsible for the security of data, systems, and processes, ensuring accountability and alignment with security policies and practices.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. Discovering and documenting external considerations: While important for risk management, external considerations are secondary to defining internal roles and responsibilities in governance.\nB. Developing procedures for employee onboarding and offboarding: This is essential for operational security but falls under procedural management rather than governance itself.\nD. Defining and monitoring change management procedures: While important for maintaining security, this is a part of operational controls rather than the core structure of security governance.","timestamp":"1739239020.0","poster":"test_arrow","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer":"C","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1739239020,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Discovering and documenting external considerations","B":"Developing procedures for employee onboarding and offboarding","D":"Defining and monitoring change management procedures","C":"Assigning roles and responsibilities for owners, controllers, and custodians"},"question_id":513,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156334-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-562-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-02-11 02:57:00","question_text":"Which of the following is the most important element when defining effective security governance?"},{"id":"A1vpMStiHvOuaZAOs8MH","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"D":"RFID keylogger","B":"Supply chain","A":"Embedded rootkit","C":"Firmware failure"},"exam_id":368,"question_text":"A contractor is required to visually inspect the motherboards of all new servers that are purchased to determine whether the servers were tampered with.

Supply chain\n\nExplanation:\nThe contractor is inspecting the motherboards of new servers to ensure they have not been tampered with during the manufacturing or shipping process. This is a classic example of mitigating supply chain risks, specifically the risk of malicious modifications or unauthorized components being introduced during the supply process, which could compromise the security of the servers.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. Embedded rootkit: While a rootkit is a form of malware that could be installed on a device, a physical inspection of hardware is aimed at detecting hardware tampering, not malware.\nC. Firmware failure: This refers to issues with the deviceâ€™s firmware, but inspecting the motherboard would not directly address firmware issues.\nD. RFID keylogger: This type of attack involves tracking or logging keystrokes via RFID, which is not directly related to inspecting motherboards for tampering."}]},{"id":"qTt7M1Aszo4x0rlyRj08","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1739239080,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156336-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-564-discussion/","exam_id":368,"question_id":515,"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"C":"On-path attack","D":"Buffer overflow","A":"User impersonation","B":"Rootkit"},"question_text":"Which of the following could potentially be introduced at the time of side loading?","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"test_arrow","comment_id":"1354789","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Rootkit\n\nExplanation:\nSide loading refers to the process of installing applications or software from unofficial or untrusted sources, bypassing the standard security measures of an operating system or application store. During side loading, malicious software such as a rootkit can be introduced, which allows attackers to gain deep, hidden access to the system, often with administrative privileges. Rootkits can remain undetected for long periods, enabling further malicious activity.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. User impersonation: This typically occurs through credential theft or social engineering, not directly due to side loading.\nC. On-path attack: An on-path attack (previously known as man-in-the-middle) involves intercepting communications, typically happening through network vulnerabilities, not side loading.\nD. Buffer overflow: While a buffer overflow is a type of software vulnerability, it is not typically introduced directly through side loading; it typically arises from poor coding practices.","timestamp":"1739239080.0"}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-02-11 02:58:00"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":581,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"SY0-701","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"id":368},"currentPage":103},"__N_SSP":true}
