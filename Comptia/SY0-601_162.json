ARP poisoning affected the machines in the building and caused the kiosks to send a copy of all the submitted credentials to a malicious machine.\n\nExplanation:\n\nARP Poisoning (Option D): ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning involves manipulating the ARP cache on a local network, leading to the association of incorrect MAC addresses with IP addresses. In this scenario, if ARP poisoning occurred, it could lead to the kiosks sending a copy of the submitted credentials to a malicious machine before reaching the legitimate server. This could happen if the ARP cache on the local network was manipulated to redirect traffic through a malicious machine.","poster":"Payu1994","comment_id":"1139017","timestamp":"1706941080.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"licks0re","timestamp":"1706129700.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nClearly C, see comments below.","comment_id":"1131132","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706129640.0","poster":"licks0re","comment_id":"1131130","comments":[{"content":"DNS poisoning redirecting the time-keeping website to a malicious domain is less likely since employees would likely notice if they were redirected to a different website.

DNS poisoning is a technique that alters the DNS records of a domain name, so that it points to a different IP address than the legitimate one. This would redirect users to a fake website that looks like the real one, but steals their credentials.
