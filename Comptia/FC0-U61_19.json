Binary is a numbering system where each single digit can express only two values, in the range 0 to 1. The reason binary works well with computers is that these two values can represent the off/on states of the transistors that make up computer memory. Binary can also be referred to as base 2.\n\nCompTIA Lesson - ITF+ Bundle","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"466142"},{"content":"Correct Answer","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"418045","poster":"bagyi","timestamp":"1643678580.0"},{"content":"Ive gotten a lot of the wording errors","poster":"Nicmc","timestamp":"1633012320.0","comment_id":"325143","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Example; 128.64.32.16.8.4.2.1 in this 32bits , if we put the first 4 bits on , it will be\n1.1.1.1.0.0.0.0 that means that the first 4 bits are \"on\" and the last 4 are \"off\" in the octet.","timestamp":"1611380220.0","comment_id":"141616","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Gedy10"},{"timestamp":"1587478740.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Binary is 0's and 1's.
