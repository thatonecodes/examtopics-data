Encryption replaces cleartext with ciphertext, while hashing calculates a checksum.\nExplanation:\n✔ Encryption converts plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key, allowing data to be decrypted when needed.\n✔ Hashing generates a fixed-length checksum (hash) from input data, ensuring data integrity but not reversibility (i.e., hashes cannot be decrypted).\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. Encryption protects data in transit, while hashing protects data at rest.\n❌ Incorrect – Encryption protects both data in transit and at rest, while hashing is used for data integrity verification, not storage security.\nC. Encryption ensures data integrity, while hashing ensures data confidentiality.\n❌ Incorrect – Encryption ensures confidentiality, and hashing ensures integrity, not the other way around.\nD. Encryption uses a public-key exchange, while hashing uses a private key.\n❌ Incorrect – Hashing does not use any keys. Public-key exchange applies only to asymmetric encryption, not encryption as a whole.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1350389","content":"Selected Answer: B\nEncrypted data hackers cannot understand, but hackers can alter the data. That's to say it ensures confidentiality but not integrity. \nEncryption works with both data in transit and rest.\nEncryption uses a public key (SSL), a private key (Asymetric), and a symmetric key (AES).\nBut Hash does not need any keys.

Peer review requirements\n\nExplanation:\nPeer review requirements are directly related to software development methodologies and are a critical part of ensuring code quality, security, and adherence to best practices. Including peer review requirements in the organization’s documentation aligns with the CISO’s focus on integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).\n\nMultifactor authentication (B) is a security control but is more related to access management than software development methodologies.\n\nBranch protection tests (C) are specific to version control systems (e.g., Git) and are more operational in nature rather than a policy-level requirement.\n\nSecrets management configurations (D) are important for securing sensitive information like API keys and passwords, but they are more of an implementation detail rather than a policy-level documentation item."}],"choices":{"C":"Branch protection tests","A":"Peer review requirements","D":"Secrets management configurations","B":"Multifactor authentication"},"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1738073280,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2025-01-28 15:08:00","exam_id":368,"topic":"1","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155559-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-525-discussion/","answer_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"PQFJmoV3g7Y3GKswGPY1","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"D":"Software development life cycle policy","A":"Business continuity plan","C":"Acceptable use policy","B":"Change management procedure"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1739579940,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156520-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-526-discussion/","question_id":474,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1356649","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Honeytoken\nExplanation:\n✔ A honeytoken is a decoy piece of data (e.g., fake credentials, database records, or files) designed to detect unauthorized access.\n✔ In this scenario, the analyst created a fake account (credentials) and stored them in a hidden spreadsheet, setting up an alert when accessed.\n✔ This helps identify malicious activity if an attacker discovers and attempts to use the credentials.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA.
