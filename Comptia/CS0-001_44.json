Adversaries donâ€™t want to duplicate efforts or exfiltration streams because such duplication would also make them easier to detect. Instead, they will typically coordinate activities within a compromised network. This means that even if multiple agents are searching for sensitive files in different subnets, they will tend to copy those files at the coordination hub at which they are staged, prepared, and relayed to an external repository. Unfortunately, these internal flows will usually be difficult to detect because they may resemble legitimate functions of the organization.\""}],"poster":"s3curity1","content":"There's very little information for this question to say that this is data exfil.
