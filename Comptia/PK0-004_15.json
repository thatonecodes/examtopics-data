I feel this is a technical question but easily distinguishable. Poor sound quality during calls is due to bad connection. With this being said, internet is the problem... Project wiki, text messages, and social media all rely on the internet. So one-on-one meetings regardless of the speed, are more effective than any communication online. Also, they type of communication needs to be considered.

Time sensitive means this needs to happen quickly. One on one meetings may or may not be able to happen quickly depending on where the team members are located.

When I think of critical conference calls I think of complex information that needs to be distributed, far more than can be appropriate to text on a phone. If the PM doesn't opt for group texts and opts for one-on-one texts, then it may as well be option A.
