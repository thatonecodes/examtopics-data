Rapid elasticity refers to allowing users to automatically request additional space. Provisioning is seamless\nB. Metered utilization charges users based on periodic usage of storage space, number of API calls, etc monitored by the storage provider. This is the definition provided by Techopedia. \nC. Shared resources refers to multiple clients using one server provisioned to access their dedicated space on that hardware. Since multiple users are using the CPU, RAM, and hard disk of the server computer, this makes the hardware \"Shared\"\nD. High availability refers to a server consistently being accessible by client devices\nC and D don't make sense. In this case, rapid elasticity is the answer.
