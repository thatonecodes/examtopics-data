In this scenario:\n\nThe software is behaving abnormally and generating unexpected outbound traffic, which suggests it may have been compromised to execute additional, malicious code.\nRandom high-port outbound traffic is a common indicator of malware or other unauthorized processes attempting to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735411440.0","poster":"jbmac","comment_id":"1333110"},{"timestamp":"1731976740.0","comment_id":"1314310","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Memory injection\n\nMemory injection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to manipulate the memory of a running application. This can lead to malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary code or altering the application's normal operation. In this scenario, the abnormal behavior (outbound traffic over random high ports) suggests that the software has been compromised to execute unauthorized operations, which is characteristic of a memory injection exploit.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"chalaka"},{"comment_id":"1308804","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Habbiti","content":"The correct answer is C, side loading\nSide loading refers to a situation where software loads a malicious or unauthorized component or library (often from an untrusted source) instead of a legitimate one. In this case, the abnormal behavior (outbound traffic over random high ports) suggests that the application may have been compromised, and a malicious payload has been introduced, causing the software to behave unexpectedly.
