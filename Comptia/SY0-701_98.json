Tailgating: This refers to an unauthorized person physically following an authorized person through a secured entry point without using their own credentials.

Tailgating.\n\nTailgating happens when an unauthorized person follows an authorized person into a secure area by closely following them through a door or gate without proper access. The multiple entries from an employee's ID badge within a short time period (two minutes) suggest that the employee may have entered and allowed someone else to follow them through, which is typical of tailgating.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the other options:\n\nA. RFID cloning: This would involve copying the RFID credentials (ID badge) and using them to gain unauthorized access. However, there’s no indication that the ID badge itself was cloned, only that multiple entries are logged in a short period.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"1eccfc0"}],"choices":{"C":"Shoulder surfing","D":"Tailgating","B":"Side-channel attack","A":"RFID cloning"},"topic":"1","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155290-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-537-discussion/","question_text":"A company’s gate access logs show multiple entries from an employee’s ID badge within a two-minute period.

Given that the password appears in plaintext, the first action should be to advise the user to change their password—especially since it may be associated with a critical account (e.g., Gmail) that could be used for further attacks.
