Inspect the connectors for any wires that are touching or exposed.\n\nExplanation:\nCat 8 cables are highly sensitive to proper termination due to their high-frequency performance requirements. Passthrough plugs can sometimes cause wires to touch or leave exposed conductors, leading to crosstalk. Inspecting the connectors for these issues is the quickest and least invasive first step in troubleshooting."},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"SuntzuLegacy","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. Inspect the connectors for any wires that are touching or exposed.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen experiencing cross-talk with a Cat 8 cable, one of the most common causes is improper termination, especially when using passthrough plugs. Improperly aligned or exposed wires can lead to signal interference and cross-talk. By visually inspecting the connectors, the electrician can identify if wires are incorrectly aligned, exposed, or not fully inserted into the connector.","comment_id":"1320012","timestamp":"1732935000.0"}],"exam_id":358},{"id":"0LNpEDich35k1TXGnV5y","question_id":258,"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1334990","upvote_count":"2","poster":"HeatSquad77","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. tracert\n\nExplanation:\nThe tracert (or traceroute on Linux/Mac) command is used to track the path that packets take from the source device to the destination server.

Check to see if the end connections were wrapped in copper tape before terminating.\n\nExplanation:\nCat 8 cables are designed for high-speed, high-frequency environments, and proper shielding is crucial to minimize interference. The shielding needs to be continuous, and ensuring that the end connections are wrapped in copper tape before termination helps maintain this shielding. If this step is overlooked, it can lead to higher interference and degraded performance.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1320015","poster":"SuntzuLegacy","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. Check to see if the end connections were wrapped in copper tape before terminating.\n\nExplanation:\nCat 8 cables are designed for high-speed data transmission in data centers and have stringent requirements to minimize interference and maintain shielding integrity. One critical aspect of Cat 8 installation is ensuring that the shielding (often foil or braided) remains continuous and properly grounded, especially at termination points. Wrapping the end connections in copper tape before termination ensures proper contact with the keystone jack, maintaining the shield's effectiveness and minimizing interference.","timestamp":"1732935060.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2024-11-30 03:51:00","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":358,"choices":{"B":"Use passthrough modular crimping plugs instead of traditional crimping plugs.","D":"Run a speed test on a device that can only achieve 100Mbps speeds.","A":"Check to see if the end connections were wrapped in copper tape before terminating.","C":"Connect the RX/TX wires to different pins."},"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1732935060,"question_text":"After installing a series of Cat 8 keystones, a data center architect notices higher than normal interference during tests.
