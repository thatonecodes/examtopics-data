Out of band\n\nExplanation:\nOut-of-band (OOB) management requires a separate network or set of IP addresses to manage devices independently of the production network.

Administrative Distance"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nI'm a bit torn here. Both Hop Count and Administrative Distance seem relevant, but I need to think about the context. Since the routing protocol isn't dynamic, they might be using static routing or have administrative nodes set up certain rules based on hop counts. Therefore, choosing Administrative Distance could make sense as a way to configure backup routes by applying administrative criteria that include hop counts.\nBut then again, hop count is more of a metric used during route discovery and management rather than an administrative setting for backup routing. So, perhaps the correct answer is D. Hop Count if they're using static routing based on known network segments, or C. Administrative distance as an administrative rule that includes hop counts.\nI'm still leaning towards C. Administrative distance because it allows applying administrative criteria like considering hop count when setting up backup routes.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1360446","poster":"93831b0","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740301980.0","content":"After some more research have also found that Hop count is a routing metric used by older distance-vector routing protocols like RIP.

Administrative distance\n\nExplanation:\nAdministrative distance (AD) is a value used by routers to prioritize routes when multiple routes to the same destination are available. By configuring static routes with different administrative distances, the network administrator can set one route as the primary (lower AD) and another as the backup (higher AD). If the primary route fails, the router will automatically switch to the backup route with the higher AD.","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1736178300,"choices":{"A":"Neighbor adjacency","C":"Administrative distance","D":"Hop count","B":"Link state flooding"}},{"id":"S0e9CMZ9Ue8lXjCUTz6L","topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Identify the symptoms.","D":"Determine any changes.","A":"Duplicate the problem.","C":"Gather information."},"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":8,"discussion":[{"poster":"HeatSquad77","comment_id":"1337214","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1736178360.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
