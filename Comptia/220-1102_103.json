Following the change management process in this scenario is important because it ensures that a rollback plan is in place in case the software breaks an application.

A rollback plan can be implemented in case the software breaks an application is the best reason to follow the change management process in this scenario. The change management process is a formal process for making changes to an IT system, and it includes steps such as assessing the impact of the change, notifying stakeholders, and implementing a rollback plan in case the change causes unexpected issues. In this scenario, the security software was accidentally uninstalled from all servers, and there is a risk that the software may break an application or cause other issues when it is reinstalled. Implementing a rollback plan as part of the change management process can help ensure that any issues that arise can be quickly resolved by reverting to the previous configuration. While notifying owners, performing a risk assessment, and making end-users aware of the scope of the change are important considerations in the change management process, they may not be the best reason in this particular scenario.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"IconGT"},{"comment_id":"830730","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. A rollback plan can be implemented in case the software breaks an application.\n\nFollowing the change management process is important because it ensures that changes are properly planned, tested, approved, and implemented with minimum risk and impact on the environment. By going through the change management process, a rollback plan can be developed in case the reinstalled software causes problems or breaks an application. This will help to minimize the impact on the environment and ensure that the environment is functioning correctly.
