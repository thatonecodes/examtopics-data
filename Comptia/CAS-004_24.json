It is literally\na site that has electricity but no computer equipment, perhaps not even any\nfurniture, but it is open and available for use.

It may take days or even weeks to set up the necessary hardware, install software, and restore data.\nCost:\n\nCold sites are relatively cost-effective compared to warm and hot sites. The organization pays for the facility and basic infrastructure but saves on maintaining a fully operational IT environment.\nUse Case:\n\nCold sites are suitable for organizations with less critical applications or those that can afford longer downtimes.
