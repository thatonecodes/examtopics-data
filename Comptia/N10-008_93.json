In a public cloud model, the corporate email systems would be hosted in a cloud environment that is shared by multiple organizations or tenants. The company would not need to worry about maintenance of the underlying server operating system (OS) or platform, as those responsibilities would be handled by the cloud service provider. The company would have the advantage of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to access email systems from anywhere with internet connectivity. Public cloud models are typically managed by third-party providers and are accessible to a wide range of customers over the internet.","poster":"CookieChip","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"873354","timestamp":"1681801140.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nI'm gonna go with Chatgpt on this one:\nThe model that the company should choose to move its on-premises corporate email systems to a multitenant product hosted in the cloud where no maintenance of the underlying server OS or platform is required is the Public cloud model. The public cloud is a type of cloud computing where cloud-based services and resources are provided over the internet to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. In this model, the resources are owned, managed, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider, who is responsible for the infrastructure, underlying server OS, and platform maintenance, leaving the customer free to focus on their application or service. This option provides the greatest degree of scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness while reducing management overhead.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Gustitute","comment_id":"869769","timestamp":"1681419660.0"}],"answers_community":["A (82%)","C (18%)"],"choices":{"D":"Community","C":"Hybrid","A":"Public","B":"Private"},"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-04-12 13:57:00","question_text":"A Fortune 500 company would like to move its on-premises corporate email systems to a multitenant product hosted in the cloud where no maintenance of the underlying server OS or platform is required.

In a router-on-a-stick deployment with multiple VLANs, an engineer would need to configure subinterfaces.\n\nA router-on-a-stick deployment is a networking configuration that enables routing between multiple VLANs using a single physical interface on a router. In this configuration, the router interface is divided into multiple logical interfaces, known as subinterfaces, each of which is associated with a specific VLAN. By configuring subinterfaces on the router, the engineer can route traffic between multiple VLANs using a single physical interface.\n\nEnabling inter-VLAN routing on a multilayer switch (B) would require configuring a Layer 3 interface on the switch, not subinterfaces.\n\nConfiguring VLAN trunk links between switches (C) would not require subinterfaces.\n\nConnecting a router that does not support 802.1Q VLAN tags (D) would require configuring the router to use a different VLAN tagging protocol, but it would not require configuring subinterfaces.","upvote_count":"10"},{"comment_id":"1088515","timestamp":"1733405160.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Hot site is the most appropriate solution for the CEO's requirements. A hot site is a fully redundant data center that has all the necessary hardware, software, and data to support a company's critical business functions in the event of a disaster. The hot site is typically located in a different geographic location than the primary site to ensure business continuity in case of a natural disaster or other disruptive event. The hot site is continuously operational and has real-time data synchronization to ensure zero data loss.\n\nA cloud site may be a viable solution as well, as it provides automatic replication and redundancy of data and services across multiple geographic locations. However, the CEO's requirement for fully redundant equipment may not be met with a cloud site.\n\nA warm site is a partially configured and equipped data center that requires some setup time to become operational, so it is not an appropriate solution for zero data loss requirements.\n\nA cold site is a completely empty data center that requires significant setup time to become operational, making it an unsuitable solution for a CEO who wants to ensure that business operations are not disrupted.","timestamp":"1728959580.0"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1681525980,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/106221-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-517-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-15 04:33:00","answer_description":"","question_id":465,"question_text":"The Chief Executive Officer of a company wants to ensure business operations are not disrupted in the event of a disaster.
