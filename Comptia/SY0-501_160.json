The file containing the passwords for the FIRST system has been compromised; now we can suppose that a hacker knows all the passwords used by each users to access the FIRST system; obviously now he can access all the accounts of the FIRST system; but how can he use this knowledge to access the SECOND system??? \n\nIf the password used for this SECOND system were ALL different, the knowledge of the passwords for the FIRST system would be USELESS to access the SECOND system; if the hacker managed to use some passwords of the FIRST system to access some accounts of the SECOND system, the only possible explanation is that some users are using two identical passwords for both the systems, meaning that some of the compromised passwords are valid for multiple systems (answer C). At least that's what I understood from the described scenario.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Duranio"}],"content":"Think of it this way. The compromised system has had it's password file downloaded and hacked (I find it odd that they use brute-force hacked) then those passwords are used on the \"NOT been compromised\" system that has had \"unusual login activity\" Because there is no SSO, every system has their own password management (Identification and Authentication) The hacker found a vulnerable system, got the passwords and now all systems are vulnerable. The password complexity means nothing if those passwords are stored on a file that can be offloaded and hacked.","poster":"Autox","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1594832940.0","comment_id":"135909"},{"comment_id":"134712","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1594717680.0","content":"I think that C actually makes more sense.","poster":"Riise"}],"exam_id":366,"answers_community":[],"isMC":true}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Comptia","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"SY0-501","isImplemented":true,"id":366,"numberOfQuestions":1043},"currentPage":160},"__N_SSP":true}
