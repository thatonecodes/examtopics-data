However, the 2.4 GHz band does not support a high number of individual channels and is often congested, with both other Wi-Fi networks and other types of wireless technology, such as Bluetooth®. Also, microwave ovens work at frequencies in the 2.4 GHz band. Consequently, with the 2.4 GHz band, there is increased risk of interference, and the maximum achievable data rates are typically lower than with 5 GHz.\"\n5 GHz - \"The 5 GHz standard is less effective at penetrating solid surfaces and so does not support the maximum ranges achieved with 2.4 GHz standards, but the band supports more individual channels and suffers less from congestion and interference, meaning it supports higher data rates at shorter ranges.\""},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"okayhey","comment_id":"1132567","comments":[{"comment_id":"1160954","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://www.antaira.com/Blog_Difference-Between-2.4GHz-and-5GHz-Wireless\nlooks like 2.4 GHz uses 11 channels (only 1,6, and 11 are used mainly so they dont overlap) and 5 GHz uses 24 non overlapping channels.","poster":"amityGanoofib","timestamp":"1724782680.0"}],"timestamp":"1721995740.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nBut I want to know more about the channels."}],"choices":{"C":"2.4GHz has a higher data rate. 5GHz has 23 channels.","B":"2.4GHz penetrates solid objects more effectively. 5GHz provides faster data connections.","A":"2.4GHz has less interference. 5GHz transmits in lower speed.","F":"2.4GHz has a higher bandwidth. 5GHz has lower transmit power.","D":"2.4GHz has 11 channels. 5GHz has no data interference.","E":"2.4GHz has a higher coverage area. 5GHz has higher bandwidth."},"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1665867120,"answers_community":["BE (100%)"],"exam_id":339,"topic":"1","answer":"BE","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/85555-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-81-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following options provides correct information about 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless frequencies?
