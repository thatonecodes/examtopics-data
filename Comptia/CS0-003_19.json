The risk would decrease because RDP is blocked by the firewall\n\nExplanation:\nPort 3389 is typically associated with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). If a vulnerability is identified that can be exploited over this port, the risk could be significant if the port is exposed.\n\nWeb Application Firewalls (WAF): A WAF is primarily designed to protect web applications from common web-based attacks (like SQL injection, XSS, etc.). It does not generally protect non-web protocols like RDP, which uses port 3389.\n\nNetwork Firewalls: If the network firewall is configured to block port 3389 (RDP), then the risk associated with this vulnerability is significantly reduced because the vulnerable service would not be accessible externally.","comment_id":"1266553","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723737840.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1265974","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI originally thought C because the wording of the question is tricky.
