The only time you document anything in a SOP is if the procedure to complete a certain task has changed. ex. if a company normally telnets to routers then they decide to change that SOP to using SSH then that woulr be documented no configuration changes will be in a SOP. On the other hand Change management is where you would document when you SSH into a router and made configuration changes. A TACAS+ will keep copies of all ASCII keys used to configuration that info can then be cut and pasted into a Changemangement DOcumentation.","timestamp":"1619972940.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"347874"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"401856","content":"I agree with you after rereading the question.
