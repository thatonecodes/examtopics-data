A software loopback towards the router usually only loops the DSU functionality of a CSU/DSU. A hardware loopback is able to prove that the entire CSU/DSU is not at fault.\"\n\nCSU/DSU (Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit) Explainer:\n\"A CSU/DSU (channel service unit/data service unit) is a digital-interface device used to connect data terminal equipment (DTE), such as a router, to a digital circuit, such as a Digital Signal 1 (DS1) T1 line. The CSU/DSU implements two different functions. The channel service unit (CSU) is responsible for the connection to the telecommunication network, while the data service unit (DSU) is responsible for managing the interface with the DTE.\n\nA CSU/DSU is the equivalent of the modem for an entire LAN. The DCE, commonly a modem or CSU/DSU, is the device used to convert the user data from the DTE into a form acceptable to the WAN service provider transmission link.\"","poster":"connelldma2","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"You need the need to physically punch-down the cable for conductivity. \"demarcation ' is the key word.","poster":"Txstan","timestamp":"1611855420.0","comment_id":"278724","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"how is it A?","timestamp":"1610400900.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kingbam","comment_id":"265083"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"sh3hT7I2Z9hxJUrwJe4n","discussion":[{"content":"Logical network separation is also known a VLAN, and 802.1Q is the IEEE standard that enables trunking.","comment_id":"402674","poster":"b0ugi3","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1625831400.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following properties should be configured to extend logical network separation on an uplink interface to a second switch?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/57528-exam-n10-007-topic-1-question-632-discussion/","answer":"A","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1625831400,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"question_id":485,"choices":{"B":"Multiple untagged ports","C":"Port mirroring","A":"802.1Q trunking","D":"Management VLAN"},"topic":"1","exam_id":356,"timestamp":"2021-07-09 13:50:00","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":701,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","id":356,"name":"N10-007"},"currentPage":97},"__N_SSP":true}
