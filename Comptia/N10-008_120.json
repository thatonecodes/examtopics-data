It ensures that the information sent from the source arrives at the destination exactly as it was sent, without any unauthorized modifications.

DNS (Domain Name System) is a service that resolves domain names to IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.comptia.org is resolved to the IP address 104.18.25.140 by a DNS server. If the host has incorrect DNS settings, such as an invalid or unreachable DNS server address, it will not be able to resolve domain names to IP addresses, and therefore it will not be able to access websites by their names. The output in the image shows that the host can ping the IP address of www.comptia.org, but it cannot ping the domain name itself, indicating a DNS problem.

Layer 3 deals with logical addressing. Layer 4 deals with \"port addressing\" (very poor wording). Option B seems very unlikely, but maybe CSMA/CA would classify as an error preventing method (collision avoidance). That feels like a stretch, though. Not to mention most Net+ materials won't mention \"error preventing\" methods. Finally, in the context of Ethernet networks, Layer 2 does not do any error correcting, so F is probably out.\n\nSo with B, C, E, and F ruled out, we have A and D. Everyone should know that Layer 2 deals with error detection, so D is a given. The last bit of garbage wording is \"local addressing.\" The standard terms are physical address, hardware address, or MAC address. Assuming that local addressing refers to MAC addresses, the overall answer is A and D.\n\nCome on CompTIA! A certification exam like this should only use clear, unambiguous, standard terminology.
