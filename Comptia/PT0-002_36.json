The DNSSEC certificate and CA: This information is related to DNS security extensions and certificate authorities, and would not be provided by a standard AXFR (zone transfer) command.\n • B. The DHCP scopes and ranges used on the network: DHCP scopes and ranges are managed by DHCP servers and are not part of the DNS zone data. They would not be included in a DNS zone transfer.\n • C. The hostnames and IP addresses of internal systems: A DNS zone transfer (AXFR) command requests a copy of the entire zone file from a DNS server. If successful, it provides detailed information about the DNS records in the zone, including hostnames, IP addresses, mail servers, and other resource records.\n • D.
