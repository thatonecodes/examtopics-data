A defective battery may not hold a charge properly, leading to the phone running out of power quickly and the need for frequent charging. The defective battery may also cause the phone to overheat, especially while charging, as the battery attempts to charge but fails to hold a charge, resulting in the battery continuing to draw power and generating heat. A broken charging port or digitizer failure would not cause the phone to get hot or affect the battery's ability to hold a charge.
