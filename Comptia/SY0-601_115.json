The most logical and what is stated in all manuals is that before making a change, it should be documented and submitted for approval. In this process, the technical analysis of why the change is made is established, and it is also noted WHEN the testing of the rule will be conducted. A testing window is determined to implement the change in a way that does not affect operations or the availability of services."},{"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1695772500.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\n\"D\" would make ACL useless","poster":"Cisco103","comment_id":"1018285"},{"timestamp":"1693991100.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWeird question, was tossing up between B and D, and ChatGPT would also swap between the two.
