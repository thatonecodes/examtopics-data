The end of this question should have said BEST in this scenario, but it only implies it without specifying.

In this case, email is not an approved communication channel, which means that it may not be secure and could potentially be intercepted by malicious actors.\n\nUsing a secure method of communication, such as an encrypted file transfer protocol or a virtual private network (VPN), will help to ensure that sensitive information, such as network design details, remains confidential and is not intercepted by unauthorized individuals.\n\nThe other options listed are not the primary reasons for using a secure method of communication during incident response. However, ensuring intellectual property remains on company servers and having a backup plan in case email access is disabled are important considerations for protecting sensitive information. Having management access to all details being exchanged is also important, but is not directly related to the security of the communication itself.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1676020080.0","comment_id":"804153","poster":"Cock"},{"poster":"absabs","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"801350","timestamp":"1675798800.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGuys focus on \"during incident response\", so i going with A."},{"timestamp":"1674569820.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CatoFong","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect answer is A","comment_id":"786596"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is explaining the importance to use secure methods","timestamp":"1667833260.0","poster":"Abyad","comment_id":"713126"},{"timestamp":"1666395840.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIndustrial designs can be protected through various forms of intellectual property (IP), including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and/or standalone design systems.\nif that email gets intercepted then the threat now has the design of the network at their disposal.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"KingDeeko","comment_id":"701226"},{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"TheSkyMan","timestamp":"1663693680.0","content":"\"It is important to remember that in the event of a network compromise, unauthorized parties are likely to be monitoring—and attempting to counteract—your efforts.
