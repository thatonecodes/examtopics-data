Input validation involves validating and sanitizing user inputs before processing them within the application. By doing so, the application can detect and prevent malicious inputs, such as SQL injection or other code injection attempts.\n\nInput validation helps ensure that data entered into web forms or other application inputs meets the expected format and criteria, thus mitigating the risk of code injection attacks.

Utilize a WAF\n\nA web application firewall (WAF) is designed to filter and monitor HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It can help protect against common web application vulnerabilities, including code injection. By implementing a WAF, it can analyze the incoming requests and block or mitigate any attempts at code injection.\n\nWhile implementing input validations (A) is a good practice, it may not be sufficient to prevent code injection entirely. Additional layers of security, such as a WAF, are recommended.\n\nDeploying multifactor authentication (MFA) (B) is not directly related to preventing code injection. MFA is used for user authentication, adding an extra layer of security to verify identities.\n\nConfiguring HIPS (D), or Host Intrusion Prevention System, may provide some additional security measures, but it is not specifically designed to prevent code injection.
