It all comes down to an important principle called zero-based indexing. Computers start counting at zero, while humans start counting at 1. When a computer needs to number 3 elements, it starts with element 0, then 1, and then 2. It’s the same with indexing. When accessing elements in a Python list, the first element resides at position 0.

Understanding the tactics of a security intrusion can help disrupt them.\n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework is a widely used method for describing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers in cyber security incidents. One of the main benefits of the framework is that it can help organizations understand the tactics used by attackers, and therefore, take steps to disrupt them or improve their defense against them. By understanding the tactics and techniques used by attackers, organizations can better identify and mitigate potential threats to their systems and data.\n\nOther benefits of the MITRE ATT&CK framework include that it can be used to help prioritize security efforts, assess the effectiveness of security controls, and measure an organization's readiness to defend against attacks. However, it should be noted that the framework is not a static one, and it's updated regularly to reflect new threats and techniques."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1259542","poster":"MeisAdriano","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI confirm A, because MITRE ATT&CK stands for \"Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge\" so you use the methodology of your adversarial to disrupt them.","timestamp":"1722540600.0"},{"poster":"Meep123","comment_id":"1025021","timestamp":"1696440060.0","content":"I love you, Mr. RRabbit.","upvote_count":"4"}],"timestamp":"2023-01-18 01:59:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"9yWFWCbS6lFZwdbcJ15E","isMC":true,"question_text":"Performing a penetration test against an environment with SCADA devices brings an additional safety risk because the:","answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/80115-exam-pt0-002-topic-1-question-40-discussion/","answers_community":["D (94%)","6%"],"choices":{"B":"devices are obsolete and are no longer available for replacement.","D":"devices may cause physical world effects.","C":"protocols are more difficult to understand.","A":"devices produce more heat and consume more power."},"exam_id":362,"unix_timestamp":1662313080,"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_id":334,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-09-04 19:38:00","discussion":[{"poster":"maps7","content":"CORRECT answer is D.","comment_id":"659425","comments":[{"timestamp":"1663014060.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"667439","content":"AGREED","poster":"sidonpc"},{"poster":"RightAsTain","content":"I second that motion","timestamp":"1664162460.0","comment_id":"679367","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"13","timestamp":"1662313080.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nSafety risk for your ego maybe (for those who pick C) haha, safety applies to real world so it's D.","poster":"Slick0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1246331","timestamp":"1720734600.0"},{"comment_id":"1089628","comments":[{"poster":"KeToopStudy","timestamp":"1703969760.0","comment_id":"1109973","content":"The problem is that the question specifies performing a penetration test not a scan ...
