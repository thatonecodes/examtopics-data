When a device sends a packet to another device on the same network, it uses the MAC address of the destination device to deliver the packet. The ARP table allows the device to determine the IP address of the destination device based on its MAC address.","timestamp":"1718658480.0","poster":"JakeCharles"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"gfGy1rBrWqF2Gseek8pZ","answer":"D","answer_images":[],"exam_id":357,"choices":{"C":"Proxy server","A":"Firewall","B":"AP","D":"IDS"},"question_text":"Which of the following BEST describes a network appliance that warns of unapproved devices that are accessing the network?","discussion":[{"poster":"danyhaddad90","content":"IDS) is a monitoring system that detects suspicious activities and generates alerts when they are detected.","timestamp":"1643820780.0","comment_id":"538965","upvote_count":"21"},{"comment_id":"797953","timestamp":"1675515360.0","poster":"StevenElev11n","content":"Selected Answer: D\n- IDS stands for Intrusion Detection System.

This is important because it will help the network administrator determine the severity of the vulnerability and the potential impact it could have on the organization.\nOnce the network administrator has assessed the risk, they can then take appropriate action to address the vulnerability. This might include patching the application, deploying a new server to host the application, or implementing other security measures to mitigate the risk.
