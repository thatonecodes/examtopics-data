Remove the snapshots\n\nIn many cases, virtual machines (VMs) cannot be deleted if there are snapshots associated with them. Snapshots represent the state of the VM at a particular point in time, and they preserve the VM's disk and memory contents. Deleting a VM with snapshots can lead to data loss and corruption. Therefore, you typically need to remove or consolidate the snapshots associated with a VM before you can successfully delete it. Once the snapshots are removed, you should be able to delete the VMs without issues.","poster":"Granddude"}],"question_text":"A technician is trying to delete six decommissioned VMs. Four VMs were deleted without issue.

This is often used to connect on-premises networks to cloud VPCs.\nOn the other hand, VPC peering allows two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) to communicate with each other as if they are part of the same network. It enables private connectivity between VPCs within the same or different AWS accounts and regions, which is not the requirement of the question.
