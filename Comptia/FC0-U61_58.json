On networks like this, clients might not be allowed to connect to the Internet directly but forced to use a proxy server instead. The proxy server can be configured as a firewall and apply other types of content filtering rules.\nSome proxy servers work transparently so that clients use them without any extra configuration of the client application. Other proxies require that client software, such as the browser, be configured with the IP address and port of the proxy server. This information would be provided by the network administrator.","comment_id":"467728","poster":"Dion79","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1729900380.0"},{"timestamp":"1739809380.0","comment_id":"1357863","poster":"lexxone","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Configure the browser proxy settings.\nIf Ann can only access intranet pages but not the Internet, it's likely that her browser is set to use an internal proxy or lacks the correct proxy configuration needed for external access. Adjusting the proxy settings should resolve the issue","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1352590","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Renew the IP address.\n\nExplanation:\nRenewing the IP address is the most likely solution because Ann is able to access local intranet pages but not external sites. This suggests that the issue might be related to a misconfigured or expired IP address, or possibly a conflict with the network configuration. By renewing the IP address (using the ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew commands on a Windows machine), Ann can get a fresh IP address, which might resolve connectivity issues with external sites.","poster":"lexxone","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1738868100.0"},{"poster":"MFZ2262","content":"Could someone please clarify this?","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721671020.0","comment_id":"411828","comments":[{"poster":"MrJelly","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"417920","content":"Proxy servers typically block access to certain parts of the internet and can act as a sort of firewall.

Encrypted flash drive\n\nExplanation:\nWhen distributing sensitive information like medical records, it is crucial to ensure that the data is protected both during storage and transit. An encrypted flash drive ensures that the data is securely stored and can only be accessed by authorized individuals who possess the encryption key.

A presentation saved to a corporate file server\n\nExplanation:\nWhen considering the highest expectation of privacy, the presentation saved to a corporate file server would typically have the highest level of privacy due to the following reasons:\n\nCorporate file servers are typically secured with strict access controls, encryption, and authentication methods to protect sensitive business data.\nThe content on corporate file servers is typically governed by company policies, and access is limited to authorized personnel only.\nThis environment is more likely to have privacy protections in place compared to other options, which may be less secure or more publicly accessible.","comment_id":"1352594"},{"comment_id":"1237133","timestamp":"1719360000.0","comments":[{"poster":"Jappo","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735791720.0","content":"locally stored means it hasnt been exchanged over email or a server.
