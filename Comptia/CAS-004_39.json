Implement iterative software releases\n\nImplementing iterative software releases, also known as an iterative or incremental development approach, involves breaking the project into smaller, manageable iterations or increments. Each iteration delivers a functioning subset of the CRM platform with essential features. This allows the company to begin releasing the product to users incrementally, even if not all the planned features are fully developed yet. Subsequent iterations build upon the previous ones, adding new features, improvements, and fixes.\n\nBy following an iterative approach, the company can start delivering value to users earlier and meet their immediate needs, even if the full CRM platform is not yet complete. Additionally, it allows for continuous testing and feedback from users throughout the development process, which helps identify issues early and prioritize future development efforts based on user feedback.\n\nChatGPT"},{"poster":"imather","comment_id":"965962","content":"Selected Answer: D\nContinuous integration allows for speedy development and incorporation of new code.

Align the exploitability metrics to the predetermined system categorization. Here's why:\nExploitability metrics in the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) take into account factors like how easily a vulnerability can be exploited. By aligning these metrics with the organization's predetermined system categorization, the analyst can adjust the ratings to reflect the specific threat environment, such as the system’s exposure or its criticality. This would help in adjusting the CVSS score to better fit the organization's risk assessment criteria while adhering to the policy of only addressing high and critical vulnerabilities. NOT C. because the impact sub score in CVSS focuses on the consequences of a vulnerability being exploited (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability). Aligning these with the system categorization may provide insight into the actual impact, but it doesn’t address the main issue of vulnerabilities breaching thresholds based on their exploitability.","poster":"Bright07"}],"choices":{"B":"Align the remediation levels to the predetermined system categorization.","A":"Align the exploitability metrics to the predetermined system categorization.","C":"Align the impact subscore requirements to the predetermined system categorization.","D":"Align the attack vectors to the predetermined system categorization."},"question_id":195,"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/109791-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-274-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1684584780,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (93%)","7%"],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-05-20 14:13:00","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"id":343,"isImplemented":true,"name":"CAS-004","provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":642,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":39},"__N_SSP":true}
