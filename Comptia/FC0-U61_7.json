Using a method might be regarded as quite a \"heavyweight\" means of doing this, so properties allow external code to ask the object to show or change the value of one of its fields.\n\nI'd go with Method as well. Seems that provided answer might be wrong.","poster":"Dion79"},{"content":"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a popular way of designing code. \nObjects can have attributes (fields), properties, and methods:\n\nAttributes are values and data types that define the object. The attributes are stored within the object as fields or private variables. Other programs cannot access or change the fields directly. They must call a particular method (see below) to do that.\n\nMethods define what you can do to an object. For example, a Customer object might have a ChangeAddress method. When another part of the program calls the ChangeAddress method, it also passes a string (hopefully containing a well-formatted address) to the object because that is what the method expects. The object's code receives this string, checks that it can be used as a valid address, and updates its Address field. The object might then have another method (PrintAddress) allowing another part of the program to find out what the current value of the Address field is.","timestamp":"1666870500.0","comment_id":"468541","poster":"Dion79","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"FaisalJ","content":"it should be method!!","comment_id":"421677","timestamp":"1659969480.0"},{"content":"it should be a method instead","poster":"luicosta","comment_id":"325135","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1648735800.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/48588-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-132-discussion/","answers_community":["A (78%)","D (22%)"],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1617199800,"answer":"A","isMC":true},{"id":"np4KYecsF3isxegI4GoH","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/70757-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-133-discussion/","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
