Key pair authentication.\n\nKey pair authentication involves using public-private key pairs to authenticate and establish secure connections between systems. This method is commonly used in cloud environments for secure access to resources and data. It provides a more secure and reliable authentication mechanism compared to using usernames and passwords, as it eliminates the risk of password-based attacks such as brute force or credential stuffing.\n\nIn this scenario, using a key pair for authentication would ensure secure access to the cloud tenancy for downloading configurations without the need to rely on potentially less secure methods such as usernames and passwords.\n\nChatGPT"},{"timestamp":"1709237520.0","comment_id":"1162981","upvote_count":"4","content":"Key pair is essential and more secure.
