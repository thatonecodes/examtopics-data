This way, even if the data is accessed or copied without authorization, it will be unreadable without the encryption key.\n\nEncrypting the data that is leaving the SAN or encrypting all network traffic can help protect data while it is in transit, but it does not necessarily protect the data if it is leaked from the SAN. Encrypting the host servers may also be a good security practice, but it does not directly address the issue of data leakage from the SAN.","poster":"Amorprecious","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt's referring to data ON the SAN.\nData at rest.","poster":"Laudy","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1677972660.0","comment_id":"829486"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI concur with answer B.
