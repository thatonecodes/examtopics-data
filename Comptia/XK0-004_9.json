The su Command\n\nUpon typing the su command, the user is prompted for the root password and, after authentication, is given a root shell prompt.\n\nOnce logged in via the su command, the user is the root user and has absolute administrative access to the system. In addition, once a user has become root, it is possible for them to use the su command to change to any other user on the system without being prompted for a password.\n\nBecause this program is so powerful, administrators within an organization may wish to limit who has access to the command.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to do this is to add users to the special administrative group called wheel. To do this, type the following command as root:\n\nusermod -G wheel <username>\n\nIn the previous command, replace <username> with the username you want to add to the wheel group.\n\nTo use the User Manager for this purpose, go to the Main Menu Button (on the Panel) => System Settings => Users & Groups or type the command system-config-users at a shell prompt.
