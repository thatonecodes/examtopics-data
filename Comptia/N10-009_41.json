Multimode.\n\nExplanation:\nMultimode fiber optic cables use a larger core (typically 50 or 62.5 microns) that allows light signals to travel in multiple paths (modes). These signals bounce off the protective cladding (due to total internal reflection) as they propagate, which is a defining characteristic of multimode fibers. In contrast, single-mode fiber (C) has a much smaller core (9 microns) and uses a single, direct path for light with minimal reflection. Twinaxial (A) and Coaxial (B) cables transmit electrical signals, not light, and are unrelated to fiber optics.\n\nThus, multimode fiber explicitly relies on bouncing light off the cladding to transmit data."},{"comment_id":"1339765","timestamp":"1736732220.0","poster":"HeatSquad77","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Single-mode.\n\nIn a single-mode fiber optic cable, light travels through a core with a very small diameter, and it bounces off the cladding (the protective layer surrounding the core) in a straight line. This design allows the light to travel long distances with minimal signal loss.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1730219880.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is D.
