We know Subnet Mask and Host Address works because IP addresses are functional.\n\nYour Default Gateway is your TCP/IP router address that links the host's subnet to other networks, when a host attempts to communicate with another device using TCP/IP, it performs comparison processing using desired subnet mask & destination host IP address versus it's own subnet mask and IP address, result tells computer whether destination is a local host, or a remote host.\n\nFor good information on how Subnet Masks and Host addresses work:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHV1aOnu7oM","poster":"Mehsotopes"},{"poster":"ConfigNique","timestamp":"1716538860.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nName Server","comment_id":"905637"},{"timestamp":"1712455080.0","content":"Anybody can explain this one?","comment_id":"863427","comments":[{"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1714643580.0","content":"When a user enters a website name or URL into a web browser, the computer sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address that the computer can use to connect to the server hosting the website. This process is called DNS resolution.\n\nIf a user can access specific IP addresses but cannot resolve external web pages, it could indicate a problem with the DNS server settings on the user's workstation. The DNS server settings on the workstation could be incorrect or pointing to an invalid DNS server.\n\nIn this scenario, the technician would need to change the name server settings on the workstation to point to a valid DNS server that can correctly resolve domain names into IP addresses. The default gateway, host address, and subnet mask settings are not typically related to DNS resolution and would not resolve the issue of not being able to resolve external web pages.","comment_id":"887195","poster":"DerekM"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712465040.0","comments":[{"content":"System* not server.","poster":"deverser","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712465160.0","comment_id":"863482"}],"content":"DNS (Domain Name Server) is not resolving.
