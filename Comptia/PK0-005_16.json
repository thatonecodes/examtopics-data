Validating the deliverables and F. Reconciling the project budget.\n\nHere's why these options are the most suitable for project closure in Waterfall:\n\nE. Validating Deliverables: Waterfall follows a sequential delivery approach. In closure, it's crucial to formally verify and validate all project deliverables ensure they meet requirements and function as intended.\n\nF. Reconciling the Project Budget: Project closure involves comparing actual expenditures against the planned budget. This reconciliation helps identify any cost variances and provides valuable insights for future project cost estimation.","comment_id":"1228197","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":360},{"id":"h3UaB6qWsEdLzVYn8jBu","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1358781","timestamp":"1739973780.0","poster":"044f354","content":"Selected Answer: D\nQuestion is designed to mislead you.\n\nYES - Go-live, operational training, and handoff are all closing activities\nBUT - one pivotal term is 'identify'.

A change control log is a tool that records and tracks any changes that occur during the project lifecycle. It usually includes information such as change ID, description, impact, status, approval, and resolution. A change control log can help to monitor and manage the changes that affect the project scope, schedule, cost, quality, or resources and ensure that they are aligned with the project objectives and stakeholder expectations."},{"poster":"BlueMan93","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAn issue is something that happened that you do not have control over.
