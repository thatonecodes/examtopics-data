Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource.\n\nWhile authentication and authorization might sound similar, they are distinct security processes in the world of identity and access management (IAM).\n\nWhat Is Authentication?\nAuthentication is the act of validating that users are whom they claim to be. This is the first step in any security process. \n\nComplete an authentication process with:\n\nPasswords. Usernames and passwords are the most common authentication factors. If a user enters the correct data, the system assumes the identity is valid and grants access.\nOne-time pins. Grant access for only one session or transaction.\nAuthentication apps. Generate security codes via an outside party that grants access.\nBiometrics. A user presents a fingerprint or eye scan to gain access to the system.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"414525"},{"content":"OK..maybe changed to D. After rereading it.
