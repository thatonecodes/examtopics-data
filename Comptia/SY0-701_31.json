Hashing:\nHashing is a technique used to generate a unique, fixed-size value (hash) based on the contents of a file, such as a software application. After the final version of the software is completed, the company can create a hash of the software file and store it securely. Whenever the software is accessed or distributed, the company can recalculate the hash and compare it to the original hash. If the hashes match, the file has not been tampered with. This provides a way to verify the integrity of the software and ensure that it has not been altered after the final version.\n\nWhy not C. Baselines:\nBaselines refer to a set of standards or configurations for systems and software that are considered secure. While baselines can be useful for ensuring that systems meet security standards, they do not directly address ensuring that the software has not been tampered with after it is finalized. Baselines help with ongoing security practices rather than tamper detection.","timestamp":"1734188640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"laternak26"},{"poster":"3b1fd98","comment_id":"1322470","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733421060.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Baselines refer to a reference point or a final version of a system or software that is used as a standard for comparison. Once a baseline is established, any changes to the software can be detected by comparing it against the baseline version.
