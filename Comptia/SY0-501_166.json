The the first data that is perishable is data on memory , caches, ruter table. Second less volatile is data in virtual memory so the ANSWER IS D\nRAM\nOrder of Volatility Summary\nFirst responders need to understand the order of volatility, to ensure they protect any potential evidence. The most volatile data includes data in CPU registers, caches, and memory. It is lost if the computer is rebooted. Virtual memory (a swap file) is stored on a disk drive, but is rebuilt when the computer is rebooted. For the CFR exam, Network cache is on about the same level of volatility as a virtual memory. Data on disk drives will stay there, often even after a user attempts to delete it. Backups on tapes and optical discs are have a very low level of volatility. Similarly, remote logs have a very low level of volatility.","timestamp":"1625877180.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Headless virtualization host is a bare metal hypervisor (https://wiki.msp.exchange/faq/create_headless_virutalbox_vhost).
