This allows the company to quickly scale up its server capacity during periods of high traffic and scale it back down when the demand decreases, ensuring efficient resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Rapid elasticity.","comment_id":"1210602","poster":"Duke_CT"}],"exam_id":339,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140496-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-568-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-05-13 03:41:00","answers_community":[]},{"id":"fIuqnE3oAhTlA2TgwnSg","question_images":[],"question_id":522,"choices":{"B":"Implementing a sandbox","A":"Installing an SSD","D":"Enabling hardware acceleration","C":"Disabling hyperthreading"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140497-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-569-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"An application developer formats and reconfigures a development PC after every application test is complete.

A sandbox is a virtual environment that isolates the application from the rest of the system, allowing the developer to test the application without affecting the main operating system, files, or settings. A sandbox can also be easily reset, deleted, or duplicated, saving the time and effort of formatting and reconfiguring the PC. A sandbox can also provide security benefits, such as preventing malware or bugs from spreading to the system or the network","poster":"JonHin","comment_id":"1361137","timestamp":"1740420480.0","comments":[{"poster":"JonHin","timestamp":"1740420540.0","comment_id":"1361138","upvote_count":"1","content":"Other options, such as installing an SSD, disabling hyperthreading, or enabling hardware acceleration, may improve the performance of the PC, but they do not address the issue of formatting and reconfiguring the PC after each test. An SSD (solid state drive) is a storage device that uses flash memory instead of spinning disks, and it can offer faster data access, lower power consumption, and less noise and heat. Hyperthreading is a feature of some CPUs (central processing units) that allows each core to run two threads simultaneously, increasing the multitasking and parallel processing capabilities of the PC. Hardware acceleration is a technique that uses the GPU (graphics processing unit) or other specialized hardware to perform some tasks faster than the CPU, such as rendering graphics, video, or audio."}],"upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1221759","content":"I vote for A","poster":"Qorbany","comments":[],"timestamp":"1732998000.0"},{"content":"The most efficient way to improve the process of formatting and reconfiguring a development PC after every application test is complete is by implementing a sandbox environment.\n\nA sandbox provides a controlled environment where software can be executed, tested, and modified without affecting the underlying operating system or other applications. By using a sandbox, the developer can quickly reset the environment to a clean state after each test, eliminating the need to format and reconfigure the entire PC. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of inadvertently damaging the system or losing important data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.

Replace the CMOS battery.\n\nThe message \"Date/Time Not Set\" is often related to a dead or failing CMOS battery, which is used to store the BIOS settings, including the date and time. Replacing the battery could resolve the issue and allow the desktop to boot into the operating system. If that does not work, then the next step would be to try restoring the BIOS to factory default settings (Option D). Reseating the motherboard power connections (Option B) or changing the motherboard (Option A) would be a last resort, as it would be more invasive and potentially expensive.","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1698335220.0","poster":"YAHudahTechSavvy","comment_id":"704835","comments":[{"poster":"Wade18","timestamp":"1700070360.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"complementary metal-oxide semiconductor","comment_id":"718990"}],"content":"Anything dealing with Date And Time is Automatically CMOS"}],"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":339,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/86472-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-57-discussion/","question_id":523,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2022-10-26 17:47:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"HqtHeS8I6jutqZjEmSiG","unix_timestamp":1715564520,"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"question_id":524,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140498-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-570-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":339,"question_text":"A printer unexpectedly runs out of consumables in the middle of a print job.
