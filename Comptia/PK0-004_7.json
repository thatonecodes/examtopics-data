First, you created a task list and milestones by decomposing\nthe work packages in your WBS. Then, you sequenced activities based on dependencies\nand relationships. After which, you estimated your resources and durations, taking into\nconsideration dates, and effort, lead, and lag time, along with those estimates for the\nduration of the tasks. Now, we have a schedule. What we don’t have is a finish date, a total\nduration, and the answer to the question of how long it will take. That brings us to schedule\ncreation.
