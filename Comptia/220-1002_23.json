I did think D initially, but as others have said if the power can be diverted there must be enough being produced by the generator to power the whole building.\nThe question states \"users on several floors have reported their machines will not start.\", it doesn't say whether the entire floor is without power or just odd users dotted about but let's look at the implications.\n\nOdd users - random computers here and there cannot start. Could be lack of current overall, could be blown fuses from the generator kicking in tbh or could be a few other things. Either way harder to diagnose and unlikely to be fixed by diverting more power.\n\nEntire floor - This would imply something has happened to the power coming to this floor, could be and RCD on the generator blew, could be a rat chewed the cable (remember this is backup cabling so the connections to the mains havent been used for a while). This WOULD be fixed by diverting power from another floor because you've bypassed the damaged part of the circuit. In this event adding redundancy to the cabling would actually have helped, if there was a redundant ;ink to the mains then there would still have been power going to those floors.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"426189","timestamp":"1629188100.0"},{"comment_id":"336152","content":"D is correct.

Any test takers who have worked a customer service job can relate to this question.\nAsking more open-ended questions to narrow down the issue is the most correct answer. If the technician had been pursuing a specific troubleshooting path up to this point, they may have been isolating the wrong issue. Specific queries can be made after broader ones have narrowed the issue down.\nDirecting a contact to call back later is inappropriate. Service calls should be dealt with at the first contact. Repeat callers indicate that an issue was not handled properly.\nRecording the call is an incorrect answer because this does not bring the contact closer to resolution.\nInforming the contact of a script, if any, is inappropriate. This dehumanizes the contact and may lead to a poor user review or needless supervisor escalation, and is bad customer relations in general.","poster":"Takoyaki","upvote_count":"15","comment_id":"189936"},{"timestamp":"1651508220.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"This is the dumbest cert I have ever taken.
