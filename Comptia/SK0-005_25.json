It provides high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity for storage devices over an optical connection. Fibre Channel supports speeds up to 16Gbps and is therefore the best option for meeting the requirement of transmitting at 16Gb over an optical connection.\n\nFCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) is a technology that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames within Ethernet frames for transmission over Ethernet networks, but it requires special hardware and is not widely adopted.\n\niSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) is a storage networking standard that carries SCSI commands over IP networks. It is commonly used in smaller SAN environments, but it may not provide the same performance and reliability as Fibre Channel.\n\neSATA (External Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is an external interface used to connect storage devices to computers, but it is not a networking technology and does not provide the same capabilities as Fibre Channel."}],"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":365,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_id":121,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/106057-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-220-discussion/","question_text":"A storage administrator needs to implement SAN-based shared storage that can transmit at 16Gb over an optical connection.

Set up a DR site that is geographically located in another region.\n\nTo ensure the company's disaster recovery (DR) site is adequate, it is advisable to set up a DR site that is geographically located in another region. Having a DR site further away from the primary data center reduces the risk of both sites being affected by the same natural disaster or regional issues. This approach increases the likelihood of maintaining business continuity and ensures that critical systems and data can be recovered in case of a disaster at the main site."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption C, setting up the warm site as a DR hot site, would be the most appropriate choice to ensure the DR site is adequate.\n\nA hot site is a DR site that has up-to-date and fully operational hardware, software, and data. In the event of a disaster, the hot site can take over operations almost immediately, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss.\n\nOption D, setting up a DR site that is geographically located in another region, would provide additional protection against disasters that affect the primary site and the warm site. However, it would require additional resources and infrastructure to ensure data synchronization and timely failover.\n\nTherefore, setting up the warm site as a DR hot site would provide the quickest and most effective failover in the event of a disaster, while also being a cost-effective solution.","poster":"Mareo","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1697021280.0","comment_id":"867209"}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Set up a DR site that is in the cloud and in the same region.","D":"Set up a DR site that is geographically located in another region.","A":"Set up the warm site as a DR cold site.","C":"Set up the warm site as a DR hot site."},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","exam_id":365,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (60%)","C (40%)"]},{"id":"qM8cdLzo9qj1vVvDb4SH","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-03-12 23:02:00","question_text":"Which of the following backup types resets the archive bit each time it is run?","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"exam_id":365,"question_id":124,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Differential","C":"Incremental","B":"Snapshot","D":"Synthetic full"},"unix_timestamp":1710280920,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135825-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-224-discussion/","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"cj207800","comment_id":"1343293","timestamp":"1737338460.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\ngoing with c"},{"poster":"surfuganda","comment_id":"1172077","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Incremental\n\nExplanation:\nIn incremental backup, only the data that has changed since the last backup (whether it's a full backup or an incremental backup) is backed up. Additionally, the archive bit associated with each file is typically reset after the data is backed up. This ensures that during subsequent incremental backups, only the files with the archive bit set (indicating they have been modified since the last backup) are included in the backup.\n\nDifferential backups do not reset the archive bit. Instead, they back up all the data that has changed since the last full backup, regardless of whether the archive bit is set or not.\n\nSnapshot and synthetic full backups are backup techniques rather than backup types. Snapshot backups capture the state of a system or data at a specific point in time, while synthetic full backups involve creating a full backup from a combination of incremental or differential backups. Neither of these backup techniques inherently involve resetting the archive bit.","timestamp":"1726171320.0"}]},{"id":"dNJENJoKc2Vd1qWiclVJ","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-03-12 23:04:00","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135826-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-225-discussion/","choices":{"B":"FCoE","D":"CIFS","A":"NFS","C":"iSCSI"},"unix_timestamp":1710281040,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":365,"question_text":"A server administrator is connecting a Linux server to a storage array.

NFS\n\nExplanation:\nNFS (Network File System) is a file-based storage protocol commonly used in Linux and Unix environments for sharing files and directories over a network. It allows remote systems to access files and directories as if they were local, making it suitable for storing data on a storage array connected to a Linux server.\n\nFCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) and iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) are block-based storage protocols designed for transmitting SCSI commands over Ethernet networks. While they can be used for storage connectivity in Linux environments, they are not file-based protocols like NFS.\n\nCIFS (Common Internet File System), also known as SMB (Server Message Block), is a file-based storage protocol commonly used in Windows environments for sharing files and printers over a network.
