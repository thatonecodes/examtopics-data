This is from Mike's book\n\n• A cold site is a location that consists of a building, facilities,\ndesks, toilets, parking—everything that a business needs …\nexcept computers. A cold site will generally take more than a\nfew days to bring online.\n\n• A warm site is the same as a cold site, but adds computers\nloaded with software and functioning servers—a complete\nhardware infrastructure. A warm site lacks current data and\nmay not have functioning Internet/network links. Bringing\nthis site up to speed may start with activating your network\nlinks, and it most certainly requires loading data from recent\nbackups. A warm site should only take a day or two to bring\nonline.\n\n• A hot site has everything a warm site does, but also includes\nvery recent backups. It might need just a little data restored\nfrom a backup to be current, but in many cases a hot site is a\ncomplete duplicate of the primary site. A proper hot site\nshould only take a few hours to bring online.","comments":[{"content":"You nailed it.","comment_id":"220756","upvote_count":"2","poster":"YouDipEE","timestamp":"1605575880.0"}],"comment_id":"209657","poster":"betty_boop","timestamp":"1604110560.0"},{"timestamp":"1629679980.0","comment_id":"429587","upvote_count":"1","content":"Although the budget is limited, a cold site data center can't be available in 72 hours.

Similar to an amplifier in a stereo system, the wireless controller allows devices from farther distances to connect.
