Identifying least significant bit encoding of data in a .wav file is a benefit of using steganalysis techniques in forensic response. Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another file, such as hiding a message within an image or an audio file. Steganalysis is the process of detecting the presence of hidden information. By using steganalysis techniques, forensic analysts can identify the least significant bit encoding of data in a .wav file and determine if it contains hidden information. This can be useful in identifying whether a file has been manipulated or tampered with, and can provide valuable evidence in forensic investigations.","poster":"margomi86","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1679198220.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"843411","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIdentifying least significant bit encoding of data in a .wav file is a benefit of using steganalysis techniques in forensic response.

(MFA) MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an application.
