These design considerations invariably add to the\nup-front costs of hardware but result in a more resilient and reliable infrastructure\nthat saves time and costs attributed to downtime.\nTo accomplish this, hardware components must incorporate redundancy in their\ndesign, for example servers with dual power supplies, multiple memory modules\nplus multiple network and storage adapters, but in a more comprehensive manner\nalso include the use of redundant systems such as by implementing server clusters\nor load balancers.

A self-healing system is designed to identify and mitigate problems automatically without human intervention. This approach can help prevent system failures from cascading and causing widespread outages. By automating the process of identifying and mitigating problems, a self-healing system can help reduce the risk of downtime, improve system availability, and minimize the impact of failures on the company's reputation and customer satisfaction.
