Compatibility\nExplanation:\nCross-platform software is designed to run on multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) without requiring separate versions for each. This ensures compatibility across different devices and environments.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. Subscription – Refers to payment models but is not directly related to cross-platform concerns.\nB. Licensing – Deals with software usage rights, but cross-platform software does not inherently solve licensing issues.\nC.

These updates include virus definitions, heuristics, and security patches to protect against evolving cyber threats.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nB. Host firewall – Firewalls require updates but not as frequently as antivirus software. Most firewall rules and policies remain stable over time.\nC.
