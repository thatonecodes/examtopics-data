Respond to the requests with the tester's IP address and steal authentication credentials\n\nWhen users mistype the name of a fileshare server, their workstations attempt to resolve the server name through network requests. A penetration tester can exploit this situation by responding to these requests with their own IP address (using tools like Responder or Metasploit SMB relay modules) to capture authentication credentials, such as hashed passwords.\n\nThis technique exploits weaknesses in the SMB protocol and is a common method for capturing NTLM hashes, which can be cracked offline or relayed to gain access to other systems.","poster":"Nikamy","timestamp":"1731607080.0"}],"exam_id":362,"answer_images":[],"question_id":296,"question_text":"A penetration tester captures SMB network traffic and discovers that users are mistyping the name of a fileshare server.
