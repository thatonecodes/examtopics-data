Duplicate IP still doesn't make sense though given the information in the question and how it can reach machines in its subnet just fine. Cloud vendors usually let you configure some sort of \"route table\" to control what traffic goes between what subnets and you're meant to configure the route table to send traffic that \"falls through\" as going to the \"internet gateway\" so by being the most related to \"no internet access, but internal access\", I think it's A.","timestamp":"1709694720.0","poster":"kuzummjakk","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"582508","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe determining factor is the subnet mask. Plugging the IPv4 address into a IPv4/Subnet calculator, you come out with 30 usable hosts. The ranges for those hosts are 172.16.31.33 - 172.16.31.62. When you plug in the default gateway’s IP, it also comes back with 30 usable hosts. However, the ranges for those hosts are 172.16.32.225 - 172.16.31.254, which is outside the range of the IPv4 address.

Wrong gateway"},{"content":"D. The wrong gateway\n\nExplanation:\n\nGiven the subnet mask of 255.255.255.224, the subnet range for the VM's IP address (172.16.31.38) would be 172.16.31.32 to 172.16.31.63, with 172.16.31.33 as the first usable address and 172.16.31.62 as the broadcast address. The default gateway for this subnet should be within this range, but typically, it would be one of the first or last usable addresses in the range, like 172.16.31.33 or 172.16.31.62.\n\nThe provided gateway, 172.16.31.254, does not fall within the 172.16.31.32/27 subnet range, which is why the VM cannot access the Internet or other subnets.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the correct gateway should be set to an address within the VM's subnet range. For example, if the standard practice in the network is to use the first usable address as the gateway, the gateway should be set to 172.16.31.33. If the last usable address is used, it should be 172.16.31.62.","poster":"54a6b25","timestamp":"1720895100.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1247425"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1222719","timestamp":"1717254540.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's deinitely wrong gateway, this subnet is /27, should only has 32 devices, 254 is way out of range","poster":"Alvin_L"},{"comment_id":"1166893","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIf it can't reach the gateway, why can it reach that other machine?
