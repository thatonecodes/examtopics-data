This will pipe the output of the ls command (which lists the files in the current directory) into the cpio command, which will create a new archive file cloud.cpio containing all the listed files.

This means that if both the original and cloned servers are on the same network, there could be two disks with the same label, leading to confusion and potential errors.\n\nOn the other hand, the block ID (blkid) is unique for each block device, even across clones. This means that even if a disk is cloned, the clone will have a different blkid. Therefore, mounting by blkid avoids the potential conflicts that can arise when cloning servers.\n\nSo, even in the case of server cloning, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. It ensures that the correct disk is mounted, regardless of any changes in the hardware configuration or cloning of disks.","comment_id":"1090668"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption D, mount disk by-blkid, is generally better than option C, mount disk by-label, for a few reasons:\n\nUniqueness: The block ID (blkid) is a unique identifier for each block device, which is guaranteed to be the same across reboots and even if the disk is moved to a different machine. On the other hand, disk labels are not guaranteed to be unique and can be changed by the user, leading to potential conflicts.\n\nPresence: Not all filesystems support labels, and even when they do, labels are not always set by default. This means that you might not be able to mount a disk by label if the label has not been set. In contrast, all block devices have a blkid.\n\nConsistency: The blkid remains consistent even if the device name (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/sdb) changes due to hardware changes or reconfiguration. Disk labels do not have this issue, but combined with the points above, using blkid is generally more reliable.\n\nTherefore, while both methods can be used to mount a disk, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1090666","timestamp":"1701992640.0","poster":"DRVision"},{"poster":"wait4thebus","comments":[{"content":"There is no block id.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"e418137","comment_id":"1145600","timestamp":"1707493200.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSee comment below.
