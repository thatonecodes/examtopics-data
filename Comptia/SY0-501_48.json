Implement deduplication on the storage array to reduce the amount of drive space needed,\nData deduplication -- often called intelligent compression or single-instance storage -- is a process that eliminates redundant copies of data and reduces storage overhead. Data deduplication techniques ensure that only one unique instance of data is retained on storage media, such as disk, flash or tape.\nStorage arrays are simply powerful computers which have large amounts of storage connected to them. Storage arrays are configured in such a way that they can present storage to multiple servers, typically over a dedicated network.","poster":"Ales","comment_id":"18604","upvote_count":"24","timestamp":"1572578340.0"},{"timestamp":"1567319460.0","poster":"Basem","comment_id":"9165","content":"Anyone has any clue about this question ?
