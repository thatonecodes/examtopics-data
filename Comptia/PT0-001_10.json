Similar question from Jason Dion practice:\nSome Windows services are run with SYSTEM privileges and may have been misconfigured by the administrator. In this case, Jason used the accesschk tool from SysInternals to find any writeable services that his user account could access. One was returned: Apache. He then stopped the service and rewrote the binary path loaded by the service to \"net localgroup administrators jason /add\", which will be run the next time the service is started.
