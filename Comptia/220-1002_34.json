For example - the system freeze occurs after the user logs in. As others have said it could be a one time thing. Or it could be something is trying to run that needs administrator rights to run, and that is preventing the system getting any further. Either of these problems would be quickly diagnosed with logging in as the admin and then, if successful, trying again as the user to see if the freeze still occurs. After that you could try booting into safe mode if you still haven't fixed the problem.","poster":"user54321","upvote_count":"12","comment_id":"426287","timestamp":"1629198900.0"},{"content":"why isn't it b?","comment_id":"209536","timestamp":"1604086320.0","poster":"frogs","upvote_count":"7"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1661280000.0","comment_id":"650952","poster":"Students","content":"emergency repair disk (ERD) Saves critical boot files and partition\ninformation and is the main tool for fixing boot problems in older versions of\nWindows.
