Edge computing helps by processing data closer to the source (IoT devices) instead of sending it to a centralized cloud or data center.\n\nWhy Edge Computing?\n✔ Reduces latency – Data is processed near the IoT devices, leading to faster response times.\n✔ Optimizes bandwidth usage – Less data is sent to the cloud, reducing network congestion.\n✔ Enhances reliability – IoT devices can continue working even with intermittent internet connections.\n✔ Improves security – Sensitive data can be processed locally before being sent to the cloud.","comment_id":"1363997","poster":"BigM"}],"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157408-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-375-discussion/"},{"id":"T6deEJs7Hc9fcARek0PF","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"License issues","A":"Oversubscription","D":"Network outage","C":"Storage latency"},"topic":"1","question_text":"A cloud administrator notices VMs on a particular host are having performance issues.
