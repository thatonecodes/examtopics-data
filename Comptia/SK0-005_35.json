Synthetic full.\n This is a type of backup that copies changed data from a server and then combines the backups on the backup target. A synthetic full backup is a backup type that creates a full backup from an existing full backup and subsequent incremental backups. A synthetic full backup does not require accessing the source data again, but only the backup data that is already stored on the backup target. A synthetic full backup offers the benefits of reducing the backup window, network traffic, and storage space while providing faster and easier recovery than incremental backups.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"930698"}],"question_id":172,"answer_description":""},{"id":"MGyokHJLzUgammmjXlCW","timestamp":"2024-03-13 03:44:00","choices":{"D":"Link aggregation","B":"Fault tolerance","C":"Load balancing","A":"Fail over"},"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","question_text":"A server administrator is taking advantage of all the available bandwidth of the four NICs on the server.

The explanation is as follows \nLicensing models based on server count are designed to accommodate fluctuating hardware configurations, making them suitable for environments where the number of servers can change regularly. This model allows you to license the software based on the number of physical servers or virtual machines (VMs) that are deployed or actively running at any given time.\n\nBy using a server-based licensing model, you can easily scale your licensing needs up or down to match the changing equipment count in your data center.
