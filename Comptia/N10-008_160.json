By changing the address prefix on the router, the router will advertise the new prefix through the ND protocol. Workstations will then automatically update their addresses based on the new prefix provided in the RA messages.","poster":"a87d6a4"},{"timestamp":"1719487980.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSLAAC uses IPv6, which in turn uses ND (Neighbor Discovery).
