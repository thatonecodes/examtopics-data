Misconfiguration in the user permissions\n\nThe most likely cause of the issue where a web application can't communicate with a managed database is a misconfiguration in the user permissions. When you deploy changes or scripts in a cloud environment, especially when dealing with databases, you need to ensure that the necessary permissions are correctly configured for the application to access the database. This includes permissions related to authentication, access control, and data retrieval. A misconfiguration in user permissions can lead to a loss of communication between the application and the database.","comment_id":"1007129","poster":"Pongsathorn"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/112662-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-265-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-06-20 07:43:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Misconfiguration in the firewall","A":"Misconfiguration in the user permissions","C":"Misconfiguration in the network ACL","B":"Misconfiguration in the routing traffic"},"question_text":"A cloud engineer recently used a deployment script template to implement changes on a cloud-hosted web application.

Define and configure the proper permissions for the file-sharing service.\n\nGiven that the administrator has identified that the parent folder permissions were modified, and the permissions on the files allowed everyone to have write access, the next best step is to correct this issue by defining and configuring the proper permissions for the file-sharing service. This will involve setting up the access controls, permissions, and policies to ensure that only authorized users or groups have the appropriate level of access, preventing unauthorized changes or deletions of files. Additionally, it's important to review and audit the changes made to permissions to ensure that they align with the organization's security policies and requirements.","poster":"Pongsathorn","comment_id":"1007132"}],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","question_text":"A cloud administrator recently noticed that a number of files stored at a SaaS provider’s file-sharing service were deleted.
