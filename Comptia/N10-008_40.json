Hot site cannot be used to decrease latency during periods of high utilization of a firewall.\n\nB. NIC teaming refers to the aggregation of multiple network adapters into a single logical interface to increase network performance. This can improve network performance, but will not decrease latency during periods of high utilization of a firewall.\n\nC. HA (High Availability) pair refers to two firewalls that are configured to provide failover capability in the event that one of the firewalls fails. This can provide continuous firewall protection and reduce downtime, but will not decrease latency during periods of high utilization of a firewall.\n\nD.
