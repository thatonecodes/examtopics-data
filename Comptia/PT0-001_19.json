However, for everything else, you can wait until the report has been handed off tobegin your cleanup tasks.

Lessons Learned - PenTest team meeting for after action reporting.\n\nWIth all that being A & C are both huge security risks if left in place and should be eliminated since they both pose a potential risk. (D) is something that doesn't necessarily effect the pentest that was just preformed so this one is concentrating on the next test and future tests for the team. Between B & D I personally would go with B obtaining client acceptance. Reason for this is the client is agreeing to the results and findings, signing that they are satisfied and the test was completed properly. Many times attestation of findings are dismissed because the customer is satisfied with what has already been presented during testing and the report.

This handshake is executed when a client wants to join a protected Wi-Fi network, and is used to confirm that both the client and access point possess the correct credentials (e.g. the pre-shared password of the network). At the same time, the 4-way handshake also negotiates a fresh encryption key that will be used to encrypt all subsequent traffic. Currently, all modern protected Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake. This implies all these networks are affected by (some variant of) our attack.
