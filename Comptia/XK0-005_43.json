There are not \"different kernels to initiate the OS startup process.\" There's just one at a time.

It initializes all the devices that are required to load the OS.\n\nThe bootloader plays a crucial role in the boot process of an operating system. One of its primary functions is to initialize the hardware devices that are necessary to load the operating system. This includes tasks such as identifying and configuring the CPU, memory, storage devices, and other essential hardware components to ensure that the system is in a suitable state to load the OS."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is \"C. It helps to load the different kernels to initiate the OS startup process.\"\n\nA bootloader is a program that runs before the operating system (OS) starts. Its main function is to load the OS into memory and initiate the OS startup process. This involves loading the kernel, which is the core part of the OS that manages hardware resources and provides a platform for running user applications. The bootloader helps to load different kernels, which can be useful for testing and recovery purposes.\n\nThe other options listed are not functions of the bootloader:\n\nOption A: Initializing devices is performed by the BIOS or UEFI (depending on the system), not the bootloader.\nOption B: Mounting the root filesystem is performed by the kernel, not the bootloader.\nOption D: Triggering the start of system services is performed by the OS, not the bootloader.","poster":"KnifeClown1","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"803155","timestamp":"1675943340.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"712013","timestamp":"1667684040.0","content":"I would go with C.
