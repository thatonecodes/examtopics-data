This differs from public key infrastructure (PKI), which involves asymmetric encryption, where a public key encrypts and a private key decrypts. While PKI is critical in other areas (like securing communications, emails, or verifying identities), it's not central to how FDE typically functions.\n\nPublic key management is more relevant for data in transit: PKI and public key management are often used for securing data in transit (e.g., SSL/TLS for web traffic) or ensuring non-repudiation (via digital signatures). FDE is focused on securing data at rest, where symmetric keys (often stored in TPM) are used for encryption, not public/private key pairs."},{"content":"Selected Answer: AB\nIn this scenario, A.
