Another brilliant questions. So, I am going to go with A here as the MOST likely reason, although I'd certainly admit, in the context of this question, there are issues. First, network resources can be set to only accept connections from certain IPs or a range, so an APIPA address wouldn't necessarily \"fix\" that.
