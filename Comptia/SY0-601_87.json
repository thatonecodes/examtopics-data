This lack of patch availability leaves the kiosks vulnerable to known and potentially exploitable security vulnerabilities. Attackers can target these vulnerabilities to compromise the kiosks and gain unauthorized access to the systems or customer information.\n\nIt is crucial for the security team to highlight the risk associated with using end-of-life operating systems and recommend upgrading to a supported and more secure operating system to mitigate potential security threats.","timestamp":"1689960540.0","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","comment_id":"958750"},{"timestamp":"1689293400.0","comment_id":"951080","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSecurity Implications of Embedded Systems\nA challenge with embedded systems is keeping them up to date with security fixes.
