It uses a modified version of the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to calculate routes and has several features that make it efficient and scalable, such as partial updates and route summarization.\n\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP): BGP is an exterior gateway protocol (EGP) used to route traffic between different autonomous systems (AS).

You wouldn't successfully carry (piggyback) someone on your back without your knowledge. \n\nTailgating however, someone could just be tippy toeing behind you without your knowledge.
