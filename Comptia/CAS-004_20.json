CVSS scores (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) should be used to create a priority list of items that must be addressed. The CVSS is a standardized scoring system that is used to assess the severity of vulnerabilities based on a number of factors, including the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as the ease of exploit and the likelihood of an attack. Vulnerabilities are assigned a score on a scale of 0.0 to 10.0, with higher scores indicating a greater level of severity. By reviewing the CVSS scores of the vulnerabilities identified in the report, the security analyst can quickly determine which ones are the most critical and should be addressed first. Other factors, such as the business impact rating and the potential impact on the organization's operations, may also be taken into account when prioritizing patches.","comment_id":"755007","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1703434980.0"},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCVSS is the fastest form of assessment from 0 to 10 [none,low, medium, high]\nhttps://www.first.org/cvss/","comment_id":"708905","timestamp":"1698821340.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1697363940.0","comment_id":"695327","poster":"sh4dali","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI would go with C as well.
