Verify full system functionality.\n\nAfter correcting a rule on a misconfigured firewall, the next step in applying the network troubleshooting methodology is to verify full system functionality and ensure that the correction has resolved the issue without causing additional problems. This involves testing the network to confirm that it operates as expected under normal conditions and that the initial problem has been effectively resolved. Verification is crucial to ensure that the changes made have indeed fixed the issue and that there are no unintended side effects.","comment_id":"1174647","timestamp":"1726444500.0","poster":"subaie503"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe network administrator should check if the firewall works after \"correcting\" it.","comment_id":"1164494","poster":"fa2a750","timestamp":"1725330060.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"gFXWmjc5wSnuEa21emE2","topic":"1","answer":"A","question_id":642,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/133972-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-677-discussion/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1710554400.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Multipathing\n\nMultipathing is the technology most likely used to prevent the loss of connection between a virtual server and network storage devices. It provides multiple physical pathways between the server and the storage infrastructure, ensuring that if one path fails, another can take over, maintaining the connection and preventing data access disruptions. This is especially important in environments relying heavily on virtual servers and network storage, where continuous access to data is critical.","poster":"subaie503","comment_id":"1174651"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1303401","content":"Selected Answer: A\nKeywords: loss of connection","poster":"21bc1a0","timestamp":"1729971120.0"},{"poster":"Korrynne","timestamp":"1712519280.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFrom VMWare https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.storage.doc/GUID-DD2FFAA7-796E-414C-84CE-1FCC14474D5B.html\n\n\"To maintain a constant connection between a host and its storage, ESXi supports multipathing. With multipathing, you can use more than one physical path that transfers data between the host and an external storage device.\n\nIf a failure of any element in the SAN network, such as an adapter, switch, or cable, occurs, ESXi can switch to another viable physical path. This process of path switching to avoid failed components is known as path failover.\n\nIn addition to path failover, multipathing provides load balancing. Load balancing is the process of distributing I/O loads across multiple physical paths. Load balancing reduces or removes potential bottlenecks.\"","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1191171"},{"poster":"PatrickH","comment_id":"1151021","timestamp":"1708002960.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is a computer networking protocol that provides for automatic assignment of available Internet Protocol (IP) routers to participating hosts. This increases the availability and reliability of routing paths via automatic default gateway selections on an IP subnetwork.\n\nThe protocol achieves this by the creation of virtual routers, which are an abstract representation of multiple routers, i.e. primary/active and secondary/Standby routers, acting as a group. The virtual router is assigned to act as a default gateway of participating hosts, instead of a physical router. If the physical router that is routing packets on behalf of the virtual router fails, another physical router is selected to automatically replace it. The physical router that is forwarding packets at any given time is called the primary/active router\n\nIts VRRP"}],"answers_community":["A (80%)","B (20%)"],"unix_timestamp":1708002960,"timestamp":"2024-02-15 14:16:00","choices":{"B":"VRRP","D":"NIC teaming","C":"Port aggregation","A":"Multipathing"},"exam_id":357,"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following technologies would MOST likely be used to prevent the loss of connection between a virtual server and network storage devices?","answer_description":"","answer_images":[]},{"id":"HOyaybYejjfXeZ77Dl9Y","timestamp":"2024-02-06 17:47:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (75%)","A (25%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/133076-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-678-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following services provides the network information for the address when IPv6 is used for SLAAC addressing?","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","question_id":643,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1726444920.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Router advertisement\n\nRouter advertisement is part of the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) in IPv6 and is used in Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) to provide network information to IPv6 hosts. Router advertisements inform hosts about the presence of routers, network prefixes for address configuration, and various other parameters necessary for the host to configure its IPv6 address and connect to the IPv6 network. This mechanism allows IPv6 devices to automatically configure themselves with an IPv6 address and other related network information without the need for a DHCPv6 server, although DHCPv6 can be used alongside SLAAC for additional configuration options like DNS server addresses.","comment_id":"1174653","upvote_count":"1","poster":"subaie503"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"C is correct. From Cisco:\nSLAAC provides the ability to address a host based on a network prefix that is advertised from a local network router via Router Advertisements (RA).

Router advertisement\n\nRouter advertisement messages are used in IPv6 networks to advertise routing information, including network prefixes, to hosts.
