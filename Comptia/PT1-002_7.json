It identifies and highlights the top 10 most critical risks commonly found in web applications. It serves as a valuable resource for developers, security professionals, and organizations to prioritize their efforts and address the most significant vulnerabilities and threats in web applications. It is not a comprehensive list of all risks but focuses on the most critical ones. It is not a risk-governance and compliance framework, but rather a guidance document for understanding and mitigating common web-application security risks. It is also not specifically focused on Apache vulnerabilities but is applicable to web applications regardless of the underlying technology stack.","timestamp":"1689586200.0","comment_id":"954035"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1685625720.0","comment_id":"912143","poster":"Anarckii","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nthis is correct"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":33,"timestamp":"2021-11-23 18:57:00","question_text":"Which of the following BEST describe the OWASP Top 10?
