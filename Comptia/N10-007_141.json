There will always be a switch at a patch panel. That's what patch panels are for, to connect points to switches. So A is a dumb answer. Placing the switches on the tables will just make a mess.

Just search in Google for Cat5e repeater devices. Example: \"1-port Gigabit High-Power PoE+ Extender Repeater, is designed to extend connection distances from a PoE source to an output device another 100 m (328 ft.) via Cat5e or Cat6 cable. You can cover even longer distances by cascading these extenders on a network. More than one can be chained thus bringing distance even further. Devices are not expensive and in this scenario is the best option. Answer is C.","timestamp":"1624778040.0"},{"comment_id":"348961","content":"I thought C made the most sense, but I think I have figured out why A is the answer. The patch panel for the conference room is not the demarcation point for the internet service. There is an unknown length of unknown cable running from the Demarcation point (at the Main Distribution Frame?) to this patch panel. The question doesn't state this, but we COULD infer this from the scenario I suppose. So \"upgrading\" the patch panel by installing a single switch to boost the signal would be the simplest, cheapest, and most secure way to address the problem. \n\nfor what it's worth I think questions like this are beyond unreasonable. It would take several minutes to sleuth your way through all that and even then, how do we know the patch panel doesn't already have a switch? So much of what makes this answer correct must be inferred or guessed, and you've only got about 60 seconds per question, so if you get one like this, it's almost more efficient to just guess.","timestamp":"1620075840.0","upvote_count":"5","poster":"gravytrain","comments":[{"comment_id":"403701","content":"uuurrgghhh, switches don't boost signals....they direct traffic accordingly to Mac addresses.
