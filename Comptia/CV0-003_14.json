This includes the IP addresses or hostnames of the database servers in the DR site. The connection string used by the application servers must be updated to point to the correct database servers in the DR site. This ensures that the application servers can establish a connection to the database servers in the new location."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe administrator should update the connection string to fix the issue. Since the application servers are unable to access the database servers, it is likely that the connection string is pointing to the wrong IP address or hostname. By updating the connection string to the correct IP address or hostname of the database servers, the application servers will be able to communicate with the database servers and access the necessary data. Changing the database application IP, creating a database cluster, or editing the DNS record may not resolve the issue, as the root cause is likely related to the connection string being incorrect.","comment_id":"871187","timestamp":"1713203940.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"BeauChateau"},{"timestamp":"1694342640.0","poster":"ironman_86","comments":[{"content":"The only thing I can think of is replicated VMs are probably trying to access the original database.
