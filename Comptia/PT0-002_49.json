Open-source research\n\nOpen-source research involves gathering information from publicly available sources such as websites, social media, and public databases. This activity is passive and does not involve direct interaction with the target systems, making it very difficult to detect.\nD. Port knocking\n\nPort knocking is a technique used to gain access to a system by sending a sequence of network packets to closed ports, which can be configured to open a port for access. When used for reconnaissance, it can be configured to have minimal visibility and is less likely to be detected if the knocking sequence is well-crafted and not too frequent.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721956920.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1710840180.0","comment_id":"1177161","poster":"Obiwan123","content":"AD - Anthony Davis"}],"exam_id":362,"answer_images":[],"question_id":245,"isMC":true,"question_text":"A penetration tester wants to perform reconnaissance without being detected.
