Primary account and password\n\nWhen an iPhone is permanently locked, it typically requires the user's primary account (Apple ID) and password to regain access. This is because Apple's security features are designed to protect the device and user data in case of unauthorized access attempts. By entering the correct primary account (Apple ID) and password associated with the device, the user can unlock the iPhone and restore access.\n\nWhile options like fingerprint and pattern (A), facial recognition and PIN code (B), and secondary account and recovery code (D) are valid security features on some devices, they are not specifically designed to unlock an iPhone that has been permanently locked. In such cases, the user's primary account and password are required to restore access to the device.\n-CHAT Gpt","poster":"Crezzki","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Alizaidi_2003","comment_id":"951087","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1689294240.0","content":"Answer seems wrong to me..."}],"unix_timestamp":1689294240,"timestamp":"2023-07-14 02:24:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/115108-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-298-discussion/","question_id":221,"choices":{"D":"Secondary account and recovery code","C":"Primary account and password","A":"Fingerprint and pattern","B":"Facial recognition and PIN code"},"isMC":true},{"id":"fgLZiUPxpjFgr5JMpFKt","topic":"1","answer":"D","question_text":"Which of the following macOS utilities uses AES-128 to encrypt the startup disk?","exam_id":340,"unix_timestamp":1692679620,"choices":{"A":"fdisk","B":"Diskpart","C":"Disk Utility","D":"FileVault"},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_id":222,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nApple's FileVault is a built-in macOS tool that uses the XTS-AES 128 encryption algorithm to protect the contents of a Mac's entire drive, including the startup disk.
