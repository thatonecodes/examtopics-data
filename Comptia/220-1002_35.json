Roll back the OS update - As JE39 said you cannot do this on most smartphones. there is no option to roll back an os update.\n B. Update the PRL - makes no sense whatsoever\n C.

Perform a factory reset - The only solution i see that addresses the problem with the OS update\n F. Run application updates - maybe applications aren't playing well with the OS update and need new versions to work properly again?\n G. Reset network settings - Don't see how this is going to help the underlying problem\n\nSinde the question asks what the technician should do NEXT out of these i'd probably go with C just to get the device to work long enough and then F just to see if it works, personally i wouldn't go as far as a factory reset until i was sure that there was no other way to fix the device.

Both android and iOS require the downloading of images to flash the devices after they are put in recovery mode, with IOS being less janky and having support via Mac OS. Problem is, wouldn't You factory reset first? It's easier, resets everything to default and doesn't involve as much fiddling and extra steps? Normally you would want to keep the latest update because of security, so I wouldn't roll back just yet unless there is an identified problem with the update.

However, they must be redownloaded and reinstalled.
