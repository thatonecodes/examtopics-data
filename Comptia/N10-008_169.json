This process minimizes the risk of unintended disruptions or negative impacts on the network and ensures that all changes are aligned with business objectives.\n\nA. Business continuity focuses on keeping the business operational during and after disruptions, not on approving network changes.\n\nB. Disaster recovery is related to restoring systems and data after a disaster, not optimizing or changing the network configuration.\n\nC. Incident response deals with managing and mitigating security incidents or breaches, not planned network optimizations."},{"content":"D.

Hubs share bandwidth among all connected devices, meaning they can only send or receive data at a time (half-duplex), not both simultaneously (full-duplex). This explains why the workstation was not connected at full duplex.\n\nA. Media converter simply converts media types (e.g., fiber to copper) and doesn't affect duplex settings.\nC.

The SOA has a serial number that sometimes needs to be manually updated so the devices that are accessing it know that they need to update their cache.
