Biometrics security hardware is the most effective security mechanism against physical intrusions due to stolen credentials as biometric authentication uses unique biological characteristics like fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial recognition to confirm a person's identity, making it difficult for an unauthorized user to gain access even if they have stolen credentials. Access card readers and access control vestibules provide an additional layer of security, but they can be compromised by stolen access credentials.

Single-mode fiber would be the best cabling solution for this project as it provides higher bandwidth and longer distances than other cabling types, such as coaxial and Cat 6a. Single-mode fiber uses a small core that allows only one mode of light to propagate, which minimizes signal degradation and attenuation, making it ideal for long-distance communications.
