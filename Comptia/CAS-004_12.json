If the password was not reversible, it would be impossible to prove that the characters entered are in their required positions. I think your line of thought is that the person was issued a password and the password somehow still resided in memory but this is not the case, even with the most trivial applications (would be voted worse design ever in history). More than likely the password went through the normal type of steps of being randomly generated and assigned. The data when entered by the user will be encrypted (via TLS) to the server.

The request proves a potential attacker only needs to be able to guess or brute force three characters rather than 12 characters of the password.\n\nCorrect. By requesting only specific characters, an attacker would need to guess or brute force only a subset of the password (e.g., 3 out of 12 characters), significantly reducing the complexity and increasing the vulnerability.\nE. The request proves the password is stored in a reversible format, making it readable by anyone at the bank who is given access.\n\nCorrect. The fact that the system can request specific characters of the password implies that the password is stored in a reversible format (e.g., plain text or encrypted but reversible), which is a significant security concern. Secure systems typically store passwords in a hashed format that does not allow for easy extraction of individual characters.","poster":"23169fd","timestamp":"1720825500.0","comment_id":"1247037","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"armid","upvote_count":"1","content":"why not CE?

However, when a system asks for specific characters of the password, it implies that the server needs to compare those characters directly with the stored password. This comparison cannot occur if the password is fully hashed or encrypted because the server wouldn't be able to retrieve the original password characters for the comparison. This leads me to believe that those specific characters are plaintext.\n\n Going with DF here, unless someone has more insight.","timestamp":"1703081340.0","comments":[{"content":"Nothing in the question can provide proof of information regarding the encryption and hashing that is being used. Honestly, this question is one of those poorly worded and given scenario's from CompTIA. We are given the characteristics of the password and asked what concerns there are. Obviously, the password is more exposed to brute force because there are only three characters. Nothing really determines how this password is stored or the encryption that is being used, which makes it hard to go with E or D.
