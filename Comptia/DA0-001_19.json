Review the files separately and ensure the blended totals match.\n\nThe most efficient way to ensure the data is reported correctly after a merger is to review the data from each company separately and then compare the blended totals. This approach allows the analyst to verify the accuracy and consistency of the merged data by confirming that the combined totals align with the individual datasets. It provides a systematic method for identifying any discrepancies or errors that may have occurred during the blending process, allowing for corrections to be made before the first quarter numbers are reported.","timestamp":"1729199460.0","comment_id":"1197505","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1713388260,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Company A recently merged with Company B and will be reporting first quarter numbers soon.
