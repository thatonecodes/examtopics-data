In password hashing, salting involves adding a random value (the salt) to the password before hashing it. The salt value is unique for each user, which means even if two users have the same password, their hashed passwords will be different due to the different salt values.\n\nIn the given scenario, the three encrypted passwords for Alice, Bob, and Chris do not match each other because each password is hashed with a different salt. This adds an extra layer of security and prevents attackers from easily identifying common passwords by looking at the hashed values.","timestamp":"1690234680.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"comment_id":"939341","timestamp":"1688151900.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn password storage, salting is the practice of adding a random value (salt) to each password before hashing it.
