This approach ensures that the organization thoroughly evaluates the specific risks associated with each product.\nEach product may have its own set of vulnerabilities due to differences in design, technology stack, or integration points. Assessing risks individually allows for the identification of product-specific threats and vulnerabilities. By understanding the risk level of each product, the organization can prioritize mitigation efforts where they are most needed.
