The correct setup would be to create a security group adding users to this security group.

C is the better option. Without expressly noted permissions, Ann would default back to Read only on Share, which is the same issue she currently has. C would resolve this issue, as Ann (who we assume falls under the domain of \"Authenticated users\") would now have Full Permissions on the share level, but Modify permissions at the file level. I have a better understanding of how File and Share permissions work now. Please disregard my previous answer, it appears to be C. Chat GPT will say that it's A as well, however by removing a specific permission for Ann from the Share, she will either default to Read Only, or we must assume that she falls under \"Authenticated Users.\" In which case, C is the only one that gives her modify permissions without giving her more control than she should have.","comment_id":"1297790"}],"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1286967","poster":"SecNoob27639","timestamp":"1726850700.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nNone of these are great, but A is the least bad. It maintains the same level of share permission for \"non-Ann\" users, aka the \"Authenticated Users,\" while removing Ann's more restrictive \"read\" Share Permission. Ideally, there would be an answer with Ann having \"modify\" share permission and \"modify\" file permission, but since that isn't an option, A is the least bad.\nC isn't a good option, because it gives all users access to not only read, but also to modify the file, which is more privilege than they need."},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe answer is C.

Link aggregation:\nLink aggregation, also known as Ethernet bonding, link bundling, or port trunking, is the process of combining multiple network connections in parallel to increase throughput and redundancy. When a connection had previously worked successfully, link aggregation protocols such as LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) or PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol) may prioritize using that connection again, provided it's available and operational. This is typically achieved through load-balancing algorithms that take into account the status of each link and its past performance,. effectively prioritizing connections that have previously demonstrated reliability and success.","timestamp":"1710300780.0","poster":"surfuganda"}],"unix_timestamp":1710300780,"answers_community":["C (75%)","D (25%)"],"timestamp":"2024-03-13 04:33:00","answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135842-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-306-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"SCP","C":"MRU","A":"Round robin","D":"Link aggregation"},"topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":365,"question_images":[],"question_id":205}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"id":365,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":349,"name":"SK0-005","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":41},"__N_SSP":true}
