However, it still requires careful management of the file's permissions to prevent unauthorized access to the credentials.\n\nOption B, which uses an environment variable (env_password), is often considered the best practice for providing authentication credentials to scripts. Environment variables can be set outside the script and are typically stored securely. They are accessed within the script without exposing the sensitive information directly in the script's code. This approach provides a good balance between security and convenience.","comment_id":"1007055","timestamp":"1726275720.0","poster":"Pongsathorn"}],"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhen provisioning authentication credentials for a script, it's essential to consider security and best practices. Storing passwords or sensitive information directly in the script (option D) is generally not recommended because it exposes the credentials in plain text, which can be a security risk.\n\nOption A is also not a recommended approach because it retrieves the password from a remote source using curl, which might not be secure and could introduce dependencies or network issues.","timestamp":"1726275720.0"},{"timestamp":"1724431200.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Allow TCP 514 outbound from the web servers to the log collector.\n\nPlease note that while UDP is more common for syslog, there are situations where TCP may be used, especially for reliable and secure log transmission.

Deduplication identifies identical blocks of data and stores only one copy, which can reduce the amount of storage space required.

Deduplication rates for VDI deployments can range as high as 95% savings. Of course that number will vary depending on the amount of user data, etc and it will also change over the course of any one day.\n\nData Deduplication optimizes files as a post processing operation. That means, as data is added over the course of a day, it will not be optimized immediately and take up extra space on disk. Instead, the new data will be processed by a background deduplication job. As a result, the optimization ratio of a VDI deployment will fluctuate a bit over the course of a day, depending on home much new data is added. By the time next optimization is done, savings will be high again.\n\nSaving space is great on its own, but it has an interesting side effect. Volumes that were always too small, but had other advantages are suddenly viable.","timestamp":"1672182420.0"},{"timestamp":"1669948740.0","content":"Why would storage migration be the most efficient?
