It is an effective technique for securing data without altering the application, and it can be applied at the presentation layer.\n\nMasking, on the other hand, typically involves partially concealing sensitive data, such as showing only the last four digits of a credit card number. While masking can be useful in certain scenarios, it may not meet the requirement of complete protection, and it often involves altering how data is displayed, which might affect the application's behavior."}],"poster":"Mr_BuCk3th34D","timestamp":"1687862340.0","upvote_count":"10","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMasking is a technique for obscuring sensitive data in a database by replacing it with fictitious data that has the same format and structure as the original data. Masking can be performed at the presentation layer, which means that it does not require any changes to the application itself. This makes it an efficient solution for protecting the production environment, as it can be easily implemented without disrupting the existing system.\n\nTokenization is a technique for replacing sensitive data with a randomly generated value (a token) that has no intrinsic meaning and cannot be used to recreate the original data. Tokenization can be used to protect data at the presentation layer, but it typically requires changes to the application to store and retrieve the tokens."},{"timestamp":"1728232080.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA.

Configuring systemd services to run automatically at startup is the most suitable option for persistence, as it allows the attacker to maintain access to the compromised system even if the system is rebooted or if the attacker loses the current session. This technique is commonly used to establish a foothold in the target environment and maintain persistence. Creating a backdoor is also a valid option, but it is more intrusive and may be easier to detect, especially if the target is using security solutions that detect malicious binaries. Exploiting an arbitrary code execution exploit may also provide the attacker with access to the target system, but it is a one-time opportunity and does not guarantee persistence.
