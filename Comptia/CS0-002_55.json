Parameterized queries\n\nParameterized queries are a security control used in database programming to mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks, which can occur when user input is directly incorporated into SQL statements. When a program is overwriting data to a buffer, it could potentially lead to a buffer overflow or other security vulnerabilities. Parameterized queries help prevent these issues by separating user input from the SQL query, making it difficult for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This control is especially important in web applications and other software where user input is involved.","poster":"kumax","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1062412","timestamp":"1699135500.0"},{"timestamp":"1697169480.0","comment_id":"1042252","content":"on exam","poster":"JakeH","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"935195","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1687859220.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nApplication developers can prevent buffer overflows by building security measures into their development code, using programming languages that include built-in protection, and regularly testing code to detect and fix errors.","poster":"tutita"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"CyberCEH","content":"Answer A","timestamp":"1684499160.0","comment_id":"901906"},{"comment_id":"896614","timestamp":"1683976080.0","poster":"ZUL01","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn exactly first article from MS in google about DEP, there is following sentence: \n\"DEM is designed to make it harder for attacks that try to use buffer overflows, or other techniques, to run their malware from those parts of memory that normally only contain data.\""},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"888601","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDEP is not designed to prevent buffer overwriting specifically, and it may not be effective in preventing all types of buffer overwriting attacks.\nThey specifically address the issue of SQL injection attacks, which can be caused by buffer overwriting.
