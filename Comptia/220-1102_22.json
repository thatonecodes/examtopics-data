Regionally diverse backups\n\nIn an area prone to frequent hurricanes and an unstable power grid, it's essential to have a robust and resilient backup strategy. Regionally diverse backups involve storing backup copies in different geographical locations, ideally far enough apart to ensure that a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, doesn't simultaneously affect both locations.

Check for application updates.\n\nWhen a frequently used application becomes unresponsive after a mobile device's OS update, the first troubleshooting step should be to check if there are any updates available for that specific application. It's possible that the application developer has released an update to address compatibility issues with the new OS version.

First, clear the application cache since this locally stored information can become glitchy and cause an app to crash. If you have two of the same smartphones having the same issue, it is unlikely to be the application cache causing the issue. In this case, the technician would then attempt to update the OS of the smartphones. Updating the operating system can minimize compatibility issues and fix crashing applications.
