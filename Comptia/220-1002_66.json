Frankly, they're forcing you to make a lot of assumptions, but it could be EITHER a worm or a virus, either one could create Zombies, or form a Botnet by turning networked computers into Zombies, but Zombies and Botnet are two different things. Botnets are clusters of Zombies working in sync. Zombies are not necessarily working in sync, doing the same tasks simultaneously; a network of Zombies is not inherently a Botnet, unless they are performing the same task simultaneously.

If they question had detailed HOW these computers had possibly been infected to perform these actions, the answers would be Virus and/or Worm.
