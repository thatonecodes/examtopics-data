It provides strong encryption and is commonly used in both personal and enterprise wireless networks. WPA2-Enterprise specifically allows for the use of login credentials via 802.1X authentication.\nWhy it's correct: WPA2-Enterprise, which uses 802.1X authentication, allows users to log in to the wireless network using their unique credentials. This setup can integrate with RADIUS servers and directory services such as Active Directory, allowing individual user credentials for access to the corporate SSIDs.","timestamp":"1718044860.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1309750","poster":"Nate_A","timestamp":"1731283980.0","content":"The answer/options does not state WPA2-Enterprise","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1711692720.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Mr_Tension","comment_id":"1185259","content":"Selected Answer: B\nKerberos is a network authentication protocol that allows individuals communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. In the context of wireless networks, Kerberos can be integrated with authentication mechanisms such as 802.1X (EAP) to provide secure authentication and authorization for users connecting to corporate SSIDs.\n\nWith Kerberos authentication enabled, users can use their login credentials (such as username and password) to authenticate and securely attach to available corporate SSIDs, ensuring that only authorized users can access the network resources.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to wireless authentication:"},{"comment_id":"1090902","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTACACS+ is a remote authentication protocol, which allows a remote access server to communicate with an authentication server to validate user access onto the network.

It's commonly used for authenticating users and services in a domain or network, especially in Windows-based networks.\n\nThat leaves D. It just says WPA2/AES. But this could be personal or enterprise. Enterprise version would allow use of a username and passwd. But got the info from chatGPT so not 100% sure if accurate. I did some research on the options and i think chatGPT may be right about Kerberos and TACACS+.","poster":"Perpendicular"},{"content":"B.

However, WPA2-Enterprise leverages 802.1X to utilize an authentication server (like RADIUS) where users can input individual login credentials.\n\nOut of the options given, none directly provides the mechanism to use individual login credentials for wireless access. However, the closest match is WPA2/AES when used in its \"Enterprise\" mode (often referred to as WPA2-Enterprise), which works in conjunction with protocols like 802.1X and back-end systems like RADIUS or EAP for individual user authentication.","timestamp":"1693102440.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt's B guys, google kerberos, verify what it is with chatgpt and comptia's book","timestamp":"1692264180.0","comment_id":"983424","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Footieprogrammer"},{"poster":"dcv1337","comment_id":"955899","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689714240.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nKerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that uses symmetric key cryptography and a key distribution center (KDC) to authenticate and verify user identities.

Because this question does not specify which one, this implies Enterprice as the question makes reference to SSID which is a naming scheme for wireless network and makes reference to corporate network which is same as an enterprise .

Kerberos.\n\nKerberos is a network authentication protocol that provides a secure method for users to authenticate themselves when connecting to a network. It uses tickets to validate the identity of users and allows them to securely attach to available corporate SSIDs by using their login credentials.\n\nTACACS+ (A) is a different authentication protocol commonly used for remote network access and device administration.\n\nPreshared key (C) is a method of authentication where a pre-shared key or password is configured on both the client and the access point/router. However, it does not involve login credentials specific to individual users.\n\nWPA2/AES (D) is a wireless security standard that provides encryption and authentication for Wi-Fi networks but does not directly involve login credentials for individual users.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate option for enabling users to use login credentials to attach to available corporate SSIDs is B.
