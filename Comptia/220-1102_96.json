Installing from a network share.\n\nInstalling from a network share allows the technician to deploy the operating system upgrade to multiple computers simultaneously over the network. This method is faster than starting up from a USB flash drive or cloning each computer's hard drive individually. Additionally, it is more efficient than using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, as it doesn't involve installing Linux within a Windows environment, which could introduce complexity and potential compatibility issues.","comment_id":"1210654"}],"unix_timestamp":1715566080,"choices":{"C":"Installing from a network share","D":"Using the Windows Subsystem for Linux","A":"Starting up from the USB flash drive","B":"Cloning each computer’s hard drive"},"question_images":[],"question_id":477,"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2024-05-13 04:08:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_text":"A technician needs to upgrade the operating system on 200 lab computers to the latest version of Linux.

Utilize a Linux live disc.\nHere's why:\n\nUtilize a Linux live disc: Booting from a Linux live disc allows you to bypass the infected operating system entirely. This way, you can run a virus scan and remove the infection without the malware being able to interfere, as it would be inactive. This method is particularly effective for stubborn infections that resist removal while the OS is running.","timestamp":"1716119880.0","comment_id":"1213767"},{"timestamp":"1715566080.0","content":"The most appropriate way to remediate the issue of an infection that the antivirus software is unable to remove is D. Update the anti-malware.\n\nUpdating the anti-malware software ensures that it has the latest virus definitions and detection capabilities, which may enable it to successfully remove the infection. If the infection persists after updating the anti-malware software, additional steps such as quarantining the infected system or utilizing specialized removal tools may be necessary. Disabling System Restore or utilizing a Linux live disc are not typically the first steps taken to address malware infections.","comment_id":"1210656","poster":"Duke_CT","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"id":"jdPtJa6etoh7NoP7YkfY","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1715566140,"timestamp":"2024-05-13 04:09:00","question_images":[],"question_id":480,"exam_id":340,"choices":{"A":"To evaluate the change before deployment","C":"To determine the affected systems","D":"To select a change owner","B":"To obtain end-user acceptance"},"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732388640.0","poster":"Sleezyglizzy","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect","comment_id":"1216769"},{"timestamp":"1731470940.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"The best reason for sandbox testing in change management is A.
