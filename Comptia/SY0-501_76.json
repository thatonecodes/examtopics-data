The three factors are:\n\nSomething the user knows. This is the most commonly used factor in all authentication, and can be something like a password or a PIN. This also includes the security question asked when you forget your password.\nSomething the user has. This is the most common second factor of authentication and is typically a device or physical object the user has. Objects can include key fobs where you press a button to get a randomly generated code to enter, a credit/ATM card or an ID card.\nSomething the user is. This is a less common form of authentication, especially for small businesses, as it relies on a physical attribute of the user like a fingerprint.","poster":"MelvinJohn","timestamp":"1580242140.0","comment_id":"43905"},{"content":"easy...C....never says change ...asking you to add to existing method","poster":"who__cares123456789___","timestamp":"1609681920.0","comment_id":"258521","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"MelvinJohn","content":"\"Which of the following authentication methods\" implies that more than one may be used.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtual machines or storage from a provider on demand with elastic scalability.

CASBs use auto-discovery to identify cloud applications in use and identify high-risk applications, high-risk users and other key risk factors. Cloud access brokers may enforce a number of different security access controls, including encryption and device profiling. They may also provide other services such as credential mapping when single sign-on is not available.\nCASBs typically offer the following:\nFirewalls to identify malware and prevent it from entering the enterprise network.\nAuthentication to checks users' credentials and ensure they only access appropriate company resources.\nWeb application firewalls (WAFs) to thwart malware designed to breach security at the application level, rather than at the network level.\nData loss prevention (DLP) to ensure that users cannot transmit sensitive information outside of the corporation."}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/4894-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-390-discussion/","question_text":"An organization recently moved its custom web applications to the cloud, and it is obtaining managed services of the back-end environment as part of its subscription.
