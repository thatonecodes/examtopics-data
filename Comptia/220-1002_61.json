This is my reasoning...Option A is like changing the location of the door to your clubhouse. It might confuse some people at first, but if someone really wanted to find it, they could look around and find the door. Option F is like giving a special secret handshake to your friends. Only the friends who know this secret handshake can enter the clubhouse. This way, even if someone finds the door, they can’t get in unless they know the secret handshake. So, using the secret handshake (Option F) is a better way to keep your clubhouse safe than just moving the door (Option A).
