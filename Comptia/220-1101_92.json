SSDs also offer faster performance, lower power consumption, and less noise and heat than HDDs. SSDs use flash memory chips to store data, unlike HDDs that use spinning platters and read/write heads. SSDs can be connected to laptops using various interfaces, such as SATA, PCIe, or NVMe.","timestamp":"1740185100.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"The other options are not suitable for this scenario. S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) is a feature that monitors the health and performance of HDDs and SSDs, but it does not prevent damage from dropping. SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) is an interface that connects various devices, such as HDDs, SSDs, scanners, and printers, to a computer, but it is not commonly used in laptops. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a system that combines multiple HDDs or SSDs into a single logical unit, providing redundancy, performance, or both, but it is not feasible or practical to implement RAID in a laptop.\nReferences:\nCompTIA A+ Certification Exam Core 1 Objectives1\nThe Official CompTIA A+ Core 1 Student Guide (Exam 220-1101) eBook2 The Best SSDs for Upgrading Your Laptop in 2023 | PCMag3","timestamp":"1740185160.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JonHin","comment_id":"1359959"}],"poster":"JonHin","comment_id":"1359958"},{"content":"To mitigate potential damage from frequent drops, the technician should install:\n\nD.
