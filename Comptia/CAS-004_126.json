The CDN's edge servers could also be configured to perform SSL offloading, improving the performance of the organization's web servers by handling the SSL/TLS encryption and decryption. Additionally, the CDN's edge servers could be configured to protect against DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks by filtering out malicious traffic and limiting the amount of traffic that is allowed to reach the origin servers.

This ensures that content is delivered from a server that is geographically close to the user, significantly reducing latency and improving the user experience.\nSSL Offloading: Many CDNs offer SSL/TLS offloading, which offloads the encryption and decryption tasks from the origin server, thus improving the performance of the web servers at the datacenter.\nProtection against DoS and DDoS Attacks: CDNs have built-in protections against DoS and DDoS attacks. They can absorb and mitigate attack traffic before it reaches the origin server, providing an additional layer of security.\nHigh Availability: CDNs provide high availability by distributing content across multiple servers.

A CDN with the origin set to its datacenter:\n\nLow latency: When a request is made for content that is not cached at an edge location of the CDN, the CDN fetches the content from the organization's datacenter, which serves as the origin server. This means that the content is pulled from the primary storage location, processed if necessary (e.g., for dynamic content), and then delivered to the user through the CDN's network. Since origin is set to datacenter datacenter, users may experience higher latency compared to when content is served directly from nearby edge servers.

A large proportion of all web traffic is delivered by CDNs. Sites such as YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon depend upon this service to deliver reliable low latency content to their customers. As the data is dispersed, it also offers an effective defense against DDoS attacks. CDNs use caching to ensure data is available on the edge of the network, where users or customers will benefit from lower latency and improved responses.
