Reserved instances.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Reserved Instances: These allow a company to commit to using a certain amount of cloud resources over a longer period (typically one or three years) in exchange for a significant discount compared to on-demand pricing. Since the company’s resource consumption has stabilized, they can benefit from the cost savings associated with reserved instances, as they are likely to continue needing the same amount of resources."},{"timestamp":"1718735520.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nReserved instances are hardware profiles that your organization commits\nto, usually for a period of one to three years.

By allowing businesses to avoid large upfront investments and instead pay for what they use, pay-as-you-go pricing can help reduce costs and provide more financial flexibility.\n\n\nSource: https://examlab.co/comptia/cloud-essentials-clo-002","poster":"studyingveryhard","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1690513980.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1690513980,"choices":{"B":"Elasticity","A":"Pay-as-you-go","D":"Availability","C":"Self-service"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":344,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-07-28 05:13:00","question_id":45,"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which of the following cloud characteristics helps transform from a typical capital expenditure model to an operating expenditure model?"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":95,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":344,"isImplemented":true,"name":"CLO-002"},"currentPage":9},"__N_SSP":true}
