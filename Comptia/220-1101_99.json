PIN code enforcement adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that devices are protected by a PIN, making physical access to the device more challenging for unauthorized users.\nWhile the other options provide various benefits, 2FA and PIN code enforcement directly enhance the security of remote users accessing company resources.\nReferences:\n* CompTIA A+ Core 1 Exam Objectives Section 2.7: Compare and contrast Internet connection types, network types, and their features."},{"content":"Selected Answer: AF\nThe two services that best enhance security for remote users accessing company resources are:\n\nA. Two-factor authentication\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security when users access company resources remotely. It requires users to provide two forms of identification (such as a password and a code sent to their phone), reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nF. PIN code enforcement\nEnforcing PIN code requirements on smartphones adds another security layer. It ensures that the device is protected with a unique code, preventing unauthorized access to the device and its contents if it's lost or stolen.","poster":"BugG5","timestamp":"1732989420.0","comment_id":"1320330","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1316467","poster":"Nate_A","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1732304100.0","content":"The two best options to enhance security for remote users accessing company resources are:\n\nA. Two-factor authentication\nF.
