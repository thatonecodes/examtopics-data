This allows the system administrator to ensure that corporate data is kept secure and is only accessible through a controlled environment, even if the device is personal. Essentially, corporate data and personal data don’t mix. For example, using a tool like Mobile Device Management (MDM) software, a container can be set up to keep work-related apps and data separate from personal apps, thus ensuring privacy and security.\nConditional access: Conditional access helps enforce specific security policies based on the state of the device. For example, access to corporate applications or data can be restricted unless the device is compliant with certain security policies like having a password, being encrypted, or being free from malware.

Specifically, the \"Policy match for large file data exfiltration\" has resulted in the DLP system denying access to a folder from all users. This is likely preventing access to the necessary large Excel and XML files that are required to process orders. So, by changing the action for the data exfiltration policy to \"alert\", rather than blocking access or denying it, the DLP system will notify administrators of potential risks but allow users to access the files as needed to complete their tasks.
