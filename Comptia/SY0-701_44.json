Footprinting the internal network\n\nExplanation: The AXFR request is typically used by attackers to obtain a complete list of DNS records, which can reveal internal IP addresses and hostnames, thereby providing a detailed map of the internal network.

Footprinting is the process of collecting information about a target network to identify vulnerabilities and plan potential attacks.\n\nWhen an attacker performs an AXFR zone transfer, they can obtain a complete list of all DNS records within a domain, including hostnames and IP addresses. This information can be used to map out the internal network structure, identify critical systems, and discover potential targets for further exploitation.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it's important to secure AXFR transfers by implementing authentication and encryption, restricting zone transfers to authorized servers only, and monitoring for any unusual activity."},{"poster":"a4e15bd","timestamp":"1724332620.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1270691","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAXFR can be used for footprinting during the reconnaissance phase."}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/145958-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-294-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"9BBYi6wn9THztlnGCbgd","answer_ET":"BD","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-08-13 18:03:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/145671-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-295-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"cri88","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1268238","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB.

WAF (Web Application Firewall):\n\n A WAF is specifically designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It can help prevent attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web-based threats. Setting up a WAF on port 443 (which is used for HTTPS traffic) would directly address risks associated with web application vulnerabilities.\n\nF. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):\n\n A SIEM system collects and analyzes security data from across the network, including logs and events from the web application. It provides real-time analysis, helps in detecting anomalies, and assists in responding to potential threats. This would complement the WAF by providing a broader view of security incidents and facilitating incident response.","poster":"Szajba123","comment_id":"1282616","timestamp":"1726142820.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"GPT: A & E","timestamp":"1724810280.0","comment_id":"1273744","poster":"ef5549f"},{"timestamp":"1724333340.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1270705","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nChanging my previous answer.
