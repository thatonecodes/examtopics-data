This solution can be implemented relatively quickly compared to other options that involve configuration changes or ordering new network connections. \nWhile ordering a direct link can provide a more reliable and potentially faster connection, it typically involves longer lead times for installation and configuration. This solution would not resolve the issue the fastest.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732785480.0","poster":"Rjimbo"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption C, enabling Quality of Service (QoS), can indeed help improve performance by prioritizing traffic and managing bandwidth effectively. However, implementing QoS typically involves configuration and testing, which may take time to implement and optimize. Additionally, while QoS can help improve the overall performance of the network by prioritizing critical traffic, it may not directly address the underlying issue of slow response times from the intranet website.\n\nOrdering a direct link to the provider (Option B) would likely provide the fastest resolution because it bypasses the limitations and potential congestion of the site-to-site VPN connection altogether. It offers a dedicated and higher bandwidth connection between the user's network and the cloud platform, resulting in lower latency and faster response times for the intranet website. So, option B is correct.","comment_id":"1181398","poster":"Sweety_Certified7","timestamp":"1727161500.0"},{"comment_id":"1131877","timestamp":"1721919240.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOrder a direct link to the provider (Option B): This option involves establishing a direct connection to the cloud provider, bypassing the VPN, and potentially providing faster and more reliable connectivity. Direct connections are often preferred for critical applications that require low-latency access.\n\nEnable quality of service (Option C): QoS is important for optimizing network performance, but it might not be the fastest solution in this context.

Wouldn't it depend on the root cause of the slow response time?"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe fastest solution to the slow response times from the intranet website hosted on a cloud platform would be to enable quality of service (QoS). QoS allows network traffic to be prioritized to ensure that important traffic, such as the intranet website traffic, is given priority over less important traffic. This can improve response times and ensure that users can access the intranet website quickly, even when other network traffic is present. Changing the connection to point-to-site VPN, ordering a direct link to the provider, or upgrading the link to 200Mbps may also help to improve response times, but they would likely take longer to implement and may involve additional costs.","timestamp":"1697391720.0","comment_id":"871175","poster":"BeauChateau"},{"timestamp":"1693544100.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC would be the quickest.","poster":"bagsik89","comment_id":"825591"},{"comment_id":"814324","poster":"Trebor28","content":"Selected Answer: C\nit is c.","timestamp":"1692459480.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1690386900.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"sorry Site to Site is what I meant","timestamp":"1690394340.0","comment_id":"789076","poster":"beamage"}],"comment_id":"788981","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe fact that it's a point to point there would much unneeded traffic you could filter immediately with QOS","poster":"beamage"},{"timestamp":"1689773940.0","content":"Im thinking C here..","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CapJackSparrow","comment_id":"781257"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt has to be C.","timestamp":"1688321640.0","poster":"TheGinjaNinja","comment_id":"763955"}],"timestamp":"2022-09-10 12:11:00","answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/81533-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-152-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":349,"question_text":"Users are experiencing slow response times from an intranet website that is hosted on a cloud platform.

System logs.\nExplanation:\n\nSystem logs provide valuable information about system events, errors, and warnings that could help diagnose issues with applications. By examining the system logs, the administrator can quickly identify any errors or issues related to the accounting application. This includes errors that may indicate why the application is not functioning properly, such as service crashes, configuration errors, or resource limitations.","poster":"Sweety_Certified7","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1088751","timestamp":"1717607640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mitchbitch","content":"Selected Answer: D\nin my work environment an admin or engineer isnt checking an SLA, we might go to our PM to check but thats not something we are tasks in doing"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nPer the CompTIA Cloud+ book I'm reading. The answer would be SLA. An example of a simple internal SLA might focus on the help disk. The SLA defines how the help desk prioritizes tickets, provides timely responses, and communicates with the rest of the organization.

System logs.\n\nBefore looking at the network components, an administrator should check the system logs for any related error messages that could give insight into what is causing the issue. The logs may reveal issues with the application or the system on which it is running, helping the administrator pinpoint the problem quickly and efficiently. Once the problem has been identified, the administrator can then move on to other troubleshooting steps, such as checking the network configuration or consulting the service-level agreement.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"BeauChateau","timestamp":"1697391780.0"},{"timestamp":"1693544160.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
