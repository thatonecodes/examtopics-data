It's another way of doing rescue.target which is also single-user mode.\nC- By adding systemd.unit=rescue.target, this will put the system into rescue mode, which again is single-user mode\n\nThis is all based if the question is asking what it is asking which is \"pick 2 which will boot the system into single user mode\" nothing more but with comptia's questioning, I think you never truly know what they want."},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"why isnt it BE?","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"881644","timestamp":"1729948260.0"},{"timestamp":"1723567620.0","comment_id":"807712","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nOption D (adding \"single=user\" in the kernel line) and option E (adding \"init=/bin/bash\" in the kernel line) can be used to boot the Linux system into single user mode. In single user mode, the system will only run a minimal set of services and the root user will be given a shell, allowing the administrator to troubleshoot and repair any issues with the system.\n\nOption C, adding systemd.unit=rescue.target to the kernel line, is intended to boot the system into a rescue environment, not a single user mode. In the rescue environment, the system will attempt to repair the system and restore the system to a bootable state, rather than providing direct access to the system as single user mode does.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","comments":[{"poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"2","content":"***Discard*** I'm going with CE.","comment_id":"817848","timestamp":"1724325180.0"}]},{"content":"Selected Answer: CE\nI think the given answer (CE) is correct\n- C. \"systems.unit=rescue.target\" will put you in single-user mode\n\n- E.\n1. In GRUB, press E to edit your boot entry (the Ubuntu entry).\n2. Look for the line that starts with linux, and then look for ro.\n3. Replace ro with rw init=/bin/bash.\nThis action mounts your file system as read-write and uses /bin/bash as the init process.\n4.
