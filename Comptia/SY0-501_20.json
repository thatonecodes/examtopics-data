PEAP\nEAP by itself is only an authentication framework.\nPEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) fully encapsulates EAP and is designed to work\nwithin a TLS (Transport Layer Security) tunnel that may be encrypted but is authenticated. The primary motivation behind the creation of PEAP was to help correct the deficiencies discovered within EAP since that protocol assumes that the communications channel is protected.

PEAP is similar in design to EAP-TTLS, requiring only a server-side PKI certificate to create a secure TLS tunnel to protect user authentication, and uses server-side public key certificates to authenticate the server.
