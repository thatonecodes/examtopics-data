Private VLANs. Private VLANs can be used to restrict the communication between the servers in the same subnet. A primary VLAN can be created and the database servers can be mapped to this VLAN as an isolated VLAN. This will restrict the communication between the database servers. Additionally, a secondary VLAN can be created and the application servers can be mapped to this VLAN as a community VLAN.
