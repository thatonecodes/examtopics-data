The cell phone had lost service to the carrier.\n\nMany modern smartphones use a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular signals to determine location. If the phone loses cellular service, it may not be able to accurately determine its location, especially in areas with weak Wi-Fi signals.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. The cell phone was in conservation mode: While conservation mode can affect certain features, it's unlikely to completely disable GPS functionality.\nC. The cell phone received a firmware update: Firmware updates typically improve device performance and stability. They are not likely to cause GPS failures.\nD. The cell phone had overheated: Overheating can cause various issues, but it's less likely to specifically affect GPS functionality.\nTherefore, a temporary loss of cellular service is the most probable explanation for the phone's GPS failure.\n\nGG","timestamp":"1732073040.0","comment_id":"1315024","poster":"Nate_A","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"CloudChef","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732035480.0","content":"Conservation mode (or battery saver mode) often limits or disables certain functions, including GPS, to preserve battery life.
