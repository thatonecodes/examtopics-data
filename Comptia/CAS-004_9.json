SIEM platforms enhance incident detection and response\ncapabilities by providing expanded insights into operational activity through\ncollection, aggregation, and correlation of vast volumes of event data across the\nentire enterprise environmentSIEM removes much of the need to analyze individual\nsystems by collecting log data and parsing it in a way that makes it easily searched\nand analyzed regardless of the underlying log format. Additionally, SIEM platforms\nremove much of the specialized knowledge needed to locate and analyze logs\ncollected and stored on individual systems.
