With traditional virtualization, the hypervisor controlled access between VMs and the bus. This control added a layer of complexity and latency to the structure.\n\nThe PCIe bus has been extended to address this concern. The single root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV) functionality permits direct access between the VM and the PCIe bus and, by extension, the NICs on the bus. This permits much faster communication between the physical network connection and the VMs on the host server.\n\nThe SR-IOV is particularly attractive to private cloud administrators that may be trying to gain as much efficiency as possible with the hardware deployments in their private data centers.","poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1726016400.0"}],"question_text":"A systems administrator is deploying a solution that includes multiple network I/O-intensive VMs. The solution design requires that vNICs of the VMs provide low- latency, near-native performance of a physical NIC and data protection between the VMs. Which of the following would BEST satisfy these requirements?","answer_images":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"8g01OPuaafolia3xNUNB","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1726888260.0","content":"To assist with the increased workload for a global web-hosting company with mainly static content during an upcoming event, the most suitable solution would be:\n\nD.

Use O365/M365 as an example and compare it with BeauChateau's response, how will you be able to contact and discuss Microsoft's scalability in anyway shape or form? One will just assume they have scalability, just like with most other SaaS providers. You also have no control over this whatsoever. All one can control (using O365/M365 as the example again) is your licensing and comparing the staff intake with the current licenses to see if the company will be able to cover any new staff members and for how long.\n\nA very rough example, but all that makes sense for me here is licensing."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"BigM","comment_id":"1361544","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D\n\nCapacity planning in a SaaS environment involves ensuring that the application can handle increasing workloads efficiently while maintaining performance.

Scalability directly impacts the ability to accommodate growth in users and usage patterns.\nEffective capacity planning focuses on ensuring that the infrastructure can handle increasing loads, adapt to fluctuating demands, and maintain performance. This means designing the system to scale efficiently—whether that’s adding more resources, optimizing performance, or managing load balancing.\nLicensing, on the other hand, is typically a separate concern that deals with the legal and financial aspects of software usage rather than the technical capacity to support user demand. Licensing considerations are also important for compliance and revenue management.\nFrom the above argument, it is more than evident that Scalability is relevant for Papacity Planning, and not Licensing.","comment_id":"1298419","poster":"braveheart22","timestamp":"1729020720.0"},{"timestamp":"1723751940.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nthink of office 365. its a saas application which costs go up per license","poster":"nedeajob12","comment_id":"1266657"},{"poster":"PatrickH","comment_id":"1173301","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTough question because its not clear enough.

Scalability is relevant to capacity planning in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) environment. Capacity planning is the process of determining the IT infrastructure resources required to meet future demand for a service or application. In a SaaS environment, the provider must ensure that the infrastructure can scale to meet the demands of all customers who use the service simultaneously. This requires careful planning of resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth to ensure that they are adequate for current and future needs.","poster":"BeauChateau"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":349,"answers_community":["D (50%)","A (50%)"],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/105029-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-116-discussion/","answer":"D","topic":"1","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Clustering","A":"Licensing","B":"A hypervisor","D":"Scalability"},"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1680563040,"question_id":20}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"provider":"Comptia","id":349,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"name":"CV0-003","numberOfQuestions":375},"currentPage":4},"__N_SSP":true}
