Check the machine’s certificates.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen a user cannot authenticate to a Wi-Fi network, especially in an enterprise setting, it's often related to certificate-based authentication, such as 802.1X or other security protocols requiring certificates to establish a secure connection.\n\n Machine certificates are often used for authentication in corporate environments. If the user’s machine is missing the necessary certificates or if they have expired, the authentication process will fail.\n\n The other options are less likely to resolve this specific issue:\n A. Reinstall the OS is a drastic step and unlikely to fix certificate issues.\n C. Resync the Group Policy may help in some cases but isn't directly related to Wi-Fi authentication.\n D.
