If the switch can, it’ll buffer transmissions until the pause expires, and then start sending again.

F-type connectors are coaxial cable connectors that are commonly used for cable television, satellite television, and cable internet services. They have a threaded barrel that screws onto the female port of the device. F-type connectors can carry high-frequency signals and support bandwidths up to 3 GHz. F-type connectors are different from RJ45, LC, and RJ11 connectors, which are used for Ethernet, fiber-optic, and telephone connections respectively.","comment_id":"866906","timestamp":"1712808360.0"},{"timestamp":"1710586260.0","content":"F type","comment_id":"840829","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Cannnon"},{"timestamp":"1706485380.0","poster":"BeauChateau","comment_id":"791207","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe F-type connector is typically used to connect to the demarcation point and provide network access to a cable modem.
