Request a traffic exemption.\n\nBy requesting a traffic exemption, the technician can obtain temporary permission from the network administrator to bypass the proxy restrictions for the specific update download. This is a common approach for troubleshooting and software updates.\n\nHere's why the other options aren't ideal:\n\nA. Connect to a hotspot: While this could work, it may not be feasible in all situations, especially if the hotspot has limited bandwidth or requires additional authentication.\nC. Change the DNS address to 1.1.1.1: This can improve DNS resolution, but it won't bypass the proxy restrictions.\nD. Update the Group Policy settings: This would require administrative privileges and may not be a quick solution. Additionally, it could affect other users and network policies.\nTherefore, requesting a traffic exemption is the most efficient and practical solution in this scenario.\n\nGG","timestamp":"1732065420.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1314986","poster":"Nate_A"},{"content":"The correct answer is B.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1204868","timestamp":"1714540740.0"}],"exam_id":339,"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-08-14 20:03:00","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answer":"B"},{"id":"8vgO7x9dFkftJisECzZI","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"The webcam is not on a level surface.","C":"The webcam is plugged into the wrong USB port.","B":"The webcam driver should be updated.","D":"The webcam is not compatible with the OS."},"timestamp":"2023-11-23 20:29:00","question_text":"An integrated webcam on a user's laptop broke, so a technician installed a temporary, external webcam.

The webcam is not on a level surface.\n\nIf other users can only see part of the user's face during videoconferences after the installation of the external webcam, it suggests a physical misalignment issue. Placing the webcam on an uneven or not level surface can result in an incomplete view.
