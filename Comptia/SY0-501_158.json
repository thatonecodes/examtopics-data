These self-signed certificates are great for certain purposes and not so great for others.”\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/when-are-self-signed-certificates-acceptable-for-businesses/\n\nThis is my breakdown of the question. If you read the question it talks about protecting the servers with SLL in the Domain (one domain). A wildcard certificate is a public key certificate used by all subdomains within a larger domain. This is unlike SAN (Subject Alternative name which allows a certificate to be valid for multiple domains using multiple names}\n\nEven though I was leaning towards C with the idea that, most cost-effective does not mean no-cost, I like it for public-facing servers, but I conclude that the answer given is correct.
