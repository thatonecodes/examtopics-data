If the DR test was successful, you might have already performed the failover during the test. In a production environment, failover would have been triggered by a disaster.\n\n2. **Restore Backups**: This step may be necessary during the failback process or as part of the overall recovery plan. However, restoring backups is generally done after initiating the failback because you want to ensure that your primary environment is operational before restoring data to it."},{"comment_id":"1009598","poster":"Pongsathorn","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA company just successfully completed a DR test and is ready to shut down its DR site and resume normal operations.
