Key escrow service. Key escrow service is designed to securely store and manage cryptographic keys, including MFA seeds. The \"escrow\" part refers to a trusted third party that holds the keys, which can be recovered if needed, ensuring secure backup of MFA seeds. This type of service is typically used for situations where keys must be stored in a way that they can be accessed under specific conditions but otherwise remain protected. \nNOT D. Hardware security module (HSM): While an HSM is excellent for securely generating and storing cryptographic keys, it is generally used for real-time operations, not necessarily for centralizing offline backups of MFA seeds. AND \nNOT C. Encrypted database: An encrypted database can be used for storing various types of sensitive data, but it requires ongoing management and doesn't inherently provide the offline storage feature or the level of protection specific to MFA seed backup.","comment_id":"1327559","timestamp":"1734371880.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bright07"},{"comment_id":"1292061","comments":[{"timestamp":"1730491320.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1305980","poster":"grelaman","content":"Changing to D cause Setting up and maintaining an encrypted database requires specialized knowledge to ensure it's configured securely.

MFA seeds are sensitive pieces of information used to generate one-time passwords for authentication purposes. Storing them securely is critical to prevent unauthorized access, which could compromise the entire authentication system. By using an encrypted database, the organization can securely store the MFA seeds in a central, offline location with minimal ongoing management requirements.\n\nWhy not D: An HSM is a physical device that manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptographic processing. SMs are expensive to procure and maintain, which might not be justifiable for simply backing up MFA seeds. HSMs are better suited for high-security environments where cryptographic operations are performed frequently, not just for storage.","poster":"grelaman"},{"comment_id":"1249253","poster":"ChopSNap","timestamp":"1721164740.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
