TIA/EIA-568-B.\n\nTIA/EIA-568-B is a standard for structured cabling, which includes the pin-outs for various types of Ethernet cables, including Cat 6. Using TIA/EIA-568-B standard ensures that the cable is terminated correctly, which can help prevent network connectivity issues and signal interference. This standard is widely used in the telecommunications industry and is the recommended choice for terminating Cat 6 cables."},{"poster":"Jakub2023","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the only termination standard mentioned, the others are connector standards.","comment_id":"843727","timestamp":"1726741020.0"}],"answer":"B","exam_id":357,"choices":{"B":"TIA/EIA-568-B","C":"LC","A":"F-type connector","D":"SC"},"question_id":376,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/103216-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-437-discussion/","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-03-19 13:17:00","answer_ET":"B","isMC":true},{"id":"uFTLWZ9mY9RX7fG3x5r5","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/103828-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-438-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. NFV (Network Functions Virtualization).\n\nNFV allows network functions, such as firewalls, routers, and load balancers, to be virtualized and run on industry-standard servers instead of having dedicated hardware appliances. This approach enables network services to be rapidly deployed, scaled, and managed in a more flexible and cost-effective manner. By using NFV, the company can create a virtual replica of its physical network, with the same logical topology and behavior, while running network functions as virtualized instances.","timestamp":"1695627600.0","poster":"StellarSteve","comment_id":"849966","upvote_count":"18"},{"upvote_count":"9","poster":"Yourebeingwatched","comment_id":"852679","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think there's typo in answer A.

NFV allows you to abstract and virtualize network services and functions, such as routers, firewalls, and load balancers, without altering the underlying logical network topology or how devices are managed.

Reverse lookup checks are used to verify that an IP address is associated with a valid domain name, and are commonly used in anti-spam and anti-phishing measures. In the case of an external mail server, a PTR record would need to be configured in the DNS server for the domain name that corresponds to the server's IP address.
