While SHA-256 and SHA-512 are more secure and resistant to collision attacks compared to MD5, they are also computationally more intensive and thus slower.\n\nAES (option D) is not a hashing algorithm but a symmetric encryption algorithm used for securing data at rest. It's not suitable for file integrity checks through hashing.\n\nTherefore, in terms of performance, MD5 would be the most appropriate choice among the options provided. However, it's important to note that MD5 is considered less secure than SHA-256 and SHA-512, so depending on the level of security required, SHA-256 might be preferred despite its higher computational overhead."},{"poster":"braveheart22","timestamp":"1729622580.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMD5 is generally faster than SHA-512 when it comes to hashing speed. This is because MD5 produces a shorter hash (128 bits) compared to SHA-512 (which produces a 512-bit hash), resulting in less computational overhead. \n\nHowever, itâ€™s important to note that while MD5 is faster, it is considered less secure and more vulnerable to collisions than SHA-512. For applications requiring stronger security, SHA-512 is preferred despite its slower performance.","comment_id":"1301677"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with what everyone else said.

Economies of scale\n\nCloud Service Providers (CSPs) can offer unlimited capacity to customers, in large part, due to economies of scale. Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that come with increased production or service capacity. As CSPs expand their data centers and infrastructure to serve a global customer base, they can achieve economies of scale by spreading the costs of hardware, data centers, and maintenance across a large number of customers. This allows them to provide seemingly limitless capacity and resources to individual customers without the need for those customers to invest in their own physical infrastructure.","poster":"Pongsathorn","comment_id":"1007141","timestamp":"1710393720.0"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/120714-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-274-discussion/"},{"id":"DHliEkSEkjbNGW7xAiaC","answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","answer_description":"","question_id":188,"question_text":"A company has two primary offices, one in the United States and one in Europe.
