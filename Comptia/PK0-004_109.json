The PMO often provides guidance, support, and oversight to project managers and teams, and is responsible for ensuring that projects are aligned with the organization's goals and objectives. In this case, the project manager has been hired to help transition projects from the waterfall style to an iterative approach, which marks a significant change in approach from previous projects.
