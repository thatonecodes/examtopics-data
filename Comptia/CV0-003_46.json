It works by introducing a delay or slowing down the login process after a certain number of failed login attempts. This delay increases with each subsequent failed attempt, making it increasingly difficult for an attacker to conduct a brute force attack.\n\nImplementing a progressive login delay can help protect user accounts from unauthorized access without significantly impacting the user experience for legitimate users, especially when combined with other security measures like account lockout and account recovery options.
