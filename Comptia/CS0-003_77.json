Which of the following is likely true? Well... do we know what the URL is for resetting a password? No. Do we know which user, or what the user did before making the request to this website? Also no. Next time you forget your password and a link is sent to your email to reset it look at the URL that you go to. It wont be the same as the login pages URL.

A social engineering attack is underway.\n\nThe scenario you describe, where outbound traffic is going to a host IP that resolves to a domain similar to \"office365password.acme.co,\" while the standard VPN logon page is \"www.acme.com/logon,\" suggests a potential social engineering attack. Attackers often create deceptive domains that mimic legitimate ones to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. In this case, the similarity in domain names raises suspicion that it could be an attempt to phish login credentials from employees. Security analysts should investigate and take appropriate measures to mitigate the threat."}],"answer":"D","question_text":"A security analyst at a company called ACME Commercial notices there is outbound traffic to a host IP that resolves to https://office365password.acme.co.

It may also gather information about the operating system versions running on target hosts.

Any hacker that finds an LFI is first going to check if they can read some globally readable files, typically this is going to be /etc/passwd on linux or C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts. Depending So in the request form you're going to see something like this (or the B64 equivalent) `../../../../../etc/passwd`) If I was red teaming and got a hit on this, you best believe the next thing I'm typing in is ../../../../etc/shadow to see if I can read it, because if I can you can copy/paste both of those to a txt file and use unshadow in kali to get the creds of the user you want and own the box. If those aren't there, then the next thing I'm going to look for is ssh keys in one of the 5ish places that they normally are, or browse around for any plaintext credentials. checking for printenv during an LFI doesn't make sense because this assumes you already have command execution, and there's plenty other commands that would give you similar info to work off of, they may never execute that command.","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1716818280.0","content":"Best explanation here.

Passive scanning is the least invasive and is just collecting the packets, but not performing additional analysis on it, which reduces the work capacity on the systems. I referenced the Sybex 003 study guide by Mike Chapple and Reidl. Page 82\n\nPassive monitoring relies on capturing information about the network as traffic passes a\nlocation on a network link.... Unlike active and router-based monitoring, passive monitoring does not add additional traffic to the network. It also performs after-the- fact analysis, since packets must be captured and analyzed, rather than being recorded in real time as they are sent.","comment_id":"1081751","upvote_count":"12","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1732723440.0"},{"upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"994108","poster":"kmordalv","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect. \nPassive scanning involves monitoring network traffic to identify vulnerabilities without actively probing or interacting with the devices. This method is relatively non-intrusive and can provide valuable information without directly affecting the systems. \nHowever, it's important to note that passive scanning might not identify all vulnerabilities, so a combination of passive scanning and periodic credentialed scanning might be a balanced approach to ensure accurate vulnerability assessment while minimizing disruption.","timestamp":"1725022260.0"},{"poster":"deeden","comment_id":"1086961","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI vote agent-based scanning because only IT services can host them.
