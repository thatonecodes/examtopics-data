The instructional designer.\n\nTrainees reporting that a trainer's innovative use of media has greatly enhanced their ability to understand course content is valuable information for the instructional designer. This feedback can help the instructional designer incorporate innovative use of media into the course design for future training programs.\n\nOption A is not the best answer, as the company that pays to have its employees trained may be interested in knowing about the effectiveness of the training program as a whole, rather than the specific media used by the trainer.\n\nOption B, the person who schedules trainers, may be interested in knowing the effectiveness of trainers in general, but may not be interested in the specific use of media by one trainer.\n\nOption D, other trainers who teach the same course, may find this information interesting, but it may not be critical for their own training programs.\n\nTherefore, the instructional designer is the most likely audience to need this information as it can help in designing effective training programs.","poster":"JimGrayham"}],"exam_id":369,"answer_images":[],"question_id":22,"answer_ET":"D","question_images":[]},{"id":"QIKRzzEFXAEfMuzXiYzg","question_text":"An instructor is a member of an organization that has recently received a great deal of unfavorable publicity about the actions of many of the organization's members at a recent convention.
