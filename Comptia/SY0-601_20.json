A hash value is a unique fixed-size string of characters generated from the contents of a file using a cryptographic hashing algorithm. Even a minor change in the file's content will result in a completely different hash value.\n\nWhen files are distributed, users can independently calculate the hash value of the received file and compare it to the published hash value. If the calculated hash matches the published hash, it means that the file has not been altered during transit, ensuring its integrity. If the hash values do not match, it indicates that the file may have been tampered with, corrupted, or modified, and users should exercise caution before using the file.","poster":"Protract8593","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1690078080.0","comment_id":"960003"},{"comment_id":"928688","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPublishing files' hashes is primarily done to validate the integrity of the files.

You take a plain txt file and, using a hash generator, create a hash for it. If I then share the text file with you and you wanted to make sure what is currently in the text file is the same as what I sent you then you'd use a compatible hash generator to generate a hash for the file you received. If our hashes match then the file wasn't changed. If the hash is different then something happened in transit and you can't trust that txt file. To accomplish this I didn't have to digitally sign it or encrypt it or anything.
