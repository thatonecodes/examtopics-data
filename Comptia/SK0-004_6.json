A red LED typically means there is an issue, such as a failing disk or a degraded RAID array. To verify the RAID functionality, the technician needs to access the server's RAID controller or management interface to check the status of the RAID array and identify any issues (such as a failed disk or degraded state).\n\nNetwork-based hardware administration allows the technician to remotely access the RAID controller or hardware management interface through a network (e.g., using tools like Dell iDRAC, HP iLO, or other remote management platforms). This will give the technician insight into the RAID configuration, status, and alerts that can help diagnose the issue.","timestamp":"1737925620.0","comment_id":"1347117","poster":"Annahubanna","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Vasco1","comments":[{"comment_id":"277820","content":"B & D are out because of relevance leaving A or C.
