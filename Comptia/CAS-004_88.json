Change the Filter action for Card_Data_Policy from Allow to Quarantine: This would be the most effective approach to prevent future incidents like this. Changing the action from Allow to Quarantine would ensure that emails containing payment card information (based on the Card_Data_Policy filter) are flagged and stopped before being sent out, without disrupting normal operations. The email could still be reviewed later, but it would not be allowed to reach the external recipient immediately. This change targets the root cause, which is the accidental or intentional emailing of sensitive data. So, this is the most effective solution to prevent future incidents of sensitive data being emailed without disrupting normal business operations. This ensures that emails containing sensitive payment card data are stopped and reviewed before being sent externally."},{"timestamp":"1721169420.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWell, no other more than B.","comment_id":"1249293","poster":"EAlonso","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721169300.0","comment_id":"1249291","content":"C.

Controlling access to data based on the role of users: This approach involves Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), where access is granted based on the user’s role. In this case, the user’s subscription tier would be tied to their role, which can limit the data they are allowed to access. For example, if a user is subscribed to a basic tier, they will only be able to access data available to that tier. This is a straightforward and effective way to ensure that only authorized users can access the data that is specific to their subscription level.\nC. Employing attribute-based access control: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) involves granting access based on specific attributes, such as user characteristics (e.g., subscription tier) and the attributes of the data (e.g., the data's classification or level of access). This allows for more fine-grained control compared to RBAC, as it can evaluate both the user's attributes (tier, subscription type, etc.) and the data’s attributes (data sensitivity, type, or tier) to make access decisions.","poster":"Bright07","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1734640380.0","comment_id":"1329155"},{"timestamp":"1727560320.0","poster":"Bright07","content":"To ensure subscribers are only granted access to data associated with their subscription tier, the best approaches would be:\nB.
