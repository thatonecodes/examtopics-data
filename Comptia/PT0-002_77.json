WPScan\n\nWPScan is a specialized tool for performing vulnerability scanning and security assessments of WordPress-based websites. It can be used to identify vulnerabilities in WordPress core, plugins, and themes. WPScan can also be used to detect the version of the WordPress installation, which is important for identifying vulnerabilities that are specific to a particular version of WordPress.\n\nBurp Suite is a widely used tool for web application security testing, it includes an intercepting proxy, a web application scanner, and a web application vulnerability scanner. But in this case, the website is a WordPress-based website, WPScan would be the best choice.\n\nDirBuster is a tool that can be used to brute-force directory and file names on web servers. It can be useful in identifying hidden or unlinked files and directories on a website.\n\nOWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a web application security scanner. It can be used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications by performing automated scans, manual testing, and fuzzing.","upvote_count":"9","poster":"RRabbit_111","timestamp":"1674094320.0","comment_id":"780649"},{"poster":"ryanzou","upvote_count":"7","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC for sure, wp-admin","comment_id":"683005","timestamp":"1664478840.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. WPScan: WPScan is specifically designed for scanning WordPress sites. It can identify vulnerabilities, enumerate plugins, themes, and users, and check for known security issues in the WordPress installation.\n\nAnalysis of Other Options:\n\nA. Burp Suite: Burp Suite is a powerful web application testing tool that can be used for a variety of tasks including scanning, intercepting, and analyzing web traffic. However, it is more general-purpose and not specifically tailored for WordPress.\nB. DirBuster: DirBuster is used to brute force directories and files on web servers. While useful, it does not provide the specialized functionality for WordPress that WPScan offers.\nD. OWASP ZAP: OWASP ZAP is another excellent general-purpose web application security scanner, similar to Burp Suite. It provides a wide range of functionalities but is not as specialized for WordPress as WPScan.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1241666","timestamp":"1720042440.0","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nYou can plug wpscan into burp suite...","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1089720","poster":"Caoilfhion","timestamp":"1701892080.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"WPScan is a security scanner for WordPress websites.
