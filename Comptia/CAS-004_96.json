Unlike AES-GCM, which relies heavily on hardware optimizations (like AES-NI instructions) for peak performance, ChaCha20-Poly1305 maintains high performance across a broader range of hardware, including mobile devices and embedded systems.\nChaCha20-Poly1305 is fully supported in TLS 1.3, ensuring that customers can use it seamlessly for secure communications during video or audio broadcasts.

Configure firewall rules to block all external traffic.\nSince the security policy mandates that only internal users should have access to the application, configuring firewall rules to block all external (public) traffic ensures that unauthorized external entities cannot access the application. This is a direct and immediate way to enforce the access policy, reducing the attack surface by limiting exposure to only trusted internal networks.\nB. Enable input validation for all fields.\nBuffer overflows often exploit insufficient input validation, allowing attackers to send malicious input that can overwrite memory. By enforcing strict input validation, the application can ensure that only properly formatted and expected data is processed, thereby preventing buffer overflow attacks.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1728597840.0","poster":"grelaman","comment_id":"1295758"},{"comment_id":"1291669","upvote_count":"1","content":"Ans AB.\nA.
