The other options are not valid steps that the penetration tester should recommend. Keeping hashes created by both methods for compatibility would defeat the purpose of updating the code, as it would leave some hashes vulnerable to attacks. Rehashing all old passwords with the new code would not work, as it would require knowing the plaintext passwords, which are not stored in the database. Replacing the SHA-256 algorithm to something more secure is not necessary, as SHA-256 is a secure and widely used hashing algorithm that has no known vulnerabilities or collisions.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1297767","poster":"IamBlackFire","timestamp":"1728928260.0"},{"timestamp":"1727097360.0","comment_id":"1288134","poster":"sparseyyy","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWithout the original plaintext passwords, it's impossible to rehash old passwords.
