Update the project charter.\n\nGoogle Gemini\n\n Project team identification: This typically happens after the business case is validated and the project is authorized to proceed. It's an important step in building the project team, but not the first step of initiation.\n Updating the project charter: Once the team is identified, the project manager should incorporate their expertise and insights into the project charter. This document outlines the project scope, objectives, stakeholders, risks, and key information for everyone involved. Updating it with the team's input ensures clarity and alignment going forward.\n Budget constraints: Determining budget constraints usually happens before or alongside identifying the project team, as it influences team size, resources, and potential solutions.\n Project schedule: Creating the project schedule typically comes after defining the project scope and key activities, which involves input from the identified team.","timestamp":"1723747440.0","comment_id":"1151286","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"JohnLarsen","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709990520.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn the project initiation phase, once the project team has been identified, the next step for the project manager is typically to \"B. Validate the business case.\" The business case provides the justification for the project and should be confirmed to ensure that the project aligns with organizational strategy and goals. Budget constraints and project schedules are generally developed during the planning phase, which comes after the initiation phase. Updating the project charter may also occur later; the charter initially provides a high-level overview of the project and is usually developed early in the initiation phase but can be refined as the project progresses.","comment_id":"1003127"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706973300.0","comment_id":"971131","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think the keyword here is DURING.","poster":"Dar87"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"889753","poster":"TheGinjaNinja","content":"Selected Answer: C\nUpdate the project charter. Updating the project charter would be the next step for the project manager after identifying the project team during the project initiation phase. A project charter is a document that formally authorizes a project and defines its purpose, scope, objectives, deliverables, milestones, roles and responsibilities, assumptions, constraints, risks, budget, and timeline. A project charter can help to align the expectations and interests of all stakeholders involved in a project and provide direction and guidance for planning and executing the project.","timestamp":"1699161120.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nI was stuck between B and C. \n\nThe project charter should be updated before validating the business case. This is because the project charter is a document that outlines the project's goals, objectives, and scope. It also identifies the project's stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities. If the project charter is not updated before validating the business case, there is a risk that the project will not be aligned with the organization's strategic goals.","comment_id":"881016","comments":[{"comment_id":"881026","poster":"lamborghini","timestamp":"1698285060.0","content":"This is off.

Scope creep.\n\nScope creep is a phenomenon that occurs when the scope of a project gradually increases over time. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\n Changes in requirements: Stakeholders may change their minds about what they want the project to deliver.\n New opportunities: The project team may identify new opportunities that they want to pursue.\n Unforeseen circumstances: Things may not go as planned, and the project team may need to make changes to the scope in order to stay on track.","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"881011","poster":"lamborghini"},{"timestamp":"1735692900.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1335084","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A. Scope creep.\n\nScope creep refers to the uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in a project’s scope, usually without adjustments to time, cost, or resources.
