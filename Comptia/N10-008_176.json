Site-to-site VPN is the best solution for connecting two remote offices securely over an untrustworthy MAN (Metropolitan Area Network). This type of VPN allows two or more sites to establish a secure, encrypted connection over the internet. Once the VPN tunnel is established, network traffic between the two sites is encapsulated and protected from unauthorized access or interception. This type of VPN allows each office to access network shares at the other site as if they were on the same LAN","poster":"StellarSteve","comment_id":"843595"},{"poster":"Rizierr","upvote_count":"2","content":"james charles","timestamp":"1730290440.0","comment_id":"1204468"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nA site-to-site VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a network connection that enables secure communication between two or more remote networks or sites over the public internet or other untrusted networks. This technology is commonly used to connect branch offices, data centers, or other geographically dispersed locations, allowing them to share data and resources as if they were on the same local network.","timestamp":"1712871300.0","poster":"osmaster","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1041124"},{"comment_id":"728086","poster":"fouserd","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSite to site is correct","timestamp":"1685171940.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1673038860.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"628090","poster":"alayeluwa","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSite to site VPN."},{"poster":"alayeluwa","upvote_count":"2","content":"C.

Port tagging is a feature that can be used to keep the network design simple and efficient in this scenario. Port tagging allows the switch to assign a VLAN ID to each packet as it arrives at the switch port. By using port tagging, the network administrator can configure the switch to segregate users by department into different VLANs, without having to physically reorganize the network. This approach also enables the administrator to apply network policies specific to each department, without affecting other departments."},{"timestamp":"1706413140.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Port tagging is the most appropriate option for segmenting departments into different networks in a campus setup with users in multiple buildings. Port tagging, also known as VLAN tagging, allows you to separate network traffic by creating multiple virtual LANs (VLANs) on a single physical network. This allows you to segment the network and keep traffic separate between different departments or buildings, while still keeping the design simple and efficient.MDIX (Media Dependent Interface Crossover) is a feature that automatically detects and configures the correct cable connection type for connecting to another device. It is not directly related to segmenting a network into different departments.","poster":"JakeCharles","comment_id":"790236","upvote_count":"5"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe only answer that makes sense here would be Port Tagging.","comment_id":"728211","poster":"fouserd","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1701089100.0"}],"choices":{"C":"Port tagging","D":"Flow control","A":"MDIX","B":"Jumbo frames"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"id":357,"name":"N10-008","isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":877,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":176},"__N_SSP":true}
