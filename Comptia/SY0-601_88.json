An internet proxy acts as an intermediary between the users' web browsers and the internet. When employees access the internet through the proxy server, it can be configured to enforce access control policies, filter web content, and log user activities.\n\nHere's how an internet proxy can fulfill the requirements:\n\nRestrict web access: The proxy server can be configured with access control lists (ACLs) to block or allow access to specific websites or categories of websites based on company policies. This allows the organization to restrict access to inappropriate or non-work-related websites.\n\nMonitor website visits: The proxy server logs all web requests made by employees, providing detailed information about the websites they visit, the time of access, and the amount of data transferred.
