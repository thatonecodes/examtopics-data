With just that info, you can eliminate C since raising the power level would only make it worse. Reconfiguring AP2 and AP3 to have non-overlapping channels would actually HELP this network, but we're trying to limit the network not improve it, so that eliminates A. And changing the SSID would have no impact on the wireless signals making it out of the building or not, so that eliminates D.\n\nThe only possible answer that meets the requirements is B. Omni-directional means it radiates outward in all directions so surely that's the source of the problem.
