Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method that assigns permissions to users based on their role in the organization. This method helps ensure that users only have the permissions they need to perform their job duties, and no more. By implementing RBAC, the organization can enforce a more uniform and controlled access to the network, reducing the risk of security incidents caused by overly permissive network accesses. The other options may help to some extent, but they do not address the underlying problem of non-uniform and overly permissive network accesses being granted.","comment_id":"850007","timestamp":"1727252220.0","upvote_count":"10","poster":"StellarSteve"}],"timestamp":"2023-03-25 11:17:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"D","choices":{"B":"Configure uniform ACLs to employees and NAC for contractors.","C":"Deploy an RDP server to centralize the access to the network.","D":"Implement role-based access control.","A":"Change the default permissions to implicit deny."},"topic":"1","exam_id":357},{"id":"qsvuEEuP74ipXGUzMfsm","answer":"","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1679915220,"isMC":false,"answer_ET":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/104078-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-461-discussion/","exam_id":357,"question_id":403,"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nA network technician needs to resolve some issues with a customer's SOHO network.
