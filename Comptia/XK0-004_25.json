This is usually due to a file that was deleted but a process is still has the file opened an it will not release the space until the process is killed or restarted. The first step to fix this issue is to find the process that is opening deleted files and \"lsof\" is the best tool to find that.","upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1620774060.0"},{"poster":"drago86299","content":"It should be A, the administrator doesn't remember which process is writing the file.","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"356479","timestamp":"1620918300.0"},{"timestamp":"1665936420.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"A is the right Answer from my point of view.\nThe lsof command stands for List Open Files and shows open files and which process uses them, while \ntruncating (or emptying) a file would be in the case of log files, the process of clearing a bunch of old data from log files to make way for newer and up-to-date information, thereby making troubleshooting much easier.","poster":"braveheart22","comment_id":"696363"},{"comment_id":"691730","timestamp":"1665463020.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"evgeniyk","content":"Answer is A\nWe cannot delete file if some process use it but can truncate.
