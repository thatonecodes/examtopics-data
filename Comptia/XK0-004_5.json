No wonder this question is here and not on the test lol. This is what we have:\nA: Adds the group write permission to the directory.\nB: Changes group ownership of file days to root.\nC: Adds sticky bit to production directory.\nD: Change the user ownership of the directory to production.\n\nOk, so B and C we can eliminate. B-if we change group ownership to root, no one can get the file & C-a sticky bit is for special user permissions to prevent others from deleting files. In order to even list the directory contents, the group member needs group x (execute) permissions on the production_days folder. You would think that A would help, but without the x permission, adding the write permission doesn't help, so A is not our answer. Changing the user ownership to production doesn't help either because we need GROUP permissions changed. So NO ANSWER is actually correct. IF answer A is changed to chmod g+wx production_days, I think we would get there.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1643316720.0","comment_id":"534117","poster":"Didi31","upvote_count":"1","content":"Did you find some questions that were on the test from this?
