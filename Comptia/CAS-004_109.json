Configure the CA to support OCSP responder services. \nReason : OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) provides a method for checking the revocation status of certificates in real time. This allows the web applications to verify the validity of certificates quickly without needing to download a full Certificate Revocation List (CRL) every time a request is made. This satisfies both the security requirement (ensuring that certificates are valid and not revoked) and the business requirement (not impacting the web application’s response time significantly).","poster":"Bright07"}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"A":"Require each endpoint to validate using a CRL.","B":"Implement certificate pinning for all web applications.","C":"Outsource PKI management to a managed service provider.","D":"Configure the CA to support OCSP responder services."},"answer_description":"","question_text":"An organization wants to set up an internal PKI to support encrypting traffic between internal support web applications and user’s endpoint devices.

Microsegmentation: Microsegmentation is a security technique that divides a network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the movement of potential attackers within the network. It allows for fine-grained control over traffic flows, ensuring that only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted within and between segments.
