A stateful firewall keeps track of the state of connections passing through it and can prevent certain types of attacks, such as TCP SYN floods. By sending an ACK packet to a closed port on a target system, the firewall should respond with a reset (RST) packet if it is stateful, indicating that the port is closed. If the firewall is not stateful, it will not respond to the ACK packet. This can help the assessor determine the firewall rule set and potentially identify any weaknesses in the firewall configuration.","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"874522"},{"timestamp":"1696235640.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nNo one said anything about being stealthy and using a SYN scan\n\nFrom the Nmap website:\n\"CP ACK Scan (-sA)\nThis scan is different than the others discussed so far in that it never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports.

A TCP SYN scan works by sending a SYN packet to the target host, and if the port is open, the host responds with a SYN-ACK packet. However, if the port is closed, the host responds with a RST packet. By analyzing the responses from the target host, the assessor can determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered by the firewall.\n\nOption A (\"-sA\") is a TCP ACK scan, which is used to determine if a port is filtered or unfiltered. It sends an ACK packet to the target host, and if the port is unfiltered, the host will respond with a RST packet. If the port is filtered, the host will not respond at all. While an ACK scan can provide some information about the firewall, it is not as effective as a SYN scan for mapping out the stateful firewall rule set.","poster":"cy_analyst","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"kenechi","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA - What is stateful firewall (One that keeps state of traffic or packet leaving the internal network to the outside and its return). A TCP Ack scan -sA fools the firewall not to know where the traffic is from and who initiated the traffic.

The option -sS specifies a SYN scan, which is a type of stealth scan that sends a SYN packet to the target host and waits for a response. This type of scan is useful for mapping out firewall rule sets because it can help determine which ports are open and which are filtered by the firewall. The assessor can use the results of this scan to identify which ports are accessible and which are blocked by the firewall, which will give them an idea of the stateful firewall rule set in place.","comments":[{"comment_id":"805049","content":"Why not A answer?","timestamp":"1691730720.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]"}],"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Vikt0r","timestamp":"1691464560.0"},{"poster":"shakevia463","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"795823","content":"How to test firewall rules\nOne of the most important aims of these scans will be to verify and test that your firewall filters and rules are performing as intended.
