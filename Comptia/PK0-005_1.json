Triggering the contingency plan is premature at this point, as there may still be ways to salvage the project without resorting to contingency measures. Submitting a change request to the change control board is also not appropriate at this time, as the project is not yet officially behind schedule.

Create a change request for the change advisory board.\n\nThe Scrum master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process and ensuring that the team follows the Scrum guidelines. This includes preventing scope creep, which is the uncontrolled growth of the project scope. When the product owner asks to add new scope to the backlog, the Scrum master should first create a change request. This will document the change and allow the team to assess its impact on the project. The change request will then be submitted to the change advisory board, which is responsible for approving or rejecting changes to the project.\n\nOption B, working with the business analyst to document the new epic, is not the best course of action because it does not address the issue of scope creep.
