This is proof that CompTIA hates you and wants you to fail.\n\nEveryone knows that the first thing you would check when troubleshooting a slow boot is the startup items, but the CompTIA exam is not based on actual reality. \n\nAccording to the official CompTIA prayer guide/songbook, they put \"Cleanup And Defragment the hard drive\" as the second option right after running the system troubleshooter. They list a number of other operations before they finally get to the \"remove applications from startup\" operation. \n\nI was pretty stumped by this one, because the two choices (defragment and cleanup) are so similar and have equal effect on system performance.
