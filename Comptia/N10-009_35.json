Replacing the NIC changes the MAC address, and if the switch was locked to the old MAC, it would block the new one, causing users to lose access. This aligns with common network administration experiences post-upgrade. B is a close contender if cabling was manually altered, but port security is a more frequent culprit in such scenarios.\n\nA (PoE) is unlikely because servers don’t typically use PoE, and a NIC upgrade wouldn’t affect a power budget.\n\nB (TX/RX transposed) could occur if cabling was disturbed or a mismatched setup was introduced, but Auto-MDI/MDIX reduces this likelihood in modern setups.\n\nD (Incorrect cable) is possible but less probable with modern auto-correcting hardware.","comment_id":"1398867","poster":"AriGarcia"}],"question_text":"A network administrator performed upgrades on a server and installed a new NIC to improve performance.
