Identity providers (IdP) store and manage users' digital identities in a secured fashion. They also track and manage the permissions and access levels associated with those identities. By integrating each Software as a service (SaaS) solution with an identity provider, the security analyst can implement strong Know Your Customer (KYC) policy to ensure the credentials of each user remain unique.
