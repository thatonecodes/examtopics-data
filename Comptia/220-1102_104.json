Running Disk Cleanup\nDisk Cleanup is a built-in Windows tool that scans your hard drive and identifies files and programs that can be safely removed to free up disk space. It can help to remove temporary files, system files, and other unnecessary items that may be taking up space.\n\nWhile increasing memory can improve system performance, it won't directly address the issue of low storage space.
