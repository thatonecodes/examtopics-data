NVMe"},{"comment_id":"865085","timestamp":"1712612880.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf fast read/write times are a key requirement and budget is not a concern, the best storage type to deploy would be NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) storage. NVMe is a high-performance storage interface that can provide significantly faster read and write speeds compared to traditional spinning disks and SSDs (Solid-State Drives). NVMe storage operates over the PCIe interface and allows for low latency and high throughput data access. NVMe storage is particularly well-suited for applications that require high IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second) and low latency.\n\nWhile SSDs also offer fast read/write times compared to spinning disks, NVMe can provide even faster speeds due to its optimized design. Hybrid storage combines multiple types of storage technologies, such as SSDs and spinning disks, to provide a balance of performance and capacity, but may not be the best choice if maximum performance is the key requirement.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"BeauChateau"}],"unix_timestamp":1680990480,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":349,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-04-08 23:48:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"SSD","B":"NVMe","D":"Hybrid","A":"Spinning disks"},"question_text":"A systems administrator is implementing a new file storage service that has been deployed in the company’s private cloud instance.

Pass-through allows the VM to address the GPU directly without having to go through the hypervisor stack. This significantly improves performance for the application.
