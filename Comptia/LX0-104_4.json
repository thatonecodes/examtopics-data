The purpose of a display manager is to provide a graphical interface for users to log in and start a session, as well as to manage the launch of the desktop environment or window manager.\n\nDisplay managers also handle user authentication, meaning that they verify the credentials of a user before granting access to the system. Some display managers may also offer additional security features such as locking the screen after a period of inactivity or when the user switches to another virtual terminal.\n\nDisplay managers also provide a way for users to choose the desktop environment or window manager they wish to use for their session, or to customize various settings such as screen resolution, color depth, and display orientation.\n\nIn general, the purpose of a display manager is to provide an attractive and user-friendly interface for managing user logins and starting desktop environments, as well as to provide a centralized mechanism for controlling the user environment.","comment_id":"804325","poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676034360.0"}],"comment_id":"803405","timestamp":"1675957080.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1675957080,"question_text":"What of the following statements is true regarding a display manager?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98583-exam-lx0-104-topic-2-question-4-discussion/","answer":"D"},{"id":"NqckZDaZscv01f0kZQ9G","question_text":"How is a display manager started?","unix_timestamp":1675957260,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"It is started by inetd when a remote hosts connects to the X11 port.","A":"It is started by a user using the command startx.","D":"It is started automatically when a X11 user logs in to the system console.","B":"It is started like any other system service by the init system."},"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-02-09 16:41:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98584-exam-lx0-104-topic-2-question-5-discussion/","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"B","topic":"2","exam_id":354,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"B.

The specific method depends on the type of operating system and the init system being used. For example, in systems using the systemd init system, the display manager is started as a system service, typically by a systemd unit file. The display manager can also be started manually by a user with administrative privileges using a command such as systemctl start display-manager. In other systems using different init systems, the display manager may be started as part of the boot process or through a different mechanism.","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"804327","timestamp":"1676034540.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675957260.0","comment_id":"803409"}],"answer":"B","question_id":17},{"id":"1rqXnMCfQz5G14wfYR5h","discussion":[{"poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"803413","comments":[{"comment_id":"804330","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676034660.0","poster":"linux_admin","content":"The xorg.conf file is the configuration file for the X.org X11 server.
