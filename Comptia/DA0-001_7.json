To increase the query speed.\n\nThe real fact is that the use on Parameterization is definitely a security approach to prevent SQL injections. But this is not a DBA certifications. The term SQL Injection in not even mentioned in some books.

To prevent SQL injections\n\nParameterization in query optimization involves using parameters instead of embedding values directly into the SQL statement. One of the primary reasons for parameterization is to prevent SQL injection attacks, where malicious SQL code is inserted into input fields by attackers. By parameterizing queries, input values are treated as data rather than executable code, reducing the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile improving query speed (option D) is also a potential benefit of parameterization, preventing SQL injections is typically the most critical reason for implementing parameterized queries in database applications."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138905-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-129-discussion/","choices":{"B":"To insert a temporary table","A":"To return a subset of records","D":"To increase the query speed","C":"To prevent SQL injections"},"timestamp":"2024-04-17 00:34:00","answer":"C","question_text":"Which of the following is the most likely reason for a data analyst to optimize a query using parameterization?","exam_id":351,"question_id":34,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1713306840,"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[]},{"id":"R1lqm4RJIsaqOSYtd4cV","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/93523-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-13-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nDiscrete data","timestamp":"1731455820.0","comment_id":"1068943","poster":"vesen22"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704176340.0","content":"D. The number of phone calls that a call center receives in a day is an example of discrete data. Discrete data refers to data that can only take on specific, distinct values within a given range. In this case, the number of phone calls can only be a whole number, and cannot take on any other value. For example, the call center might receive 100 calls one day, and 105 calls the next day, but it could not receive 100.5 calls. In contrast, continuous data refers to data that can take on any value within a given range, such as measurements or temperatures. Categorical data refers to data that can be divided into categories or groups, and ordinal data refers to data that has a specific order or ranking.","poster":"CineFeX","comment_id":"763542"}],"unix_timestamp":1672640340,"topic":"1","question_text":"The number of phone calls that call center receives in a day is an example of:","timestamp":"2023-01-02 07:19:00","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","question_id":35,"exam_id":351,"choices":{"D":"discrete data.","B":"categorical data.","C":"ordinal data.","A":"continuous data."},"answer":"D"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":219,"id":351,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"DA0-001","provider":"Comptia","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":7},"__N_SSP":true}
