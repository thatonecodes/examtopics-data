Conversely, \nthe report might be categorized as a false positive and dismissed. \nLessons Learned - The lessons learned process reviews severe security incidents to determine their root cause, whether they were avoidable, and how to avoid them in the future. The lessons learned process should invoke root cause analysis or the effort to \ndetermine how the incident was able to occur. A lot of models have been developed \nto structure root cause analysis. One is the “Five Whys” model.

Automated scanning\nExplanation:\nAutomated vulnerability scanning is the first step in identifying vulnerabilities across an environment. It systematically scans systems, networks, and applications for known security weaknesses, such as outdated software, misconfigurations, and missing patches.\nIt provides a broad and efficient assessment before deeper security evaluations like penetration testing or threat hunting.\nWhy Not the Other Options?\nB. Penetration testing → Penetration testing is a hands-on, targeted attack simulation, usually conducted after identifying vulnerabilities to confirm their exploitability.\nC. Threat hunting → This involves proactively searching for threats that have already bypassed defenses, not for general vulnerability discovery.\nD. Log aggregation → Collecting and analyzing logs helps with incident response and monitoring, but it does not directly identify vulnerabilities.\nE.

Obfuscation → This makes data harder to read but does not block access from high-risk regions.\nB.
