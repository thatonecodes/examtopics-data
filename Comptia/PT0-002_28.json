It can be used to discover hidden files, weak passwords, and other information that can be abused to gain access to a target system.","timestamp":"1678323300.0","comment_id":"833487","poster":"nickwen007","comments":[{"content":"B is correct","timestamp":"1678352100.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"833744"}],"upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"beamage","comments":[{"content":"CeWL will not crack the password","upvote_count":"1","poster":"beamage","comment_id":"824063","timestamp":"1677525120.0","comments":[{"content":"B is correct CeWL\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://allabouttesting.org/cewl-tool-for-generating-custom-wordlist-for-password-cracking/&ved=2ahUKEwiBhvTe5Lf9AhVJzaQKHVgvDYAQFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Wtyce5mx7Ecxd-dqfAdM6","comment_id":"824509","timestamp":"1677569040.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]"}]}],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nDirBuster can enhance what CeWL will be able to access and is a Brute-Forcer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"824060","timestamp":"1677525060.0"},{"poster":"toor777","comment_id":"766983","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1672946100.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCeWL, the Custom Word List Generator"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"747527","content":"B, https://esgeeks.com/como-utilizar-cewl/","timestamp":"1671218820.0","poster":"josepa"},{"comment_id":"747421","poster":"ExamTopics274","timestamp":"1671208800.0","content":"CeWL (Custom Word List generator) is a ruby app which spiders a given URL, up to a specified depth, and returns a list of words","upvote_count":"4"}],"answers_community":["B (97%)","3%"],"timestamp":"2022-12-16 17:40:00"}],"exam":{"id":362,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":445,"isMCOnly":false,"name":"PT0-002"},"currentPage":28},"__N_SSP":true}
