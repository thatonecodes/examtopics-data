Anycast addressing\n\nTo achieve the goal of accessing servers based on topographical proximity and having the next closest server respond if the first one does not, the technician should configure Anycast addressing.

Typically, excessive cable length can lead to attenuation and signal degradation, resulting in errors and retransmissions rather than late collisions.

I clarified a little more with Mr. Chatbot over here and got him to admit, \"Apologies for the confusion. If both devices are configured for half-duplex, the cable length could indeed be the cause of the issue. In half-duplex mode, Ethernet devices rely on CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) to detect and manage collisions on the network. CSMA/CD works by monitoring the transmission medium for other frames being transmitted and waiting for a gap to transmit its own frame. Excessive cable length can cause significant delays in the signal propagation, leading to overlapping frames and late collisions. Therefore, option C is a possible cause of the issue when both devices are set to half-duplex.\""}],"content":"Lol nevermind. See Chatgpt is stupid here.

In this scenario, since the devices on both ends of the link are configured for half-duplex, they cannot receive data while transmitting, which can result in late collisions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this issue is B. One of the devices is misconfigured. It is possible that one of the devices is operating in full-duplex mode instead of half-duplex mode.

However, if one device is configured for full-duplex mode and the other device is configured for half-duplex mode, it can result in collisions and other performance issues.\n\nOther potential causes, such as improper termination, excessive cable length, or a hardware issue, are less likely to cause late collisions on a half-duplex link.","poster":"SmokedQ","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"867439","timestamp":"1681226100.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"crazywai1221","content":"Selected Answer: D\nwhen i think of C, the cable length may be 100km+, it seems impossible\nI go for D","comment_id":"864053","timestamp":"1680882600.0"},{"timestamp":"1679877360.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nB.
