WPA2 with AES\n\nHere’s why:\n\n WPA2 with AES: WPA2 is the most secure option that most routers support, especially older ones. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is the more secure encryption protocol compared to TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), which is older and vulnerable to certain attacks. WPA2 with AES provides solid encryption for a secure wireless network.\n\n Why not WPA3?: WPA3 is the latest standard, offering improved security features, including stronger encryption and protection against brute-force attacks, but many older routers (especially 10-year-old models) do not support WPA3. If the router does not support WPA3, it won’t be an available option.\n\n Why not WPA2 with TKIP?: While TKIP is technically compatible with WPA2, it is outdated and much less secure than AES.

A log-in script is a set of instructions that execute when a user logs into a computer. The log-in script can be used to map network drives to the user's computer, so the user has access to the files on the network. If the log-in script fails to execute, then the network drives will not be mapped, and the user will be unable to connect to them.\n\nIt is less likely that the user is not connected to the VPN since other users have not reported any issues, and the file server is offline since other users would also be unable to access the network drives. A low battery is also an unlikely reason as it would not affect the user's ability to connect to network drives. Therefore, the failed log-in script is the most probable reason for the issue.
