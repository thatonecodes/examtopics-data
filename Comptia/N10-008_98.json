Because they aren't concurrently connected, if they have too high of a lease time then they can simply sit there connected hogging the network connections available.

Excluding the network address (10.0.0.0), DHCP server (10.0.0.1) and gateway IP (10.0.0.254), the DHCP scope that the server can give out would range from 10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.253.
