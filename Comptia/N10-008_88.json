Interference\n\nThe most likely cause of the issue is interference from the three-phase motor installation. Electrical motors, such as the three-phase motor mentioned, can generate electromagnetic interference (EMI) that affects nearby network cables. This interference can lead to high latency, packet loss, or other network issues. To mitigate this problem, consider rerouting the network cable away from the motor or using shielded twisted pair (STP) cables, which are designed to reduce the impact of electromagnetic interference."},{"comment_id":"1015119","poster":"PolyDork","upvote_count":"4","content":"I don't know what a three-phase motor is, but if it's right next to the cable, interference is almost certainly going to be your issue","timestamp":"1727110500.0"},{"timestamp":"1722218220.0","comment_id":"965982","upvote_count":"1","content":"BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ, you got da interference","poster":"gho5tface"},{"content":"ChatGPT and Google Bard both say it is A, and that is the most logical answer as well.","poster":"S5Networking","comment_id":"951127","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720919940.0"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/115114-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-494-discussion/"},{"id":"3ZaGIEEYg0WAUIyrzRJC","unix_timestamp":1681664760,"choices":{"B":"Collisions","C":"IP settings","A":"Broadcast storm","D":"Routing loops"},"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731883500.0","upvote_count":"11","comment_id":"900500","poster":"rah555","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA broadcast storm occurs when there is a high volume of broadcast traffic in a network, resulting in network congestion and performance degradation.
