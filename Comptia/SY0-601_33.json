My previous explanation focused on option B, which involves physically checking each system to identify the rogue device. This method is more reliable in confirming the presence of a rogue system but may be more time consuming. A ping sweep can help detect active devices on the network by sending ICMP echo requests to multiple IP addresses and waiting for responses. While it may help identify active devices and potentially reveal the rogue system, it may not provide enough information to conclusively determine if a device is unauthorized, as the rogue device could be configured not to respond to ICMP echo requests. Both options A and B can be used to detect rogue devices without causing downtime or impacting availability. However, option B is more reliable in confirming the presence of a rogue device, while option A may only provide limited information and may not conclusively identify the unauthorized device. Thus, I still believe option B is the more appropriate choice in this situation.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"875263","timestamp":"1681962420.0","content":"B\nA ping sweep is a network scanning technique used to discover active hosts or devices on a network.\nQuestion states \"small\" business.

However, doesn't it seem like a relevant piece of information that the UNKNOWN device record indicates that MAC filtering is OFF? Since PC2’s MAC filtering is also off, couldn’t PC2’s displayed MAC address also be a spoofed address? I’m not trying to be cute, it’s just that any given piece of information could be relevant and I don't see that anyone has considered that MAC Filtering is off for two of the devices.\n\nMy assumption for the answer is that the UNKOWN device needs to be properly identified, and that PC2 is an allowable device. By applying MAC Filtering, additional (though optional) fields are introduced that can further identify a device that correlates with the MAC address. It’s doubtful that administrators would list devices as “UNKNOWN” in their MAC Filters.
