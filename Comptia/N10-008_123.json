Port mirroring\n\nTo monitor traffic on a specific port on a switch, the network administrator should configure port mirroring. Port mirroring (also known as SPAN - Switched Port Analyzer) allows the switch to copy the traffic from one or more ports and send it to another port, known as the monitoring port. This enables the administrator to analyze and monitor the network traffic without disrupting the normal operation of the switch or the devices connected to the mirrored ports.","poster":"salah112","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1090405"}],"exam_id":357,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/128029-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-649-discussion/","question_text":"A network administrator needs to monitor traffic on a specific port on a switch.

It is measured as a negative number on a logarithmic scale, which means that the closer to 0 the RSSI is, the better the signal. Clearly, AP 1 and AP 2 has channel/frequency overlap that causes the RF signals to interfere with each other. Thus, the correct answer is A.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because by using directional antennas, the RF signal will be directed toward a single direction.

Reconfigure the channels to reduce overlap should be the NEXT step a wireless technician should take to troubleshoot this issue.\n\nBased on the site survey findings, it appears that AP3 and AP4 are operating on channels 5 and 11, respectively, which could be causing interference with AP1 and AP2, both of which are on channels 2 and 1, respectively. In addition, the RSSI for AP3 and AP4 is much stronger than for AP1 and AP2, which suggests that clients may be associating with AP3 and AP4 instead of AP1 and AP2.\n\nTo address this issue, the wireless technician should reconfigure the channels on the APs to reduce overlap and interference. This may involve changing the channel assignments for AP1 and AP2 to channels with less interference, such as 3 or 4. Additionally, decreasing the transmit power on AP3 and AP4 may also help to reduce interference and encourage clients to connect to AP1 and AP2 instead."},{"poster":"PatrickH","content":"Its gotta be D.
