Testing the theory.\n\nWhen troubleshooting an issue, testing the theory is part of the process of identifying a solution. After you’ve identified potential causes (through gathering information, spotting symptoms, and determining if anything has changed), you need to test those theories to see if they lead to a resolution of the problem. Testing helps confirm if the theory you have about the issue is correct, and if the solution works.","comment_id":"1365200","poster":"lexxone","timestamp":"1741137960.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1339708","timestamp":"1736723160.0","poster":"Demonia","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Flat file.\n\nA flat file is a simple data storage format where data is stored in a plain text file without any complex structure like tables or relationships. Comma-separated values (CSV) are a common example of flat file formats, where each record is separated by a comma, and each line represents a new record.

Replay attack --> Integrity: It is not an attack on confidentiality because the attacker isn't learning any new information: the attackers have the same data than what they recorded in the first place. Although, it might lead to an unauthorized access but that is a different issue. It is not an attack on availability because the target system will still be functioning normally (again, unless the replay attack opens up the way for a different kind of exploit). It is, however, a breach of the system integrity because it allowed an unauthorized transaction.

This can be compromised in a number of ways:\nSnooping—this is any attempt to get access to information on a host or storage device (data at rest) that you are not authorized to view. An attacker might steal a password or find an unlocked workstation with a logged-on user account, or they might install some sort of spyware on the host.\nEavesdropping/wiretapping—this is snooping on data or telephone conversations as they pass over the network. Snooping on traffic passing over a network is also often called sniffing. It can be relatively easy for an attacker to \"tap\" a wired network or intercept unencrypted wireless transmissions. Networks can use segmentation and encryption to protect data in-transit.\nSocial engineering/dumpster diving—this means getting users to reveal information or finding printed information. We'll discuss this topic in more detail later in this unit.","poster":"Dion79"},{"content":"I'd go with D","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Dion79","timestamp":"1634928540.0","comment_id":"466294"},{"poster":"Cybersmartie","comment_id":"416211","timestamp":"1627478220.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Agree.
