This can be a suitable solution for a company using legacy accounting software that may not be compatible with modern operating systems or hardware. By virtualizing the desktop environment, the company can continue to run the legacy software on a virtual machine while maintaining compatibility and isolation from the host system. It provides a way to extend the life of the legacy software without having to find a replacement or upgrade the underlying hardware and operating system.","comment_id":"966397","poster":"Andylove","timestamp":"1722255660.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (88%)","13%"],"timestamp":"2023-07-29 14:21:00","choices":{"B":"Storage","D":"Sandbox","A":"Network","C":"Desktop"},"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"mDw4L5VhdBooaI0qptbv","question_text":"The owner of a restaurant reports that wireless network connections are lost intermittently throughout the day.
