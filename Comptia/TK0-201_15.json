The instructor should avoid using jargon and acronyms before explaining them because it could confuse the learners.\n\nIt's important for instructors to use language that is understandable to their learners. While using jargon and acronyms that are familiar to most of the learners may establish credibility and show that the instructor is knowledgeable about the subject matter, it can also be confusing and intimidating for those who are not familiar with the terms. It's important for instructors to strike a balance between using language that demonstrates their expertise and using language that is accessible and understandable to all learners.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725856320.0","poster":"JimGrayham"}],"answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"question_text":"During the start of a class an instructor uses jargon and acronyms that are familiar to most of the learners and that are part of the course content.

The question states that this is a mandatory course which means the students have to take the course as part of a series of other courses. So for those students who are not willing to take the course there should be some form of flexibility to be provided to them, such as allowing them to setup break times.

Thus, if we want to motivate our students in a mandatory training, reminding them that their participation will be reported to the management will be the most reasonable strategy.

During introductions, inform the students of the situation.\n\nIf a trainer realizes that a friend is taking the course on the first day, it's important for the trainer to be transparent and address the situation with the entire class during introductions. This helps to establish trust and credibility with the students and ensures that there is no perception of favoritism or bias. The trainer should explain the situation and reassure the students that all students will be treated equally and evaluated based on their performance in the course. Proceeding with the course without addressing the situation may create a perception of unfairness or undermine the trainer's credibility.
