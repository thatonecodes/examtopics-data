SELinux operates in either Enforcing or Permissive mode, so \"Protecting\" is not a valid option for configuring SELinux.\n\nPermissive: In Permissive mode, SELinux policies are not enforced. Instead, SELinux logs the actions that would have been denied if the system were in Enforcing mode.

It operates in three modes: Enforcing, Permissive, and Disabled.\n\nIn the Enforcing mode, the policy is actively enforced and any actions not explicitly allowed by the policy are blocked and logged. This is the mode the shipping company should use if they want to ensure their custom Android devices are used exclusively for package tracking, as it will prevent any actions not permitted by the policy.\n\nThe Permissive mode is used for troubleshooting and logs violations of the policy but does not enforce it, allowing actions even if they are not permitted by the policy.\n\nThe Disabled mode turns off SELinux functionality altogether.\n\nTherefore, to eliminate entire classes of threats and ensure the devices are used exclusively for package tracking, the company should configure the devices to run in the Enforcing mode.","comment_id":"1223300"},{"timestamp":"1704934380.0","comment_id":"1119211","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Delab202","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux), after compiling and implementing a policy, the company must ensure that the devices are configured to run in:\n\nC.

Certificates have specific key usage flags that indicate what the certificate can be used for. For example, a certificate may be issued for digital signatures or for encryption. If the certificate is not set up for the correct key usage, it will not be able to sign the application correctly.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the certificate being used to sign the applications has been set up for the wrong key usage, causing the signature process to fail. The administrator should review the certificate's key usage and ensure it is set up correctly for signing applications.","poster":"javier051977","timestamp":"1696702800.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"864150"},{"comment_id":"834257","timestamp":"1694275920.0","poster":"hailhydra325","content":"Selected Answer: A\nHaving taught CA design and implementation, I've seen this NTP issue multiple times when students forget set the correct time in their VM labs.

Digital signatures typically require a certificate with the key usage of \"digital signature\" enabled.
