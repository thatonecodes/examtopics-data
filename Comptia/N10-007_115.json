I first saw this one from N10-005. Secondly, typical CompTIA half-ass question. Switches are in a loop and experiencing a broadcast storm. The power outage caused the switches to lose their Spanning tree protocol configuration. This would happen if you forgot to save the running-config to startup-config (copy run start). Real world fix would be to reconfigure switches, but in CompTIA land I would disable the ports that connect Switch 2 to Switch 3. Switch 1 is acting like the core switch and the other links/ports allow Switch 2 and 3 to directly connect to Switch1. If you disabled those links Switch 2 would have to forward traffic through Switch 3 to get to Switch 1 or vice versa.","timestamp":"1636080480.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"confusing answers here i hate all of u","poster":"Messi0001","comments":[{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1636497240.0","content":"Messi the best","poster":"aquilius","comment_id":"475107"}],"timestamp":"1635502800.0","comment_id":"469695"},{"comment_id":"460681","poster":"Technan456","timestamp":"1633965780.0","content":"Please god give me this as a simulation on the exam.. it's so simple lmao.","upvote_count":"5"},{"content":"hi all can someone help me here i can not see the different between the question and the answer it looked the same please help","comment_id":"460361","timestamp":"1633927080.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mandisi_saneleh"},{"comment_id":"450341","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Noman205","content":"in the real exam you cannot change the connections..you cannot move the cables connecting switches to the switch or switch to the pc.you cannot move any connection at all...only thing you can do is enable and disable switch ports...so what cud b the answer i do not get still","timestamp":"1632406560.0"},{"timestamp":"1632404520.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"i have this question on real exam last month..not sure how to solve this","comment_id":"450319","poster":"Noman205"},{"timestamp":"1631737740.0","content":"all ports should be enabled","comment_id":"445457","poster":"jojomax","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"mxh778872","timestamp":"1643918940.0","comment_id":"539941","content":"After switches reboot and enable all, the STP will blocks switch2/2 automatically, you need todo nothing"}],"poster":"Nebulise","upvote_count":"1","content":"Guys, is the correct answer to have all ports enabled as per the photo?
