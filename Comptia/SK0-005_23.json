One of the requirements for proper functioning of Kerberos is that the clocks of the client, server, and third-party server must be synchronized within a certain tolerance.

A vNIC (virtual network interface card) is what connects a VM to a virtual network, and it is responsible for sending and receiving network traffic. When a VLAN needs to be configured within a virtual environment for a new VM, creating a vNIC with the correct VLAN configuration will ensure that the VM receives a correct IP address within that VLAN. The virtual switch is what connects the vNIC to the physical network, and a virtual router may be necessary if the VLAN is to communicate with other networks or the Internet, but neither of these options specifically ensures that the VM receives a correct IP address. AVPN (Amazon Virtual Private Network) is a networking solution provided by Amazon Web Services and is not relevant to this scenario unless the virtual environment is hosted on AWS.
