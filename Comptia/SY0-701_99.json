IPSec with RADIUS\n\nExplanation:\nIPSec with RADIUS provides a secure remote access solution that includes AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) capabilities. RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a protocol specifically designed for AAA, ensuring that users are authenticated, authorized, and their activities are logged. IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) adds encryption to secure the data transmitted over the connection.\n\nRDP connection with LDAPS (B) provides secure remote desktop access but does not inherently include AAA functionality.\n\nWeb proxy for all remote traffic (C) is not a remote access solution and does not provide AAA capabilities.\n\nJump server with 802.1X (D) is used for secure access to internal resources but does not inherently provide AAA for remote access. 802.1X is primarily used for network access control.","comment_id":"1348027","timestamp":"1738081320.0"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1738081320,"topic":"1","question_text":"A company evaluates several options that would allow employees to have remote access to the network.

Smishing\nWhy?\nSmishing (SMS Phishing) is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker sends fraudulent text messages (SMS) to trick the recipient into taking action, such as resetting a password or providing sensitive information.\nIn this case, the attacker pretends to be the CEO and tries to manipulate the systems administrator into resetting a password, which could lead to unauthorized access.\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Typosquatting – This involves creating fake websites with misspelled domain names to trick users into visiting them, not SMS-based attacks.\nC. Pretexting – A broader social engineering technique where the attacker creates a fabricated scenario (pretext) to obtain information, but in this case, the attack method is specifically via SMS, making it smishing.\nD.

Avoid\nExplanation:\n✔ Risk avoidance involves modifying business operations to eliminate the risk rather than mitigating or transferring it.\n✔ In this scenario, the company chooses not to accept responsibility and shifts its focus to a different market segment, effectively avoiding the risk altogether.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. Exemption – Not a recognized risk management strategy in this context.\nB. Exception – Typically refers to granting temporary permission to bypass a security policy, not changing business strategy.\nD.
