An incorrect cable was used: The question mentions that both patch cables were changed with known working cables, so I doubt that the cables are the issue here or that they would grab the same incorrect cable\nC. The device failed during installation: They mentioned that the device was tested before installation, so it probably didn't fail during installation either.\nD. Attenuation is occurring: Attenuation is the loss of signal strength as it travels through a medium. This could make sense if this was over a long distance, but it's a datacenter so the connections are made over a short distance.","poster":"rodwave","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1726906560.0","poster":"Mehsotopes","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1069902","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMost fiber connections consist of two individual cables, one for transmission of data & one for receiving data. If you're connecting a switch to a workstation using a NIC that has Straight Tip (ST) connections on it, one will be Tx, & one will be Rx. You can check the NIC the ST connections are attached to, the solid orange light will indicates a good idle connection & blinking indicates the network is actively communicating through connection."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nI would go for A","timestamp":"1675074120.0","comment_id":"792636","upvote_count":"2","poster":"JakeCharles"},{"comments":[{"poster":"CTE_Instructor","comment_id":"738928","content":"LC fibers can be swapped because you can easily remove the connecting bracket.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1670497560.0"},{"timestamp":"1680894000.0","content":"While they do have them \"in place\" with one connector sometimes from the factory/distributor they are crisscrossed...this has happened to me before on a job.

However, let's remember that option B says \"wrong cable\", not wrong connector or wrong signal. Also even if a LC has a fixed TX/RX in place with one connector, you can still mess up with a mislabelled patch panel.

An LC cable has both the TX/RX in place with one connector, it's not like an ST where the cables could be swapped. My best guess would be B then? Just because the cable is good doesn't mean it's compatible. Based on this from Meyers \n\"Finally, different runs of fiber use different wavelength signals. You might be able to plug an LC connector into a switch just fine, for example, but if the signal starts at 1310 nm and the switch expects 1530 nm, that sort of wavelength mismatch will stop the transmission cold.\" Still not 100% sure though.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1667000520.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"jr6666","timestamp":"1655317140.0","content":"answer is a","comment_id":"616897"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"598254","content":"Answer is A","poster":"Touch_91","timestamp":"1651948560.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"We have to understand the difference between crossover and straight through cabling..","timestamp":"1646265120.0","poster":"Stpn2me","comment_id":"559755"},{"timestamp":"1643983320.0","comment_id":"540457","upvote_count":"1","poster":"itssnowyseason","content":"Answer is A?"},{"timestamp":"1642696500.0","comment_id":"528590","upvote_count":"1","poster":"geober","content":"Sorry that was not properly set up"},{"timestamp":"1642696440.0","comments":[{"poster":"ArchEpic","timestamp":"1646150940.0","content":"Correct, but, TX/RX reverse means the ingress and egress traffic ends of, depending on the pinout configuration, and reversed or plainly wrong.
