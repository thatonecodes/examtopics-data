It contains information about file systems to be mounted, including the device name, mount point, file system type, and mount options. The error message indicates that a dependency has failed for \"/data\" and for local file systems, which suggests that there is an issue with one of the file systems listed in the /etc/fstab file.\n\nIt is likely that the device name, mount point, file system type, or mount options for \"/data\" or another file system listed in /etc/fstab is incorrect or outdated, causing the system to fail to mount the file system during boot.

This makes it possible to apply changes to the SSH configuration file without disrupting any active SSH sessions.\n\nUsing the systemctl reload sshd command will cause the SSH service to reload its configuration file and apply any changes that have been made, without requiring the service to be stopped and restarted. This is the preferred method of applying changes to the SSH configuration file because it allows changes to be made without affecting any currently connected users.\n\nIf the systemctl reload sshd command is not available, the systemctl restart sshd command can be used instead. This will stop and start the SSH service, terminating all existing connections and applying the new configuration settings.
