Train them! Issues like \"How do I print...\" will come up thousands of times unless you take proactive steps to make your coworkers sufficient. It's totally acceptable to create a powerpoint, send an email, write a document, or whatever is neccesary to explain different systems and technology. As a rule, realize that if you don't train your staff. They won't learn it themselves. Often they'll continue poor habits or waste time and resources (Printing on one side, not doing collated). Simple things like this go a long way. The same goes for Office products, Windows 10, Email systems. Think through what a person needs to know on Day one to be sufficient and start communicating that. Overcommunicate. It'll save you tons of time solving problems that could have been avoided.","poster":"MrCompTIA","upvote_count":"4"}],"choices":{"B":"Orientation","A":"Collate","C":"Duplex","D":"Transparency"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2019-11-25 15:38:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/9065-exam-220-1001-topic-1-question-8-discussion/","question_id":402,"exam_id":337,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1574692680,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","question_text":"A user wants to print a large job on both the front and back sides of the paper.\nWhich of the following settings should the technician advise the user to change in the printer settings?","topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","answer_description":""},{"id":"eyFe7qMAe1xEiTRClgmY","answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/18776-exam-220-1001-topic-1-question-80-discussion/","discussion":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"642056","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1659554400.0","content":"Because he is connecting it to the company","poster":"Sami97789"}],"comment_id":"580477","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1649027460.0","poster":"iLikeBeagButt","content":"Why is this not LAN?
