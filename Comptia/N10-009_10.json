Out-of-band management.\n\nOut-of-band management allows administrators to access and manage network appliances remotely, even when the device has not started up properly or is not functioning on the primary network. It typically uses a dedicated management interface separate from the regular network traffic, enabling troubleshooting and configuration in such scenarios.","timestamp":"1734557940.0","poster":"ba10f26","comment_id":"1328723","upvote_count":"1"}],"choices":{"D":"Out-of-band management","A":"Crash cart","B":"Jump box","C":"Secure Shell"},"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/150287-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-14-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-10-26 10:49:00","question_id":46,"unix_timestamp":1729932540,"answer":"D","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following should be used to obtain remote access to a network appliance that has failed to start up properly?","answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"YeRyaIPqhIfdnfvjiSEH","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"HeatSquad77","timestamp":"1735582500.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines public and private clouds, as well as on-premises data centers, to run applications","comment_id":"1334315"}],"choices":{"D":"Private","C":"SaaS","B":"Hybrid","A":"Public"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"To reduce costs and increase mobility, a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) wants to adopt cloud services for the organization and its affiliates.

Enable 802.1Q.\nD. Set up voice VLANs.\n\nExplanation:\n\nB. Enable 802.1Q: 802.1Q is a VLAN tagging protocol that allows multiple VLANs to be carried over a single physical link. Since the network is already segmented for computers and servers, enabling 802.1Q allows the switch ports to carry both data and voice traffic over the same physical connection, effectively supporting the new VoIP network without requiring additional switch ports.\n\nD. Set up voice VLANs: Voice VLANs are required to separate voice traffic from data traffic on the same network. This ensures that voice data is prioritized for quality and performance while keeping it logically isolated from other types of traffic, which is critical for VoIP performance.","poster":"HeatSquad77"}],"unix_timestamp":1736182020,"timestamp":"2025-01-06 17:47:00"},{"id":"ZzGJCY4fcUZKDYMWu7cy","question_text":"A network rack has four servers and four switches with dual power supplies.
