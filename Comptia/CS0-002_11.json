Use AppLocker to create a set of whitelist and blacklist rules specific to group membership.\n\nAppLocker is a security feature in Windows that allows you to create policies to control which applications are allowed to run on a system. In this scenario, using AppLocker to create a set of whitelist rules specific to group membership would be the best action. This approach would allow the security analyst to specify which applications (such as the command prompt, PowerShell, and other system utilities) are allowed to run based on the user's group membership.","timestamp":"1703174340.0","poster":"RobV","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1701386880.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAppLocker is a Microsoft Windows feature that allows administrators to create policies to control which applications are allowed to run on a system.

These templates can be used to configure settings for standard users just like they can be used to configure settings for privileged users. For example, an organization can use administrative templates to configure security settings, software installation and maintenance settings, and settings for specific applications for standard users.\n\nIt's important to note that while standard users may not have the ability to modify GPO settings themselves, the administrative templates can be used by a privileged user, such as an administrator, to configure settings for standard users. These templates can be used to restrict access to certain features or applications for standard users, or to configure settings that will enforce specific policies for standard users.\n\nIt's important to review and test the changes made by GPO for standard users, to ensure that the changes do not negatively impact their daily work.","timestamp":"1673954220.0","poster":"trojan123","comment_id":"778831"}],"timestamp":"1673532360.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"trainingsmits","comment_id":"773537"},{"comment_id":"736228","timestamp":"1670268360.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis should D. The problem states the user has been given excessive permissions violating the principle of least privilege, removing the user's access to stated executables will correct the user's permission.
