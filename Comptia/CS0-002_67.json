ICS are often critical for public safety and national security, and therefore a prime target for cyberattacks. One of the greatest security concerns regarding ICS is that issues on the systems cannot be reversed without rebuilding the systems. This means that any damage or disruption caused by an attack can have long-lasting and catastrophic consequences for the physical infrastructure and human lives.

Issues on the systems cannot be reversed without rebuilding the systems.\n\nIn ICS environments, especially in critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, water, and manufacturing, the operational technology (OT) systems often control essential processes and may be responsible for human safety. These systems are designed for reliability and availability and are typically challenging to modify or reverse without significant disruption to operations. As a result, security incidents, such as malware infections or breaches, can have severe consequences and may require rebuilding or reconfiguring systems, causing significant downtime and potentially substantial costs. Therefore, protecting ICS from cyber threats and vulnerabilities is of paramount importance.","comment_id":"1042194"},{"poster":"Rori791","comment_id":"956051","timestamp":"1689726240.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the best option. \nA. The involved systems are generally hard to identify.\nIt is true that ICS systems can be difficult to identify and locate, but this is not the greatest security concern for ICS. There are various techniques and tools available to help identify and map out ICS systems, such as network scanning and vulnerability assessments. Once the systems are identified, appropriate security measures can be implemented to protect them.\n\nB. The systems are configured for automatic updates, leading to device failure.\nAutomatic updates can sometimes cause issues with ICS systems, but it is not the greatest security concern for ICS.

While rebuilding the systems may be necessary in some cases, it is not always the only option.\n\nC. The systems are oftentimes air-gapped, leading to fileless malware attacks.\nAir-gapping of ICS systems is a significant security concern because it can make it more difficult to detect and respond to fileless malware attacks, which are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated.
