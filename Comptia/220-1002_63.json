Within the OSI model of networking, logical diagrams are referred to as â€˜L2â€™.\n\nA physical network diagram will, ideally, show the network topology exactly as it is: with all of the devices and the connections between them. Because physical diagrams depict all of the physical aspects of the network, they will likely include: ports, cables, racks, servers, specific models, and so on. Within the OSI model of networking, physical diagrams are referred to as â€˜L1â€™. So, a physical network diagram could be a networkâ€™s server diagram, a networkâ€™s cabling diagram, racks diagram, or a mix of different types of diagram that is interactive and allows you to view what you need to see (if youâ€™re using automated mapping software).","timestamp":"1618619820.0"},{"content":"OCD is correct","timestamp":"1704204900.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"c22e828","comment_id":"1111950"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"This question is in Exam Cram book by Prowse. \nCorrect: B. physical network diagram - will show switches and their individual ports.

A logical network topology diagram will show how all devices are connected over the network, where a physical network diagram will show the physicality of it (what plugs into what, their location in the building, etc). The logical topology diagram will show what clients connect to what switches, and what switches connect to the routers, and how it goes though firewalls, and so forth.
