You would generally want to perform a stealth scan, use a slower timing template to make the scan less obvious, and avoid unnecessary options that could increase visibility.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Uses TCP connect scan (-sT) and very verbose output (-vvv), and attempts OS detection (-O), which might be more likely to trigger alarms.\nB. Scans for service versions (-sV), which is more aggressive and could also trigger alarms.\nC. Uses the ACK scan (-sA), which might not be the best choice for stealth in this situation.\nD.
