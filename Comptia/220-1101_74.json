Hybrid\n\nExplanation:\n\nHybrid cloud combines both private and public cloud infrastructures, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model provides flexibility and customization options, allowing the company to keep sensitive or critical workloads in a private cloud environment while leveraging the cost-effectiveness and scalability of public cloud resources for other aspects.","comment_id":"1132082","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1740780360.0","poster":"JonHin","comments":[{"poster":"JonHin","timestamp":"1740780360.0","comment_id":"1363267","upvote_count":"1","content":"A private cloud service is a cloud service that is dedicated to a single customer, and is hosted either on-premises or by a third-party provider. A hybrid cloud model allows the company to use the public cloud for cost-effective and scalable services, such as storage, backup, or analytics, and use the private cloud for more sensitive or customized services, such as security, compliance, or performance. A hybrid cloud model also enables the company to move workloads between the public and private cloud as needed, depending on the demand, availability, or cost. A hybrid cloud model can provide the company with the best of both worlds: the flexibility and efficiency of the cloud, and the control and customization of the infrastructure."}],"content":"C is correct answer\nA hybrid cloud model would best address the companyâ€™s needs of saving money by leveraging the cloud while still being able to customize the infrastructure. A hybrid cloud model is a combination of public and private cloud services, connected by a secure network.

Here's why:\n\nLimited Customization: Public cloud providers offer standardized infrastructure and services. While they provide a high degree of flexibility, they may not always meet the specific customization needs of an organization.\nSecurity Concerns: Public cloud environments share resources with other organizations, which can raise security concerns, especially for sensitive data.\nVendor Lock-in: Relying heavily on a single public cloud provider can lead to vendor lock-in, making it difficult to migrate to another provider in the future.\n\nGG","comment_id":"1315654","timestamp":"1732165860.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nnot sure why it'd be hybrid, when the question prefaced cost and flexibility. hybrid does offer some flexibility (even though it's less flexible than hybrid), but it's also known for being more expensive."}],"choices":{"C":"Hybrid","B":"Public","A":"Private","D":"Community"},"question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"inWQs77X0liVnLK91Cid","unix_timestamp":1706218080,"question_id":367,"choices":{"D":"Satellite","C":"DSL","B":"Cable","A":"Fiber"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/132171-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-429-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following internet connection types would be the most readily available for users located on unimproved land that lacks infrastructure?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFor users located on unimproved land that lacks infrastructure, the most readily available internet connection type is:\n\nD.

Cross-platform virtualization is the best solution for running Windows software on a computer running macOS. Cross-platform virtualization allows the user to create a virtual environment on their computer that mimics a different operating system, in this case Windows. The user can then install the Windows software within this virtual environment and run it just as they would on a computer running Windows.\n\nOperating system spoofing involves tricking the computer into thinking it is running a different operating system, which is not recommended as it can compromise the security and stability of the computer.\n\nRemote software provisioning involves accessing software on a remote computer and using it as if it were installed locally, which may not be feasible in this scenario if the software is only available on Windows.\n\nIndirect software implementation involves running the software through an intermediary such as a compatibility layer, which may not be possible for the specific software in question.","comment_id":"802869","poster":"Shah_Naaz"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1362242","poster":"vduffy75","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCross-Platform","timestamp":"1740595020.0"},{"poster":"Chavozamiri","timestamp":"1729291020.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
