As an example, Microsoft Windows 10 supports picture passwords. Users first select a picture, and then they can add three gestures as their picture password. Gestures include tapping in specific places on the picture, drawing lines between items with a finger, or drawing a circle around an item such as someone’s head. After registering the picture and their gestures, users repeat these gestures to log on again later.\n\n-Security+ SY0-601 Get Certified Get Ahead by Darril Gibson","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"993722","timestamp":"1693373220.0"},{"poster":"Alcpt","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727768820.0","comment_id":"1291859","content":"Selected Answer: B\n=B"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nHad a similar question to this in bootcamp: \n\nspecific gesture is “Something you know” we have to assume that isn’t the answer because it isn’t an option, and the same goes with this only being single factor.

Non-functional testing tests everything outside the primary function of the code. This includes security testing and performance testing. Black-box testing separates the tester from the source code. The tester inserts inputs and checks the outputs, looking for weaknesses or flaws. Staging often employs sandboxing, the use of virtual machines (VMs) to enable aggressive testing of the application without risking any problems with the rest of the network.\n\n-Mike Meyers' Security+ SY0-601 Certification Guide Third Edition","upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1693374180.0","poster":"LeonardSnart"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/119352-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-649-discussion/"}],"exam":{"name":"SY0-601","numberOfQuestions":860,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":367,"provider":"Comptia"},"currentPage":122},"__N_SSP":true}
