Most cases of a power surge/spike, the buildings power panel will throw breakers to avoid the surge from causing fire by overheating the wires and outlets as well as protecting any machines plugged into those sockets. However, that safety feature is not without faults. That is where the surge protectors come in. With that said, if the breakers were to flip to cut the circuit, you then have no power which will result in the missing time in the event logs. A power recycle of a machine turning off and back on will still log the occurrence in the event logs. So to prevent gaps in the event log due to the server not being on, you would need the battery backup."}],"poster":"chuda"},{"timestamp":"1583818920.0","poster":"csgx","content":"Why not B?
