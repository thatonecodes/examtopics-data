This cloud model is ideal for the scenario where organizations are working together and need to migrate project-related data to the cloud.\n\nWhy Not A (Public): Public cloud is shared among all users and lacks the collaboration-specific features of a community cloud.\n\nWhy Not B (Hybrid): Hybrid cloud combines public and private resources but is not tailored to multiple organizations working on a joint project.\n \n\nWhy Not C (Private): Private cloud is exclusive to a single organization and unsuitable for collaboration among multiple entities.\nCompTIA A+ Exam Reference: Core 1 (220-1101), Section 4.1, cloud computing models."},{"poster":"kinglema","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Community: This is the correct answer. A community cloud is designed for specific organizations with shared concerns (such as security, compliance, or performance).

Autoconnect\nIf the user's smartphone is only showing the 5G symbol, it means the device is prioritizing the 5GHz Wi-Fi band. In some cases, the 5GHz band may have a weaker signal or be less stable, especially in areas with obstacles or interference.\n\nBy enabling the \"Autoconnect\" setting, the smartphone will automatically switch to the 2.4 GHz band if the 5 GHz signal is weak or unstable. The 2.4 GHz band generally has better range and penetration, which can improve the connection and allow the user to access the network.\n\nGG","comment_id":"1316887","timestamp":"1732414800.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Nate_A"},{"poster":"HeatSquad77","timestamp":"1732298460.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1316434","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhow is VPN the correct answer? the user is not trying to connect from a remote location. hes onsite trying to connect but he probably doesn't have auto connect enabled"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn many cases, when connected to a Virtual Private Network (VPN), the smartphone will route all network traffic through the VPN, including Wi-Fi connections, which could cause confusion or prevent local network access.

Autoconnect\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The smartphone is only showing the 5G symbol, which indicates that it is connected to a 5G network but not the company's network.\n\n2. Enabling Wi-Fi on the smartphone suggests that the device is able to detect and connect to wireless networks, but it is not automatically connecting to the company's network.\n\n3. The most likely issue is that the \"autoconnect\" or \"auto-join\" feature for the company's wireless network is not enabled on the smartphone. This feature allows the device to automatically connect to a known and preferred wireless network when it is in range.\n\n3. By configuring the autoconnect or auto-join setting for the company's wireless network on the smartphone, the user can ensure that the device will automatically connect to the correct network when it is available, resolving the connectivity issue.","comment_id":"1278564","upvote_count":"4"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/146965-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-613-discussion/","exam_id":339,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1725496020,"choices":{"C":"Encryption","D":"WPS","B":"VPN","A":"Autoconnect"},"timestamp":"2024-09-05 02:27:00","answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","question_id":572,"answers_community":["A (80%)","B (20%)"],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"gIAuYVs394j3V23nxPcw","question_id":573,"exam_id":339,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"CMOS battery","C":"NTP server","D":"RAM","A":"OS updates"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/149436-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-614-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe CMOS battery powers the real-time clock (RTC) on the motherboard, which maintains the date and time when the computer is turned off.
