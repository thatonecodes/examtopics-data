In an XSS attack, an attacker injects malicious scripts into a trusted website, which then executes those scripts in the browsers of unsuspecting users. This can happen when the website fails to properly validate and sanitize user input, allowing the attacker to inject malicious code.\n\nIn this case, the pop-up window used to collect user credentials is not a legitimate part of the trusted website's design. The attacker has injected a script that creates the pop-up and tricks the user into entering their login credentials into the fake form. The credentials are then captured and sent to the attacker, compromising the user's account.\n\nTo prevent XSS attacks, web applications should implement proper input validation and output encoding to ensure that user-supplied data is treated as data and not executable code. Additionally, using security mechanisms like Content Security Policy (CSP) and sanitizing user input can help protect against XSS vulnerabilities.","timestamp":"1690498440.0","comment_id":"965131"},{"comments":[{"content":"I meant C","comment_id":"959990","timestamp":"1690076940.0","poster":"pachosinfortuna","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt is most probable be DNS poisoning.
