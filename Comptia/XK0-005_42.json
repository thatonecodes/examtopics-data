Cloud-init\n\nCloud-init is a popular tool used for provisioning virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud. It is commonly used to automate the initial configuration of cloud instances, such as setting up SSH keys, creating users, installing packages, and so on.\n\nWhen installing packages during VM provisioning, cloud-init can be configured to run a script that installs the required packages, or to use a package management tool such as apt-get or yum to install the packages.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the cloud engineer should use cloud-init to accomplish the task of installing packages during VM provisioning. This will ensure that the packages are installed consistently and correctly, and that the VMs are properly configured for use.","comment_id":"806901"},{"content":"The correct tool for a cloud engineer to use when installing packages during VM provisioning is:\n\nA. Cloud-init\n\nHere’s why:\n\nCloud-init is a widely used approach to initialize cloud instances. It is a package that contains utilities for early boot configuration of a cloud instance. It can handle tasks such as setting up users, SSH keys, and installing packages, making it an ideal choice for this task.","poster":"ericsrz","timestamp":"1718604600.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1098741"}],"question_id":207,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1676244180,"timestamp":"2023-02-13 00:23:00","choices":{"B":"Bash","A":"Cloud-init","D":"Sidecar","C":"Docker"}},{"id":"X5kgsXIrEEeSWpNtl8z2","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"806910","poster":"linux_admin","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe technology used by the systems administrator in this task is Ansible.\n\nThe code is written in YAML and is using an Ansible module, specifically the \"community.abc.ec2_instance\" module, to create a cloud-based server with a public IP address.
