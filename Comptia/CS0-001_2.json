The question is \"... vulnerabilities with lower CVSS scores may get a higher priority if they are easier to implement ... \". Let's assume the CVSS Score is 7 for a minute:\n\nA. Hard: 7 * 0.1 = 0.7\n Easy: 7 * 1 = 7\nB. Hard: 7 * 5 = 35\n Easy: 7 * 1 = 7\nC. Hard: 7 / 1 = 7\n Easy: 7 / 10 = 0.7\nD. Hard: (7 * 2) / 1 = 14\n Easy: (7 * 2) / 5 = 2.8\n\nSo, A is the only correct answer imho.

Makes sense and I think that is the right answer, just one note, CVSS scores is not really equal to risk. We can never quantify a risk/envi to a specific number since there is too many factor to consider, we can only say quantitative risk like high, moderate or low.
