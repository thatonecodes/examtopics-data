Check the speed and duplex settings on the switch.\n\nSince the user's new computer is experiencing slow network speeds despite swapping out the patch cable, the next step should be to check the speed and duplex settings on the switch to which the computer is connected. Mismatched speed and duplex settings between the computer's network interface card (NIC) and the switch port can lead to network performance issues. Ensuring that both sides are configured correctly can help resolve the slow network speed problem. If the settings are mismatched, they should be adjusted to match each other (e.g., both set to \"Auto\" or manually configured with the same values).","timestamp":"1692599280.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"ComPCertOn","content":"the answer is B!
