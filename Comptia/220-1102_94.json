UPnP allows devices on the network to automatically discover and interact with each other, including opening ports for certain applications or services. However, disabling UPnP prevents this automatic port forwarding, ensuring that only manually configured port forwarding rules are active, thereby providing better control over incoming traffic.","poster":"Sanan4ik"}],"timestamp":"2024-04-21 16:03:00","question_id":466,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1713708180,"exam_id":340,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"A SOHO wireless router needs to be configured so incoming traffic is only allowed on specified ports.
