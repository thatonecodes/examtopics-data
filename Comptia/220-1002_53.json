You can't just move it into another PC and mount it or you risk the infection spreading. So instead you can mount it via a \"forensic platform\" that will allow you to scan the drive without the risk of the infection spreading further into your system. For a basic example you could redirect a usb port to a virtual machine and inspect it in there, that way if there is an infection that spreads it will only affect the virtual machine and not anything else.

Option A seems a more likely fit that D. If the files are moved to a specific user account folder or a different machine then users may need to be added to the local admin group to access it. This is more true if the new drive or parent folder requires admin permissions/group-membership to read because moving files across drives changes the files permissions to inherit from the destination.
