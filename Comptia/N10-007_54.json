This procedure is known as on-boarding. As mobile devices leave the control of the organization, those same devices must be confirmed\nto no longer store any proprietary applications or data, a process called offboarding.\"\n\n\"Off-Boarding\nMobile devices move out of organizations just as often as they move in, for\nvarious reasons. A person quits and intends to take their phone with them.\nMobile devices get old and are due for replacement. A device that uses tablets\nfor controls switches from iPads to Android tablets.

Off boarding is the removal of an employee or service and the process to follow in doing so. So in the case of off boarding a company that is doing a service and is not an employee (third party)we have a policy in place to off board the 3rd party service, its access, and decommission the hardware and data. This may include who owns the data, how the data is collected, and what the data can be used for. In the question above we are tasked with disposal of old network devices and not services…. therefore the answer is (A) system life - cycle procedures.
