Port mirroring\n\nPort mirroring (or port spanning) involves configuring a network switch to send a copy of network packets from one port (or a set of ports) to another designated port, where the server with the 10Gb connection is connected. By setting up port mirroring on the switch, the administrator can capture and analyze the network traffic passing through the 40Gb connection without affecting the actual traffic flow.
