RC4 is a stream cipher that has known vulnerabilities and has been deprecated by the industry due to its security weaknesses. If the attacker can break RC4 encryption, they can potentially intercept and view the sensitive information transmitted between the client and the server. Therefore, an attack that breaks RC4 encryption is the most likely to succeed.","comment_id":"830125"},{"comment_id":"1350415","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe output states: \n\nLOW: 64 Bit + DES, RC(2,4) w/o export offered (NOT ok)\nTriple DES Ciphers / IDEA offered\n\nSo both RC4 and 3DES (Triple DES) are offered. The Sweet32 attack can break 3DES so option A is also correct, however, RC4 is faster to break as it's much weaker than 3DES. The question asks \"Which is most likely to succeed?\".

A birthday attack on 64-bit ciphers (Sweet32)\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe scan results indicate that the service supports TLS1.0, which is deprecated, and offers “Low” ciphers, including 64-bit DES and RC2 ciphers. The presence of these 64-bit block ciphers makes the system vulnerable to the Sweet32 attack.\n\nSweet32 (Birthday Attack on 64-bit Ciphers):\n\n • Sweet32 is a practical attack against the use of 64-bit block ciphers in TLS and SSL. The attack exploits the birthday paradox to find a collision in the cipher’s 64-bit block size, allowing an attacker to decrypt sensitive data. The scan shows that “LOW: 64 Bit + DES, RC[2,4] (w/o export) offered (NOT ok),” indicating that these vulnerable ciphers are indeed supported.","comment_id":"1242352","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"D is the answer!
