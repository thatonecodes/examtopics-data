Reducing MTU size means faster packet transmission.","poster":"Kobigasi","timestamp":"1724810760.0"}],"poster":"BeauChateau","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Enable compression between the servers.\n\nEnabling compression between the servers can help to reduce the network delay without taxing other system resources. Compression reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network, thereby reducing the overall network delay. Compression can be particularly effective for data that is highly redundant or compressible, such as text files or log files.","comment_id":"870555","timestamp":"1681524180.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"poster":"TheFivePips","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGiven the options and considering the potential impact on system resources, if I had to choose one, I would lean towards Option A: Decrease the MTU size on both servers.\n\nWhile both options have their pros and cons, reducing the MTU size addresses potential delays caused by packet fragmentation, which can occur when packets are too large to traverse certain network segments without being fragmented. By reducing the MTU size, we aim to minimize the need for packet fragmentation, thus potentially reducing delays associated with retransmission of fragmented packets.\n\nAdditionally, adjusting the MTU size is a network-level configuration that doesn't directly impose additional computational overhead on the servers, unlike enabling compression. While decreasing the MTU size may lead to slightly more packets being sent, it generally doesn't require significant additional computational resources compared to compression.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the specific network environment and the underlying causes of network delay that the question simply does not give us.","timestamp":"1716219240.0","comment_id":"1214460"},{"poster":"kuzummjakk","timestamp":"1710105960.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI was gonna say C, but i realized it doesn't say \"other systems\", it says \"other system RESOURCES\".","comment_id":"1170634","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1001876","upvote_count":"2","poster":"cobbs","timestamp":"1694118600.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIncreasing the MTU can improve performance, but decreasing the MTU can resolve packet loss and fragmentation problems when it is too high (and will not tax system resources like \"enable compression\" would)."},{"timestamp":"1685390160.0","poster":"SecPlus2022","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAs Maelo states, compression and decompression takes CPU resources to process.
