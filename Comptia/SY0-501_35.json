Same way they can track you even without you turning on \"location services\"....they do it with metadata and google typically still tracks you even when the phone is off. saw an undercover investigative story on the news where a guy took 2 phones, one on and one powered off....he was able to show that the damn phone that was off actually upload more data to google than the phone that was powered off....google will grab wifi signals you walk past and shoot out this metadata....they claim you signed off on it and they also claim it is used for their advertisement backend. power off your phone and frequent some sporting goods stores for a week and I bet you get sporting good ads in email and on Facebook etc....this is that same metadata principle that handles the Geotagging which is the concern in this question. Also notice how you can lose service but Google Maps stills directs you to the destination. Long as you load the destination and begin mapping to your destination, it will carry you 100 miles, through places in Montana where you hit no towers , and you will always have accurate maps and travel directions....Please listen, the given answer is correct.","timestamp":"1609510320.0","poster":"who__cares123456789___","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Yes you are right.\nThis is the reason I'm downgrading to an iphone to upgrade my privacy.","comment_id":"385714","poster":"Texrax","timestamp":"1624128780.0"}],"comment_id":"256847"}],"comment_id":"68683","poster":"brandonl","content":"B- location based services.

As with the e-mail messages used in regular phishing expeditions, spear phishing messages appear to come from a trusted source. Phishing messages usually appear to come from a large and well-known company or Web site with a broad membership base, such as eBay or PayPal. In the case of spear phishing, however, the apparent source of the e-mail is likely to be an individual within the recipient's own company and generally someone in a position of authority.\n2: The Hoax in this question is designed to make people believe that the fake AV (anti- virus) software is genuine.\n3: Vishing is the act of using the telephone in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft. The scammer usually pretends to be a legitimate business, and fools the victim into thinking he or she will profit.\n4: Email spam, also referred to as junk email, is unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email (spamming).\n5: Similar in nature to e-mail phishing, pharming seeks to obtain personal or private (usually financial related) information through domain spoofing. Rather than being spammed with malicious and mischievous e-mail requests for you to visit spoof Web sites which appear legitimate, pharming 'poisons' a DNS server by infusing false information into the DNS server, resulting in a user's request being redirected elsewhere. Your browser, however will show you are at the correct\nWeb site, which makes pharming a bit more serious and more difficult to detect. Phishing attempts to scam people one at a time with an e-mail while pharming allows the scammers to target large groups of people at one time through domain spoofing.\nReferences:\nhttp://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/spear-phishing http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/V/vishing.html http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/phishing.html http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/pharming.html","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03794/0000600001.jpg"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"10","poster":"Heymannicerouter","comment_id":"346458","content":"First one is whaling, not spear phishing; \"CEO and board members\"","timestamp":"1619816280.0"},{"upvote_count":"9","timestamp":"1620865860.0","comment_id":"355866","poster":"bdelude","content":"This question is tricky and I agree outside of this test.
