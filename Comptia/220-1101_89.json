The printer's drum is a critical component in this process, as it is responsible for transferring the image onto the paper. The drum is coated with a thin layer of electrically charged toner, which is attracted to the areas of the drum that have been exposed to the laser beam. When the drum rotates, it transfers the toner onto the paper, which is then fused to the paper by the printer's fuser.\n\nIf the drum is damaged or worn, it can cause various issues with the print quality, including vertical streaks on the output.
