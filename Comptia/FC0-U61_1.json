Fiber optic\nExplanation:\nFiber optic internet provides high-speed, high-bandwidth, and low-latency connectivity, making it ideal for remote users who require significant bandwidth for tasks such as video conferencing, large file transfers, and cloud-based applications.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. T1 line – T1 lines are outdated and offer only 1.54 Mbps, which is insufficient for modern high-bandwidth applications.\nB. Satellite – Satellite connections have high latency and can be unreliable, making them less suitable for real-time applications.\nD.

Email encryption – Encrypts email messages, not the entire laptop. It does not protect files stored on the device.\nC.

Disk management\nExplanation:\nIOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) is a performance measurement used to evaluate storage devices such as hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and storage area networks (SANs). It measures how many read and write operations a storage system can handle per second, making it directly related to disk management.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nB.
