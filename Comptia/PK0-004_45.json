While an intranet can be a useful tool for sharing information among employees, it may not provide the level of security that is needed for sensitive information that could affect the success of the project.\n\nAn extranet, on the other hand, is a private network that is accessible to a specific group of people, such as partners, suppliers, or customers, who have been granted access. An extranet allows users outside of the organization to access certain resources on the organization's private network, while still maintaining a level of security and control over who has access to the information. In this case, the PM is requesting the development of a project repository that will contain sensitive information that should only be accessible to personnel who need to know it, which suggests that an extranet would be the most appropriate site type for this purpose.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kmanb"},{"content":"Intranet best answer since its security protocols are internally controlled. \nWiki is possible though it is more commonly regarded as public access.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"688725","timestamp":"1665154500.0","poster":"ItsMeAgain99"},{"comment_id":"676230","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Manzer","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI'll go with Wiki.
