VM was moved. Storage profile should be transparent to the application and its compatibility, but overall storage behaviour adds complexity, so latency.

Lock-in.

Licensing: While licensing considerations may be important, especially when migrating to another cloud provider, they are generally more manageable compared to the challenges of vendor lock-in. Licensing issues can often be addressed through negotiations with vendors or by selecting cloud providers with favorable licensing terms.\n\nB. Authentication providers: Authentication providers, such as identity and access management (IAM) services, are important for security and user management but are typically more adaptable to different cloud environments. While there may be some differences in authentication mechanisms between cloud providers, they are generally less restrictive than platform-specific components.\n\nC. Service-level agreement (SLA): Service-level agreements define the terms of service availability, performance, and support provided by a cloud provider. While SLAs are important for ensuring reliability and performance, they are generally negotiable and can be adjusted to meet the company's requirements when migrating to another cloud provider. However, vendor lock-in may limit the flexibility to negotiate favorable SLAs with alternative providers.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1731509220.0","poster":"TheFivePips"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1697131320.0","poster":"betty_boop","content":"Selected Answer: D\nVendor lock in","comment_id":"868632"},{"timestamp":"1691153400.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AustinKelleyNet","comment_id":"798062","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree, should be D.
