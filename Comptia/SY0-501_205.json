Full disk encryption is not possible for BYOD. Ask yourself would you allow your organization to FDE your device? Knowing that it is personal and you have personal files stored in it? Also for a BYOD deployment, it is either you isolate the application or data via (Containerization) or create a separate segment, one for the corporate data which is yes encrypted and one for the personal space which belongs to the owner of the device. FDE will only be advisable if the deployment is company owned, COPE or CYOD.","poster":"xsp","timestamp":"1608555900.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"18","content":"I asked professor messer on his website if FDE can be applied to BYOD and he said this\nhttps://pasteboard.co/JGBGgB2.png\n\nThe question is asking for the best methods to ensure company is not stolen if the device is lost so I think we can put the feelings of the corporate slaves aside and implement both FDE and Remote Wipe.

During the offboarding phase, he was asked to reset his tablet to its factory settings to ensure that the data was deleted. John has refused to do this as he has personal data and music files on the tablet. The company has called the local Police and accused him of stealing their data. John informed the police officer that this is his personal device with his own data, and he\nproduced a copy of the sales receipt for the device. The police officer was powerless and could do nothing further. The company would have to take John to court and prove that the data was theirs. John is now traveling the world, leaving the company with a further headache—they cannot take John to court because they don't know which country he is in.
