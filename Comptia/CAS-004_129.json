Binding ports 137, 138, 139 (NetBIOS and SMB-related services), and 445 (SMB over TCP) to only the internal interface ensures that these services are only accessible internally, reducing the attack surface on the public-facing network interface.","poster":"user009","timestamp":"1679945520.0","upvote_count":"11"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe engineer should close any unnecessary ports, such as port 25 (SMTP) and port 110 (POP3), which are not used by the SFTP server.\n\nThe SFTP server uses port 22 for secure file transfers, so this port should be left open.
