It is possible to purchase Stratum 1 or Stratum 0 NTP appliances to use internally for less than the cost of a typical server. \nBy setting up an internal NTP service on the latest revision of stable code and standardizing its use, the viability of time-based network attacks or processes that are dependent on time are harder to co-opt. \nThe identification of the order of events in a compromise becomes easier because the times in the logs can now be systems of record. For law enforcement and other investigative agencies, accurate NTP services can be very constructive in evaluating evidence and sequencing a chain of events.\n\nhttps://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/04/best-practices-for-ntp-services.html"}]},{"id":"7kwcKX2bk83KUogudbWw","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Install digital certificates","B":"Establish digital signatures","C":"Agree on an encryption method","A":"Exchange encryption key"},"timestamp":"2019-10-09 11:33:00","question_id":528,"exam_id":366,"answer":"C","discussion":[{"comment_id":"45092","content":"What a trick question. comptia is nothing but a reading comprehension test.","upvote_count":"38","poster":"Caleb","timestamp":"1580439180.0"},{"comment_id":"17433","upvote_count":"25","timestamp":"1572030360.0","content":"C is the right answer.\n\nBefore exchanging the encryption key, you have to generate it, preferably using the best algorithm known by both parties... so first you have to agree on which algorithm to use.","poster":"ctux"},{"poster":"Steve107","content":"C, just like two parties made an agreemnt first.","timestamp":"1623505620.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"380492"},{"poster":"babati","content":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1596539220.0","comment_id":"150369"},{"poster":"MagicianRecon","content":"Ppl go hit the books again if you think the answer is A","comment_id":"118596","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1593016920.0"},{"timestamp":"1589474820.0","comments":[{"poster":"majid94","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"89060","timestamp":"1589474880.0","content":"I mean encryption method."}],"poster":"majid94","comment_id":"89058","content":"the first you have to agree on the type of encryption then do key exchange","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"64319","timestamp":"1584283140.0","poster":"The_Temp","content":"I thought it was A, but then I realised you need to agree the encryption method first with the recipient of the messages you're sending."},{"comments":[{"content":"Touche","comment_id":"288484","poster":"matt9875","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1613068440.0"}],"poster":"DCarma","content":"To the people saying \"A\", how long is the encryption key you are using? 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit?
