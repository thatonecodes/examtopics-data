When a compliance scan is performed\nagainst a single computing system, it produces a report that defines how well the\nsystem is hardened against the selected compliance framework. Compliance scans\nare not designed to locate vulnerabilities in software applications or operating\nsystems but are designed to locate and assess vulnerabilities in system hardening\nconfigurations. In this scenario, since you are seeing more assets on the network\nthan what was provided in the network architecture, you can attribute that to having\nlimited network access or storage access.\n\nBut since they didn't want to make it too obvious, I would go for D too as it's the only vulnerability scan type from the options.\n\nhttps://security.berkeley.edu/faq/nessus-network-vulnerability-scanning/how-do-i-run-credentialed-nessus-scan-windows-computer"}]},{"comment_id":"56794","timestamp":"1582971300.0","poster":"jon34thna","content":"SYBEX | PenTest+ Practice Test | Chapter 2 | Information Gathering and Vulnerability Identificationn | Question 147\nBook says \"Discovery scan\"\nI think the book is wrong a Discovery Scan identifies hosts. \nI think Credentialed Scan but also could be Full scan.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1576831020.0","comment_id":"31260","content":"D should be correct","poster":"amankry"}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":361,"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/7751-exam-pt0-001-topic-1-question-52-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2019-11-06 14:56:00","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Stealth scan","D":"Credentialed scan","A":"Discovery scan","C":"Full scan"},"answer_images":[]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"name":"PT0-001","numberOfQuestions":196,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Comptia","id":361,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":29},"__N_SSP":true}
