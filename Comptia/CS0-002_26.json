It provides insights into the incident and identifies areas of improvement to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. By reviewing the lessons-learned report, the security analyst can identify gaps in the company's controls that contributed to the fraud and suggest measures to strengthen them.\nAn incident response plan (Option B) outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents. While it is a crucial document, it is not the best option for helping the security analyst develop better controls to prevent financial fraud.","timestamp":"1682343300.0","comment_id":"879382"},{"timestamp":"1679879820.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer","poster":"Brian93","comment_id":"851607"},{"poster":"Frog_Man","timestamp":"1670076660.0","comment_id":"734494","upvote_count":"2","content":"D - would cover the present and future, whereas D describes the past.

One of the possible causes of this warning is if the root certificate was not installed in the trusted store. This means that the client doesn't trust the certificate and, as a result, it is not able to establish a secure connection with the sender's email server.

This allows the security administrator to create a series of tasks that will be automatically executed based on the results of previous processes.\n\nScripting, on the other hand, allows the security administrator to automate repetitive tasks or processes, such as data collection, analysis, and reporting.
