When using a SaaS solution, the company entrusts the service provider with its data and relies on the service provider to maintain and protect that data. If the company decides to switch to a different service provider in the future, it is important to ensure that it can obtain its data in a timely and secure manner. If the company is unable to obtain its data when migrating to another service, it could result in significant disruption to its business operations and could lead to financial losses.","poster":"Mr_BuCk3th34D","comment_id":"758682","upvote_count":"9"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\ni'm going with D, cause now you can't test out the environement and know the vulnerabilities + you won't have full control on the system","poster":"david124","comment_id":"682741","upvote_count":"5","comments":[{"upvote_count":"5","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"708875","timestamp":"1667281680.0","content":"I agree with you.

The inability to require the service provider process data in a specific country\n\nExplanation:\nWhen adopting a SaaS solution, one of the most significant risks involves data sovereignty and compliance. If the service provider is unable to process data in a specific country (or within a region that complies with local regulations like GDPR), it could expose the company to regulatory and legal risks.
