Briefly, it's highly recommended (if at all used) to manually disable VTP after convergence of the configuration throughout the targeted switches. \n\nAs a matter, I have heard and read that most network engineers (due the potential catastrophe that misconfigured switches can have on the network) prefer to opt for manual configuration and document accordingly. \n\nBut as said before it's a personal opinion, and let the various forums of discussion on the topic let you decide (an example listed below)...\n\nStay away from VTP?\nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/switching/stay-away-from-vtp/td-p/2462234"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1563526620.0","content":"As VTP (VLAN Trunking) is a Cisco propriety technology, as a network admin he/she would need to be 100% confident that ALL affected switches are from the Cisco brand.\n\n...also if VTP is part of the solution, then the question should have stipulated that all switches are Cisco. But it a moot topic of discussion as all possible answers have VTP mentioned as part of the solution. \n\nSafe bet to opt (like 802.1Q) for open source as this would mitigate any problems with future deployments (if documentation of network layout was not up to scratch - e.g. a new hire, unaware of the network layout / configuration installs a non-Cisco switch).\n\nErgo:\n\n'IEEE 802.1ak defines a protocol called Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol or MVRP in short.
