CFH \nC. eFuse: eFuses can be used to create a tamper-resistant counter that tracks whether unapproved firmware has been loaded. They can be programmed to change state permanently when certain conditions are met, making them useful for integrity checks.\nF. Secure boot: Secure boot ensures that only authorized firmware is loaded on the device at startup. It verifies the digital signatures of the firmware and helps prevent the loading of unapproved or malicious firmware.\nH. Secure enclave: A secure enclave provides a hardware-based trusted execution environment where sensitive operations, like storing biometric data, can be performed securely. It helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.","comment_id":"1292130","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727820060.0","poster":"Bright07"}],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1727820060,"timestamp":"2024-10-02 00:01:00","question_images":[],"answers_community":["CFH (100%)"],"answer":"CFH","question_text":"A mobile device hardware manufacturer receives the following requirements from a company that wants to produce and sell a new mobile platform:\n\n• The platform should store biometric data.\n• The platform should prevent unapproved firmware from being loaded.\n• A tamper-resistant, hardware-based counter should track if unapproved firmware was loaded.\n\nWhich of the following should the hardware manufacturer implement?

The server's support for older, less secure cipher suites, such as RC4 and 3DES, is a more immediate concern.\n\nThe most likely successful attack in this scenario is a forced downgrade attack. The attacker could exploit the server's support for weaker cipher suites to force the client to negotiate a less secure connection.

Downgrade attacks, including those that lead to NULL ciphers, allow attackers to force weak encryption or no encryption, which aligns with the weaknesses highlighted in this scan.

Developers receive real-time alerts about insecure code, allowing them to fix issues promptly. Automated scanning reduces the likelihood of insecure functions being overlooked due to human error. SAST/DAST tools often maintain logs and reports, providing an audit trail of security assessments.

Perform DAST/SAST scanning before handoff to another team. Implementing Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) can help identify insecure functions and coding practices early in the development process. This proactive approach allows teams to catch vulnerabilities before they are handed off or deployed, reducing the likelihood of security issues in the final product.
