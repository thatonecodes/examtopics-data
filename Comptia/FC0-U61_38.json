Open source doesn't necessarily mean available for free (although many distributions are); it means that developers are free to make changes to the way the operating system works, so long as they make the changes they have made available in turn. Some software vendors are reluctant to make their source code available to third parties fearing piracy, infringement of copyright, and loss of market position. This means that users of these systems must wait for the vendor to make the modifications they need, if they make them at all. The open source model claims to make improvements to software available more quickly and cost-effectively.\n\nUNIX, Linux, and Android are examples of open source operating systems.","poster":"Dion79","timestamp":"1651880520.0","comment_id":"473693","upvote_count":"5"},{"poster":"Davis.jade","timestamp":"1722616740.0","comment_id":"1138792","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOpen-source Software","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":186,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1636249320,"question_text":"Which of the following software license models allows a developer to modify the original code and release its own version of the application?","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","answer":"C","timestamp":"2021-11-07 02:42:00","choices":{"C":"Open source software","D":"Cross-platform software","A":"Proprietary software","B":"Commercial software"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","exam_id":352,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/65574-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-35-discussion/","answer_images":[]},{"id":"4J1bXRzvIUw3FYIctDGN","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. patent.\nA patent is granted to protect new inventions or designs, including a unique laptop design.
