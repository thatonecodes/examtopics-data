They can detect suspicious activities, such as the insertion of unauthorized USB devices, and respond to them in near real-time. This allows EDR solutions to potentially block or quarantine the USB device and prevent any malicious activity from occurring before it has a chance to trigger a DLP policy.\n\nDLP solutions, while effective at monitoring and controlling data transfers, may not always detect the presence of unauthorized USB devices immediately. They typically focus on monitoring data transfers and applying policies based on predefined rules. If a USB device is inserted and data transfer occurs before the DLP solution detects it, there may be a window of time during which sensitive data could be at risk.\n\n\nIn comparison to DLP, EDR can identify unauthorized USB devices earlier, enabling quicker responses or prevention measures.
