SEDs automatically encrypt all data stored on the drive without requiring any special software or user action, ensuring that data remains protected even if the drive is removed from the device. This feature is particularly beneficial for remote users who may not consistently follow manual encryption procedures, offering a seamless and user-transparent method to secure sensitive data.","timestamp":"1724636520.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1272368"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"3Q6xmAoq3iqNApRuT00N","timestamp":"2024-06-19 18:39:00","exam_id":339,"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Bad display cable","D":"Incorrect color settings","C":"Display burn-in","B":"Burned out bulbs"},"question_text":"A field technician is responding to a ticket about an animated sign with double images.

This issue can result in double images, where the \"burned-in\" stationary image persists alongside new, live content. This problem is more common in older displays or those used for static signage. Replacing the display cable or adjusting color settings would not address the underlying cause of uneven pixel wear, and burned-out bulbs would likely result in a loss of image clarity or brightness, not double images.\n\nReferences: Display burn-in is a well-documented phenomenon in display technology, particularly affecting screens used for signage with static elements.","comment_id":"1363757","poster":"JonHin","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740886440.0"},{"comment_id":"1316858","timestamp":"1732407780.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"C.

(A technician is upgrading a faulty motherboard that was ORDERED by an END USER for an old, high-end desktop computer.)\nIf the motherboard was ordered by an end-user, it's possible that the end-user ordered the incorrect one, it would indeed be prudent for the technician to consider verifying the socket type and manufacturer, as mentioned in option C.

If the pins on the CPU do not line up with the socket on the motherboard, it's a clear indication that the CPU is not compatible with that motherboard.\n\nTrying to set pins or installing an adapter (Options A and B) is not a recommended approach. CPUs are delicate components, and attempting to modify the pins or using an adapter that was not designed for this purpose can lead to damage to the CPU and motherboard.\n\nVerifying the socket type and manufacturer (Option C) is a reasonable step to take to confirm compatibility.

The issue of mismatched pins on the CPU and socket can occur if the wrong type of CPU is being used for the socket or if the socket itself is faulty. Verifying the socket type and manufacturer can help the technician determine if the issue is due to a compatibility issue between the CPU and socket, or if the socket is defective and needs to be replaced. Trying to set as many pins as possible (Option A) could result in permanent damage to the CPU or socket and is not a recommended solution. Installing an adapter to create a universal socket (Option B) is not a guaranteed solution and could result in performance issues or compatibility issues.
