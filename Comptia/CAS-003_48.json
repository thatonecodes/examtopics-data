The question says the systems are modern and have TPMs. Based on what Ive read on TPMs, (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview) they sort of already have a function of ensuring proper boot code. I feel like it may be a trick question. Which would provide the MOST preventative value, which would be D because the antivirus would catch more than just measured boot would.
