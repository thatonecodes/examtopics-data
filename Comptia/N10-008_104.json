Zero trust\n\nZero Trust is a security concept that assumes no implicit trust within a network and requires verification from everyone trying to access resources in the network, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter. In a Zero Trust model, users and devices need to mutually authenticate before accessing any network resource. This approach enhances security by continuously verifying the identity of users and devices, even after they have gained initial access to the network."}],"exam_id":357,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Zero trust","A":"Least privilege","D":"Need to know","B":"Local authentication"},"isMC":true,"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-12-06 15:26:00","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following describes a network in which users and devices need to mutually authenticate before any network resource can be accessed?","unix_timestamp":1701872760,"question_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"iNm3hlAv6p9as41OyQXS","isMC":true,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Cname should be the answer","comment_id":"966475","upvote_count":"11","timestamp":"1690641120.0","poster":"kingnito","comments":[{"timestamp":"1690833300.0","poster":"johnhi96","content":"Yeah, indeed.","comment_id":"968466","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"poster":"huradazimi","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
