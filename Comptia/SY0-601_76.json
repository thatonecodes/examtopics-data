They are designed to prevent or deter unauthorized physical access to equipment, facilities, or information.\n\nIn the context of a USB removable media restriction policy, a physical control could be a USB port blocker, which is a physical device that blocks access to USB ports on a computer or other device. This device physically prevents unauthorized USB devices from being plugged in, thereby restricting the use of removable media.\n\nSo, the BEST example of a cost-effective physical control to enforce a USB removable media restriction policy would be option A, putting security/antitamper tape over USB ports, logging the port numbers, and regularly inspecting the ports. While this option may not be as effective as USB port blockers, it is a cost-effective physical control that can help enforce the policy.","timestamp":"1681809600.0"}],"content":"GPT response\n\nOption B is better than Option A because it provides a more automated and centralized approach to enforcing the USB removable media restriction policy.\n\nOption B involves implementing a Group Policy Object (GPO) that restricts access to authorized USB removable media. This is a more centralized approach that allows administrators to apply the policy to multiple devices at once, rather than manually inspecting each device as in Option A. Additionally, a GPO is more reliable than manual inspection, as it is less prone to human error and can be more easily audited to ensure that the policy is being enforced.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, involves manually putting security/antitamper tape over USB ports and regularly inspecting the ports. This is a more decentralized approach that relies on manual effort and is more prone to human error. It can also be difficult to scale this approach to larger organizations with many devices, as the manual effort required to inspect each device can become prohibitive.\n\nTherefore, while both options can be effective in enforcing a USB removable media restriction policy, Option B is a more scalable, automated, and centralized approach that is easier to manage and audit.","poster":"hieptran","comment_id":"856561","timestamp":"1680231000.0"}],"content":"The answer is GPO not A.
