This is typically used to inform the user that the system is down for maintenance or that their account has been disabled.\n\nFor example, the contents of a .nologin file might look like this:\n\nThis account is currently unavailable. Please try again later.\n\nWhen the user tries to log in, they will see the message contained in the .nologin file, but will not be able to log in.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675983000.0","comment_id":"803746"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98617-exam-lx0-104-topic-7-question-14-discussion/","question_id":68,"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-02-09 23:50:00","topic":"7","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"choices":{"E":"Create a .nologin file in the user's home directory.","B":"Set the UID for the user to 0.","A":"Run the command chsh -s /bin/false with the user name.","C":"Remove the user from the group staff.","D":"Add the user to /etc/noaccess."},"unix_timestamp":1675983000},{"id":"CzaCAWHUzYF3zl3du2Ky","question_text":"FILL BLANK -\nWhich file specifies the user accounts that can NOT submit jobs via at or batch?

To set the system's timezone, you create a symbolic link from /etc/localtime to the appropriate file in this directory.\n\nFor example, to set the timezone to US/Pacific, you would run the following command:\n\nln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific /etc/localtime\n\nThis sets up a symbolic link from /etc/localtime to /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific, which is the file that defines the Pacific Time Zone.
