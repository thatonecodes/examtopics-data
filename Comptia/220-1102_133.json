This would result in the consistent warnings experienced by multiple colleagues across different websites.\nSo its A"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. The time or date was not in sync with the website.\n\nThis issue is likely related to SSL/TLS certificates used by websites. When a device's time and date are not synchronized correctly with the actual time, SSL/TLS certificates may appear as expired or not trusted, leading to security warnings. SSL/TLS certificates have validity periods, and if the device's clock is significantly off, it can cause these certificates to appear invalid, resulting in the warning message about the website not being trusted.\n\nRemote users who were not connected to corporate resources might not have experienced the issue because their devices' clocks were likely synchronized correctly with internet time servers.\n\nIt's a common security practice to ensure that devices have accurate time and date settings to prevent these types of issues with SSL/TLS certificates.","poster":"Fannan","comments":[{"poster":"ComPCertOn","content":"i thought we cannot just assume things with this exam ? i still think it is B","timestamp":"1708208640.0","comment_id":"983980","upvote_count":"2"}],"comment_id":"976440","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1707479880.0"},{"poster":"Crezzki","comments":[{"poster":"amityGanoofib","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726244760.0","content":"it just says the website couldn't be trusted not that it couldn't or wouldn't access it right? seems more of a certification issue.","comment_id":"1172811"}],"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1698382200.0","comment_id":"882235","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. A router was misconfigured and was blocking traffic.\n\nThe most likely cause of this issue is a misconfigured router that is blocking traffic to certain websites. This could be due to a number of factors, such as incorrect firewall settings or a problem with the router's configuration. The fact that several colleagues are experiencing the same issue across numerous websites suggests that the problem is not specific to any one website, but rather a broader network issue affecting multiple sites. Remote users who are not connected to corporate resources are not affected because they are not using the same network infrastructure as the affected staff members. A bad antivirus signature update or a problem with the time or date would not likely cause this type of issue, and an upstream internet service provider flapping would affect all users, not just those within a specific organization.\n\n-ChatGPT"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"876769","poster":"[Removed]","content":"When date or time arent in sync, can cause cert issues.

The time or date was not in sync with the website.\n\nWhen the time or date on a computer is not in sync with the website's server, it can cause SSL/TLS certificates to appear invalid, resulting in trust warnings. This issue can affect multiple users within a corporate network, while remote users who are not connected to the same network may not experience any problems.","poster":"lordcheekklappur"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"The most likely cause of this issue is D. The time or date was not in sync with the website.\n\nWhen a user receives a message that a website cannot be trusted, it means that the security certificate used by the website is not trusted by the user's web browser. Web browsers rely on security certificates to verify the authenticity of websites and to establish secure connections with them. If the security certificate is not trusted, the browser will display a warning message.\n\nOne common cause of this issue is when the time or date on the user's computer is not in sync with the time or date on the website's server. This can cause the security certificate to appear as if it has expired or is otherwise invalid, even if it is still valid.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the user should check that the time and date on their computer are correct and adjust them if necessary. They may also need to clear their browser's cache and cookies, or adjust their browser's security settings to recognize the website's security certificate as trusted. \nSource: ChatGPT","comment_id":"829570","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1693873980.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"ChatGPT says:\nA.
