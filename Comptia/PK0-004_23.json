A project manager should update a list of realized risks to document this information. A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect on the project's objectives. A realized risk is a risk that has occurred and is impacting the project. In this case, the unavailability of the datacenter and the absence of the team member assigned to complete the datacenter project are both realized risks that need to be documented.\n\nBy updating the list of realized risks, the project manager can keep track of the risks that have occurred and their impact on the project. This will help the project manager to manage the project's constraints and make informed decisions to minimize the risks' impact.
