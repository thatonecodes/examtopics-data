The client did not receive a trusted response.\n\nDNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is a type of attack in which an attacker alters the mapping of a domain name to an IP address, redirecting traffic from the intended domain to a malicious domain.\n\nIf no traffic was seen from the target machine after the attempted DNS poisoning attack, it is most likely that the client did not receive a trusted response. This means that the client's DNS resolver did not trust the response from the attacker and did not update its cache with the malicious mapping provided by the attacker.

In this way, the resolver can respond to future queries much more quickly, without needing to communicate with the many servers involved in the typical DNS resolution process. DNS resolvers save responses in their cache for as long as the designated time to live (TTL) associated with that IP address allows them to.\n\nInstead of using TCP, which requires both communicating parties to perform a 'handshake' to initiate communication, DNS requests and responses use UDP, or the User Datagram Protocol. With UDP, there is no guarantee that a connection is open or that the recipient is ready to receive. UDP is vulnerable to forging for this reason – an attacker can send a message via UDP and pretend it is a response from a legitimate server by forging the header data.\n\nIf a DNS resolver receives a forged response, it accepts and caches the data uncritically because there is no way to verify if the information is accurate and comes from a legitimate source.","timestamp":"1722144780.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1722145200.0","content":"Also, per CloudFlare:\n\nMuch like TLS/SSL, DNSSEC uses public key cryptography (a way of digitally signing information) to verify and authenticate data.

The client did not receive a trusted response is the most likely reason for the attack to fail. DNS poisoning attack aims to introduce false information into a DNS resolver's cache.

If the attacker has successfully poisoned the cache with false information, the client may be directed to a fake website, or its traffic could be redirected to a server controlled by the attacker.\n\nHowever, modern operating systems and browsers have implemented measures such as DNSSEC and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to protect against DNS poisoning attacks.

Network segmentation\n\nNetwork segmentation isolates different parts of the network. In this case, ideally, the customer information folder should be placed in a separate network segment with stricter access controls. This would make it much harder for an attacker who has breached one part of the network (like the penetration tester) to access the sensitive data in another segment.\n\nPCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) specifically requires that organizations implement network segmentation to isolate the cardholder data environment (CDE) from the rest of the network. This helps to ensure that even if an attacker gains access to a system on the network, they wouldn't have easy access to the sensitive credit card data.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1226182","timestamp":"1717769400.0","poster":"pepgua"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe term \"another part of the network\" here may very well mean separate VLANs. However, it's important to consider that network segmentation can be achieved through various methods beyond VLANs.
