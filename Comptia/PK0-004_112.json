While a retrospective could potentially be useful in this situation to identify potential issues or problems that may have contributed to the defects in the work product, it would not be the most effective way for the project manager to get to the root cause of the defects. In this situation, it would be more effective for the project manager to conduct a face-to-face meeting with the junior-level engineer to discuss the defects and gather more information about the root cause of the issues.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675094940.0","comment_id":"793018","poster":"BreathHaier","content":"Retrospective meeting, or retro, is a structured session that gives teams time to reflect on a completed project.
