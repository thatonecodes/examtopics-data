D is the answer.\n\nThis is best suitable for heavy IO usage & also provides 100 percent redundancy. Minimum number of drives required is 4. It is quite expensive, as you can clearly see that you are dedicating one disk per raid 1 array for redundancy. But is an excellent choice for both performance and redundancy.\nSummary of different RAID levels\nRAID 0 uses striping for high performance. Raid 0 cannot be considered as RAID as it does not provide fault tolerance.\nRAID 1 uses mirroring for redundancy.\nRAID 5 uses striping as well as parity for redundancy. It is well suited for heavy read and low write operations.\nRAID 6 uses striping and double parity for redundancy.\nRAID 10 is a combination of raid 1 and raid 0. It also provides heavy redundancy because of mirroring, and also provides performance as the data is striped across multiple raid 1 group\n\nhttps://www.slashroot.in/raid-levels-raid0-raid1-raid10-raid5-raid6-complete-tutorial"}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-12-02 19:55:00","question_id":1019,"exam_id":366,"answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"question_text":"A network administrator is trying to provide the most resilient hard drive configuration in a server.
