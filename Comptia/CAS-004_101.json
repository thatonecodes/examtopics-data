MTBF provides an estimate of a server's reliability by indicating how frequently a server is expected to fail. Servers with a lower MTBF are more likely to fail sooner than those with a higher MTBF. By analyzing the MTBF of each server, the management team can prioritize replacements for servers that are more likely to fail, ensuring proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1297132"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"The management team at a company with a large, aging server environment is conducting a server risk assessment in order to create a replacement strategy.
