Scapy\n\nScapy is a powerful Python library and interactive tool that enables the creation, manipulation, sending, and receiving of network packets. It is often used for network discovery, scanning, and vulnerability testing, and it can be very useful when testing how a proprietary service responds to specifically crafted or invalid packets. Options A, B, and D are valuable tools in the networking and security domains, but Scapy is particularly well-suited for this kind of packet manipulation and analysis."},{"content":"Scapyy is the right.

In this attack, the attacker sends a large amount of UDP traffic to a broadcast address with the source address spoofed to that of the victim. Since ICMP is disabled, the network devices will not respond to ICMP-based attacks, but they might still process and respond to UDP traffic, making Fraggle a viable option.","timestamp":"1720045680.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn a Fraggle attack, an attacker sends a large number of UDP packets to a network's broadcast address.

The attack exploits network devices that respond to these packets by sending even larger responses to the victim's IP address, thereby overwhelming the victim's network and causing a denial of service.","comment_id":"981371","poster":"bieecop","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1692082320.0"},{"comment_id":"973349","timestamp":"1691266680.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIf ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is disabled on a network segment, it would mean that ICMP-based attacks, like ping flood (option B) and ping of death (option D), would not be effective.
