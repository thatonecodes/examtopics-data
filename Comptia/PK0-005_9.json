Collaborating with them to develop a work breakdown structure (WBS) and project schedule would be a constructive use of their time and would help in aligning everyone involved with the project's objectives and timelines.

A tiered architecture can exist within any of those environment types. The question is asking about the architecture itself, not the environment it's deployed in.\n\nTiered architecture fundamentally describes how network components are organized and interact. It's a network concept. While a tiered architecture impacts security, releases, and staging, it is a network architecture. The question forces a choice, and \"network environment\" is the most directly related to the concept of tiers.\n\nThe best answer from the options provided (albeit still not ideal) is:\nB.

In software development, a stage environment refers to an environment where software changes are tested before being promoted to production.
