It is important to have control diversity, both administrative and technical, providing layered security to ensure the controls are effective in producing the desired results. One area frequently overlooked is the value of policies and procedures to guide workers’ actions. If these policies and procedures are aligned with reducing risk, they act as controls. If there are technical controls backing up those policies, then policy violations may still not create a complete vulnerability, as the technical control can stop a problem from occurring. Total reliance on technical controls without policy provides insufficient security because users who lack policy guidance may utilize a system in ways not foreseen by the implementers of the technical controls, resulting in another risk.","poster":"lapejor","timestamp":"1615361100.0"},{"content":"Keyword = Multiple\ntherefore Multiple somehow is related to Diverse right?\nSo Multiple = Diverse = Answer Control Diversity","timestamp":"1608341220.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"xsp","comment_id":"247687"}],"answer_description":""},{"id":"B39XBAV5NAEHDqAVKqQI","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/21534-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-652-discussion/","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Implement input validations.","A":"Implement stored procedures.","B":"Implement proper error handling.","D":"Implement a WAF."},"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1590685380,"discussion":[{"poster":"MagicianRecon","upvote_count":"11","comment_id":"119314","timestamp":"1593078240.0","content":"There would always be input validation FIRST, be it at the client side or server side or both.
