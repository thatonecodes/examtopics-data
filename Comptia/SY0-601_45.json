A reverse proxy sits between the clients and the back-end servers, handling client requests on behalf of the servers.

The reverse proxy can distribute client requests across multiple back-end servers, reducing the resource load on individual servers.

Reverse proxies are often used for load balancing, security, and improving performance.\n\n1. Increased scalability and flexibility: Reverse proxies can distribute client requests across multiple back-end servers, providing increased scalability. They also allow for easier modification and updating of the back-end infrastructure without disrupting services, as changes can be made to the back-end servers without affecting the clients directly.\n\n2. Reduced back-end server resources: By distributing client requests across multiple back-end servers, a reverse proxy can balance the load, reducing the burden on individual back-end servers and optimizing resource utilization.\n\n3. Session persistence not important: In some scenarios, session persistence is critical to maintain user state across requests. However, in this case, session persistence is explicitly stated as not important.

Enabling AES encryption on the web server is a good practice to ensure secure communication. It aligns with the requirement to enable strong ciphers.\nAES is used for encrypting data in transit over secure connections in web browsers. When you see a padlock symbol in your web browser's address bar (indicating a secure HTTPS connection), AES is likely being used to encrypt the data.","poster":"Yarzo","comment_id":"1051877","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1698067140.0"},{"upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"1046967","timestamp":"1697637240.0","content":"There is no TLS v2..latest is 1.3","poster":"MortG7"},{"comment_id":"1042751","timestamp":"1697208120.0","poster":"fercho2023","upvote_count":"1","content":"TLS (Transport Layer Security) which means data in transit where as AES encrypts data at rest."},{"poster":"sujon_london","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BF\nBGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is not directly related to the given requirements of preserving public IP addresses on the core router and enabling \"in transport\" encryption protection on the web server.\nBGP is an exterior gateway protocol used for routing between autonomous systems (AS) on the internet.

Configure NAT on the core router: By configuring Network Address Translation (NAT) on the core router, the analyst can preserve the use of public IP addresses assigned to equipment. NAT allows for the translation of private IP addresses to public IP addresses and vice versa, enabling devices with private IP addresses to communicate with devices on the internet using the public IP addresses assigned to the core router.\n\nF. Enable TLSv2 encryption on the web server: To enable \"in transport\" encryption protection to the web server with the strongest ciphers, the analyst should enable TLSv2 encryption. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over networks.
