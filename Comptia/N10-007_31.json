In other words, a honeypot is there to distract the attackers from valuable assets of the organization.\n\nHoneypot can be defined as a system that is attached to the network.

SIEM solutions provide a holistic view of what is happening on a network in real-time and help IT teams to be more proactive in the fight against security threats.\n\nWhat is unique about SIEM solutions is that they combine Security Event Management (SEM) - which carries out analysis of event and log data in real-time to provide event correlation, threat monitoring an incident response - with Security Information Management (SIM) which retrieves and analyzes log data and generates a report. For the organization that wants complete visibility and control over what is happening on their network in real-time, SIEM solutions are critical.","timestamp":"1605008760.0","comment_id":"216566","poster":"Putka"},{"poster":"Keennn","upvote_count":"3","content":"A is the answer, SIEM logs information while honey pots only trap attacks","timestamp":"1604097300.0","comment_id":"209620","comments":[{"poster":"fuzzyguzzy","comment_id":"256040","content":"A SIEM isn't a vulnerable system though.
