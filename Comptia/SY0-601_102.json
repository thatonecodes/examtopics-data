Most office buildings and datacenters do. Generators are not cheap. Multiday power outages can occur with sites that have generators.

Unlike traditional brute-force attacks that attempt to guess the password for a single user account by trying various combinations of characters, password spraying involves trying a small number of commonly used passwords against multiple accounts. The goal is to avoid detection by avoiding excessive failed login attempts for a single account, which could trigger account lockouts or other security measures.\n\nIn a password spraying attack, the attacker typically selects a few common passwords (such as \"password,\" \"123456,\" \"admin,\" etc.) and tries these passwords against many user accounts. This approach takes advantage of the fact that many users often choose weak and easily guessable passwords, and the attacker hopes that at least one of the accounts will have a weak password that matches the ones attempted.","comment_id":"965155","upvote_count":"6","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","timestamp":"1690500420.0"},{"timestamp":"1711210800.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTrying same password for multiple users","poster":"Gabuu","comment_id":"1181012","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Stormiecheryl","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCommon password on several username.
