Would you like to configure your system so that the Accounting group can only log on between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M.? There’s a security policy for that. How about forcing anyone who logs on to your system to use a password that’s at least eight characters long? There’s a security policy for that as well.

This is because a risk analysis helps identify potential risks or challenges that may arise during the project and allows the team to develop a plan to mitigate them. It is important to include a risk analysis in the SOW to ensure that the project team is aware of the risks involved and has a plan to address them.\n\nPlan to change, backout plan, and change board approvals may also be important components of the SOW, but they are not as critical as a risk analysis, which helps ensure the success of the project.
