Resource Tagging.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Resource Tagging: This is a method used to assign metadata to cloud resources in a public cloud environment. By applying tags (such as project name, department, cost center, etc.) to resources, the finance department can easily track and identify the costs associated with different projects and departments. This allows for detailed cost analysis and reporting, helping to manage and optimize cloud spending.","timestamp":"1724078460.0","poster":"SophyQueenCR82","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1268779"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1724078460,"answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":344,"answer":"C","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-08-19 16:41:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Resource tagging","B":"Service level agreement","A":"Reserved instances","D":"RFI from the CSP"},"question_text":"Which of the following can be used by a client's finance department to identify the cost of cloud use in a public cloud environment shared by different projects and departments?"},{"id":"tFw32jOv7KqdlPJybjwc","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"CD","question_id":58,"answer":"CD","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/19021-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-41-discussion/","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"the required network performance.","E":"the required amount of storage.","D":"the required cloud services.","C":"the desired CSP.","B":"the key stakeholders."},"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":344,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1682360460.0","poster":"Shaune","upvote_count":"6","content":"The question asks for the first step (singular) but there are multiple answers?","comment_id":"79228"},{"comment_id":"479211","timestamp":"1731739500.0","poster":"karnav","upvote_count":"2","content":"From the first statement, it seems they are migrating to the cloud which means that CSP is already selected.

I also assert that (D) is correct and (C) is actually incorrect – determining required services (D) in fact informs and therefore precedes the CSP selection (C). The CLO-002 concepts that address these factors are:\nFeasibility study – Determining required services is a core study deliverable; even if a CSP assists with the study, the CSP may not be able to provide all required services; \nGap analysis – the current vs. needed services is a core analysis deliverable; in order to know the “gap”, we must determine the required services; \nRFI/RFP/RFQ – these requests are solicitations and, for each, required services precede and inform CSP selection; informally RFI asks of potential CSP(s) “what services do you provide”, RFI asks “what services do you propose” and RFQ “quote prices for THESE services” (required services already identified).","comments":[{"comment_id":"384496","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1718669640.0","poster":"cinderus","content":"Agreed, it has to be D.

Vulnerability scan.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Vulnerability Scan: After migrating infrastructure to the cloud, performing a vulnerability scan is crucial to identify any security weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the new environment. This scan helps ensure that all components, such as applications, databases, and network configurations, are secure and comply with security policies. It’s a key step in post-migration security assessment to detect potential risks that could be exploited by attackers.","poster":"SophyQueenCR82","timestamp":"1724087580.0"},{"content":"Vulnerability scanning software checks applications and services for security\nissues.
