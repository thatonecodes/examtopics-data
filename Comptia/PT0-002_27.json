Since these emails can be highly tailored and convincing, they have a higher chance of tricking employees into clicking on malicious links or providing sensitive information quickly.\n\nAttempting to tailgate an employee: While this could provide physical access, it depends on the penetration tester's ability to physically be at the client's location, which may not be feasible within the given time.\n Dropping a malicious USB key: This method relies on an employee finding and using the USB key, which may not happen within the eight-hour window. It also depends on the employee bypassing potential security policies that prevent the use of unknown USB devices.\nBrute-force attacks against external perimeters can be time-consuming and may not succeed within eight hours due to rate limiting, account lockouts, and other security measures in place.","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI agree with option D, humans can be the weakest in most cases.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709912940.0","poster":"deeden","comment_id":"1168923"},{"poster":"Gazza242","content":"I go with D","timestamp":"1704366240.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1113605"},{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1083533","content":"Selected Answer: D\nC is eliminated since it's a technical approach and is met with greater resistance.

Performing spear phishing against employees by posing as senior management\n\nPerforming spear phishing (Option D) against employees by posing as senior management is likely to have the highest likelihood of success because it targets the weakest link in any security system: the human element. People are often the weakest link in security and can be easily fooled by a well-crafted spear phishing email. Attempting to tailgate an employee (Option A) or dropping a malicious USB key (Option B) in the parking lot may be successful, but they will likely be less effective than a spear phishing attack. A brute-force attack (Option C) against the external perimeter to gain a foothold may also be possible but it is less likely to be successful within eight hours, and also it's a noisy method that will be easily detected."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"toor777","timestamp":"1673176740.0","comment_id":"769323","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt doesn't indicate brute-forcing a user's account which performing such a task is unlikely with in a specific 8 hours. For B you have to hope that there is someone even notices the USB and bet on them plugging it in. You never know when a spear phishing attack would work. You rely on your target to open it. Even then, it's not guaranteed the information provided will get you where you need to be. If you're given one time within an 8 hour window, it would be C because it's related to physical security and you choose when to break in.
