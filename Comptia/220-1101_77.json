Change the resolution settings.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe \"Out of Range\" message typically indicates that the resolution being sent by the laptop is not supported by the projector.

The server is configured with a static IP address.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA static IP address (Option A) ensures a consistent and predictable address for the server.

If the server does not have a static IP address or if it is using dynamic IP assignment (via DHCP), the IP address could change unexpectedly, causing the user’s computer to be unable to reach the server using the hostname in the custom hosts file.
