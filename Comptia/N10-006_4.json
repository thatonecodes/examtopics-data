Different fire suppression systems work in different ways. Obviously a fire suppression system that sprays water onto the fire is no good for a server room as the water would do as much damage as the fire. A common fire suppression system used in server rooms is one that suppresses the fire by starving it of oxygen. One way the oxygen can be removed from the server room is to fill the server room with an inert gas such as carbon dioxide.","question_id":17,"exam_id":355,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1688712960,"answer_ET":"A","topic":"5","answer":"A","question_text":"An organization is moving to a new datacenter.

The network devices sense when the line is idle and therefore available for the transmission of data. The network device then transmits a data frame onto the network. If another device sends a frame at exactly the same time, a collision occurs and the frames are discarded. The network devices will then wait for a random period of time before attempting to send the frame again.","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sunniesideup","content":"A shld be the answer","comment_id":"945406","timestamp":"1688711520.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following will negotiate standoff timers to allow multiple devices to communicate on congested network segments?"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":109,"name":"N10-006","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"id":355},"currentPage":4},"__N_SSP":true}
