The driver could be the cause of the drop in network performance after the hardware upgrade. Drivers are software components that enable communication between the operating system and the hardware devices in a computer. If the new hardware is not compatible with the current driver, it could lead to performance issues, including slow network performance. Upgrading or updating the driver to a version that is compatible with the new hardware could resolve the issue.
