This command will attempt to combine multiple sets of query results into one data set, however, this technique is only effective when an attacker knows the exact number of columns in the query and the types of data that it contains.

The only info you will receive from B. (OR 1=1 --) is all the other productid variables. \"WHERE productid=22' OR 1=1 --\" will only display all the other products, something thats already available. Since we already know that time based blind SQL injection is possible, we should attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data by selecting columns and inferring through error messages which ones are valid and contain text based data.
