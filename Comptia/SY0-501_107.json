This usually means we need to identify some key aspect of what is happening in the questions scenario in order to get the best answer.\n\nFor the attack, a Trojan is valid, but since the owner of the hardware probably didn't download and accidentally install anything on the device, it probably wasn't a Trojan in this case. Though this isn't entirely unfeasible.\n\nCould there be a backdoor. Absolutely yes. I might plant one so that I can attack again from the same location. Also, if there is a backdoor, this might be a RAT, which is why the writer of this question needs to be slapped.\n\nI will stick with the provided answer (A), since a common type of attack these days is to launch multiple IoT (the linux device) bots against a single target in order to overwhelm it. \n\nFor an exam that allows under a minute per question, this one is idiotic and I'd sure like to question the writer as to his motives/reasoning.
