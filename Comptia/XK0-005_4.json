The CPU is overloaded. The load average of 9.90 indicates that there are, on average, 9.90 processes in the running or runnable state. Given that there is only a single CPU, this means that there are far more processes needing CPU time than the CPU can handle, leading to an overloaded CPU. This is likely the cause of the slowness. The other options (A, C, and D) do not seem to be supported by the provided output. The output does not indicate that the system is running out of swap space (almost all free), that the memory is exhausted (still have a lot of free mem), or that the processes are paging (only 5 for pages used).
