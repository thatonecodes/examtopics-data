To secure the devices from further exploitation, the best course of action is to remove them from the production network for analysis. This will help to prevent any potential harm to the network and reduce the risk of further compromise. The analysis will also provide important information for determining the source and extent of the breach, as well as any necessary steps to remediate it.
