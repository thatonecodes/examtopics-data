Although it's strange that this isn't affecting the entire company. Maybe the other users are all still getting their coffee and BSing at the watering hole while rocket man Dan is showing up 20 minutes every day and was calling you the fifth time as you rushed in to grab the phone to report his trouble ticket.\nIf it was JUST the mouse, or JUST the keyboard, or JUST the printer, or JUST the humping dog USB interface, then you would check for updates on that one device to see if they were released in sync with the OS update. Or... is there a lag between an OS update causing issues and the company releasing its own update, like if an OS update drops the framerate of an RTX 3090... Would Windows work with NVIDIA so the updates would be released simultaneously, or does NVIDIA gotta scramble to patch their stuff to keep working with Windows?\nThere's a LOT of stuff CBT Nuggets doesn't cover, and I bet it's mentioned in ONE sentence out of about 700 pages of the official CompTIA A+ study guide..."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"\"Check for updates\" may mean \"check if there have been any updates\" rather than check to see if there are any new updates which might fix it.","poster":"DoggyStyle","timestamp":"1634050380.0","comment_id":"461119"},{"poster":"SolidScores","comment_id":"384860","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"426823","timestamp":"1629287340.0","poster":"user54321","upvote_count":"6","content":"The clue is that the issue started in the morning.

Line conditioners, sometimes known as power conditioners, are more expensive than surge protectors, but they protect a computer from overvoltages, undervoltages, and adverse noise conditions over electrical lines. A line conditioner monitors AC electricity. If the voltage is too low, the line conditioner boosts voltage to the proper range. If the voltage level is too high, the line conditioner clamps down the voltage and sends the proper amount to the computer.\""}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-06-21 01:35:00","question_id":403,"answers_community":["D (50%)","C (50%)"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST cost-effective option to protect computers and peripherals from damage caused by power fluctuations?"},{"id":"uPbykM9nNeknMGBgwrEd","topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"the right answer is A, She called because she can only see 1 screen at a time.
