Port mirroring.\n\nExplanation:\nPort mirroring is a feature on network switches that allows network traffic from one or more ports to be copied (mirrored) to another port, where it can be monitored or analyzed by a network appliance (such as a network analyzer, IDS/IPS, or other monitoring device). In this scenario, the engineer needs to monitor network traffic for devices connected to a switch, which is exactly what port mirroring is designed for.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"HeatSquad77"}],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A network manager wants to view network traffic for devices connected to a switch.
