Given the context of the network traffic logs, where multiple connections are being accepted and rejected, and the potential for suspicious activity around the IP addresses involved, the FIRST step the security analyst should take is, Access 10.0.5.52 via EDR and identify processes that have network connections. This step allows the analyst to directly assess the behavior of the host (10.0.5.52) that is involved in both accepted and rejected connections. By identifying which processes are making network connections, the analyst can quickly determine if there are any malicious activities or unauthorized applications running on that host.
