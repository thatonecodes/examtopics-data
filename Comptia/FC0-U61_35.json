Scripting is disabled.\n\nWhen scripting is disabled in a web browser, it can prevent certain actions on a webpage from occurring, such as opening a document or navigating to a new page. Many modern web applications rely on scripting (e.g., JavaScript) to execute actions, like opening links, downloading files, or rendering content. If scripting is disabled, clicking on a link may result in no action being performed, as the browser won't execute the necessary code.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1365190","poster":"lexxone","timestamp":"1741137480.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nIts scripting is disabled. If a web page relies on scripts to open a document, and scripting is disabled in the user's browser, the page may fail to function as expected. \n\nIts not C because pop-up blockers prevent new windows from opening, but they would not prevent a document from being accessed directly via a link, unless the link is intended to open in a pop-up window. This is less likely in this case.","comment_id":"1357885","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1739812380.0","poster":"Torrente"},{"timestamp":"1724000820.0","poster":"xls1000","comment_id":"1153510","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Pop-up blockers are enabled.\n\nPop-up blockers are designed to prevent new browser windows or tabs from opening automatically, which includes attempts to open new windows or tabs triggered by clicking links. If a pop-up blocker is enabled, it may prevent the document from opening as expected when the link is clicked.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Pop-up blockers are enabled.\n\nWhen a user clicks a link to view a document and nothing happens, it's most likely that pop-up blockers are enabled. Pop-up blockers prevent new windows or tabs (which are commonly used to display documents or additional information) from opening. If a website tries to open a new window or tab to show a document and a pop-up blocker is active, it can prevent the action from completing, resulting in no visible response to the user's click.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1148783","poster":"_denw","timestamp":"1723500180.0"},{"timestamp":"1710480420.0","poster":"teejay82","content":"C.

User interface.\n\nA user interface (UI) is the best access method for a user who wants to view data ad hoc from a company database. A UI typically provides an intuitive, visual way for non-technical users to interact with databases, making it easy to search, view, and filter data without needing advanced technical knowledge. Most modern database systems come with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow users to query the database and generate reports or view data in an accessible way.","comment_id":"1365191","poster":"lexxone","timestamp":"1741137600.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nUser interface.

Branching.\n\nIn an expert system that uses a series of closed-ended questions to arrive at specific output, branching is the most likely characteristic used. Branching allows the program to make decisions based on user input or specific conditions. Each closed-ended question in the system typically leads to a branch, where the response (such as \"yes\" or \"no\") dictates the next step or leads to different outcomes.
