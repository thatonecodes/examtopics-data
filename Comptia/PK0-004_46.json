Since risks aren't mentioned, I think C would be a fair answer if it read closer to \"Evaluate the potential risk impact\".\n\nWhat I have a contention with is B, \"Obtaining approval from the CCB\", the PM submitted the change request meaning approval is pending, ie approval is being obtained. Unless of course they are talking about obtaining approval from CCB to perform the action of submitting a change request after a change was put into production rather than the approval of the change request form itself. My initial thoughts is that the answer is D, but these questions are so awful. The content is so easy that they need to make the questions incredibly vague and allow for multiple interpretations for the exam to be a challenge.
