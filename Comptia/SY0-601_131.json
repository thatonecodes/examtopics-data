Computers that use the sinkhole fail to access the real site.[2] The higher up the DNS resolution chain the sinkhole is, the more requests will fail, because of the greater number of lower nameservers that in turn serve a greater number of clients. Some of the larger botnets have been made unusable by top-level domain sinkholes that span the entire Internet.[3] DNS Sinkholes are effective at detecting and blocking bots and other malicious traffic. \n\nDNS sinkholing is used to provide wrong DNS resolution and alternate the path of the users to different resources instead of the malicious or non-accessible content. A sinkhole is a way of redirecting malicious internet traffic so that it can be captured and analyzed by security analysts. Sinkholes are most often used to seize control of botnets by interrupting the DNS names of the botnet that is used by the malware.\nhttps://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topics/general-security/dns-sinkhole/","comment_id":"1055115"},{"timestamp":"1697132100.0","poster":"Gwcan","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1041973","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC perfectly describes a DNS sinkhole."},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"12","content":"D is a honeypot, not a DNS sinkhole.","timestamp":"1697132160.0","comment_id":"1041975","poster":"Gwcan"}],"comment_id":"1025679","poster":"Hibiww","timestamp":"1696511400.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC for this one","comment_id":"1022645","poster":"jwoyer001","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1696191660.0"}],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"H0bgXQTL7TiQCXlZcki9","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/125521-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-689-discussion/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1700844060.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\n\"If hackers gain access to the list of password hashes, they can crack all passwords very quickly with a rainbow table.
