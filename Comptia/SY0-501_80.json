I have sifted through Gibson's book to see if anything specifically refers to this. This is what I found.

This physical isolation significantly reduces risks to the SCADA system. If an attacker can’t reach it from the Internet, it is much more difficult to attack it. However, if the system is connected to the internal network, it’s possible for an attacker to gain access to internal computers, and then access any resource on the internal network. \"\n\nSo I'm sort of wondering now if the default answer is correct since it mentions this directly, but I can see how the others make sense as well.
