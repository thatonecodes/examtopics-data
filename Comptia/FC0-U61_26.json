Integrity\nExplanation:\nAn on-path attack (formerly known as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack) occurs when an attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties. The best security concept to prevent such attacks is integrity, which ensures that data is not tampered with during transmission.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n\nA. Availability – Availability ensures that systems and data remain accessible but does not directly prevent on-path attacks.\nC. Performance – Performance relates to system speed and efficiency, not security.\nD. Confidentiality – Confidentiality protects against unauthorized access but does not necessarily prevent an attacker from intercepting and modifying data.\nSince integrity mechanisms (such as encryption, digital signatures, and certificate validation) help prevent on-path attacks, \"Integrity\" is the best answer.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1729872360.0","comment_id":"1053862","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIntegrity, in the context of security, involves ensuring that data is not tampered with during transmission or storage. By maintaining the integrity of data, you reduce the chance of an on-path attack where an attacker attempts to alter or manipulate data as it travels between two points. This concept helps protect the data's accuracy and reliability, which is crucial for security. Availability, performance, and confidentiality are also essential security concepts but are not directly related to reducing on-path attack risks.","poster":"UnitedAlmond","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"id":"Yfh3ziwOzdiL2MvznWPD","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1704387480.0","comment_id":"765919","upvote_count":"8","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Researching the knowledge base\nExplanation:\nWhen a technician looks up an error code in an online forum or vendor documentation, they are gathering information to understand the issue. This aligns with the troubleshooting methodology step \"Researching the knowledge base\", which involves checking manuals, forums, and other resources for known issues and solutions.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n\nA. Documenting the lessons learned – This step occurs after troubleshooting is completed, not during research.\nB. Verifying full system functionality – This step happens after a fix is applied, to confirm the issue is resolved.\nC.
