If an unauthorized user connects to the network port of an employee's phone, he will be within the employee network segment.

Segmentation\n\nExplanation:\nSegmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated sub-networks or segments. By segmenting the network, you can control which devices or users have access to specific parts of the network. In this case, segmentation would prevent an unauthorized user from accessing sensitive parts of the network (such as the database servers) even if they plug their laptop into a network port. The unauthorized laptop would be placed on a segment of the network that does not have access to critical resources, thereby preventing scans and unauthorized access.","timestamp":"1735506420.0","poster":"jbmac","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1333225","poster":"Becccca","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCertification (i.e., using 802.1X or certificate-based authentication) is the most effective way to ensure that simply plugging a laptop into a phone port will not grant unauthorized network access.
