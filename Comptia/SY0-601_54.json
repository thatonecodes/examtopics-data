Though I have spent quite a few minutes to justify my answer SLA with BAR, Perflexity AI and Chat GPT. Finally, I am convinced that NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) is chosen primarily for confidentiality over SLA (Service Level Agreement).\n\nAn SLA is a contract between two parties that defines the level of service that the vendor will provide. In this case, the vendor is the penetration testing company and the customer is the security team. \nAn NDA is a legal contract that protects confidential information.

It prevents the vendor from disclosing or sharing any confidential information with unauthorized parties or using it for purposes other than the agreed-upon scope of the penetration test.\n\nBy signing the NDA, the third-party vendor acknowledges their responsibility to protect the confidential information they may come across during the penetration testing process and demonstrates their commitment to maintaining the privacy and security of the proprietary application and its related data.","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122"},{"poster":"NeoSam999","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMemorandum of understanding (MOU)\nA memorandum of understanding (MOU) or memorandum of agreement (MOA) is an\nexpression of agreement or aligned intent, will, or purpose between two entities.
