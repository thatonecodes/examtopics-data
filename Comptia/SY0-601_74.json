Cloud providers offer mechanisms for customers to set and manage these policies. These policies define who can access the resources, what actions they can perform on those resources, and under what conditions.\n\nFor example, in Amazon Web Services (AWS), customers can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to their resources.
