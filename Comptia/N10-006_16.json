Let's look at all the answers, in order for lab computers within the LAN to communicate, LAN-LAN traffic is necessary, so don't pick A, don't block LAN-LAN! The Q doesn't mention WiFi, so D is not the best answer. They want to block in->out traffic, from the LAN to the internet, in this case the WAN must be assumed to be the internet for any question to work. Blocking in->out, or LAN to WAN, is the best answer, B. You can block out->in if done correctly, but outgoing traffic would still traverse your internet pipe. Why have extra traffic going OUT the internet if you are only going to block it coming back? The BEST answer is block it before it leaves, keeping unnecessary WAN traffic off your internet connection. Thus B is the BEST answer. Don't memorize Qs. KNOW THE WHYS and you'll do great on the exam!","timestamp":"1594475520.0","comment_id":"132128","comments":[{"poster":"PeoplesChamp","timestamp":"1645369200.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"551910","content":"I'm glad you clarified this because I was confused when B was labeled the wrong answer"}],"poster":"KLT316","upvote_count":"8"}],"exam_id":355}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":109,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"id":355,"name":"N10-006"},"currentPage":16},"__N_SSP":true}
