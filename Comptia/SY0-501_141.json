The problem with non-salted passwords is that they do not have a property that is unique to themselves – that is, if someone had a precomputed rainbow table of common password hashes, they could easily compare them to a database and see who had used which common password. A rainbow table is a pre-generated list of hash inputs to outputs, to quickly be able to look up an input (in this case, a password), from its hash. However, a rainbow table attack is only possible because the output of a hash function is always the same with the same input.\nSo how do we make each hashed password in a database unique? We add something called a salt to the input to the hash function. A salt is basically some random data that is unique to each user, that is saved with their password and used in the hashing process of both storing and verifying the password.","upvote_count":"11","comment_id":"15964","poster":"Ales"},{"comment_id":"2034","content":"it's Rainbow","poster":"Abner89","timestamp":"1558713840.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"content":"Salt makes the rainbow go away.","timestamp":"1619804640.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Freddie26","comment_id":"346353"},{"timestamp":"1590934380.0","content":"Rainbow: The Rainbow method uses password and precomputed hash.

Whether the laptop is provided by the company, or is BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), location based rules let you strike a balance between protection and leniency. For example, you may want to use a web filtering policy in the workplace to prevent inappropriate surfing, but allow employees to surf as they wish when they go home at the end of the day.

Individual accounts alone can not solve this problem. Actually they already have individual accounts and with these accounts they are unable to access resources remotely (as they are travelling). They need something more and that something IMO is a location-based policy.
