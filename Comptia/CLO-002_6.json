From the given options, the analyst should include the following three:\n\nB. Backups: Regular backups of critical data and systems are essential for disaster recovery. This ensures that in the event of data loss or system failure, the business can restore operations from a known good state.\n\nD. Replication: Replicating data and systems across multiple locations or servers helps ensure redundancy and availability. In the event of a disaster affecting one location, the replicated data or systems can be used to continue operations from another location.\n\nG. Geo-redundancy: Geo-redundancy involves replicating data and systems across geographically dispersed locations. This adds an extra layer of protection by ensuring that even if an entire region experiences a disaster, operations can continue from another unaffected location."}],"answers_community":["BDG (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"BDG"},{"id":"W1Ie9pOf2YVJga1uaDgn","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/144811-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-163-discussion/","answer":"D","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1722435960.0","comment_id":"1258927","poster":"BlueMan93","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect me if I'm wrong:\nA = 290GB x $5 = $1,450/mo\nB = $200 + ($10 x 50GB) = $700/mo\nC = 290GB x $10 = $2,900/mo\nD = $500/mo"}],"unix_timestamp":1722435960,"question_id":29,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-07-31 16:26:00","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/clo-002/image2.png"],"exam_id":344,"choices":{"C":"Enhanced VPN (200MB)","A":"VPN (100MB)","D":"Enhanced Direct Connect (1GB)","B":"Direct Connect (500MB)"},"answer_description":"","question_text":"A systems administrator needs to transfer 300GB of data to the cloud every month.
