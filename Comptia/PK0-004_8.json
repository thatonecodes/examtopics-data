It will be used as an input to numerous other planning processes. It's also the basis for estimating activity duration, assigning resources to activities, estimating work effort, and creating a budget.\"\n\nCash burn rate would be a good answer but burn rate is measuring the project expenditures to-date rather than projected project expenditures. As for Cash Flow, I couldn't find much information on Google regarding that as it relates to Project Management and the only related definitions, at least in title, are cash flow techniques and not cash flow schedules, which includes Discounted Cash Flow, Net Present Value, and Internal Rate of Return which are more economic models predicting revenue.","poster":"HelloMyNameIs","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1618410300.0","poster":"l0609890","comment_id":"335547","content":"I feel the answer should be a cash flow schedule because it shows the estimated and schedules cash disbursement of the project by time period. \n\nWBS doesn't show the projected project expenditures but rather the work that has to be done to successfully produce a deliverable.

Using the WBS will help prevent work from slipping or being forgotten.\nD. The WBS will aid in determining which resources are required for the project.\n\nExplanation: The WBS is an essential tool for breaking down a project into manageable work packages, which aids in preventing work from being overlooked or delayed. Additionally, by breaking down the project, the project manager can determine which resources are required for each package of work. These points are likely to resonate with the other managers, making the benefits of the WBS more apparent.","comment_id":"825404","timestamp":"1677630360.0"}],"question_text":"A project manager wants to introduce the practice of a WBS to the PMO, but the other managers believe this will create extra work.
