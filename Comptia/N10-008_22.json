It's designed to efficiently route IP packets based on the network topology, and it can dynamically adapt to changes in the network, such as link failures or additions. OSPF calculates the shortest path to a destination using a metric known as cost, which is based on various factors such as link bandwidth.\n\nRIPv2 (B) is an older distance-vector routing protocol that has limitations in large and complex networks due to its slower convergence and less efficient routing algorithms.\n\nQoS (C) stands for Quality of Service and is not a routing protocol. It's a set of techniques used to manage and prioritize network traffic to ensure that certain types of traffic receive preferential treatment.\n\nSTP (D) stands for Spanning Tree Protocol, which is used to prevent loops in Ethernet networks.
