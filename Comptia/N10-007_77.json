My reasoning is that in the question it states that the network administrator is presented with a log from the Switch, not the ARP table from the target or the victim computers in this situation. You can ARP poison the computer's table, but the switch learns the MAC address when a device is plugged into the switch. So the attacking device has Spoofed an existing MAC address and the switch is learning that MAC from that device. The switch's ARP table is not being poisoned, but being spoofed by the attacking device.","poster":"Big_H","timestamp":"1741812300.0"},{"content":"Respuesta B es correcta, ARP Poisoning","timestamp":"1671067560.0","comment_id":"745597","poster":"Gilber507","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nARP poisoning for sure - more than 1 MAC corrupted","poster":"Xynus","timestamp":"1647985680.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"573245"},{"upvote_count":"4","comments":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1643833500.0","poster":"marerad","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"539164","content":"Yes - I would also say that it is B - ARP poisoning.

Instead, with the Static PAT, the users can just type “www.site.com” (which implicitly assumes the standard web port of 80) and the router automatically translates the packet to port 8080 instead.\n\nThis could work in reverse as well.
