Hence you said hardware anti-tampering. \nFirstly, you can infer from the question that the data is not sitting on the device but in the cloud. hardware antitampering doesn't seem like the choice to make straight away.\nSecond, the cloud storage solution was for company devices which have sync client installed. The breach happened from a \"lost personal mobile device\".
