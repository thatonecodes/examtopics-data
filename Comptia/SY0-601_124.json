VPN with full tunneling and NAS authenticating through the Active Directory**. This is because a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with full tunneling establishes a secure, encrypted connection over a potentially unsecure network, like the internet. It's like a private tunnel in the internet that can securely transmit data between networks. This ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be understood due to the encryption.\n\nNAS (Network Attached Storage) authenticating through Active Directory means that the users are authenticated (their identities are confirmed) via a central directory before they can access the data. This ensures that only authorized users can access the data.\n\nThis option addresses the CSO's concerns regarding proprietary data exposure as it provides secure data transmission and restricts data access to authenticated users only.
