This type of scan can identify vulnerabilities that may not be visible during an unauthenticated scan.","comment_id":"1137111","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1722454500.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

A network vulnerability scan**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Agent-based scan (A)** typically involves installing an agent on the target system. In this case, since you're dealing with a DMZ web server in an IaaS compute instance, it may not be feasible to install an agent directly on the instance, especially if it's externally facing. Additionally, agent-based scans are more commonly used for endpoints and servers within your organization's network.","poster":"Pongsathorn","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1017486","comments":[{"poster":"Pongsathorn","comments":[{"comment_id":"1017488","timestamp":"1711443540.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"- **Network credentialed vulnerability scan (D)** typically implies using credentials to authenticate with the target system and perform a vulnerability scan. While this can provide more in-depth results, it may not be suitable for an externally facing web server in a DMZ due to security concerns. Moreover, the provided firewall settings might not allow the necessary ports and protocols for credential-based scans.\n\nIn summary, a network vulnerability scan is the most accurate and appropriate choice for assessing the security of the web server in the DMZ with the given firewall settings.","poster":"Pongsathorn"}],"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1017487","content":"- **Network vulnerability scan (B)** is the best choice for this scenario. Network vulnerability scanning tools, like Nessus or OpenVAS, can scan the target system over the network without requiring an agent. Given the provided firewall settings, the web server allows traffic on ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and ICMP echo requests. Network vulnerability scanners can assess the vulnerabilities of the web server based on these open ports and the services running behind them.\n\n- **Default and common credentialed scan (C)** usually involves using default or common credentials to check for vulnerabilities on the target system. This might not be suitable for an externally facing web server, as it could be a security risk to use credentials that are not specifically configured for this purpose.","timestamp":"1711443540.0"}],"timestamp":"1711443540.0"}],"answers_community":["D (67%)","B (33%)"],"question_id":371,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/121421-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-95-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04289/0006000001.png"],"answer":"D","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":349,"choices":{"C":"A default and common credentialed scan","D":"A network credentialed vulnerability scan","B":"A network vulnerability scan","A":"An agent-based scan"},"unix_timestamp":1695711540,"question_text":"A cloud security analyst is implementing a vulnerability scan of the web server in the DMZ, which is running in an IaaS compute instance.
