Autoscaling\n\nAutoscaling is the best option to accomplish the goal of adjusting system resources based on usage. Autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of compute resources (such as virtual machines or containers) based on predefined conditions or metrics, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, or incoming network traffic. When demand increases, autoscaling can dynamically add more resources to handle the load, and when demand decreases, it can remove unnecessary resources to optimize costs.","comment_id":"1169700","timestamp":"1725897420.0"}]},{"id":"tJtkwWbtbE3tPbwSqgLz","exam_id":349,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-12-02 14:47:00","question_text":"A company is switching from one cloud provider to another and needs to complete the migration as quickly as possible.
