SaaS provides customers with the benefits of cloud computing such as scalability, low cost, and quick implementation without the need for expensive hardware, software, and support infrastructure. SaaS providers also have security controls in place to protect sensitive data, such as encryption, data backup, and disaster recovery.

When the requirement is to have security controls in place to protect sensitive data, PaaS (Platform as a Service) would likely be a better fit than SaaS (Software as a Service), as PaaS provides a more flexible and customizable environment for organizations to deploy and manage their applications and security controls.
