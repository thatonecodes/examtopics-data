They have all the equipment necessary for the businessâ€”servers, workstations, network devices, office furniture, power, and Internet connectivity. A hot site is a fully capable location ready at a momentâ€™s notice. Because of this, hot sites are costlyâ€”they are essentially a mirror of the primary site, with all associated costs.

A cold site consists of elements to provide power and networking capability as well as cooling. It does not include other hardware elements such as servers and storage. The use of a cold site is very limiting to a business since before it can be used, backup data along with some additional hardware must be sent to the site and installed. This will impede workflow.\n\nWarm Computing Sites - contain all the elements of a cold site while adding to them additional elements including storage hardware such as tape or disk drives along with both servers and switches. Warm sites are \"ready to go\" in one sense, but they still need to have data transported to them for use in recovery should a disaster occur.\n\nHot Computing Sites - a fully functional backup site that already has important data mirrored to it.
