LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) can be used to increase bandwidth to a server without replacing hardware. LACP allows multiple network connections to be bundled together to increase throughput and provide redundancy. This is also known as link aggregation or NIC teaming. By using LACP, the IT technician can combine multiple gigabit ports on the server to create a single high-bandwidth connection without replacing any hardware. STP (Spanning Tree Protocol), 802.1Q (VLAN tagging), and duplex settings do not increase bandwidth but rather control network topology, network segmentation, and communication speed, respectively.","upvote_count":"14"}],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An IT technician needs to increase bandwidth to a server.

With this type of attack, the attacker seeks to gain access to systems\nor files by using the actual password required for that access. There are\nmany different forms of password attacks, including the following:\nBrute-force password attack: In this type of attack, the attacker tries\nall possible password combinations until a match is made. For\nexample, a brute-force attack might start with the letter a and go\nthrough the letter z, and then the attacker might attempt the letters aa\nthrough zz, continuing to try combinations until the password is\ndetermined. Using complicated passwords—with a mixture of upperand\nlowercase letters as well as special characters and numbers—can\nhelp prevent brute-force attacks.\nDictionary password attack: In this type of attack, the attacker tries\nmultiple password guesses. However, a dictionary attack is based on a\ndictionary of commonly used words rather than trying all possible\ncombinations, as in a brute-force attack. Picking a password that is not\na common word helps thwart dictionary attacks.","comment_id":"523385"},{"timestamp":"1731852720.0","poster":"fritts","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nDictionary attack and brute-force attack are very similar but in this case, dictionary is the answer because the outlying difference between the two is that brute-force is simply guessing passwords with no basis whereas a dictionary attack is attempting to guess a password from a predetermined set of possible passwords. Another example of a question that differentiates the two is one that asks of a person attempting to guess a password from a list of passwords that the hacker bought from a malicious source.
