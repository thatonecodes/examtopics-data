SIEM\n\nSecurity Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are designed to aggregate, analyze, and report on log data from various sources across the network, including security devices, network infrastructure, systems, and applications. SIEM solutions centralize the collection of log data, making analysis less difficult by providing tools and features to correlate events, detect anomalies, and generate alerts on potential security incidents or operational issues. This makes SIEM an effective choice for managing logs from different devices in a unified manner."},{"comment_id":"1160866","poster":"13thFloor","timestamp":"1724772120.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSIEM is responsible for aggregating logs.","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":357,"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-02-27 18:22:00"},{"id":"bRiaTRTEccCLJHcuZ4pX","choices":{"C":"Establish a theory.","A":"Identify the problem.","B":"Test the theory.","D":"Document findings."},"question_id":652,"question_text":"A network administrator is checking to see if anything has changed.
