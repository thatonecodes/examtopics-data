Permissions and F. Multifactor authentication.\n\nHere's why these options are best suited for ensuring authorization and accounting:\n\nA. Permissions: Permissions control access to resources on the server by specifying which users or groups are allowed to access specific files, applications, or systems. By configuring appropriate permissions, the company can ensure that only authorized users can access the server.\n\nF. Multifactor authentication: Multifactor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification (e.g., a password and a fingerprint or a one-time passcode). This ensures that only authorized users are able to gain access, improving the accuracy of authorization.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741140660.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nPermissions and Logs are correct.
