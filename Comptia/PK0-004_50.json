It displays the relative frequency or size of each issue in descending order of importance, allowing project managers to prioritize their actions.\n\nA Pareto chart is a tool that's primarily used for taking preventive action.\n\nPreventive action is focused on identifying and addressing the root causes of problems to prevent them from occurring in the first place. In contrast, corrective action is focused on addressing the symptoms of problems that have already occurred.\n\nIn this case, the Pareto chart is being used to identify the most significant factors contributing to the project's problems. By identifying the root causes of these issues, the project manager can take preventive action to address them and reduce the overall number of problems. This approach is more effective than simply taking corrective action to address the symptoms of the problems without addressing their underlying causes."},{"comment_id":"579878","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI'm no expert but I think D is probably the best answer her.
