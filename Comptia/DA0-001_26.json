Merge all date columns and unify the format.\nExplanation:\nMaintaining data consistency means ensuring all dates are represented in the same format and that they refer to the same thing. Since the analyst has three separate date columns, merging them and then unifying their format is the most direct and efficient way to achieve consistency. This approach allows the analyst to work with all dates as a single unit without the confusion of having multiple, potentially differently formatted, date columns."}],"timestamp":"2025-02-08 03:00:00","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"D":"Separate the columns into a table and merge.","A":"Append all date columns and parse the strings.","C":"Merge all date columns and unify the format.","B":"Impute all three date columns and then merge."},"question_text":"A data analyst received a large amount of third-party data that needs to be joined with in-house data files.

To improve data acquisition\nD. To provide continuity through personnel turnover\n\nA data dictionary is a critical component of data management, and its creation and maintenance are important for several reasons.\n\nA. To improve data acquisition: A data dictionary helps in improving data acquisition by providing clear definitions and descriptions of data elements, allowing for more accurate and consistent data collection. It also helps to eliminate duplicates and improve data quality by providing a clear understanding of what data is stored and where.\n\nD. To provide continuity through personnel turnover: As personnel change within an organization, the data dictionary provides continuity and helps to ensure that data remains consistently defined and described. This helps to minimize the impact of personnel changes on data quality and consistency, allowing for seamless transitions in data management.","poster":"ronniehaang","comments":[{"content":"Note: These are just two reasons why it is important to create and maintain a data dictionary.
