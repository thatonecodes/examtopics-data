The most logical answer is A. Furthermore, BranchCache allows computers at a local branch office to cache data from a file or web server on a WAN (wide area network).

This is because WANs connect buildings, locations in different cities, or locations in different countries. Microsoft has introduced a technology called BranchCache that helps users more quickly retrieve data from remote locations. BranchCache is available on Windows 7, 8, and 10 and some Windows Server versions. The beauty of BranchCache is that whenever a user accesses content from a remote server or cloud server, that information is stored locally. The next time the user needs to access that content, the information is\nretrieved faster and without using WAN resources. If another user needs that same information, that user retrieves it from the local storage and doesn’t use WAN resources either. Only authorized users can access the information, so even though it is stored locally, it is secure.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"546709","content":"No Doubt, BranchCache is the correct.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"skesii","timestamp":"1644785400.0"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"634689","timestamp":"1658417280.0","content":"Useless information","poster":"Aerials","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"I thought it was Proxy server","comment_id":"521024","upvote_count":"1","poster":"lance12","timestamp":"1641838500.0"}],"choices":{"D":"Proxy server","B":"Swap partition","A":"BranchCache","C":"Domain access"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/51345-exam-220-1002-topic-1-question-127-discussion/","answer":"A","isMC":true,"question_id":31},{"id":"ZPGgxBGPxwIpXWV70Lal","timestamp":"2020-10-01 13:13:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/33330-exam-220-1002-topic-1-question-128-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04149/0007500001.png"],"topic":"1","question_text":"Joe, a user, calls the help desk from a coffee shop while on a business trip to report the WiFi hotspot on his phone is extremely slow.
