Password complexity wouldn't fix the issue since its a dictionary attack. when you use complicated passwords people start to use the waterfall password, or other simple methods. Lockout policy would be good but the attacker could get lucky and still gain access within the lockout limit. MFA is the best solution compared to all the other options above.","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["B (59%)","D (24%)","A (18%)"],"choices":{"B":"Password complexity","C":"Web application firewall","A":"Multifactor authentication","D":"Lockout policy"},"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153252-exam-cs0-003-topic-1-question-386-discussion/","question_images":[]},{"id":"VRCeECSej0tvJGGF0dip","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"The vulnerable parameter and unfiltered or encoded characters passed > and \" as unsafe","A":"An output of characters > and \" as the parameters used in the attempt","B":"The vulnerable parameter ID http://172.31.15.2/1.php?id=2 and unfiltered characters returned","D":"The vulnerable parameter id=2 with a SQL injection attempt"},"discussion":[{"poster":"panzer","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1366544","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
