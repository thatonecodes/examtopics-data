By adding `NOPASSWD:` and including the restart command in the sudoers file, user1 can manage the service without requiring a password, ensuring the correct and necessary permissions are applied.\n\nThe answer is not D because user1 is already a member of the webadmin group, and the permissions for restarting the `httpd` service using `systemctl` are not included in the webadmin group configuration. The correct answer is B because user1 needs `NOPASSWD` permission specifically for `systemctl restart httpd`, which is currently missing. Adding this to the sudoers file ensures user1 can restart the service without requiring unnecessary broader permissions.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1359344","timestamp":"1740067800.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"\"B.
