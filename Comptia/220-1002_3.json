Turn off the computer, turn it back on\nSometimes the issue isn’t just the printer.\n\n3. Check the connections\nSometimes the most frustrating problems are caused by the smallest details. Checking that everything is connected will properly alieve a surprising amount of issues.\n\n4. Check the status\nIn some instances, the printer will tell you exactly what is wrong with it. Go to the Control Panel and select Devices and Printers. Click on the printer that is having problems. It will usually tell you what is wrong.\n\n5. Check the print queue\nMake sure someone else hasn’t clogged the queue with a bunch of print jobs. If you have permissions, clearing problematic print jobs can get the printer back up and running.\n\n6.

Disk wiping software ensures that old data is destroyed by writing to each location on the media, either using zeroes or in a random pattern. This leaves the disk in a \"clean\" state ready to be passed to the new owner. This overwriting method is suitable for all but the most confidential data (like top-secret documents about terrorism, national security etc.), but is time-consuming and requires special software. \n\nLOW LEVEL FORMAT\nMost disk vendors supply tools to reset a disk to its factory condition. These are often described as low level format tools and will have the same sort of effect as disk wiping software. A \"proper\" low level format creates cylinders and sectors on the disk. This can generally only be done at the factory.
