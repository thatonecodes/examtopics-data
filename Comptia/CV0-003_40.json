Cloud bursting\n\nCloud bursting is a scalability model in which an organization uses its private cloud resources for normal day-to-day computing but relies on public cloud resources (cloud services) during periods of increased demand or resource requirements. In this scenario, the private cloud hosts the business applications, and the public cloud services are used for replication and to provide additional resources when needed, making it an example of cloud bursting to handle scalability requirements.","poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1710399600.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"The cloud services are also being used to accommodate the additional resource requirements to provide continued services\" -> Cloud Bursting","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1701712140.0","comment_id":"914791","poster":"SecPlus2022"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with u/Daymeyon","timestamp":"1696693320.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"concepcionz","comment_id":"864046"}],"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Vertical scaling","B":"Autoscaling","D":"Horizontal scaling","C":"Cloud bursting"},"question_id":196,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/99303-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-282-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","question_text":"A company is using a hybrid cloud environment.
