AKA FTPS or FTPES which SSL/TLS \nSSL/TLS SUPPORTED CIPHER SUITES\nSSL/TLS supports most of the major symmetric and asymmetric ciphers.\nAsymmetric ciphers (key exchange and authentication)—RSA, DSA/DSS, and Diffie-Hellmann.\nSymmetric ciphers (confidentiality)—RC4, RC2, DES, 3DES, IDEA, AES.\nHashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) function—MD5 or SHA.\n\nAnother means of securing FTP is to use the connection security protocol SSL/TLS. As with SMTP, there are two means of doing this:\nExplicit TLS (FTPES)—use the AUTH TLS command to upgrade an unsecure connection established over port 21 to a secure one. This protects authentication credentials. The data connection for the actual file transfers can also be encrypted (using the PROT command).\nImplicit TLS (FTPS)—negotiate an SSL/TLS tunnel before the exchange of any FTP commands. This mode uses the secure port 990 for the control connection.\n\nFTPS is tricky to configure when there are firewalls between the client and server. Consequently, FTPES is usually the preferred method."},{"content":"I have seen this question somewhere else and it was A.","poster":"Aarongreene","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1618539780.0","comment_id":"336705"},{"timestamp":"1614803940.0","content":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html","poster":"sgb","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"302857"},{"content":"B is correct. \nSSH in SFTP Servers is an encrypted network protocol that uses public-key cryptography to create a more secure method to authenticate a client’s identity and rights to access a server..\nhttps://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/sftp-authentication.html","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1603754940.0","poster":"jasony","comment_id":"206693"},{"timestamp":"1601570700.0","poster":"DookyBoots","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://www.jscape.com/blog/what-is-an-sftp-key","comment_id":"191081"},{"poster":"Waffa","timestamp":"1599179580.0","content":"I agree with you Teza","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"172980"},{"timestamp":"1598699940.0","poster":"Teza","comments":[{"poster":"Teza","content":"*requires asymmetric key I mean*","comment_id":"169194","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1598700060.0"}],"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"169193","content":"SFTP uses SSH and port 22, FTPS uses SSL.
