It’s very common when collecting this evidence to get a copy of any storage drives. When taking this evidence, we’re not simply copying the files, we’re copying every single bit of information from that storage drive. You’ll sometimes hear this referred to as a bit-for-bit copy or a byte-for-byte copy.\n\nThat means you’re not only collecting all of the files, you’re also collecting anything else that might be on that storage device. We’ll sometimes perform this drive copy by physically removing the drive from the device. We will then connect it to a hardware write blocker that would prevent anything from changing the data that’s on that storage drive. We can then make a copy of that drive by using a hardware copying device or by using software imaging tools that can create the copy for us\nProfessor ¨GOD¨ Messer"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB because you can't tamper with evidence.
