You might be a director or a team lead or a manager, and the type of access you have to an object is going to depend on that role.\n\nWith role-based access control, the administrator determines what type of access a user has. But this is also an implicit type of right. For example, if the administer provides access to the managers, and the directors happened to be in the manager group, then the directors will also gain those rights. - https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-501/access-control-models/"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nRole based access controls are put in place specifically for scenarios like these","timestamp":"1707486720.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1145520","poster":"Benrosan"}],"answer":"A"},{"id":"nhGn6yApwLWHHD3gW82V","question_id":717,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":367,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/126134-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-744-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Deploying an appropriate in-line CASB solution","D":"Configuring double key encryption in SaaS platforms","C":"Conducting user training on software policies","A":"Upgrading to a next-generation firewall"},"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1209176","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: B\nalways CASB, for anything","poster":"spearous","timestamp":"1715309100.0"},{"timestamp":"1719664500.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"I see cloud; I choose CASB.
