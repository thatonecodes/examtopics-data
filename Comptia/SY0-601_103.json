It is the initial stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC) where developers write, test, and debug code. Implementing secure coding practices in the Development environment helps to ensure that security considerations are integrated from the early stages of application development.\n\nBy following secure coding practices during development, such as input validation, secure data handling, and proper use of encryption, developers can mitigate common vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited in later stages. This proactive approach reduces the likelihood of introducing security flaws and weaknesses that can lead to security breaches and incidents in subsequent environments like Testing, Staging, and Production.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Givemore","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDevelopment","timestamp":"1687699020.0","comment_id":"933622"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"876807","poster":"Yawannawanka","content":"The FIRST environment in which proper, secure coding should be practiced is in the development environment, option B.
