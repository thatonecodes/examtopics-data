A VPN creates an encrypted connection between the corporate network and the cloud environment, allowing the developers to access servers in all three tiers securely. This protects the sensitive data and network traffic from unauthorized access or eavesdropping. The VPN uses tunneling protocols, such as IPsec or SSL, to encrypt the traffic and authenticate the users. The analyst can configure the VPN to enforce access controls and restrict the developers to only the resources they need, providing an additional layer of security.

By defining roles and associated permissions, you can restrict access to sensitive assets, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\nLeast Privilege Principle: RBAC follows the principle of least privilege, meaning that users are granted the minimum level of access needed to perform their job functions. This minimizes the potential damage that can occur in the event of a security incident or if a user account is compromised.\n\nEase of Management: RBAC simplifies access management by grouping users based on their roles.
