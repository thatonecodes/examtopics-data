Both are forms of NAT, but consider the subnet masks: Company A: /26, /26 (64*2 = 128 IPs, 124 hosts), and /28 on the other (16 IPs, 14 hosts). The types of NAT are Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, and PAT: with with static (1 to 1) or dynamic (many to many pool) NAT, you're probably paying for multiple public IPs (expensive) per site. With PAT, you only need one public IP per site and map to the private addresses using ports instead of separate IPs.
