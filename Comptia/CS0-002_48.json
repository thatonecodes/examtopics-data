We all know how much chromium based apps love to devour memory. Plus there are numerous addons that can be running on this particular system so the 1.2gb or whatever that translates to isn’t completely alarming (to me). Now the fact that someone has opened and used paint at all, let alone for 6 hours is alarming enough for me to raise concerns haha. But really, that coupled with the 0.85gb or 2/3 the amount of memory that VS is using?
