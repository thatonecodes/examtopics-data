The RJ45 cables were replaced with unshielded cables\nE. The wrong transceiver type was used for the new termination\n\nExplanation:\nD. The RJ45 cables were replaced with unshielded cables: If the original network setup used shielded cables (e.g., STP - Shielded Twisted Pair) and the replacement cables are unshielded (e.g., UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair), it could lead to network interference, particularly in environments with high electromagnetic interference. This could cause network performance issues.\n\nE. The wrong transceiver type was used for the new termination: If the transceivers used for fiber or copper connections are incorrect or incompatible with the new cabling or network equipment, it could result in connectivity issues, leading to network instability or failure.","comment_id":"1337351","poster":"HeatSquad77","timestamp":"1736195040.0"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1736195040,"question_id":77,"answer_ET":"DE","timestamp":"2025-01-06 21:24:00","exam_id":358,"topic":"1","answer":"DE","question_text":"Following a fire in a data center, the cabling was replaced.
