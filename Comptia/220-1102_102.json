TLS\nTLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over a computer network. When a web server is configured to only allow secure connections, it means that it only accepts connections encrypted with TLS. This ensures that the data transmitted between the server and the client is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.\n\nTFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a simple file transfer protocol that lacks security features. It does not provide encryption or authentication, making it vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, a web server that requires secure connections would not use TFTP.\n\nTLS, on the other hand, provides strong encryption and authentication, ensuring the security of data transmitted over the network.\n\n\nGoogle Gemini","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1724025300.0","poster":"Philco","content":"D\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) encrypts data sent over the Internet to ensure that eavesdroppers and hackers are unable to see what you transmit which is particularly useful for private and sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal correspondence.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1268269"}],"unix_timestamp":1724025300,"timestamp":"2024-08-19 01:55:00","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"question_text":"A web server is configured to only allow secure connections.

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** \nWhile MFA enhances security by requiring multiple forms of authentication, it doesn't directly enable access to connected system features through account federation. MFA is typically used to protect individual accounts and resources.\n\n**B. NAC (Network Access Control):** \nNAC is a security solution that controls access to network resources based on device compliance and user identity. While it can be used to enforce security policies and restrict access, it doesn't provide the same level of seamless access as SSO.\n\n**D.
