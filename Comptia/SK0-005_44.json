When a server is left logged on with a privileged account, it creates a huge security issue. Most of the server operating systems you will encounter today incorporate the ability of an administrator or a root account holder to use a nonprivileged account as standard operating procedure and elevate their privileges as needed without logging off and logging back in as root.\n\nThe User Account Control feature in Windows and the use of the sudo command in Linux make this possible. Using either system an administrator can elevate their privileges for a specific task and that security context ends when they are finished with that task.\n\nIn Windows this can be done in the GUI by right-clicking the icon representing the task and selecting Run As Administrator\n\nUAC REQUIRES administrator-level access, provided answer is not correct."},{"timestamp":"1683517740.0","comment_id":"713510","poster":"Pongsathorn","content":"Selected Answer: D\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages can be used to scan a network for open ports. Open ports indicate services that may be running and listening on a device that may be susceptible to attack. An ICMP, or port scanning, attack basically pings every address and port number combination and keeps track of which ports are open on each device as the pings are answered by open ports with listening services and not answered by closed ports. One of the most widely used port scanners is Network Mapper (Nmap), a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"nixonbii","content":"Never seen UAC as a way to detect the status of any network application.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"694199","timestamp":"1681409820.0"},{"comment_id":"606672","poster":"Dion79","timestamp":"1669297320.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1676307540.0","poster":"TheITStudent","content":"@Dion... close, but not correct... you were on the right track. UAC or user account control is basically Mandatory Access Control. which REQUIRES administrator level access. That would be the correct answer IF \"analyst does not have administrative credentials\" was not in there. So the analyst needs to verify/check vulnerable applications without administrative access. welcome to the world of hackers... you run nmap or something of the sort. sniffing would work, but if traffic is encrypted, it might be more challenging. best answer is to do a port scan.
