Most of the questions are all on here. \n\nTo complete this PBQ on the exam you have to go into the Core Switch terminal. Type '?' and it will list what commands you can use. The 'show interfaces' command will list all the mac addresses and IP addresses. \n\nIt's confusing at first, but then it starts to make sense. You just have to read carefully and match up the right mac addresses to the corresponding VLANs and IP addresses. \n\nTBH, nothing worth memorizing here, because the VLANs for each device will depend on what you pick, and the order you put them in. One of the easier PBQ's IMO.","poster":"dadba8c","comment_id":"1268912","comments":[{"content":"Were most questions that you found on the exam towards the very end of this dump?
