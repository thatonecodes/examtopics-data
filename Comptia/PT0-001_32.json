Kerberoasting is used by attackers once they are established inside an enterprise network and have begun reconnaissance for lateral movement. The technique allows the attackers, as valid domain users, to request a Kerberos service ticket for any service, capture that ticket granting service (TGS) ticket from memory, and then attempt to crack the service credential hash offline using any number of password-cracking tools, such as Hashcat, John the Ripper, and others.\"\n\nhttps://www.qomplx.com/qomplx-knowledge-kerberoasting-attacks-explained/"},{"content":"cccccccccccc","poster":"kloug","comment_id":"812014","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676645760.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nlooks good to me","comment_id":"628233","timestamp":"1657176780.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"miabe"},{"timestamp":"1634306040.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"462641","content":"C laaaa.

The testing will want to exploit the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive is meant to be available only to the currently logged on user. So, when a different Windows user logs onto the system, a different copy of the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive is loaded. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive is saved locally as the file NTUSER.DAT or USER.DAT when a user logs off. This registry hive can be opened in Notepad, and the encrypted login ID and password can be easily located. If the user has a roaming profile, then the NTUSER .DAT file will be saved on every workstation the user logged onto.","comments":[{"content":"As byrne pointed out, question states that you have limited privs on this account.
