With 18 VPCs, you'd need numerous peering connections, which can quickly become unmanageable (especially as the number of VPCs grows)."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nI'm changing my response to C After a careful review of the scenario, I think the hub-and-spoke model using AWS Transit Gateway would be the best architecture to connect 18 VPCs in an AWS cloud environment.\nReasons for Choosing Hub-and-Spoke with AWS Transit Gateway:\n1. Scalability: Transit Gateway allows you to connect multiple VPCs efficiently without creating a complex web of peering connections. This scalability is essential as the number of VPCs grows.\n2. Centralized Management: It provides centralized routing and management, simplifying the administration of network connections and policies across all VPCs.\n3. Reduced Complexity: With VPC peering, each VPC needs a direct peering connection to every other VPC, leading to a large number of connections and increased complexity. Transit Gateway minimizes this by acting as a single point of connectivity.","poster":"braveheart22","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1301726","timestamp":"1729632720.0"},{"poster":"braveheart22","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSince this configuration is in the AWS environment, I m going with VPC hands down.","timestamp":"1729631040.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1301721"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"C.

From AWS:\n\"If more than two network address spaces (VPCs, on-premises networks) are connected via VPC peering, AWS Direct Connect, or VPN, then use a hub-and-spoke model like that provided by AWS Transit Gateway.\n\nFor only two such networks, you can simply connect them to each other, but as the number of networks grows, the complexity of such meshed connections becomes untenable.

In this architecture, you have a central hub VPC that serves as a centralized point for connecting to other VPCs (the spokes). Each product's VPC can be a spoke connected to the central hub VPC.\n\nThis approach offers several advantages:\n\n1. **Centralized Control**: The hub VPC can provide centralized control over network traffic, security policies, and routing.\n\n2. **Reduced Complexity**: It simplifies network management by avoiding direct connections between every pair of VPCs, which can become complex as the number of VPCs grows.\n\n3. **Security**: You can implement security measures, such as Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways and firewall rules, at the hub to control traffic between VPCs.","upvote_count":"4"}],"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"xXsY1cIMdglqv1zxUdhF","topic":"1","question_text":"An organization has a web-server farm.
