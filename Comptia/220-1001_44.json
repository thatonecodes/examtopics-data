Increased memory requirements for the new OS is resulting in applications not having access to enough memory. \n\nThe windows machine is having to rely on the page file constantly. The page file uses disk storage and this is resulting in the constant activity of the disk and of course slow down because hard drive speed is much slower than RAM. While the question does not mention Ram. CompTIA wants you to recognize concepts like memory requirements for software and OS, the speed of a hard drive vs the speed of Ram among other concepts.","poster":"JE39","timestamp":"1622667900.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1637008860.0","content":"Agree with you with pearson cram exam and professor messer cram exam they talk about these.","comment_id":"478989","poster":"ronah"}],"comment_id":"373060"},{"comment_id":"835413","upvote_count":"1","content":"Best thing to do (key word) FIRST.

Sounds like a hard drive problem so I suppose backing up the data before you do any changes make sense. \n\nI don't believe the answer is B because 2GB of ram meet the minimum requirement for 64-bit windows 10. That should still let you get some real work done. \n\nAlso, the first solution should most definitely not be flashing your bios. Bios update isn't going to improve performance, it is typically there to do bug fixes with obscure pieces of hardware or add support for a new model of CPU. Not to mention flashing a bio is a dangerous procedure so you better know what you are doing. \n\nEven if we suppose updating the bios made sense, then you still have to update your data because there are cases where the bios don't work with your hard drive and it can blow your data away.","comments":[{"content":"I think A is right guys Check this out\n\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/a-system-bios-update-is-required-before-upgrading/c181fb9b-a7a0-42ac-9df2-0893c3832e3f","comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"Which of the following should a technician do FIRST?\n\nYes.
