A seems to be too easy of an answer, but it's A. Part of the reason it tripped me up is anytime I learned about vender diversity, it was always in the context of anti-malware, SIEM, NIDS, etc. Never dawned on me that vendor diversity also applies to physical hardware, but it makes sense. Vender diversity is a part of the swiss cheese model, or defense-in-depth. Having your production server, and your backup server running identical configurations means that there's two perfectly aligned holes in the swiss cheese model. Meaning the integrity of the backup server cannot be trusted in the event of an attack that damages or shuts down the production server.
