In this case, a log entry indicating the deletion of a file by a user during a previous session is an example of persistent data because the log record is saved and accessible even after the session ends.\n\nHere's why the other options are less relevant:\n\nA. analysis: Data analysis refers to the process of examining data to draw conclusions. While the log entry could be analyzed, the log itself represents persistent data.\n\nB. exportation: Exporting data involves transferring data from one system to another. The log entry is not being exported; it's being stored for future reference.\n\nC. querying: Querying involves searching or retrieving data based on specific criteria. The log entry is data, but querying is not whatâ€™s being described here."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1739816880.0","comment_id":"1357910","poster":"Torrente","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA log entry that records the deletion of a file by a user during a previous session is an example of persistent data because it is stored in a log file and remains available even after the session ends."}],"question_id":197,"unix_timestamp":1739816880},{"id":"o2cMvYuy3rfy3Da0cOxU","topic":"1","exam_id":352,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140701-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-389-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1715774160,"choices":{"D":"Tables","B":"Constraints","C":"Schema","A":"Primary keys","E":"Delimiters"},"isMC":true,"question_id":198,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-05-15 13:56:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following is an element of a NoSQL database?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIts C.
