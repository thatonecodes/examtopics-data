Duplicate the problem in a lab: This step is typically taken earlier in the troubleshooting process when you're trying to recreate the issue in a controlled environment to better understand its causes. After confirming the root cause theory, you don't need to duplicate the problem again; you're already at the point where you know what the issue is.\n\nC. Present the theory for approval: While presenting the theory for approval might be important in some organizational settings (particularly for formal change management), it's not typically the next step after confirming the root cause. At this stage, you would already have the necessary buy-in to proceed with resolution steps.\n\nD. Implement the solution to the problem: Implementing the solution is a crucial step, but it comes after determining the specific resolution steps. First, you need to decide on the best course of action, including testing and validating the solution, and then implement it in a controlled way."}],"timestamp":"1731273420.0"},{"poster":"ojones888","timestamp":"1730311620.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAfter successfully testing a root cause theory and confirming it explains the issue, the next step is to implement the solution.
