Code repositories\n\nCommonly, unintentional corporate credential leakage in cloud environments can occur through code repositories. Developers and teams often store code, configuration files, and other sensitive information in repositories like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. If these repositories are not properly secured or if sensitive data is inadvertently included in code commits, it can lead to credential exposure. Attackers might search public repositories for such information, potentially gaining unauthorized access to corporate resources.\n\nThe other options (B. Dark web, C. Threat feeds, D. State actors, E.

A cold aisle: Cold aisles are typically positioned in front of equipment racks, with the racks facing into the aisle. This design ensures that cold air from the air conditioning units is drawn directly into the front of the equipment, ensuring efficient cooling.\n\nD. A hot aisle: Hot aisles are positioned behind equipment racks. Equipment is oriented so that exhaust fans blow hot air from the equipment directly into these aisles.
