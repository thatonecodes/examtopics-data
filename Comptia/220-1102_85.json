Multifactor authentication\n\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) is the best option among the provided choices for strengthening security controls against brute-force attacks. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication before gaining access to a system or application. Even if an attacker manages to guess or brute-force a password, they would still need the additional authentication factor (such as a code sent to a mobile device) to gain access, significantly reducing the effectiveness of brute-force attacks. chat gpt 4","comment_id":"1191851","timestamp":"1712614980.0"},{"timestamp":"1711737600.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"It most def does, but does it work better than password complexity? that is the question","comment_id":"1345480","poster":"JasonMunoz","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737646200.0"},{"timestamp":"1712771940.0","content":"Except that it definitely does","upvote_count":"3","poster":"yutface","comment_id":"1193195"}],"poster":"66bc3a0","comment_id":"1185620","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMFA does not protect against brute force attacks, increased password complexity does."}],"exam_id":340,"unix_timestamp":1711737600,"answer":"A","question_text":"A technician needs to strengthen security controls against brute-force attacks.
