Disabling anonymous access would require users to authenticate before accessing the share, which would prevent unauthorized access and file transfers from external sources.\n\nData loss prevention (A) and intrusion detection (B) are both important security measures, but they may not necessarily prevent unauthorized access to a network share. User Account Control (C) is a feature in Windows that helps prevent unauthorized changes to a computer, but it is not directly related to preventing unauthorized access to a network share.

It uses block-level striping with distributed parity to achieve redundancy while improving performance by spreading data over multiple disks.\n\nIn this case, using four 200GB drives in a RAID 5 configuration with block-level striping and distributed parity, the total available capacity would be approximately 600GB (400GB usable), which is the sum of the capacity of three drives minus the capacity of one drive (i.e., 3 x 200GB = 600GB - 200GB = 400GB).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.

RAID 0 was configured by mistake.\n\nRAID 5 uses one of the drives for parity information, so the usable capacity of the four 200GB drives in a RAID 5 array should be around 600GB, not 400GB. The fact that the server reports using all four drives but with only 400GB of capacity suggests that the four drives were combined using a RAID 0 configuration instead of RAID 5. In a RAID 0 configuration, the capacity of the drives is combined without any redundancy or parity information, resulting in faster performance but no fault tolerance.
