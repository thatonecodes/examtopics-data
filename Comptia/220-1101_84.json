The drawing stylus only works with a special digitizer.\nFor a stylus to work on a touchscreen device, the device must have a specific type of digitizer that is compatible with the stylus. There are two main types of digitizers: resistive and capacitive. Resistive digitizers require pressure to register input, while capacitive digitizers respond to electrical conductivity.\n\nMost modern smartphones use capacitive touchscreens, which are not compatible with traditional resistive styluses. To use a stylus on a capacitive touchscreen, you need a special stylus designed for capacitive touchscreens.\n\nGG","poster":"Nate_A","comment_id":"1316141","timestamp":"1732247280.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt says in the question that the style didn't come with the phone which would indicate that it might not work with it.","poster":"Phillyboy20_","timestamp":"1710446100.0","comment_id":"1173672","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"o4WUxB7iulAGZzzrCs6j","isMC":true,"answer":"AB","answer_description":"","question_id":417,"unix_timestamp":1708373160,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1740776520.0","content":"I think B and C are correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1363246","poster":"JonHin"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1316144","content":"The first two steps the technician should complete are:\n\nB.
