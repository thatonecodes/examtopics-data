But in case of passing CompTIA it only helps a bit. CompTIA by his own logic has just one answer and they want them from us. :)\n\nMy Answer suggestion is A - POST beep codes.\nReason: If you check out different CompTIA approved Books they refer for POST Beep codes everytime to RAM Troubleshooting. Different HW Manufactors (Dell as example) only have one POST Beep code available -> RAM. All other Error Codes are LED based.\n\nCapacitors and wrong BIOS time for sure wrong.\n\nContinuous Reboots, could be possible, but normally RAM error at post will halt the system and during OS-Boot or running OS it will result in a BSOD or other Error.

You need more information honestly. Different BIOS actually use different POST code beep combinations, so you'll need to know the BIOS (Or manufacturer) as a RAM error code is sometimes used. On OSX, RAM issues can be signified by POST issues as well. Continuous Reboots can be from a variety of issues (Including a power supply slowly failing). If it occurs after using the computer for a bit, it is not a RAM installation error (Although BSOD can sometimes have a memory error/leak cause a reboot). RAM being installed poorly usually means a computer will just fail to boot (Thus simulating continuously rebooting). Pay attention to little tells though. Do the fans spin up? Do lights turn on? It may look like RAM or the PSU only to be something really unexpected like the CPU overheating from poor thermal paste application and a failed fan only seconds into turning it on."},{"timestamp":"1705016220.0","content":"C. if there is a faulty RAM it fails to boot the OS, therefore continuous reboots.","comment_id":"1120291","poster":"vshaagar","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Tomeq","timestamp":"1682618820.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAccording to CompTIA Cert master Learn Continous BEEP is most likely a problem with memory modules or memory controller listed in the POST code beep IBM PC table.
