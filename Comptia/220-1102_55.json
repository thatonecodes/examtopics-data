Allocate more space by removing factory applications.\n\nFactory applications, also known as bloatware, often come pre-installed on devices and can consume a significant amount of storage space. Removing unnecessary factory applications that the user does not use can free up space on the device, allowing for updates and the installation of new applications. This solution addresses the issue by optimizing the use of available storage without the need for hardware upgrades or device replacements."},{"poster":"shkejo","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1706928240.0","comments":[{"poster":"shkejo","content":"I’m wrong, It’s D.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1143676","timestamp":"1707331440.0"}],"comment_id":"1138974","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHave you ever seen anybody saving “Time and Date application” on USB?
