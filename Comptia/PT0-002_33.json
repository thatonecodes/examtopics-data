This helps to prevent unauthorized access to the client's information and protects the client's confidentiality.\n\nReporting any findings to regulatory oversight groups may be necessary in some cases, but it should be done only with the client's permission and in accordance with any relevant legal requirements. Publishing the findings before the client has reviewed the report is also not recommended, as it may breach the client's confidentiality and damage their reputation. Encrypting and storing client information for future analysis is also not recommended unless it is necessary and in compliance with any legal or ethical requirements.","timestamp":"1710675360.0"},{"comment_id":"840852","poster":"KingIT_ENG","timestamp":"1710586980.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"D is correct answer"},{"comment_id":"836020","content":"A or D ?","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1710162840.0"},{"timestamp":"1709388900.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","content":"D is the answer read","comment_id":"826976"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"823875","content":"Answer the other new questions also and share your idea","timestamp":"1709047140.0"},{"comments":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"825025","timestamp":"1709137440.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"I Believe A can allow the use of D if that is within the retention policy.","comments":[{"comment_id":"829024","timestamp":"1709561220.0","content":"D is the answer search again","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"Dybala"}],"timestamp":"1709047080.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"823874","content":"I think D is the correct answer","poster":"[Removed]"}],"comment_id":"818158","poster":"kloug","timestamp":"1708624860.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"aaaaaaaaaa"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1677088860,"question_id":165,"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","exam_id":362,"timestamp":"2023-02-22 19:01:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_text":"An assessment has been completed, and all reports and evidence have been turned over to the client.
