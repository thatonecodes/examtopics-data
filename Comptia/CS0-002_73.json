Running an antivirus against the binaries to check for malware is a more direct step to determine if the abnormal behaviors are a result of malicious activity. If the binaries are found to contain malware, then steps can be taken to mitigate the threat and prevent further harm, such as only allowing whitelisted binaries to execute."},{"timestamp":"1667336280.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\n\"...After extracting the strings, the analyst finds unexpected content...\" something different or something that should not be there...you validate the hash to confirm why data was altered/changed/edited and is not what is expected","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"709434","poster":"MortG7"},{"comment_id":"707352","timestamp":"1667064000.0","poster":"david124","upvote_count":"1","content":"A it is"},{"poster":"nonjabusiness","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA wouldn't hurt to do, but C seems like the more thorough answer","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"671795","timestamp":"1663446540.0"},{"comment_id":"670804","timestamp":"1663331100.0","poster":"bigerblue2002","upvote_count":"1","content":"Hey amateurguy, I literally said the exact same thing.
