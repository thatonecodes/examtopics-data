MD5\n\nRainbow tables are precomputed tables that are used to quickly crack the password hash. They are particularly effective against unsalted password hashes that are created using weak hashing algorithms such as MD5, which can be cracked quickly.\n\nIf the user credentials were captured from a database during an assessment and cracked using rainbow tables, it is likely that the passwords were stored in the database using the MD5 hashing algorithm.\n\nIn contrast, bcrypt, SHA-1, and PBKDF2 are considered stronger algorithms that are more resistant to rainbow table attacks, as they use a technique called salting to add randomness to the password hash and make it more difficult to crack.","comment_id":"847296","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1679503680.0","poster":"lifehacker0777"}],"exam_id":363,"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"TvXlbkgpA0oPpV8zjzUf","exam_id":363,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1689216660.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"bieecop","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe social engineering attack that the tester utilized in this scenario is c.
