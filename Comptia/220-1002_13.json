Connecting to the WIFI network automatically only benefits the user if assuming that employee spends a significant amount of time on their phone and not actually doing work. B and E more often depend on the employees usage and habits more than any other factor. But the giveaway is in the office.

B is incorrect because that would only help specific users that seldomly use their phone. If an employee is active enough to not trigger screen dimming, then changing that setting will be pointless. A&E works for all scenarios. The phone constantly searching for 4/5g takes up a lot of battery. Try using your cellphone without going on the wifi in a hospital.
