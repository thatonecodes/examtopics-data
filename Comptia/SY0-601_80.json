Access control vestibules can be used to prevent multiple people from using a unique card swipe and being admitted to a secure entrance. An access control vestibule is a physical security measure that creates a buffer space between the exterior and interior of a building. It is typically a small room or hallway that has two doors: one leading to the outside and one leading to the inside of the building. To enter the building, a person must first swipe their access card to unlock the first door, and then wait for it to close before swiping the card again to unlock the second door.\n\nBy requiring individuals to swipe their access card twice, access control vestibules prevent multiple people from entering the building using a single access card swipe. This helps to ensure that only authorized individuals are granted access to the secure entrance. Additionally, access control vestibules can be equipped with other security controls, such as cameras and intercoms, to enhance security and surveillance.","timestamp":"1684351860.0"},{"timestamp":"1683034800.0","poster":"mouettespaghetti","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"887424","content":"-C is correct\nAccess control vestibules, also known as mantraps, are designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to secure areas. They work by providing an intermediate space between two secure doors, where individuals must first be authenticated before being granted access through the second door. This prevents multiple people from using a single card swipe to enter a secure area, as only one individual can enter the vestibule at a time and must be authenticated before proceeding through the second door."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/108250-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-456-discussion/","topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Faraday cages","D":"Motion detection sensors","A":"Visitor logs","C":"Access control vestibules"}},{"id":"hwnlihKYMvWQZpGJVzwP","answer":"A","question_images":[],"exam_id":367,"choices":{"B":"DLP","D":"MFA","A":"NAC","C":"IDS"},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-05-02 15:42:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/108251-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-457-discussion/","question_text":"Unauthorized devices have been detected on the internal network.

It verifies that the device attempting to connect to the network complies with security policies and meets certain security standards. If the device does not meet the requirements, access is denied or limited.\n\nBy implementing NAC, the organization can ensure that only authorized devices are allowed to connect to the network through the Ethernet ports in conference rooms. NAC can authenticate devices and users, check their security posture, and apply network access policies based on the results of the authentication and security checks. This can help prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches caused by rogue devices.","comment_id":"900469","upvote_count":"6"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"cyberPunk28","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
