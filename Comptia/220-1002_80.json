This helps protect accounts even if passwords are compromised.\n\nEnforce account lockouts after five bad password attempts (Option F):\nImplementing account lockouts after a certain number of unsuccessful password attempts can help mitigate the risk of brute force attacks by temporarily blocking access to the account after repeated failed login attempts.\n\nThese measures enhance the security posture of the bank by strengthening access controls and reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access through brute force attacks. The other options may have some benefits, but enabling multifactor authentication and enforcing account lockouts are particularly effective in addressing the specific risks outlined in the scenario.","poster":"mohdAj","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AF\nAgree with AF","poster":"Ren758","timestamp":"1663802280.0","comment_id":"675576","upvote_count":"3"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/75499-exam-220-1002-topic-1-question-514-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer":"AF","unix_timestamp":1652308200,"choices":{"A":"Enable multifactor authentication for each support account.","B":"Limit remote access to destinations inside the corporate network.","C":"Block all support accounts from logging in from foreign countries.","F":"Enforce account lockouts after five bad password attempts.","D":"Configure a replacement remote-access tool for support cases.","E":"Purchase a password manager for remote tool users."},"question_images":[],"question_id":399,"timestamp":"2022-05-12 00:30:00","topic":"1","answer_ET":"AF","exam_id":338,"isMC":true,"question_text":"The Chief Executive Officer at a bank recently saw a news report about a high-profile cybercrime where a remote access tool that the bank uses for support was also used in this crime.
