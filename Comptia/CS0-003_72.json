Delete the user profile and restore data from backup.By deleting the user profile, you remove any potential lingering malware or malicious configurations associated with that profile. Then, restoring the data from a backup ensures that the device is returned to a known, clean state, reducing the risk of further infection or compromise.

If the system was compromised because it contained a security vulnerability, and not because of the use of a compromised user account, it is likely that backups and images of that system will have that same vulnerability. \n\nAfter this explanation, it seems that option D is not the best option as the malware could have infected system files and by deleting and restoring the user's profile, the malware would still be there.\n\nOption A talks about firmware and reimages the hardware Wouldn't it be the software?
