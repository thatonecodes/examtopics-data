Blue-team exercise: A blue team exercise is a simulated attack designed to test and evaluate the effectiveness of an organization's security operations center (SOC) and incident response procedures. During a blue team exercise, the SOC team will attempt to detect and respond to a simulated attack in real-time, allowing the organization to evaluate its ability to detect and respond to threats effectively.\n\nE. Tabletop exercise: A tabletop exercise is a simulation of a real-world scenario that is designed to test an organization's incident response plan.

Blue-team exercise and E. Tabletop exercise would most likely be used to evaluate the new implementations for monitoring and incident response at the same time.\n\nA blue-team exercise involves testing the effectiveness of the organization's security measures and monitoring capabilities by simulating an attack scenario. This exercise can help to identify weaknesses in the security measures and monitoring capabilities, and provide an opportunity to improve the incident response procedures. A tabletop exercise, on the other hand, is a more focused exercise that involves simulating a specific incident and walking through the steps of the incident response procedures. This exercise can help to identify any gaps in the incident response procedures and provide an opportunity to make improvements.","poster":"encxorblood","timestamp":"1676799960.0","comment_id":"813920","upvote_count":"4","comments":[{"timestamp":"1679103480.0","content":"Agree..
