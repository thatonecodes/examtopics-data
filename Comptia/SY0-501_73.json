AND NEVER LISTEN TO MELVINJOHN....I know him personally and he told me that he comes on here time to time and puts wrong answers..\nYour passwords usually aren’t kept in the plain-text form. When you’re logging into your account, the password runs through a one-way hashing algorithm. This way, it turns into an unrecognizable, completely different string of characters. That string is then compared to the other hashes in the database, and if they match, you get to access the account.\n\nWhile it may seem like a safe way to store passwords, there is a problem. If two passwords are the same, their hash is identical, which makes it easier to crack. This is where password salting comes in. A password salt is a random bit of data added to the password before it’s run through the hashing algorithm.\n\nImagine your password is ‘yellow.’ If another user has the same password, the hash output will be the same. But if you add a few random characters to both, you get two different passwords —‘yellow#1Gn%’ and ‘yellow9j?L’ — with completely different hashes. But how does it make them harder to crack?"},{"content":"A.\nIn password protection, salt is a random string of data used to modify a password hash. Salt can be added to the hash to prevent a collision by uniquely identifying a user's password, even if another user in the system has selected the same password. Salt can also be added to make it more difficult for an attacker to break into a system by using password hash-matching strategies because adding salt to a password hash prevents an attacker from testing known dictionary words across the entire system.\n\nhttps://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/salt#:~:text=In%20password%20protection%2C%20salt%20is%20a%20random%20string,in%20the%20system%20has%20selected%20the%20same%20password.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"267405","timestamp":"1610656980.0","poster":"Lumeya"}],"timestamp":"1579906020.0"},{"content":"I like B. \n\"Hash functions can be made more secure by adding salt. Salt is a random value added to the plaintext. This helps to slow down rainbow table attacks against a hashed password database, as the table cannot be created in advance and must be recreated for each combination of password and salt value. Rainbow tables are also impractical when trying to discover long passwords (over about 14 characters). UNIX® and Linux® password storage mechanisms use salt, but Windows does not. Consequently, in a Windows environment it is even more important to enforce password policies, such as selecting a strong password and changing it periodically\".","poster":"Dion79","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"374525","timestamp":"1622828160.0"},{"timestamp":"1609903920.0","content":"IT B\nIf two user using same password, their hash will be the same.
