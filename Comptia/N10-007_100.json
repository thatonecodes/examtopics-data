Which of the following protocols should the technician use to increase speed and fault tolerance?\nA. SIP\nB. BGP\nC. LACP\nD. LLDP\n\nLACP is the most correct answer. Link Aggregation Control Protocol can combine multiple physical ports together to make a single local channel. It allows for both redundancy and load balancing.\nSIP is incorrect; Session Initiation Protocol is for establishing multimedia connections and would have no impact on speed or fault tolerance.\nBGP is incorrect; Border Gateway Protocol is meant for linking routers and would be inappropriate to resolve the needs outlined here.\nLLDP is incorrect; Link Layer Discovery Protocol is used in local Ethernet networks for advertising device identity, capability, and neighbours, defined in 802.1AB. This would help organize network paths but do not increase speed or fault tolerance.","upvote_count":"54"}],"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"question_text":"A network technician is connecting two switches together.
