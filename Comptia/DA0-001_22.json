Correlation coefficient.\n\nMulticollinearity refers to the situation where two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. One common approach to identifying multicollinearity is to calculate the correlation coefficient between pairs of independent variables. A high correlation coefficient (close to 1 or -1) indicates strong linear relationship between the variables, suggesting potential multicollinearity issues.\n\nOption B, the chi-squared test, is used for testing independence between categorical variables, not for identifying multicollinearity between continuous variables.\n\nOption C, the two-sample t-test, compares the means of two groups and is not directly related to identifying multicollinearity.\n\nOption D, the two-way ANOVA, is used to analyze the effect of two categorical independent variables on a continuous dependent variable, and it does not directly address multicollinearity between independent variables.\n\nSo, option A, correlation coefficient, is the most appropriate method for identifying multicollinear attributes in a data set.","comment_id":"1197537","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","timestamp":"1729202220.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-04-17 23:57:00","topic":"1","question_id":106,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following would be the BEST way to identify multicollinear attributes in a data set?","answer":"A","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1713391020,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"1f0XX2ZPHaaRkW1c57C8","unix_timestamp":1738978560,"exam_id":351,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156128-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-199-discussion/","question_id":107,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-02-08 02:36:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1738978560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

A dashboard allows for a clear and concise presentation of information with the ability to filter and view data in different ways.

In order to determine the most popular movie genre, the data analyst must first delimit the Genre column. Delimiting means separating or breaking up the data in a column into separate values or categories. In this case, the Genre column contains multiple movie genres for each movie, which are separated by commas. In order to determine the most popular movie genre, the data analyst must first split the Genre column into separate rows or categories for each movie genre. This will allow the data analyst to count the number of movies in each genre and determine the most popular genre.

Explanation: Discrete data refers to data that can only take on specific, countable values, usually whole numbers, meaning you can't have values in between (like fractions or decimals). This aligns with the concept of counting the frequency of each value, where you can only count whole occurrences of a specific value.\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. Non-numeric data used to describe attributes of a population sample: This describes qualitative data, not discrete data.\nC. Numeric values that can be measured on a continuous scale: This describes continuous data, where values can fall anywhere within a range, not discrete data.\nD. Non-numeric data used to describe attributes of a population sample ranked in a specific order: This describes ordinal data, a type of qualitative data with a ranking system, not discrete data.\nExample of discrete data: The number of cars in a parking lot (you can only have a whole number of cars, not a fraction of a car).","comment_id":"1353178"}],"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","topic":"1"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":219,"isImplemented":true,"id":351,"name":"DA0-001","isBeta":false,"provider":"Comptia","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":22},"__N_SSP":true}
