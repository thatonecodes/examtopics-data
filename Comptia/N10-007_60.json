This is more indicative of a DHCP issue rather than an Evil Twin attack. An Evil Twin attack would typically result in the user being connected to a malicious network, not just having an incorrect IP address. Therefore, the most likely cause of the issue in this case is DHCP exhaustion, not an Evil Twin (A). In an evil twin attack, an attacker sets up a rogue wireless access point with a name and settings that mimic a legitimate corporate network. Users may inadvertently connect to this rogue access point, thinking it's the legitimate network, and the attacker can then intercept or manipulate their traffic. However, this attack doesn't directly involve the allocation of IP addresses.","comment_id":"1045254","timestamp":"1697489160.0"},{"timestamp":"1644424560.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe keywords here that indicate that it's A are \"Wireless Network\" and \"Client has an IP assignment\" but that assignment is in another range.","comment_id":"543921","poster":"mariodesa","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Callas","timestamp":"1635964620.0","content":"I could see this as being either A or C\nAn evil twin is a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications.\nSo A could be right if the laptop connected to a different Wifi.\n\nC could also be right, because the IP address could be APIPA, making it so they can't connect","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"472203"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1631642580.0","comment_id":"444736","poster":"jojomax","content":"A.Evil Twin Attack (ETA) refers to a rogue Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) that appears to be a legitimate one but actually has been set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications [1]. Most of existing detection techniques assume that the attacker will use the same legitimate wireless network gateway to pass through victim’s wireless data. These detection methods will fail if the attacker uses a different gateway, such as using his own broadband cellular connection through his own smartphone. In this paper, we present a new client-side detection method to detect such an ETA that uses a different gateway from the legitimate one. It relies on SSL/TCP connection to an arbitrary remote web server to avoid attacker’s misleading message, and trying to detect the changing of gateway’s public IP address by switching from one AP to another in the middle of the SSL/TCP connection. The detection method is on the client side which makes it more convenient for users to deploy and ensure their security.
