CNAME\n\nA Canonical Name (CNAME) record in DNS maps an alias (or canonical name) to a true name (or canonical name). This allows a domain name to be an alias for another domain name. When a DNS lookup is performed on the alias, the CNAME record redirects the query to the true name specified in the record. This is commonly used for creating aliases for hosts or domains. Therefore, option D, CNAME, is the correct answer.","comment_id":"1174746","poster":"subaie503","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1726457400.0"}],"question_id":681,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/136212-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-711-discussion/","answer":"D","topic":"1"},{"id":"rCnT9UR1bQA3mPbOf54c","unix_timestamp":1710366660,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"F":"Cat 5e","B":"SFP","E":"Cat 6a","C":"QSFP+","D":"Multimode","A":"SFP+"},"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-03-13 22:51:00","question_id":682,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"CD","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135973-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-712-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1726257060.0","upvote_count":"14","poster":"Jkeller","comment_id":"1172927","content":"This question was on the exam"},{"comment_id":"1174748","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC. QSFP+\nD. Multimode\n\nQSFP+ (Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable Plus) transceivers are designed for high-density, high-speed networking applications such as 40 Gigabit Ethernet. They can support data rates of 40 Gbps, making them suitable for achieving 40GB of network throughput.\n\nMultimode fiber optic cable is often used with QSFP+ transceivers for short-range data transmission, such as within data centers or between buildings in close proximity.

Assign a new IP address range to the local company.\n\nGiven that both companies are currently using overlapping IP address ranges, the most straightforward and effective solution to quickly connect the two companies without causing IP address conflicts would be to reassign a new, non-overlapping IP address range to the local company.

This allows both networks to communicate without requiring an immediate IP address reconfiguration for the local company. NAT translates the local company’s IP addresses to a unique range that the global company’s network can recognize, enabling connectivity despite the overlapping address space.","poster":"ComeHonnorFace","timestamp":"1731304260.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1309845"}],"exam_id":357,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (73%)","D (27%)"],"question_text":"A global company has acquired a local company.
