STP is not configured.\n\nThe redundant links between two switches without STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) can cause a network loop. When a network loop occurs, the switches will forward traffic endlessly in a loop, which can cause a network outage or poor network performance. Therefore, if there are redundant links between two switches and STP is not configured, it can cause the network to be non-functional.\n\nARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache corruption (option A) can cause connectivity issues, but it is not related to redundant links or STP.\n\nCSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) protocols (option B) are used in Ethernet networks to detect and recover from collisions, and are not directly related to redundant links or STP.\n\nIncompatible switch models (option D) can cause issues with connectivity, but it is unlikely to be the cause of non-functional network after the replacement of switches, especially if the replacement switches are of the same make and model as the original switches.","timestamp":"1710974940.0","comment_id":"845320","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"Redundant links\" makes me think of Spanning Tree not configured.
