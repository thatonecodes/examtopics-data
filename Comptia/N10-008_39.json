Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given amount of time. When a network link is saturated, it means that the bandwidth is fully consumed, and any additional traffic will be dropped or delayed, resulting in slower network performance.\n\nWhile other performance metrics such as latency, jitter, and speed can also be affected by link saturation, bandwidth is typically the most immediate and noticeable impact. Latency refers to the time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another, jitter refers to the variation in latency over time, and speed refers to the rate at which data can be transmitted over a network connection.

Electrical monitoring may be useful for detecting power surges or other electrical issues, but it is not directly related to the issues mentioned in the report.","comment_id":"846809"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI would think given lack of ventilation it would be humidity","timestamp":"1712574120.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1713535020.0","content":"Lack of ventilation will increase the temperature because there is nowhere for the heat to go","poster":"Dano000","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"699080"},{"content":"You also need to consider how dry the air might be.
