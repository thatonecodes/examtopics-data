It utilizes FCP, the Fiber Channel Protocol, to do what needs to be\ndone, and Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) can be used in high-speed (10\nGB and higher) implementations.\nThe big advantage of Fibre Channel is its scalability. FCoE encapsulates FC over\nthe Ethernet portions of connectivity, making it easy to add into an existing\nnetwork. As such, FCoE is an extension to FC intended to extend the scalability\nand efficiency associated with Fibre Channel.","timestamp":"1634925600.0","poster":"MyName7"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/64535-exam-n10-007-topic-1-question-288-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1"},{"id":"v94K6HtjtefiGTemt6XT","unix_timestamp":1606755540,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/38122-exam-n10-007-topic-1-question-289-discussion/","choices":{"D":"192.168.0.192/24","E":"192.170.10.0/24","A":"10.10.50.0/30","B":"172.16.20.0/30","C":"192.1.0.124/30"},"isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2020-11-30 17:59:00","discussion":[{"content":"Key is in the question \"narrow scope\" and \"class C\".
