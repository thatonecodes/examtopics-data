The change control board (CCB) is a group of individuals responsible for reviewing and approving changes to the project, including changes to scope, schedule, budget, and quality. The CCB typically includes representatives from various stakeholders, including the project manager, functional managers, and subject matter experts (SMEs). In this case, the functional manager within the project is requesting to edit the display features of an application that is being developed, which would likely be considered a change to the project. As such, the CCB would have the authority to review and approve the edit requested by the functional manager. While the project manager (PM) and the project management office (PMO) may also be involved in the process, they would typically not have the final say on whether the change is approved or not. Instead, it would be up to the CCB to make the final decision on whether to approve the edit.","poster":"kmanb","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"769903","timestamp":"1673220540.0"},{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1656676380.0","comment_id":"625738","content":"requesting to edit the display features of an application\nThis would simply fall under the change control procedure. editing the display could impact the project and the change would need to be approved, validated and communicated. the PM would not and could not make that determination."},{"timestamp":"1656084120.0","comment_id":"621728","content":"CCB isn't used for small items like display features... and in this scenario, we're approving an \"edit.\" All other options are overkill or irrelevant.
