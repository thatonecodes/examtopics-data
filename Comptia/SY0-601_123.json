It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others. A WAF is a protocol layer 7 defense (in the OSI model).\n\nA network intrusion protection system (NIPS) is an umbrella term for a combination of hardware and software systems that protect computer networks from unauthorized access and malicious activity.

NIPS (Network Intrusion Prevention System): A NIPS is an intrusion detection system that can actively block and prevent detected threats. It operates at Layer 7 of the OSI model, just like NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System). However, NIPS goes beyond detection and takes proactive measures to block potential attacks at the network level.\n- D. WAF (Web Application Firewall): A WAF is a security control that operates at Layer 7 of the OSI model. It is specifically designed to monitor, filter, and block HTTP/HTTPS traffic to and from web applications. By doing so, it can prevent web-based attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.\n\nWhy A is wrong according to ChatGPT:\n\nA.

WAF (Web Application Firewall): A WAF is a Layer 7 security control that sits between a web application and the internet, inspecting all incoming and outgoing traffic. It can block attacks targeting web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote file inclusion (RFI), by examining the content of HTTP requests and responses and blocking any that match predefined rules.\n\nB. NIPS (Network Intrusion Prevention System): A NIPS is a Layer 7 security control that can inspect and block attacks targeting specific network protocols and applications. It can identify and block attacks at the network layer, transport layer, and application layer, including Layer 7. NIPS uses signature-based detection and behavioral analysis to detect and block known and unknown attacks.\n\nTherefore, options B (NIPS) and D (WAF) are the correct answers.
