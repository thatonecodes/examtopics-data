Problems take longer to discover, and running into a problem is a huge hurdle that could derail the whole project. In an agile environment, a major issue is a signal to the developers to reassess their current plan and tweak the approach. In waterfall, where project specs are set in stone from the beginning, it is much harder to work around issues.","timestamp":"1581621660.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"50191"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"258608","comments":[{"poster":"who__cares123456789___","timestamp":"1609687200.0","comment_id":"258612","content":"Never mind, as it says \"existing\"...guess that means old method STILL EXISTS...still suffer from rampant second-guessing and PTSD!!! lol","upvote_count":"2"}],"content":"This is the BS I hate...Lead2Pass has Agile...this is because you could read the ques as Manager is taking over and the have already moved to Agile from Waterfall...I think I overthought this due to PTSD from their typically bad wording and obfuscated questions","poster":"who__cares123456789___","timestamp":"1609687080.0"}],"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Elb","comment_id":"43521","content":"B.
