Directory traversal revealed the hashed SSH password, which was used to access the server. Brief explanation: The log entry https://myapp.mycompany.com/something.php=?../..../../etc/shadow suggests a directory traversal attack, where the attacker attempts to access files outside the web server's intended directory. /etc/shadow is a critical file on Linux systems that contains hashed passwords. If an attacker retrieves this file, they can crack the hashes to gain credentials.\nThe sequence of events shows: Attempted directory traversal to access /etc/shadow (likely to retrieve hashed passwords).\nActions like whoami indicate the attacker tested their access level after gaining entry.\nAn SSH session was initiated shortly after, indicating the attacker used credentials from the /etc/shadow file.","comment_id":"1347184"}]},{"id":"HrpceMZ2vofiwErGbTaN","unix_timestamp":1740614760,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-02-27 01:06:00","exam_id":343,"question_id":584,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157174-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-627-discussion/","answer":"C","topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1362358","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRedundancy refers to having backup systems, devices, or components in place so that if one fails, the other can take over without causing a disruption in service.
