Implement the change: This would happen later in the process, after developing and testing the change, and only during the pre-determined maintenance window.\n B. Approve the test plan: While approving the test plan is important, it typically precedes determining the maintenance window as the window depends on the test schedule and potential downtime impact.\n C. Notify customers: Depending on the organization's policies and the impact of the change, customer notification might happen before or after developing the rollback plan, but it's not the immediate next step.\n D.
