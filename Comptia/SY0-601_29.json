SOAR platforms are designed to help security teams automate and orchestrate incident response processes, making incident handling more efficient and less labor-intensive.\n\nIn the context of a phishing campaign, a SOAR playbook can be created to automatically analyze incoming emails for phishing indicators, such as suspicious URLs or attachments, and trigger specific actions based on predefined rules. For example, the playbook can automatically block the sender's email address, quarantine suspicious emails, notify relevant stakeholders, and initiate the investigation process.\n\nBy leveraging automation and orchestration through a SOAR platform, the incident response team can significantly reduce the manual effort required to handle phishing incidents and respond to them more effectively and efficiently.","comment_id":"961769","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\n\"As a simple example, SOAR tools can examine and respond to phishing emails, reducing the amount of time needed by personnel to investigate them. By looking at email elements, such as the header, embedded URLs, and attachments, it’s possible to detect suspicious emails.\nThese can be forwarded to other tools to investigate further. For example, a SOAR tool can open attachments within a sandbox and observe the activity. Another SOAR tool may dissect the header looking for discrepancies common in phishing emails such as spoofed email addresses.\nWhen the SOAR platform verifies an email is malicious, it can automatically respond. The response is dependent on the organization’s available tools and internal guidelines.

The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet, and the client completes the connection establishment by sending an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server. Once the handshake is complete, data can be exchanged between the client and server.\n\nIn a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN packets to the target server but does not respond to the SYN-ACK packets sent by the server. As a result, the target server keeps waiting for the final ACK packet to complete the connection, and these half-open connections consume server resources such as memory and processing power.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"4","content":"The attacker overwhelms the server with a high volume of half-open connections, causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate client requests.

Spam and spim are cousins: Spim stands for “Spam over instant messaging,” and refers to unsolicited instant messages. Spim not only disrupts your chatting, but can also contain viruses or spyware.","comment_id":"691359"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Granddude","comment_id":"688141","timestamp":"1665097200.0","content":"I am going with B (vishing) and E (Credential Harvesting).

Phishing is another flavor of SPIT, that is phishing over VoIP. Phishing attacks consist of sending a voicemail to a person, masquerading it with information from a party trustworthy to the receiver, like a bank or online paying service, making him think he is safe.","poster":"omodara","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1664361300.0"},{"poster":"pdbone","comment_id":"678064","timestamp":"1664039160.0","content":"SPIM Vishing","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"100% this is Vishing and Hopping.

This one is VISH'ing and Credential harvesting. Vishing is the easy giveaway one, because VOIP is literally in the official definition of VISH'ing. The second one is the hard one, because it can either be hopping or credential harvesting. The reason it's not hopping, is because it doesn't specify VOIP hopping. The most common form of hopping is Island Hopping, which is an attack strategy that doesn't utilize VOIP at all. VOIP hopping is a popular attack vector used by pen testers and attackers, but isn't as common as credential harvesting. You'll want to look into VOIP VOMIT, which is a way to conduct credential harvesting of information, including usernames and passwords over VOIP. Countless articles mention credential harvesting as a common vulnerability in VOIP, meanwhile VOIP hopping really only pops up in a few articles and deep discussions on IT discussion boards well beyond the laymen.","timestamp":"1663185120.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"poster":"RonWonkers","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nI would say its B and E, I have no clue what Hopping is and I cant find it in my study book / google.
