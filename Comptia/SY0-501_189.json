I think this is a bigger threat than the provided answer of disabling location services. Meanwhile geolocation can track someone within a few feet, this solution implies theft of the device which could be the more immediate concern. However a remote wipe would have to be implemented which may not work considering you are rivaling a nation-state aka they have unlimited resources which means they probably would know to turn off the device or wrap it in a faraday cage or another method to prevent this which means the window for remote wipe is small.

Although very useful when used with navigation systems, it provides a mechanism to track an individual's movements, and therefore their social habits. The problem is further compounded by the plethora of mobile apps that require access to location services and then both send the information to the application developers and store it within the device's file structure. If an attacker can gain access to this data, then stalking, social engineering, and even identity theft become real possibilities.","poster":"Dion79","timestamp":"1624318200.0"},{"timestamp":"1623970680.0","comment_id":"384484","poster":"Brittle","content":"Let’s go A","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1618151520.0","content":"A is the correct answer","poster":"simo77","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"333352"},{"comment_id":"331639","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1617930540.0","content":"i believe A ... i thought this was a repeat question too.","poster":"Aarongreene"},{"timestamp":"1616990880.0","comments":[{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1617052200.0","content":"Some updates can be bad.

Is the bad actor's trying to steal the device and by disabling location-based service we are trying to hide the device's location or prevent tracking? Not sure if that could be considered the BEST Option.\nMy vote would be for A. Disable firmware OTA Update. It's not a very good answer - however from the list of answer's I prefer that the most. Scanning security patches and updates to make sure it does not impact any of the existing applications or disrupt any essential service is a common practice. Also with state-sponsored actors probably they could aim for a firmware hack? With that in mind I believe disabling OTA update and pushing update through an MDM or some other channel could be considered appropriate for this highly-sensitive device.
