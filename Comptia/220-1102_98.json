The device has been jailbroken.\n\nJailbreaking a mobile device involves removing the limitations imposed by the device manufacturer and carrier, allowing the user to gain privileged control over the device's operating system. However, from a security perspective, jailbroken devices pose significant risks, as they can bypass security measures implemented by the mobile device management (MDM) system. Therefore, many MDM systems are configured to detect jailbroken devices and flag them as non-compliant.","poster":"Duke_CT","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1210665"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":340,"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140534-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-538-discussion/","question_id":487},{"id":"DVxxWKtm6ge3e2fzxvBL","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sleezyglizzy","comment_id":"1216790","timestamp":"1732389240.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect"},{"content":"A.

Chain of custody must be maintained throughout the forensic evidence life cycle when dealing with a piece of evidence. The chain of custody refers to the chronological documentation or paper trail that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic evidence. It is crucial to maintain a clear and complete chain of custody to ensure that the evidence is admissible in court and that its integrity and authenticity are not compromised. While acceptable use, security policy, and information management are also important considerations in forensic investigations, they do not specifically refer to the maintenance of the chain of custody.","timestamp":"1701803760.0","upvote_count":"11"},{"content":"Was not expecting my time on the police force to aid in a tech based exam, but here we are","poster":"MikeGeo","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1148758","timestamp":"1723497900.0"},{"comment_id":"710037","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is correct","poster":"Porygon","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1683050700.0"},{"poster":"imtiazL","timestamp":"1682566980.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"answer is correct\nhttps://www.google.co.za/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiD4sTX2f_6AhVKQEEAHbXcCp0QFnoECA4QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unodc.org%2Fe4j%2Fen%2Fcybercrime%2Fmodule-6%2Fkey-issues%2Fhandling-of-digital-evidence.html%23%3A~%3Atext%3DTo%2520demonstrate%2520this%252C%2520a%2520chain%2Clife%2520cycle%2520of%2520a%2520case.&usg=AOvVaw2OoKXHja_nQmIUgAi4wauN","comment_id":"705195"}],"exam_id":340,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/86495-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-54-discussion/","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-10-27 05:43:00","question_text":"Which of the following must be maintained throughout the forensic evidence life cycle when dealing with a piece of evidence?"},{"id":"2cQvqctpl7jn0lwVpIj2","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":490,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1715566380,"choices":{"A":"Automate the patching process","D":"Document all changes.","B":"Monitor the firewall configuration,","C":"Implement access control lists."},"answer":"A","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1216796","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect","poster":"Sleezyglizzy","timestamp":"1732389420.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1731471180.0","poster":"Duke_CT","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1210667","content":"A.
