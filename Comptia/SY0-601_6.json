Service\n\nThe most appropriate account type for an application that needs to read and write data to a shared database is a \"Service\" account. Service accounts are used to run specific services or applications in a controlled manner, allowing them to access resources and perform specific actions on behalf of the application or service they represent.\n\nIn this scenario, the application needs to interact with the database on a regular basis, so a dedicated service account should be created for it. This service account should have the necessary permissions to read and write data to the specific tables or data objects required by the application.\n\nUsing a service account provides better control and accountability over the actions performed by the application.

A CASB is a security solution that is designed to provide visibility and control over cloud applications and services. It can be used to block access to unsanctioned applications and to enforce security policies and compliance requirements for cloud services. In this case, the CASB would be used to block access to unsanctioned high-risk SaaS applications, reducing the risk of shadow IT and helping the organization to maintain control over its cloud environment. Options B, C, and D are not specifically related to reducing the risk of shadow IT and unsanctioned SaaS applications.
