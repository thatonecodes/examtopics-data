Another advantage is that server-based scans might not have the opportunity to assess devices that connect to the network temporarily and infrequently, such as mobiles and laptops. One drawback is that the range of agents may be limited to a particular operating system. There is also the chance that an adversary could compromise the agent software. It is often right to use both approaches to cover different asset classes. For example, agent-based scanning might be used for client PCs and mobiles, while active server-based scanning is used for network servers and routing/switching infrastructure, and passive scanning is used for embedded systems networks.\" (The Official CompTIA CySA+ Student Guide Exam CS0-002 page 354)","poster":"kmordalv","comments":[{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1716768420.0","comment_id":"1081131","content":"I agree!"}]},{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"998195","content":"Selected Answer: B\nFor a company with a geographically diverse workforce and dynamic IP addresses looking to implement a vulnerability scanning method with reduced network traffic, the most suitable option is:\n\nB.
