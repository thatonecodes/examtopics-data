The user's computer is properly configured with an IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway, which should allow the user to access the internet and online videos. The high download and upload speeds and low ping time recorded from the test laptop also indicate that the network is working well. However, the user's inability to watch online videos suggests that there might be an issue with the network card (NIC) on the user's computer. The NIC might be faulty or malfunctioning, which is preventing the computer from receiving and processing the video data.

To avoid this interference, the technician should configure the Wi-Fi access point (AP) to use a 5GHz band, which has more channels and less interference from other devices. Changing the Wi-Fi operation channel may not solve the problem if the microwave interferes with multiple channels. Increasing the power output of the AP may not overcome the interference and may cause more interference to other devices.
