Implement a privileged access management solution.\n\nExplanation:\nA privileged access management (PAM) solution minimizes the risk of pass-the-hash attacks by enforcing stricter controls on privileged accounts, such as domain administrators. PAM solutions include features like just-in-time access, session monitoring, credential vaulting, and isolating privileged credentials, ensuring that attackers cannot easily exploit administrative credentials.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. Audit each domain administrator account weekly for password compliance: While auditing is good practice, it does not directly prevent pass-the-hash attacks because the attack uses hashed credentials, not passwords themselves.\nC. Create IDS policies to monitor domain controller access: Monitoring is helpful for detection, but it does not prevent the attack. Pass-the-hash attacks exploit credential reuse, which monitoring alone cannot stop.","comment_id":"1347699","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Anyio"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nPrivileged access management (PAM) refers to policies, procedures, and technical \ncontrols to prevent compromise of privileged accounts.

Malicious code is copied to the allocated space of an already running process.\n\nExplanation:\nMemory injection occurs when malicious code is directly injected into the memory space of an already running process. This type of attack bypasses the need to write malicious code to disk, making it harder to detect with traditional file-based antivirus solutions. Examples include DLL injection or process hollowing.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. Two processes access the same variable, allowing one to cause a privilege escalation: This describes a race condition, not memory injection.\nB. A process receives an unexpected amount of data, which causes malicious code to be executed: This describes a buffer overflow, which is a precursor to injection attacks but not memory injection itself.","comment_id":"1347700","timestamp":"1738030920.0"},{"timestamp":"1737696240.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFrom ChatGPT\nMemory injection is a technique where malicious code is directly injected into the memory space of an already running process, allowing the attacker to execute unauthorized commands or manipulate the process.
