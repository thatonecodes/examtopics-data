And what if there is passive-POE? \nBut yeah, from the options it looks like DHCP exhaustion. Because other options does not make sense. But the main red-herring is that the AP is restarted.

It provides detailed information about network throughput, packet loss, and latency. In this case, an engineer can use iPerf to measure the performance of the network between the remote office and the central location to identify the cause of the slow file transfers. Packet capture can be used to analyze the network traffic, but it may not provide the detailed measurement data required to diagnose the issue.
