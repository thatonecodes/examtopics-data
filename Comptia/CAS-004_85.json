Tabletop exercise because it specifically meets the requirement of discussing disaster recovery scenarios with representatives from multiple departments within an incident response team without executing any invasive actions. This exercise allows for a structured discussion and evaluation of disaster response plans, enhances coordination and communication among stakeholders, and helps in identifying gaps or areas needing improvement in a controlled and non-disruptive manner. Thus, it's the most appropriate testing plan for scenario-based discussions in the given context.","comment_id":"1243504","timestamp":"1720292340.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"isaphiltrick"}],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-07-06 20:59:00","topic":"1","question_id":421,"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":343,"answer":"B","choices":{"B":"Tabletop exercise","C":"Full interruption test","A":"Disaster recovery checklist","D":"Parallel test"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following testing plans is used to discuss disaster recovery scenarios with representatives from multiple departments within an incident response team but without taking any invasive actions?","unix_timestamp":1720292340,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/143460-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-477-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_images":[]},{"id":"Rh3k2cywYM6uVPKv8JfB","answer_description":"","question_id":422,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"ISA","C":"SLA","D":"MOU","A":"NDA"},"question_text":"Recently, two large engineering companies in the same line of business decided to approach cyberthreats in a united way.

It allows the security administrator to examine the data packets flowing between the source and destination servers on port 1433 (commonly used for SQL databases), which is crucial for identifying any potential bottlenecks or issues causing the performance degradation.
