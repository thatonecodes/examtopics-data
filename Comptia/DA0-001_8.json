Stratified sampling\n\nStratified sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous groups or strata based on certain characteristics (in this case, states) and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. Since the goal is to collect a similar proportion of data from every state, stratified sampling would be the most appropriate method. This ensures that each state is represented in the sample proportionally to its size in the population, thus achieving a balanced representation across all states.","timestamp":"1729118160.0","comment_id":"1196855","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":36,"exam_id":351,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1713306960},{"id":"JdZ8GwlN8zCSqKpzshCt","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1713307200,"topic":"1","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image41.png","https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image42.png"],"answer_images":[],"answer":"C","question_id":37,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138909-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-131-discussion/","choices":{"D":"81.5","C":"78.8","B":"76.5","A":"73.5"},"exam_id":351,"timestamp":"2024-04-17 00:40:00","question_text":"A data analyst needs to perform a full outer join of a customerâ€™s orders using the tables below:\n\n\nSales_table -\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nOrder_table -\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich of the following is the mean of the order quantity?","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","comment_id":"1196860","content":"When both tables are merged, there will be six order_qty values, 50 and 103 from both Sales_table and Order_table, 68 from Sales_table, 102, 80, and 70 from Order_table. \n\n(50 + 68 + 103 + 102 + 80 + 70) / 6 = 78.8. \n\nC is correct.","timestamp":"1729118400.0"}]},{"id":"HyQznsqpS2yanISL84Di","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image43.png"],"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":351,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-04-17 00:42:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138912-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-132-discussion/","answers_community":[],"question_id":38,"choices":{"A":"Data normalization","D":"Data blending","B":"Data append","C":"Data aggregation"},"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1713307320,"answer":"C","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729118520.0","content":"C. Data aggregation\n\nTo obtain the average daily sales for the following week, the analyst needs to aggregate the sales data for each day of the week and then calculate the average. Aggregation involves combining or summarizing data from multiple sources or rows into a single value, such as summing, averaging, or counting. In this case, the analyst would aggregate the daily sales data to calculate the total sales for each day, and then divide by the number of days in the week to find the average daily sales.","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","comment_id":"1196864"}],"question_text":"An analyst must obtain the average daily sales for the following week:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich of the following must the analyst perform to obtain this value?"},{"id":"3oUxffW9GHr9jvahbjBu","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2024-04-17 00:44:00","unix_timestamp":1713307440,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1196865","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","content":"A.
