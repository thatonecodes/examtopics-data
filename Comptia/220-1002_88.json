Firstly, it is set to auto, so the phone will increase the brightness during the day (highest while outside but also moderate while in a bright room etc) which dramatically increases power consumption. Secondly, the screen autolock is set to off. This means that the screen will constantly be on and adjusting brightness higher unless the user turns it off. This would indeed drain the battery extremely fast and could be lessened most effectively by manually setting the brightness.","poster":"dnbly","timestamp":"1618303740.0","comment_id":"334512","upvote_count":"4"}],"upvote_count":"14"},{"poster":"ep0ch","timestamp":"1633371720.0","comment_id":"457306","upvote_count":"9","content":"This has to be A.
