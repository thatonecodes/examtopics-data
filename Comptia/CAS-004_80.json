A CDN leverages caching and content distribution to deliver content with low latency by serving it from edge servers located close to end users. This approach ensures that both sensitive and public content can be delivered swiftly across different geographic regions, optimizing user experience without requiring significant infrastructure changes or delays in deployment."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCDN offers itself, but my worry is the sensitive information.

Publishing it publicly could further damage the company's reputation and potentially lead to legal repercussions. Therefore, collecting sufficient evidence to demonstrate the vulnerability's existence and impact, while maintaining a responsible and professional approach, is the most recommended course of action. \no C. Recommend legal consultation about the process: While legal consultation might be beneficial in complex situations, it's not the first step. The researcher should initially attempt to engage with the company directly, following established vulnerability disclosure procedures.

This is a crucial initial step because it addresses fundamental vulnerabilities and strengthens the system's overall security posture. Before implementing additional security measures like IPS/IDS or antivirus, it's essential to harden vulnerable systems to minimize their exposure to attacks. \no D. Installing all available patches: Installing all available patches is a good practice for maintaining system security. However, it's a reactive measure that addresses existing vulnerabilities.

Installing all available patches. Installing patches is the most immediate and effective way to address known vulnerabilities in software and systems. Since the systems are end-of-support, they may not receive regular updates from the vendor, so it is critical to install any remaining available patches that address security flaws. This can help prevent exploitation of those known vulnerabilities and significantly reduce the attack surface by fixing weaknesses that attackers could exploit. NOT A. Utilizing hardening recommendations: While hardening recommendations (such as disabling unnecessary services, adjusting permissions, and enforcing security policies) are important to secure systems, patching vulnerabilities should be the first priority.
