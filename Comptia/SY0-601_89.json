Data masking aims to make the data unusable and unrecognizable, while pseudonymization aims to make the data unlinkable and untraceable. Data masking usually involves modifying the data in a way that cannot be reversed, while pseudonymization usually involves replacing the data with a key that can be restored if needed. Data masking preserves the format and structure of the data, while pseudonymization may alter the format and structure of the data. Data masking is more suitable for data that does not need to be analyzed or processed, while pseudonymization is more suitable for data that needs to be aggregated or queried.\n\nFrom: www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-do-you-balance-data-utility-privacy-when-using","poster":"geogal","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1693726080.0"},{"timestamp":"1693182360.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPseudo-anonymization is a de-identification method that replaces private identifiers with fake identifiers or pseudonyms (for example, replacing the value of the name identifier “Mark Sands” with “John Doe”).

Noise can be added to some fields to remove direct connections, but maintaining the approximate value; for example, randomly adding or subtracting three days to/from the actual date of birth preserves the age but de-identifies to the original record.
