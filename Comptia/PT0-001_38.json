It provides a broad range of capabilities, including multiple scan modes intended to bypass firewalls and other network protection devices. Nmap is a port scanner. To scan for ports, you will want to use -p <port ranges> (only scan specified ports). This option specifies which ports you want to scan and overrides the default scan. Individual port numbers or ranges are acceptable. Ranges are separated by a hyphen (e.g., 1-1023). The beginning and/or end values of a range may be omitted, causing nmap to use 1 and 65535, respectively. So, you can specify -p- to scan ports from 1 through 65535.
