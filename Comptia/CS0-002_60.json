Explanation: The Nmap output shows that several ports are open on the scanned host. Each port represents a potential security vulnerability, but the SSH service (port 22) stands out for two reasons. First, SSH allows remote access, which means an attacker could potentially take full control of the system if they were able to exploit this service. Second, it's unusual to see SSH running on a Windows host (as suggested by the presence of ports 135, 445, and 3389, all commonly associated with Windows systems). This combination of factors makes port 22 the most urgent to investigate. [Port 135 is associated with the Microsoft RPC service, which is often exploited by malware, but it's also a core service in Windows environments. Port 445 is used for SMB, a service used for file sharing. While these can be exploited, it's less unusual to see them on a Windows host. Port 3389 is used for RDP, another potential vector for attacks, but again it's less unusual to see this service on a Windows host.]","upvote_count":"7"},{"poster":"Chilaqui1es","comment_id":"1059346","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAccording to Google \"hackers or unauthorized users can access a computer system through TCP Port 135 if it is left open\" Im choosing B\" Look up if Port 135 is secure","timestamp":"1698810240.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/47028-exam-cs0-002-topic-1-question-124-discussion/","poster":"yanyan20","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1684745640.0","comment_id":"903885"},{"comment_id":"902013","timestamp":"1684506240.0","content":"Answer D","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CyberCEH"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1684083180.0","comment_id":"897736","content":"Answer seems to be D.
