Gotta pay but the have tons of videos and test prep stuff) and the answer is B. Here's their explanation:\n Explanation\n\"While all of the answers could provide some insight into the APT’s actions, only “Analyze the trends of the events while manually reviewing them to see if any indicators match” effectively will answer this question. If you only use the IP addresses to search the event logs, you would miss any events that correlated only to the domain names. If you create an advanced query with ALL of the indicators, your search of the event logs will find nothing, because no single event will include ALL of these IPs and domain names. Finally, while scanning for vulnerabilities known to have been used by the APTs is a good practice, it would only be effective in determining how to stop future attacks from occurring, not for piecing together whether or not an attack has already occurred.\"","comments":[{"comment_id":"114017","upvote_count":"9","poster":"Blind_Hatred","content":"This doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
