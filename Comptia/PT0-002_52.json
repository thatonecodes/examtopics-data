Shodan. Given that the security cameras are connected to the Internet, Shodan can be used to gather additional information about these devices, such as their make, model, and any known vulnerabilities.\n\nAnalysis of Other Options:\n\nA. Wardriving: While wardriving (searching for WiFi networks from a moving vehicle) can be useful for identifying wireless networks, it is less specific than Shodan for gathering detailed information about Internet-connected devices.\nC. Recon-ng: Recon-ng is a reconnaissance framework that can be used for gathering open-source intelligence (OSINT). While useful, it is more general-purpose and not specifically focused on identifying Internet-connected devices like Shodan.\nD. Aircrack-ng: Aircrack-ng is a suite of tools for assessing WiFi network security, including cracking WEP and WPA-PSK keys. This tool is more relevant for wireless network security testing rather than Internet-connected device reconnaissance.","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"Answer Bâ€¦.. hit wrong option when posting","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000","comment_id":"1241652","timestamp":"1720039920.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1241651"},{"timestamp":"1711929000.0","poster":"shaneo007","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1187092","content":"In the context of a physical penetration test, Recon-ng would be a better choice for additional reconnaissance within the building."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe fact that the question specifies there were multiple cameras connected to the internet it's a clear indicator that there is an incentive for the pentester to go and use Shodan for further investigation.","timestamp":"1703539680.0","poster":"KeToopStudy","comment_id":"1105548","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1692987900.0","poster":"FnordyClovers","content":"B.
