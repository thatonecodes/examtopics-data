Implement allow listing and add the office IP address as an exception.\n\nAllow listing (also known as whitelisting) involves specifying trusted IP addresses or ranges from which users can access resources without being prompted for two-factor authentication. By adding the office IP address as an exception to the two-factor authentication requirement, users connecting to the office Wi-Fi will not be prompted for two-factor authentication, while users working outside of the office will still be required to authenticate."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1362427","poster":"JonHin","timestamp":"1740634560.0","content":"B\nAllow listing is a security technique that allows only specific IP addresses or domains to access a network or a service. By adding the office IP address as an exception, the company can prevent two-factor authentication from being triggered when users are connected to the office Wi-Fi, since the office network is considered trusted. This way, users will only be prompted for two-factor authentication when working outside of the office, which enhances security."},{"comment_id":"1214325","poster":"Jayysaystgis","upvote_count":"1","content":"I say the answer is D","timestamp":"1732112580.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1715562000,"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140414-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-451-discussion/","question_id":392,"answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"4w9C1ABxXqamRhaFU8K4","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"choices":{"C":"Multiuser software development","B":"Legacy software support","A":"Cross-platform network support","D":"Minimized resource consumption"},"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following is an aspect of using client-side virtualization?","unix_timestamp":1715562060,"exam_id":339,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":393,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1210504","content":"An aspect of using client-side virtualization is:\n\nB. Legacy software support.\n\nClient-side virtualization allows users to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on their local computer, enabling them to run different operating systems and software simultaneously. This capability is particularly useful for supporting legacy software that may require older operating systems or dependencies that are no longer compatible with the host system. By running legacy software in a virtual machine, users can maintain compatibility and access applications that would otherwise be incompatible with their current operating environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1731466860.0","poster":"Duke_CT"}],"timestamp":"2024-05-13 03:01:00","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140415-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-452-discussion/"},{"id":"acglQukK707WvwGZ8Yfs","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"C\nA load balancer is a device or software that distributes network or application traffic across a group of servers, often referred to as a \"server farm.\" This helps in ensuring that no single server becomes overloaded and that the workload is balanced efficiently across all available resources.","comment_id":"1314896","poster":"CloudChef","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732047840.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
