In the context of network connectivity troubleshooting, a short circuit in the cabling or the wall jack can cause unexpected impedance values. This can lead to connectivity issues and signal degradation.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1717623720.0","comment_id":"1088879"},{"poster":"actingnurse1","comment_id":"979544","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1707773580.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe most likely cause of extremely low ohmic values (indicating a short circuit) instead of the rated impedance from the switchport is a short circuit within the cabling or the network equipment.\n\nExplanation:\n\nShort circuit: A short circuit occurs when there is an unintended connection between two conductors or components that are not supposed to be electrically connected. This can result in extremely low resistance (ohmic value), causing a significant current flow. In the context of network cabling, a short circuit could occur due to damaged or frayed cables, improper termination, or physical damage to the cabling infrastructure."}],"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_id":496,"choices":{"C":"Short circuit","A":"Incorrect transceivers","B":"Faulty LED","D":"Upgraded OS version on switch"},"topic":"1","answer":"C","exam_id":357},{"id":"3RxSS2BY8mv66SWDZ6ez","topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-11-12 15:11:00","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"A user is experimenting with audio transmissions and would like the transmissions to reach several specific devices simultaneously over the IP network.

Cat 5e\n\nFor a cost-effective solution that supports Gigabit Ethernet for up to 328 feet (100 meters), Cat 5e (Category 5e) is the most suitable option. Cat 5e cables are an improved version of Cat 5 cables and are capable of supporting Gigabit Ethernet up to the specified distance.\n\nWhile Cat 6 and Cat 7 cables offer higher performance and better shielding, they may be overkill for a typical retail store environment.
