The lines are not shared. And with cable (is also a copper), users do not usually get the full download speeds as it is shared.

Fiber: Fiber-optic connections use light to transmit data through glass or plastic fibers, not copper.\n\nB. Cable: Cable internet uses coaxial cables, which are different from copper wires.\n\nC.

This technology, known as Cable Internet, is distinct from DSL. Cable Internet typically offers higher speeds than DSL and is often provided by cable television companies. It also involves shared customer bandwidth, similar to DSL.\n\nSo, both DSL (option D) and Cable (option B) involve the use of copper mediums with shared customer bandwidth. However, DSL specifically refers to Digital Subscriber Line technology, while Cable refers to cable internet service.\n\nGiven this clarification, either option D (DSL) or option B (Cable) could be the correct answer, depending on the specific context of the question.

The fact that is says it is delivered over a copper medium would make me think DSL. Then it mentions shared bandwidth. Bandwidth is not shared with DSL but is is shared with cable which is why people always saw their internet speeds drop between the hours of 5 and 10pm. Usually cable uses a hybrid network consisting of fiber to the node then delivers service from the node to multiple customers over copper.
