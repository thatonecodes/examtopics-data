Higher severity vulnerabilities should be prioritized first. Explanation of the CVSS Vector Components:\nAV (Attack Vector):\nN (Network): The vulnerability is exploitable over a network. (Most critical)\nA (Adjacent): Exploitable in the same network segment.\nL (Local): Requires local access to exploit.\nP (Physical): Requires physical access to exploit.\nPR (Privileges Required):\nN (None): No privileges are required. (Most critical)\nL (Low): Low privileges are required.\nH (High): High privileges are required.\nAC (Attack Complexity):\nL (Low): Exploiting is straightforward. (Most critical)\nH (High): Exploiting is complex.\nUI (User Interaction):\nN (None): No user interaction is required. (Most critical)\nR (Required): User interaction is required.
