Perform supply chain analysis and require third-party suppliers to implement vulnerability management programs would be the best option to mitigate risks and prevent further issues like these from occurring. The developer did not write some of the code, and it is not tracked for licensing purposes. Hence, it is likely that the code was obtained from third-party suppliers. By performing a supply chain analysis and requiring third-party suppliers to implement vulnerability management programs, the developer can ensure that the code used in the product is secure and does not contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

This solution directly addresses the core issue — vulnerabilities in code that the developer did not write — by identifying the third-party or open-source components in the software and checking for known vulnerabilities.
