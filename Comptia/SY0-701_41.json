By restricting access to the administrator console of the help desk software to only the IT manager and the help desk lead, the IT manager is adhering to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only those individuals who require administrative access have it, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse.\n\nGiven the scenario described, the security technique that the IT manager is setting up by restricting access to the administrator console of the help desk software is Least privilege. This approach aligns with the principle of least privilege by granting administrative access only to individuals who need it to perform their job responsibilities.","comment_id":"1208569","timestamp":"1715205960.0","poster":"metzen227","upvote_count":"13"},{"poster":"1LL337","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nEliminating unnecessary access = Least Privilege","comment_id":"1259308","timestamp":"1722507900.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

PIN\n\nHere’s why:\nPIN (Personal Identification Number): When using a smart card, the smart card itself serves as one factor (something you have), and the PIN entered to access the smart card provides the second factor (something you know). This combination of something you have (the smart card) and something you know (the PIN) constitutes MFA.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the authentication factor provided by the smart card:\n-Hardware token: This could be another factor for MFA but is not used in conjunction with a smart card; instead, it’s a standalone factor.\n\n-User ID: This is usually a username and not a factor in MFA.\n\n-SMS: This can be used as an additional factor in some MFA setups but is not directly related to smart cards.
