The purpose of Active-Active is to have zero down-time. If a node fails, it automatically sends all that traffic to the other running node (as they were active-active, aka \"Live Failover\").

Services such as Microsoft SCCM and Microsoft Cluster Aware Updating can automate the process.\nThe Official CompTIA Server+ Study Guide (Exam SK0-005)\n\nI think the most important is the process to patch cluster nodes is to bring down one node at a time for patching (and the subsequent reboot) and then return it to service.\n\nIf you have one (or more) VMs on active cluster server, you have to failover the VM(s) to patch the active cluster server.","comments":[{"comment_id":"715036","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1668068340.0","content":"Failover and Failback\nWhen you research server clustering, you frequently hear the terms failover and failback. Failover refers to the failure of the active service provider node and passive node's taking over of its responsibilities. At that point, the server that was the passive node becomes the active node. It services clients and handles the cluster’s duties. Once the original active node returns to service, you may set it to act as the new passive node, or you may shift the services back to it, causing it to take back its active node role and relegating the formerly passive server to its original role. The term failback refers to the service returning to the original active node.\nThe Official CompTIA Server+ Study Guide (Exam SK0-005) page 242","comments":[{"poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1668068820.0","comment_id":"715044","content":"I think the \"B.
