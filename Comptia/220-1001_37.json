That's a good one. When you see vertical lines on page, first of all, I pretty much guarantee we're talking laser printers here because it's a big issue with 'em.

You'll get little pieces of paper, little pieces of string that will actually wrap around it, and that's going to corrupt the image, and every time you print something you're going to get a line there. And the answer is you yank the toner cartridge and you throw it in the garbage. It is impossible to take like a pair of scissors or something and try to cut away that debris. The thing is simply too sensitive and just touching it with a piece of metal can usually force it to never be able to really print properly again. be able to really print properly again. \"","timestamp":"1637506980.0"}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":337,"unix_timestamp":1637506980,"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2021-11-21 16:03:00","question_text":"A technician is repairing a laser printer because its print jobs have a narrow, faded line running along the length of the page from top to bottom.
