Appetite\nRisk appetite refers to the level of risk an organization is willing to accept to achieve its objectives. Before granting access to contractors and employees, the implementation team should understand the company's risk appetite to ensure the expansion of access controls aligns with the organization's tolerance for risk.\n\nWhy the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Threshold\nA risk threshold is the specific level of risk that an organization is unwilling to exceed. While thresholds are important, they are more granular than risk appetite and are typically derived from it. Understanding risk appetite is more critical at this stage.\n\nC. Avoidance\nRisk avoidance involves eliminating risk by not engaging in the activity that creates it. This is not relevant to the scenario, as the company is considering expanding access, not avoiding it.","poster":"Anyio","timestamp":"1738041360.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1347732"}],"choices":{"C":"Avoidance","D":"Register","A":"Threshold","B":"Appetite"},"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1738041360,"question_images":[]},{"id":"bzXV3pcgQ6riQRmfjK2V","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is the act of proving to a customer that software developers are trained on secure coding?","timestamp":"2025-01-21 19:18:00","question_id":463,"exam_id":368,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155093-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-516-discussion/","answer":"D","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"poster":"9149f41","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1738493400.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nDue diligence refers to the comprehensive process of evaluating and mitigating risks before making a decision or entering into an agreement.\nSo only attestation is the only reasonable answer.","comment_id":"1350347"},{"comment_id":"1347202","timestamp":"1737945360.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAttestation is the act of formally proving or certifying that a specific requirement or standard has been met.
