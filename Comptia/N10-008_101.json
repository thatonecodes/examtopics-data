The switch's mirror port is duplicating traffic on another port on the switch and sending the mirrored traffic through its mirror port which is connected to the linux computer on eth1.\n\nI'm still trying to understand if promiscuous mode should be set on eth1 instead of eth0 since eth1 is the interface where the mirrored traffic is being sent to be captured and analyzed... The Linux computer's main duty is for network monitoring anyway so I guess setting it to eth0 is probably for general network monitoring/control?\n\nEitherway, it's the only answer that makes sense given the other choices but if someone can clarify that it would be appreciated.","poster":"rodwave","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bimbo_12","content":"Yeah, the issue with this question is, that it would have to be the interface of the mirror port that had to be set to promiscuous mode, not the one of the monitoring machine.
