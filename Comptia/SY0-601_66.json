VPN (Virtual Private Network) is the security solution that would be the best choice for preventing unauthorized access to an internal network. A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the Internet between the remote user and the internal network, which ensures that the traffic is protected from eavesdropping and interception. This solution is particularly useful when employees are working remotely or accessing the network from a public network.\n\nMAC filtering, anti-malware, and translation gateway are also important security solutions, but they do not directly address the issue of unauthorized access to the internal network. MAC filtering is a network access control method that allows or blocks access based on the physical addresses of network interfaces. Anti-malware protects against malicious software that can infect systems and cause damage.

This suggests that the malware may have been downloaded or delivered through a web-based attack, rather than through email.\n\nDNS logs are useful for tracking network traffic, but they do not provide information on what specifically happened on the web server. On the other hand, web server logs can provide more detailed information about web-based activity, such as which websites were visited, which files were downloaded, and which IPs accessed the server.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the web server logs would be more useful for identifying the source of the malware. By analyzing the logs, the incident response team can potentially identify which websites or web-based applications the user interacted with, which may have been compromised and delivered the malware.","poster":"skorza","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"828493"},{"timestamp":"1677730800.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDNS logs","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"826488","poster":"ganymede"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"802526","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
