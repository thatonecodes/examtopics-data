Blocklists are used by firewalls and other security measures to restrict access to certain IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. If an IP address is on the blocklist, it will not be able to be scanned by a penetration tester.","timestamp":"1678331520.0","poster":"nickwen007","comment_id":"833557","upvote_count":"10"},{"timestamp":"1726251060.0","poster":"b1484e5","content":"All in the wording I think penetration tester cannot scan = pentester IP on block list\nserver can't be scanned = server unreachable or wrong IP address","comment_id":"1283306","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"NateyNat","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think option C is best, unlikely a server is unreachable.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718909880.0","comment_id":"1233915"},{"content":"Another horribly written question. It is not specifying which IP is on the blocklist. The attacker machine or the server. Why in the world would any WAF block your server's IP due to an attacker scanning it. That is dumb. If anything, the attacker machine's IP would end up on the blocklist. But again, who's blocklist? The server's? a router? a firewall?

Blocklists are commonly used to restrict access from specific IP addresses that might be considered suspicious or have been identified as sources of malicious activity. If the server has detected scanning activity from the penetration tester's IP address and considered it hostile, it could have added the IP address to a blocklist, subsequently preventing further scans from that address.","timestamp":"1691452740.0","poster":"solutionz","comment_id":"975064","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nthe best is C","timestamp":"1691253660.0","comment_id":"973184","poster":"matheusfmartins","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThere could be several reasons why a penetration tester cannot scan a server that was previously scanned successfully. One possible reason could be that the IP address of the server is on the blocklist, which means that the organization's security measures have blocked access from the penetration tester's scanning tool. Another possible reason could be that the server's IP address has changed since the last scan, making it unreachable or belonging to a different device.
