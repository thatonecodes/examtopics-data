Router\n\nIn a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) environment, a router would most likely be used to connect one or more devices to the Internet. Routers play a crucial role in connecting a local network to the Internet, providing network address translation (NAT), firewall capabilities, and the ability to share a single Internet connection among multiple devices.\n\nOptions A (Hub) and C (Wireless access point) are not typically used for Internet connectivity in a SOHO setting. A hub is a basic networking device that does not provide the necessary features for Internet connection sharing, and a wireless access point provides Wi-Fi connectivity but does not handle Internet connectivity on its own.\n\nOption B (Ethernet gateway) is a less common term and is not as widely used as \"router\" in the context of connecting devices to the Internet.","comment_id":"1085345"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"alforg03","content":"Selected Answer: D\nTHE Right asnwer is D","timestamp":"1701095040.0","comment_id":"1081642"},{"comment_id":"964827","timestamp":"1690469760.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"A router is a device that connects one or more networks, such as a home or small office network, to\nthe internet.

That being said, don't discount the value in waiting for a vendor. While people often want quick solutions, some laptops have unique cords or cables attached. They may have plastic clips or non-universal designs. Breaking some of these small pieces is often painful, hard to replace, and expensive. Caution is the best answer if you are unfamiliar with a laptop design. By all means, ALWAYS document, but be aware that foreign design elements can be broken when pulling off a piece of case. It's usually most common with circuit cables that are connected in a place you wouldn't expect.","poster":"MrCompTIA","upvote_count":"6","comments":[{"poster":"DinamoDennis","timestamp":"1731502920.0","content":"This explanation makes no sense in regards to the question.
