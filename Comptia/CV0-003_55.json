Data is synchronized in real time across the sites.\n\nIn an active-active configuration with dual-stack infrastructure across two separate data centers, the best practice for replication is to synchronize data in real-time across the sites. Real-time synchronization ensures that changes made in one data center are immediately replicated to the other data center, maintaining consistency and availability of data across both sites.","upvote_count":"2"}],"exam_id":349,"question_images":[]},{"id":"nD4SVvwlUiQle79Afn3S","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157394-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-353-discussion/","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2025-03-02 15:02:00","exam_id":349,"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":273,"isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"A differential backup","B":"A production snapshot","C":"A full backup","A":"An application-level backup"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1740924120.0","comment_id":"1363970","poster":"BigM","content":"Selected Answer: B\nExplanation:\nWhen upgrading a critical production application without a development environment, a quick rollback strategy is essential in case something goes wrong.\n\nWhy Option B (Production Snapshot) is the Best Choice:\n✔ Fastest rollback method – Snapshots capture the entire system state, including the OS, application, and configuration.
