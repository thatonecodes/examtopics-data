Use more elaborative questioning to elicit connections.\n\nWhen students demonstrate a lack of connection with the subject matter, the instructor can use more elaborative questioning to elicit connections. This approach can help students engage with the material and make connections between what they already know and what they are learning.\n\nOption B, continuing with the course and making no adjustments, is not an effective approach because it does not address the issue of students' lack of connection with the subject matter. Option C, creating scenarios on more interesting topics than the objective, may be a good idea to make the class more engaging, but it may not be directly relevant to the course objectives. Option D, reminding the students that this is a requirement, may be perceived as coercive and could lead to resentment, further disengagement, and negative attitudes towards the subject matter.\n\nTherefore, the best approach is to use more elaborative questioning to elicit connections and help students engage with the material. This approach can create a more interactive and engaging learning experience for the students.","poster":"JimGrayham","timestamp":"1726044720.0","comment_id":"835851"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/102282-exam-tk0-201-topic-4-question-82-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1678531920,"answers_community":[],"choices":{"A":"Use more elaborative questioning to elicit connections.","B":"Continue with the course and make no adjustments.","C":"Create scenarios on more interesting topics than the objective.","D":"Remind the students that this is a requirement."},"answer_description":"","exam_id":369,"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_id":86,"question_text":"By the first break in a mandatory course, the students non-verbal communication demonstrates a lack of connection with the subject matter.

This helps to motivate the learner by emphasizing the practical applications of the objective and how it can help them perform their job better. Bringing statistics from other classes, using multitasking teaching methods, and involving other classmates in the explanation may be useful in some situations but are not necessarily motivators for learners."}],"answers_community":[],"topic":"4","timestamp":"2023-03-12 06:54:00","unix_timestamp":1678600440},{"id":"YhffWlBQ03LMchF7U3Aj","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-03-12 07:07:00","unix_timestamp":1678601220,"exam_id":369,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"The drawback to using open-ended questions toward the beginning of a synchronous virtual class is:","answer":"A","choices":{"C":"open-ended questioning is inappropriate for a virtual class.","A":"response in a virtual class is too time-consuming for discussions at the start of class.","D":"personal commentary is contradictory to the efficient impersonal design of virtual classes.","B":"virtual learners will be thrown off; they are expecting visual presentations."},"question_id":89,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"4","discussion":[{"content":"B. Virtual learners will be thrown off; they are expecting visual presentations would be the drawback to using open-ended questions toward the beginning of a synchronous virtual class.\n\nWhen learners join a synchronous virtual class, they may have expectations of what will happen during the session. If the instructor starts with open-ended questions that require a lot of discussion, it may be unexpected and throw off the learners. This can make it difficult for learners to engage and focus on the class, especially if they were expecting visual presentations or other types of activities.\n\nThe other options presented are not drawbacks to using open-ended questions at the beginning of a synchronous virtual class. Response time may be a concern for discussion-based questions, but it is not necessarily a drawback. Open-ended questioning is not inappropriate for a virtual class, and personal commentary can be beneficial in creating a more engaging and interactive learning environment.","comment_id":"836742","timestamp":"1726114020.0","poster":"JimGrayham","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/102385-exam-tk0-201-topic-4-question-98-discussion/"},{"id":"0kzulofkoj7Fqckl41bg","answers_community":[],"topic":"5","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Should be E, F","timestamp":"1727549340.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1020164","poster":"koffeebrown"}],"unix_timestamp":1695926940,"timestamp":"2023-09-28 20:49:00","choices":{"A":"Give the students a break to absorb the information.","D":"Generate a skills inventory on the next subject.","F":"Ask probing questions to select students.","E":"Perform a teach-back through role play.","B":"Watch for non-verbal communication from the students.","C":"Create a hypothetical scenario."},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"After completing instruction on a topic, which of the following tasks would the instructor perform to evaluate learner retention?
