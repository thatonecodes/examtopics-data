This means that the previously issued token, which does not require MFA, remains valid even after the user has changed locations. As a result, the users can log in without going through the MFA process, violating the policy set by the application.\n\nThe IP address is a common factor used to identify the location of the user. When a user's IP address changes significantly, it indicates a change in location. In this case, the application should have mechanisms in place to detect such changes and invalidate the existing token, requiring the user to reauthenticate and complete the MFA process for security purposes.","timestamp":"1684519020.0","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","upvote_count":"15"},{"poster":"Ranaer","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI believe A is straight up wrong.

It is commonly used in conjunction with FDE solutions to protect data on laptops and other devices.\n\nFDE works by encrypting the entire contents of a disk, including the operating system, applications, and user data. When a device is powered on, FDE requires authentication, typically through a pre-boot authentication process, to unlock the encrypted disk and allow the operating system to boot.\n\nTPM plays a crucial role in FDE by securely storing encryption keys and providing hardware-based security features.

It offers several features that align with the specified security requirements:\n\nLogging: TACACS+ supports extensive logging capabilities, allowing all actions performed by the network staff to be logged. This helps with audit trails, monitoring, and forensic analysis.\n\nPer-command permissions: TACACS+ provides granular control over access permissions, including per-command permissions. This means that administrators can define specific permissions for each command or operation that network staff can perform. It offers fine-grained access control for network devices.\n\nTCP communication: TACACS+ is designed to work over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which satisfies the requirement for communication between the authentication server and the network devices.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1684519740.0","comment_id":"902169","upvote_count":"18","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","content":"Option A: Kerberos is a network authentication protocol primarily used in Windows environments.
