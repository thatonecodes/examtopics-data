Reseat the RAM.\n\nThe symptoms described (three beeps and a black screen) are typically indicative of a RAM issue. The three beeps usually indicate a memory error, and the black screen suggests that the computer is not able to boot properly. Reseating the RAM (removing and reinserting it) may resolve the issue.\n\nHere's why the other options are not the best choice:\n\nA. Replacing the power supply may not address the specific issue, and it's unlikely that the power supply is causing the memory error.\n\nC. Reattaching the hard drive may not be relevant to the issue, as the computer is not booting far enough to access the hard drive.\n\nD. Flashing the BIOS may not resolve the issue, and it's a more complex process that should be attempted only if other troubleshooting steps have been exhausted.\n\nBy reseating the RAM, the analyst can potentially resolve the memory error and get the computer booting properly again.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715124840.0","content":"Sorry, that comment was meant for question #349","poster":"Farticus","comment_id":"1065277"},{"comment_id":"1059935","poster":"TrebleSmith","timestamp":"1714575960.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\n3 beeps typically means there is a memory problem.
