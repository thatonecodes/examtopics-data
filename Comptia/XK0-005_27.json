The sticky bit is a property of a directory, not a file. When a sticky bit is set on a directory, it affects the behavior of file deletion within that directory. A file within a directory with a sticky bit set cannot be deleted by a user who does not have write permissions to the directory, regardless of the permissions on the file itself. Therefore, to remove a sticky bit, you need to use the path to the directory for which you want to remove the sticky bit, not a file within the directory.","comment_id":"806758"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is D. chmod -t files","timestamp":"1723832760.0","comment_id":"982868","poster":"Alizadeh","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1698759780.0","comment_id":"708442","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","poster":"ryanzou"},{"timestamp":"1697894100.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"700948","poster":"Aamm033","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct the directory has Sticky bit on. in the first ls -ld you can see the \"t\" instead of an \"x\""}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-10-21 15:15:00","question_id":131,"exam_id":371,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1666358100},{"id":"acFWaRTzteftHaun2tsc","timestamp":"2024-08-20 04:21:00","question_text":"Which of the following actions are considered good security practices when hardening a Linux server?

With *LOCK* in the password field, it means that nobody can log into the system as root user using a password. If the root account was configured for other authentication methods, like SSH keys or certificates, they could do so that way. That alone would not prevent regular users the ability to run \"sudo\", if they are configured properly in /etc/sudoers. That is because \"sudo\" uses the user's password, not the root password.\n\nBut, the sudoers file is misconfigured, maybe someone tried editing it directly with \"vim\" rather than \"visudo\" and broke it. Now it seems that nobody can perform sudo and nobody can log in as root (thus, no permission to fix the sudoers file). A good course of action is to boot into single user mode, which would allow root access to a simplified system without a password, and fix the syntax error.","timestamp":"1724078100.0","comment_id":"1154114","poster":"makuziker"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":133,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1708360500},{"id":"ImntliN3nk9rB9VCNTS8","question_text":"Users are experiencing high latency when accessing a web application served by a Linux machine.

This is the most immediate and clear reason why there would be high latency or no connectivity at all.
