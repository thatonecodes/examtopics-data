The \"-n\" option is used to display the output in integer form, rather than resolving IP addresses and port numbers to their hostnames. This command will display all active connections, and the output will include the protocol, local and remote IP addresses, and the state of the connection.\n\nThe command \"netstat -n\" will display the same information as \"netstat\" but it shows the numerical IP addresses and port numbers instead of resolving them to hostnames. This can be useful for troubleshooting and performance monitoring, as it can be faster to process the numerical output.\n\n\"netstat -a\" shows the status of all sockets, \"netstat -e\" shows detailed information of the network interfaces.
