This allows for the NICs to work in tandem and provide redundancy in case one of the NICs fails or experiences issues. If one NIC fails, the other NIC can continue to handle the network traffic, which helps to ensure that the server remains connected to the network and available.\n\nWhile other components listed may have redundancy options or configurations, they do not provide network redundancy in pairs on a server. MRU (Maximum Receive Unit) is a networking term that refers to the largest size of a packet that can be received on a network interface. SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is a protocol used for securely transferring files between systems. DLP (Data Loss Prevention) is a strategy or technology used to prevent the loss or theft of sensitive data. CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a hardware component that processes instructions in a computer.","poster":"gingasaurusrex"},{"comment_id":"816970","upvote_count":"2","poster":"fionni92","timestamp":"1692634200.0","content":"Selected Answer: E\nNIC Teaming."},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Obi_Wan_Jacoby","content":"Selected Answer: E\nAnswer is E.

The scope is not configured properly. The scope of a GPO determines which objects (such as users or computers) it applies to. Since the GPO is working as expected in the accounting OU but not in the sales OU, and there's no mention of security groups filtering being used, it suggests that the GPO may not be linked to the sales OU or the link is not active.

Check the firewall rules.\n\nYes, the server worked before the patch, but we have no indication what kind of patch it was. This is a troubleshooting question. So follow the process. You don't just jump straight to remove the patch without investigating possible causes.\nIt doesn't say \"change\" the firewall rules, it says \"Check\" the firewall rules. This is a low effort step that will yield information, even if nothing has changed. Assume host based firewall on the server could have been modified by the patch.
