RG-6 is the type of cabling that the cable company is most likely to use from the demarcation point back to the central office.\n\nRG-6 (Radio Guide 6) is a type of coaxial cable that is commonly used for cable TV and broadband Internet service. It is capable of carrying high-frequency signals over long distances and it has a thicker insulation and shielding than other types of coaxial cable. This makes it less susceptible to interference from other sources and better able to maintain signal quality over long distances.

The network gateway is configured to send router advertisements.\n\nThe network administrator should verify that the network gateway is configured to send router advertisements (RA) for SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) to work properly. RA's are used to advertise the network prefix and other information, such as the default gateway, to the hosts on the LAN. Without these advertisements, the hosts will not be able to autoconfigure their IP addresses.\n\nB. A DHCP server is present on the same broadcast domain as the clients.\n\nA DHCP server is not required for SLAAC to work. SLAAC uses the network prefix advertised by the router to generate an IP address for the host. DHCP is used for DHCPv4 only.\n\nC. The devices support dual stack on the network layer.\n\nIt's not necessary that all devices should support dual stack on the network layer. They should support IPv6 stack on their own.\n\nD.
