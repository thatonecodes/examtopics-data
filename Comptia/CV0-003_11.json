RAID 10 combines the benefits of RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping) to provide both redundancy and improved performance. With RAID 10, data is mirrored across multiple drives for redundancy, and then the mirrored sets are striped for performance. This configuration provides good performance and fault tolerance, while maximizing the available storage space.

In this setup, data is split across multiple disks and two sets of redundant data are stored. This means that if two disks fail, the data can still be reconstructed.\n\nCompared to RAID 5, RAID 6 provides better data redundancy and can sustain the failure of two disks, but at the cost of some additional disk space being reserved for data redundancy.\n\nIf data redundancy is not a major concern and maximizing storage is the priority, RAID 0 or RAID 10 would be more appropriate.
