The process involves analyzing the source code for potential vulnerabilities or issues without executing it. This allows for the identification of issues early on in the development process, before the application is compiled and deployed.\n\nPerforming static code analysis on the compiled code can also be done but typically is less effective as it is harder to analyze the code as it loses some of its original structure and also the scanner won't be able to see the potential vulnerabilities that might have been introduced by the developers during the coding process.\n\nIt is important to note that static code analysis is just one step in the software development life cycle (SDLC) and should be integrated with other security testing methodologies like dynamic analysis, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning to provide comprehensive security testing of an application."},{"poster":"Frog_Man","timestamp":"1671393360.0","content":"Static analysis is done before the code is compiled - by definition.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"749137"},{"poster":"bob12356","timestamp":"1670972340.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis type of analysis is performed before the application is installed and active on a system, and it involves examining the code without actually executing it in order to identify potential vulnerabilities or security risks.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"744522"},{"comment_id":"744322","timestamp":"1670953260.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nthe answer is B , the already said in web application not a system","poster":"sho123","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nStatic code analysis examines the source code of an application.
