Think of the DNS cache as a list of addresses you frequent and an important tool for having a fast and healthy internet connection. This cache can be corrupted by a variety of factors (Including virus issues). Flushing it is similar to resetting RAM, it forgets everything and starts fresh. On a network with tons of DNS issues, this is a quick possible solution. DNS knowledge is very important for understanding networking, take sometime and make it second-nature. Also memorize key DNS numbers (For your job). They sometimes have appeared on CompTIA style exams but it's also really useful for testing. DNS servers like 8.8.8.8 (Public Google) allow you to test different combinations, go around ISP restrictions, and even access restricted content. It's important to understand why DNS routing is a useful tool.","timestamp":"1574691480.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1611764280.0","content":"So what is the correct answer then?","comment_id":"277925","poster":"Berto","upvote_count":"2","comments":[]}],"poster":"MrCompTIA","comment_id":"24290"}],"topic":"1","question_id":281,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04179/0001000002.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04179/0001100001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04179/0001200001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04179/0001300001.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/9061-exam-220-1001-topic-1-question-4-discussion/","answers_community":[]},{"id":"oZpRYoSdhmSJF7gc5aoT","question_images":[],"question_text":"An end user has signed up to use a web-based calendar application.\nWhich of the following solutions has the user purchased?","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1592444040,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"PaaS","B":"SaaS","A":"DaaS","D":"IaaS"},"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/23406-exam-220-1001-topic-1-question-40-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"648076","timestamp":"1660739400.0","content":"Correct answer is B) SaaS\nFrom the official CompTIA study guide:\nIaaS - Infrastructure as a Service requires the most network management expertise from a client.
