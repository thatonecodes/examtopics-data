Controllers will not validate the origin of commands\n\nThe assumption that controllers will not validate the origin of commands is most likely to be valid. Many legacy industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are not designed with security in mind and lack basic security features such as authentication and access controls. As a result, it is common for these systems to accept commands from any source without verifying their origin. This makes them vulnerable to attacks such as command injection, which can be used to disrupt or damage the systems they control.\n\nOption A & D are likely to be invalid assumptions, many PLCs can act upon commands injected over the network and supervisory systems can detect malicious injection of code/commands if properly configured.\n\nOption B is also likely to be invalid as it is not a common practice, usually, the supervisory systems and PLCs are connected to the same network, and separating them would require additional hardware and configuration steps."},{"comment_id":"1058910","timestamp":"1730385120.0","poster":"Alizade","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe MOST likely valid assumption made by the penetration-testing team is that Controllers will not validate the origin of commands.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728273120.0","comment_id":"1027068","poster":"elenakamba","content":"it should be B."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt is likely that the controllers (such as PLCs) in a manufacturing plant's cyber-physical systems are not designed to validate the origin of commands received over the network. This means that they may not have the necessary security measures in place to prevent malicious commands from being injected over the network and executed. In contrast, it is less likely that the supervisory systems or PLCs would act upon commands injected over the network, or that the supervisory systems would detect a malicious injection of code/commands. It is also possible that the supervisory systems and controllers are on separate virtual networks, but this cannot be assumed without further information.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1702935180.0","poster":"Mr_BuCk3th34D","comment_id":"749206"}],"answer_description":"","question_id":411,"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1671399180,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-12-18 22:33:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/92024-exam-pt0-002-topic-1-question-68-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":362,"choices":{"C":"Controllers will not validate the origin of commands.","A":"PLCs will not act upon commands injected over the network.","D":"Supervisory systems will detect a malicious injection of code/commands.","B":"Supervisors and controllers are on a separate virtual network by default."},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A company hired a penetration-testing team to review the cyber-physical systems in a manufacturing plant.

Whether sensitive client data is publicly accessible\n\nWhen assessing the security of hosted data in a cloud environment, the first thing that should be verified is whether sensitive client data is publicly accessible. This includes checking for any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthorized person to access the data. This could be accomplished by performing web application scans, network scans, and manual testing to check for any vulnerabilities that could allow for data exfiltration or unauthorized access.\n\nIt's also important to check whether the connection between the cloud and the client is secure, whether the client's employees are trained properly to use the platform, and whether the cloud applications were developed using a secure SDLC, but verifying whether sensitive client data is publicly accessible should be the primary focus.","poster":"RRabbit_111","timestamp":"1674005340.0","comment_id":"779482","upvote_count":"10"},{"comment_id":"698684","timestamp":"1666156800.0","poster":"petercorn","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A as question is asking 'data'"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1737153120.0","poster":"DoomChicken","comment_id":"1342362","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA would be your first step to see if there is any security at all on the hosted data itself.
