The salt is unique for each user, so even if two users have the same password, their hashed passwords will be different due to the unique salts. This makes it extremely difficult for attackers to precompute rainbow tables or use precomputed tables effectively since they would need to generate and store tables for every possible combination of salt and password.","comment_id":"925376","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","timestamp":"1686932700.0"},{"timestamp":"1685532600.0","poster":"EduSantos","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"911162","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSalting is a concept that typically pertains to password hashing."},{"timestamp":"1676151660.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"rf18","comment_id":"805696","content":"Selected Answer: B\nsalting"},{"comment_id":"805446","timestamp":"1676135580.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Jibz18","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - Salting"},{"timestamp":"1676135520.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"805445","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSalting is the correct answer","poster":"seagnull"}],"timestamp":"2023-02-07 21:50:00","exam_id":367,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98361-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-398-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1675803000,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[]},{"id":"sAP1FFVGFpXy9hyAjYaB","question_id":332,"timestamp":"2023-02-07 21:50:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98362-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-399-discussion/","exam_id":367,"question_text":"A company wants to deploy PKI on its internet-facing website.
