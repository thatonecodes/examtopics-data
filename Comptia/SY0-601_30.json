Messer's notes: \"Rainbow tables won’t work with salted hashes\""},{"timestamp":"1690128000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSalting is a technique used to eliminate the use of precomputed tables like rainbow tables for password cracking. When passwords are stored in a database, a unique random value known as a salt is generated and appended to each password before hashing. This salt value makes each hashed password unique, even if two users have the same password. As a result, rainbow tables, which are precomputed tables of hash values for commonly used passwords, become ineffective because the same password will have different hash values due to the presence of different salts.\n\nBy using salting, even if an attacker gains access to the hashed passwords, they cannot easily reverse-engineer the original passwords using precomputed tables, significantly improving the security of stored passwords.","upvote_count":"6","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","comment_id":"960606"},{"comment_id":"1157489","poster":"TM78","timestamp":"1708720920.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Salt and Rainbows.

While it can enhance security in certain contexts, it’s not directly related to password cracking and doesn’t prevent rainbow table attacks.\n\nAsymmetric encryption: Asymmetric encryption involves using a pair of keys (public and private) to encrypt and decrypt data.
