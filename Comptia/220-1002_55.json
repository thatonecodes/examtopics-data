One example of a MITM attack is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. Spoofing is often used as a method of injecting the attacker into the conversation path between the two parties."},{"content":"Man-in-the-Middle Attack\nA Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is another specific type of spoofing attack where the attacker sits between two communicating hosts and transparently monitors, captures, and relays all communication between them.
