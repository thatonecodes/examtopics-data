It's asking about encrypting the devices (phones), not the data the are sending over the network. Encrypting the data on a device itself is done using symmetric encryption.\n\nEliptic curve (ECC) is asymmetric. It's a useful because it's efficient and requires less processing/power. It's used by mobile phones and other low power devices for *communication* over a network, but not for encrypting device storage.\n\nOne-time pad you basically use only once to encrypt / decrypt. This is good at achieving forward secrecy in communication, but is not efficient. The key size is the same as the input data. It would not be appropriate to sustain encryption on a mobile device.\n\n3DES and AES are symmetric encryption algorithms. AES-256 is much more secure. D (AES) is the best choice.","comment_id":"635358","timestamp":"1658520900.0","poster":"ekafasti","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"We are taking about encryotion not military contract.Answer is A because smart phones doesn't requires high CPU cycle like desk top and also interms of battery life Eleptic curve stay longer with out being attacked in the back door so we ECC is the best choose\nPleade read this\n\n\nOkay, first of all ECC are not meant to encrypt files. For two reasons, they can have a back-door, completely untraceable and they are also really slow and are asymmetric, meaning, they can’t be deciphered, atleast not with the computing power we have. By Quantum Computer, maybe it can be. But that’s still very far away.\n\nAES, is meant to cipher texts and other inputs that can be ultimately converted into binary… obviously but are also needed to be converted back into original text. But one thing to keep in mind is that it requires hardware acceleration.\n\nSo a common and even an algorithm which Google and other sites use is CHACHA20-POLY1305. Its 3 times faster than AES and can run on mobiles with really less computing power and provides an equivalent encryption strength.\n\nTo sum up, ECC with combination of DHE is mostly preferred for Public Key Pairing.
