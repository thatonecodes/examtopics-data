UAC (User Account Control)**.\n\nUAC is a security feature in Windows that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the system. It does this by asking for permission or an administrator's credentials before allowing actions that could potentially affect the system's operation or that change settings that affect other users. If the user is trying to run a client/server application that requires administrative privileges, UAC could be prompting for the username and password. The other options (EFS, NTFS, UTP) are not directly related to the scenario described. EFS (Encrypting File System) and NTFS (New Technology File System) are related to file systems, and UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) is a type of cabling used in networking. None of these would typically cause a prompt for a username and password when running an application.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mamad66","comment_id":"1191450","timestamp":"1712562480.0"},{"timestamp":"1643330820.0","comment_id":"534231","upvote_count":"4","poster":"lance12","content":"I'm not sure about this but UAC [User Access Control] is one of things that stops a user from accessing certain programs/data, so it makes sense that UAC is preventing you from doing stuff"}],"timestamp":"2022-01-28 01:47:00","exam_id":338,"choices":{"C":"UTP","A":"EFS","D":"UAC","B":"NTFS"}},{"id":"9CZH2g0wR1CbiEauISYw","question_text":"A technician is working on a computer that has the following symptoms:\n* Unable to access the Internet\n* Unable to send email\n* Network connection (limited or no connectivity)\nThe technician runs hardware diagnostics on the computer and verifies the computer's NIC is functioning correctly.
