This typically involves combining something the user knows (such as a password or PIN) with something the user has (such as a physical token or a mobile device) or something the user is (such as biometric data like a fingerprint or facial recognition). By implementing MFA, even if an attacker manages to obtain a user's password or credentials, they would still need access to the additional factor to successfully authenticate and access the data.","comment_id":"935815","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI agree that A would protected user's data internally and externally because PAM would manage what privileged users can do with data","timestamp":"1682435280.0","poster":"Simpbizkit","comment_id":"880555"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1682258160.0","poster":"kiduuu","comment_id":"878429","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn this case, implementing MFA for accessing sensitive data can help prevent unauthorized access even if the attacker manages to bypass other security measures.

The principle of least privilege is widely considered to be a cybersecurity best practice and is a fundamental step in protecting privileged access to high-value data and assets. By enforcing the principle of least privilege, organizations can reduce the attack surface and mitigate the risk from malicious insiders or external cyber attacks that can lead to costly data breaches.
