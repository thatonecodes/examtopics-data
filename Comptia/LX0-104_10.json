It is used to ensure that all devices on a network have the same time and date, and is widely used for maintaining accurate time on servers, workstations, and other networked devices. NTP works by obtaining time from one or more sources, and then distributing it to other devices on the network. This allows devices to maintain accurate time, even in the presence of network delays or other factors that could cause the time on different devices to drift apart. NTP is designed to be scalable and reliable, making it well-suited for use in large and complex network environments.","comment_id":"804501"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_text":"What is NTP?","question_images":[]},{"id":"K7PxqyRFGydETnI2yw67","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"B.

This can be especially useful in cases where one server may be providing an incorrect time.\n\nLoad balancing: Maintaining multiple connections to NTP servers can help distribute the load among the servers and reduce the impact of any one server being overwhelmed with too many requests.\n\nNetwork diversity: Connecting to NTP servers in different geographic locations can help ensure that the client is receiving accurate time information, even if there are network outages or other issues in one location.\n\nOverall, maintaining multiple NTP server connections helps increase the reliability and accuracy of time synchronization for an NTP client.","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1676043360.0"}]},{"id":"EEL3c6a0Exvr7MJCTpjY","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98725-exam-lx0-104-topic-4-question-9-discussion/","question_id":50,"question_text":"With syslog, what is a facility?","timestamp":"2023-02-10 16:38:00","answer":"E","answer_ET":"E","answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"4","choices":{"E":"Facilities describe categories or groups of messages such as mail or auth.","D":"When using remote logging, the hostname of the server that generated a message is called facility.","C":"Facilities describe the severity of a log message such as emerg or info.","B":"From syslog's point of view, each Unix process that issues messages is a facility.","A":"Facilities are different connection interfaces to syslog.

The facility is a code that is included in each syslog message to indicate which type of system component or process generated the message.\n\nThere are several standard facilities defined in the syslog protocol, including:\n\nauth: used for messages related to authentication and authorization.\n\ncron: used for messages generated by the cron job scheduler.\n\ndaemon: used for messages generated by system daemons.\n\nkern: used for messages generated by the kernel.\n\nlocal0 through local7: reserved for local use by the administrator.\n\nEach facility provides a different level of severity or importance, which is indicated by the log level. For example, an emergency log message would be indicated with a high severity, while an informational message would be indicated with a lower severity.\n\nThe facility code helps system administrators to quickly identify the source and purpose of each log message, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues on the system."}]}],"exam":{"id":354,"provider":"Comptia","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"name":"LX0-104","isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":99,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":10},"__N_SSP":true}
