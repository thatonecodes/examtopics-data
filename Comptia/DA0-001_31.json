It is structured in nature. This is because a relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. A relational database is structured in nature, which means that the data has a predefined schema or format, and follows certain rules and constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, or referential integrity. A relational database can be used to store, query, and manipulate data using a structured query language (SQL).

Data encryption\nE. Data masking\n\nData encryption involves transforming the data into an unreadable format so that it cannot be understood without the appropriate decryption key. This protects the data from being intercepted or viewed by unauthorized parties during transmission.\n\nData masking involves obscuring sensitive data elements by replacing them with non-sensitive values. This allows the data to be used for testing, development, and reporting purposes without compromising its confidentiality. Data masking also helps to mitigate the risk of data leaks, since the sensitive information is not accessible to unauthorized parties.\n\nBy using both encryption and masking, the chance of a data leak occurring during transmission can be significantly reduced, as the data is protected both in transit and at rest.","poster":"ronniehaang","upvote_count":"5"},{"content":"Selected Answer: DE\nsince it says to choose two, both D and E are answers.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1364049","timestamp":"1740934560.0","poster":"daksa"},{"timestamp":"1719892500.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"763523","content":"Data encryption and data masking are both methods that can be used to protect data when it is transmitted.
