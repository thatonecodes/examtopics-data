Movement could disrupt airflow or cause components such as fans or heat sinks to become dislodged, leading to overheating and subsequent shutdowns. Therefore, system overheating is the most probable cause of the issue.\n\nNot C Distended capacitors\nDistended or swollen capacitors on the motherboard can indeed cause various issues, including unexpected shutdowns. However, the symptoms described in the scenario—shutdowns occurring only when the laptop is moved from one room to another—do not directly suggest a problem with the capacitors. While distended capacitors can lead to system instability and malfunctions, the symptoms described are more indicative of a mechanical issue related to movement, such as system overheating. Therefore, while distended capacitors could be a potential cause of the issue, it is less likely than system overheating based on the provided information.","comment_id":"1147648","timestamp":"1707683160.0"},{"poster":"vshaagar","timestamp":"1705020660.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt can't be a loose battery connection because it is already reseated. it is the distended capacitors when they move from one room to the other it might cause the electrical flow and shutdowns.","comment_id":"1120317"},{"content":"Question uses the term \"shutdown\" implying that the laptop goes into the shut down process.
