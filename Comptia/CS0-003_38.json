Patch testing should primarily involve testing a patch on a single isolated system to determine whether a patch causes problems, such as software crashes or system instability. Additionally, testing should validate that issues addressed by the software patch work as expected—for example, a patch successfully removes a vulnerability. A common way to test a patch is by setting up a non-production environment hosting like-for-like mission-critical applications, including enterprise applications and networking systems (where available).
