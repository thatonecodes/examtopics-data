Establish baseline metrics.\n\nExplanation:\n\nEstablishing baseline metrics is the first step in improving network monitoring. A baseline represents the normal operating performance of the network, such as traffic patterns, bandwidth usage, and response times. By understanding what \"normal\" looks like, the administrator can more easily identify anomalies or performance issues when monitoring the network in the future.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1736182620.0"}],"exam_id":358,"unix_timestamp":1736182620,"question_id":56,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A network administrator needs to improve network monitoring.

Increase the scope size.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe issue is likely related to a shortage of available IP addresses in the DHCP scope. As more students arrive on campus, the demand for IP addresses increases. If the DHCP server’s scope (the range of IP addresses it can assign) is too small to accommodate all the devices, the server will not be able to assign IP addresses to new users. Increasing the DHCP scope size will allow the server to allocate more IP addresses, resolving the issue."},{"poster":"HeatSquad77","timestamp":"1735583100.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMore student came back to school so increasing the scope size of Ip addresses will help student connect to the network","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1334329"}],"choices":{"A":"Enable IP helper.","D":"Add address exclusions.","C":"Increase the scope size.","B":"Change the subnet mask."},"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153673-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-150-discussion/","exam_id":358,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"A network administrator is troubleshooting issues with a DHCP server at a university.

Wrong VLAN assignment\n\nHere’s why:\n\nThe user can access the internet (which likely requires external routing via a gateway) and can print (which could be local or via a networked printer in the same VLAN), but is unable to access server resources. This suggests the user has network connectivity but is possibly on the wrong VLAN.\nServer resources are often restricted to specific VLANs, so if the user was moved to a port associated with a different VLAN, their device may no longer be able to reach the servers, especially if those resources are in a separate VLAN or subnet."}],"choices":{"D":"Duplicate IP address","A":"Incorrect default gateway","C":"Error-disabled port","B":"Wrong VLAN assignment"},"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/154517-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-152-discussion/","exam_id":358,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"A user recently moved a workstation to a different part of the office.
