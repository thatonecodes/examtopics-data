The influx of SPIM messages can degrade the quality of VoIP calls, overload servers, and serve as a platform for social engineering attacks, jeopardizing the security of VoIP users. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement spam filters, intrusion detection systems, and regular software updates while also educating users to recognize and avoid potential threats associated with SPIM.","upvote_count":"12","poster":"wakkaking14"},{"comment_id":"1075095","timestamp":"1700449440.0","upvote_count":"8","poster":"EMP00000000","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nThis is another repeat question but with slightly different options listed. \nhttps://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/78835-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-23-discussion/\n\nSPIM and VISHING are listed as the answer on both."},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1210449","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nSPIT is the specific terminology for Spam Over Internet Telephony.
