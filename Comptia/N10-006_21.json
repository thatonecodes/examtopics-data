You cannot mix and match different types of cable. For example, if you connect single mode fiber to multimode fiber, you will introduce a catastrophic signal loss of up to 99%. Even connecting cables of the same type that have different core diameters can cause a loss of up to 50% of the signal strength.'","poster":"mad"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"6","answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","question_images":[],"question_id":101,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":355,"choices":{"B":"Wavelength mismatch","D":"EMI","E":"Macro bend","C":"cross-talk","A":"Distance limitation"},"unix_timestamp":1562492340},{"id":"ZDtRBHIj7ywUlKHRAosC","exam_id":355,"question_id":102,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1562492520,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-07-07 11:42:00","answer_ET":"Explanation","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1616422920.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"317228","content":"Frequency Theoretical Speed Real-World Speed\n2.4 GHz (802.11n) 300 Mpbs 150 Mbps\n5 GHz (802.11a) 6-54 Mbps 3 - 32 Mbps\n5 GHz (802.11ac) 433 Mbps - 1.7 Gbps 210 Mbps - 1 G\n5 GHz (802.11n) 900 Mbps 450Mbps","poster":"ade2901296"},{"timestamp":"1562492520.0","comment_id":"3659","content":"802.11n AB is not a standard.

In very simple terms it encompasses protection services abiding to all 3 main areas (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication - Not to be confused with the CIA triad*).\n\nSHA is classified as a hash function. Simply put:\n\n'Hash functions are the building blocks for modern cryptography. A hash function is a cryptographic algorithm which is used to transform large random size data to small fixed size data.'\n\nHence, it provides integrity as the process is a 'one way street'. More can be read via link below.\n\nIn short, SHA would answer the question more accurately as it does one simple job: integrity, unlike IPSec, which as mentioned earlier is a suite that includes integrity.\n\nhttp://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=24833&seqNum=3\n\nhttps://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/differences-between-hash-functions-symmetric-asymmetric-algorithms\n\n*\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cissp-for-dummies/9781118417102/a2_13_9781118362396-ch08.html"}],"unix_timestamp":1562573280,"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"question_text":"Which of the following integrity security mechanisms ensures that a sent message has been received intact, by the intended receiver?","timestamp":"2019-07-08 10:08:00","exam_id":355},{"id":"3ki6dS31GeI3UPGXAtjh","answer_ET":"","discussion":[{"content":"Why we use stright through cable between a hub and switch?","comment_id":"304234","comments":[{"poster":"welly123","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1618936620.0","comment_id":"339726","content":"agreed, hub to switch should be a crossover."}],"poster":"Hajar","timestamp":"1614957120.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Tricky question as a Console port on a Cisco device uses a rollover RJ45 to RS232 cable.
