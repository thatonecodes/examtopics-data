Password spraying is a type of brute-force attack that uses a single password (in this case, 123change) and tries it against multiple usernames. The objective is to identify accounts that are still using the temporary password.\n\nOption A (Brute-force attack) is a general term used to describe attacks that involve trying multiple passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing the correct one. Password spraying is a type of brute-force attack.\n\nOption B (LDAP injection) is an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) implementations to execute unauthorized queries or commands. This technique is not related to password spraying.\n\nOption D (Kerberoasting) is an attack that targets Kerberos authentication protocol to extract service account credentials from Active Directory domain controllers. This technique is not related to password spraying."}]},{"id":"Ux8pfhW4NfPWCNveQGfm","answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","choices":{"D":"Private code repositories associated with a developer who previously worked for the target company","B":"Public code repositories associated with the target company's organization","A":"Public code repositories associated with a developer who previously worked for the target company","C":"Private code repositories associated with the target company's organization"},"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":362,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (83%)","A (17%)"],"question_text":"A penetration tester is conducting an unknown environment test and gathering additional information that can be used for later stages of an assessment.\n\nWhich of the following would most likely produce useful information for additional testing?","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/125045-exam-pt0-002-topic-1-question-276-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-10-31 15:50:00","topic":"1","question_id":197,"unix_timestamp":1698763800,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1720197780.0","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
