The cable modem is interfaced to the local router via an RJ45 port and with the access provider's network by a short segment of coax terminated using threaded F-type connectors. More coax then links all the premises in a street with a cable modem termination system (CMTS), which forwards data traffic via the fiber backbone to the ISP's point of presence and from there to the internet.\n\nMight have to read the question carefully. \n\"connecting a cable modem TO a SOHO router\"\nCoaxial line is only to DSL to modem.
