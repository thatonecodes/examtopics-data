Yes storage space is a concern. However, offsite backups generally dont mean you get another data center and use it for backups. In most cases, offsite refers to the cloud. For a ransomware target, its getting more common for them to infect the whole network, and its likely backups will be affected as well. Cloud storage is also very cheap if you only need to backup a few files. GFS has offsite backups, but at least some are on site, and that's more prone to ransomware and uses more storage (Otherwise whats the point of the generations?)
