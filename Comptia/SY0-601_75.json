The user-agent string is a piece of information that is sent along with an HTTP request and identifies the type and version of the web browser or client being used. By spoofing the user-agent string, an attacker can trick a web server into thinking that a request is coming from a different browser or client than the one that is actually being used.\n\nUser-agent spoofing can be used by attackers to evade detection and bypass security controls, such as web application firewalls (WAFs) or content filtering systems. For example, an attacker could send a request with a user-agent string that matches that of a known and trusted browser or client, in order to avoid being blocked or flagged as suspicious by a WAF or content filtering system. Alternatively, an attacker could send a request with a user-agent string that appears to come from a mobile device, in order to bypass security controls that are designed to block requests from desktop browsers.","comment_id":"898424"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"fouserd","timestamp":"1683552720.0","comment_id":"892204","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe most likely cause of the security control bypass in this scenario is User-agent spoofing.
