For example, an outdated firmware version might have security flaws that can be exploited, affecting the hardware's security posture. Firmware vulnerabilities are intrinsically tied to the hardware on which they run, making them hardware-specific. An outdated or improperly secured firmware version can introduce vulnerabilities unique to that hardware platform.","comment_id":"1259521","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722536940.0","poster":"dbrowndiver"},{"poster":"Zach123654","comment_id":"1244417","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1720450020.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGPT!!!"},{"timestamp":"1715936640.0","comment_id":"1212807","content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe firmware version (option A) is directly related to the hardware and represents a potential point of vulnerability that attackers could exploit.

MDM (Mobile Device Management)\n\nExplanation:\nMDM solutions allow organizations to enforce application policies on personal devices (as part of a BYOD policy). With MDM, the company can ensure that only approved applications are installed and used for work purposes. MDM provides application control, policy enforcement, and device monitoring to maintain security while allowing personal devices.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nB.

Containerization\n\nExplanation:\nContainerization allows companies to create a secure, isolated environment on employees' personal devices, in which only approved company applications can be installed and used. This ensures that work-related data and applications are separated from personal apps and data, providing a layer of control while still allowing employees to use their own devices. With containerization, the company can enforce security policies, such as allowing only approved applications within the container, and preventing unauthorized apps from being installed.","timestamp":"1735506960.0","poster":"jbmac"}],"answers_community":["A (53%)","B (47%)"],"timestamp":"2024-12-29 22:16:00","exam_id":368,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1735506960},{"id":"uaDBMz9VZ2gXwnVRplqL","question_id":425,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153396-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-482-discussion/","answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1735062540.0","poster":"ojones888","comment_id":"1331202","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA compensating control is a security measure implemented to mitigate risk when the primary control (such as a patch for a zero-day exploit) is not available or cannot be applied immediately."}],"question_text":"An alert references attacks associated with a zero-day exploit.
