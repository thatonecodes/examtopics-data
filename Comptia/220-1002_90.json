Server then opens a backdoor(a layer 4) TCP port on the victims machine. This server can be designed in way to brute force open a port on HIPS(host based firewalls etc)(windows firewall for example). \n\nOnce the server opens this port on victims node, it listens to the socket(IP:port) on the local system(victim). \n\nThe client side of the trojan controlled by the attacker, makes connection to the server.

Rootkit :\nRootkit is a set of application, a type of malware that is designed to infect a target PC and allow an attacker to install a set of tools that grant him persistent remote access to the computer. The malware typically pretended itself as normal files that “hide in plain sight” so your antivirus software overlooks them. It enables administrator-level access to a computer or computer network. The motive is to steal the identity information from your computer, often to gain control of a system. It is difficult to detect and remove, requires the specialized tools to remove.\n\n2. Trojan Horse :\nTrojan Horse is also a type of malware which uses false and fake name for mislead users from its true intent and executing them. Trojan Horses generally install on the system as legitimate and useful software that can give unauthorized access and control of the system to the hackers.

A calculator program that works that has also been infected, is a trojan. You might never know that you have been infected because the program you ran works as intended.\n\n\"Rootkit\" has to do with where the malware resides on the system.
