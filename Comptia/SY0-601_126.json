Then, leveraging a forensic workstation, utilize the dd command in a live Linux environment to create a duplicate copy.\n\nThis option reflects the correct approach to creating a forensic copy of a hard drive. By using a write blocker, you ensure that no data is written to the original drive during the copying process, which might change the drive's state and potentially destroy evidence, contradicting the main principle of digital forensic analysisâ€”to cause as little change as possible to the original data.\n\nAnswer A could change data on the disk while changing the hard drive, compromising the integrity of the data. Answer C is not a valid process since the hard drive needs to be connected to a forensic workstation with a write blocker, not merely copying the files.

Also, data is lost for good if the Uncorrectable Read Error (URE) occurs in RAID 5.\n\nIn all, RAID 10 is your choice when you want to recover quickly from a disk failure without impacting existing operations.","poster":"NOEY18","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"\"itâ€™s not possible to recover data when two or more disks fail at the same time in RAID 10\"\n\nThis is not true, depending on the scenario.\nRAID 10 is a stripe of mirrors. Therefore you can lose multiple drives without data loss or speed loss as long as the failed drives are not from the same mirrored pair. Four disks = two pairs of mirrored drives, striped together. Each time you add two drives to RAID 10 you've added another mirrored pair into the striping set. So if you have six drives, you could theoretically lose up to 3 drives without a performance impact or data loss as long as no single mirrored pair went down together.\nRAID 5 is less resilient than that and will stop working if more than one drive fails, regardless of the number of disks in the array.
