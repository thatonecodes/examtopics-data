Two-tier → Requires both a client (workstation) and a server (database/server application) to function. Example: A workstation running an application that connects to a remote database.\nC. Three-tier → Involves three separate layers:\nPresentation Layer (User Interface - Client)\nApplication Layer (Business Logic - Server)\nData Layer (Database - Database Server)\nD. n-tier → Expands beyond three tiers, commonly used in cloud-based or enterprise applications with multiple layers (e.g., web servers, application servers, database servers).","comment_id":"1359278","timestamp":"1740060360.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"15ef0b6","comment_id":"1232022","content":"I have no idea what this means either","timestamp":"1718641740.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1203315","content":"Can Someone explain this","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714257360.0","poster":"RoBery"}],"answer":"A","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"n-tier","B":"Two-tier","A":"One-tier","C":"Three-tier"},"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1714257360,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/139711-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-122-discussion/","question_text":"A company has installed an application that only requires a workstation to function.

Integer\nExplanation:\nSince the age variable represents a countable number (e.g., 25 years old, 30 years old) and will be incremented, it should be defined as an integer. Integers are whole numbers and do not require decimal precision, making them the most suitable data type for this scenario.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nB. Float → Used for numbers with decimal points, but age is typically represented as a whole number (e.g., 25, not 25.5).\nC. Double → Similar to float but with higher precision, which is unnecessary for an integer value like age.\nD. String → A string stores text, but age is a numeric value that needs to be incremented, making a string unsuitable.\nConclusion:\nSince age is a whole number that will be incremented, Integer (A) is the most appropriate data type. ✅","poster":"fcc_class","comment_id":"1359279","timestamp":"1740060480.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"789139","content":"Since it is being incremented and the information does not specify storing an individual's age in something like a database the answer should be A.","timestamp":"1722024660.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Garra"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/96941-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-123-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-01-26 23:11:00","question_text":"A global variable called `age` will be created in a program and incremented through the use of a function.
