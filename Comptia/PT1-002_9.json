In this case, the SOC (Security Operations Center) implemented sinkholing on the penetration tester's IP address, effectively preventing network traffic from reaching the tester's system.\nThe reason for this action can be attributed to a failure in the planning process. When conducting a penetration test, it is essential to have clear communication and coordination between the penetration tester, the client, and any involved teams or departments. The failure to notify the SOC about the penetration test or to coordinate with them properly resulted in the sinkholing of the tester's IP address."}],"answer":"B","question_id":42,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[]},{"id":"RTuM8A2hYz0txVGwwUL9","exam_id":363,"question_text":"A penetration tester wants to perform reconnaissance without being detected.
