The third-party, like insurance company or vendor, is paid to accept or handle the risk on your behalf and hence the ownership, as well as impact of the risk, is borne by that third party. This payment is called a risk premium. Contracts are signed to transfer the liability of risks to the third party.\nRisk Transfer does not eliminate the risk, but it reduces the direct impact of the risk on the project. Few Transference tools are an insurance policy, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. This approach is most effective in covering financial risk exposure."},{"timestamp":"1671497880.0","content":"Is warranty a risk transfer?\nThese questions are just a way to express the real question: is reps and warranties insurance merely a “deal facilitation tool” or a genuine risk transfer mechanism?

It may have an absolute transfer of risk, i.e. the keyboard bottoms up and you get an entire new computer system.
