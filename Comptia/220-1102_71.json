USB\nC. Optical media\n\nWhen reimaging a desktop in an area without network access, using USB drives or optical media (such as DVDs or CDs) are the most practical options. These methods allow the technician to boot the desktop from an external source containing the image files needed for the reinstallation. PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) relies on network booting and wouldn't be suitable in this scenario where network access is unavailable. Similarly, partition, boot record, and SMB (Server Message Block) are not appropriate for standalone reimage operations.","poster":"Duke_CT","timestamp":"1731470040.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":351},{"id":"TFQ2QFrQdLc8rygbjImC","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140505-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-416-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-05-13 03:54:00","exam_id":340,"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"question_id":352,"unix_timestamp":1715565240,"choices":{"D":"Printer Properties/Ports tab","C":"Printer Properties/Security tab","B":"Printer Properties/Sharing tab","A":"Printing Preferences/Advanced tab"},"discussion":[{"poster":"Phillyboy20_","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer because it is the only place where there is an option to share with another computer.","timestamp":"1733312460.0","comment_id":"1224036","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"B.
