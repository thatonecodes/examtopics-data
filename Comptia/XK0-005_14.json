The result is the default permission for each bit (r, w, and x).\nFor example, a umask value of 022 would result in file permissions of 644 (666 - 022) and directory permissions of 755 (777 - 022).\n\nOption A (setenforce) is used to set the enforcement mode of SELinux, the security module in Linux. It is not used to configure the default permissions for new files.\n\nOption B (sudo) is used to run commands with administrative privileges. It is not used to configure the default permissions for new files.\n\nOption D (chmod) is used to change the permissions of existing files and directories, but not to configure the default permissions for new files.","comment_id":"807937","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1707869220.0","comments":[{"poster":"Damon54","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"985775","content":"The default permissions are calculated by subtracting the umask value from 777 for Directories and 666 for files","timestamp":"1724157540.0"}],"upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct\nThe user mask (umask) feature defines the default permissions Linux assigns to the file or directory.
