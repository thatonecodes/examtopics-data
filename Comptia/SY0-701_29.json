Each VM can run its own operating system and applications, effectively reducing the number of physical servers required and thus the number of individual operating systems managed in a physical sense. By using virtualization, a company can consolidate its server infrastructure, leading to reduced hardware costs, easier management, and potentially enhanced security due to a smaller physical footprint and centralized management."}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Infrastructure as code","A":"Microservices","C":"Virtualization","B":"Containerization"},"answer_ET":"B","question_id":142,"question_text":"A company is decommissioning its physical servers and replacing them with an architecture that will reduce the number of individual operating systems.
