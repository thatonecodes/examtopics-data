(This is contrary to the mobile telephone network, where access points decide which one will serve which client.) Many devices are very reluctant to roam to another AP. They hold on to the first chosen one even when there is a much stronger AP next to the device. Only when the connection breaks will they associate with the next AP – and keep that connection to the end. This results in clients using far away access points with poor connections. By lowering the transmit power the connection will break sooner and the client will roam to a better access point.\n\nThis behaviour affects access point utilisation as well.

An incorrect channel assignment is on the nearest APs.\n\nIt is likely that the nearest APs have been incorrectly configured with a channel that overlaps with the channel being used by the AP on the far side of the warehouse. This would cause interference, resulting in devices connecting to the AP with the strongest signal, which would be the AP on the far side of the warehouse. The power level is too high for the AP on the far side,\" is not the most likely cause of the issue because, if the power level was too high, it would result in the devices being able to connect to the nearest APs but with a weaker signal strength. In the scenario described in the question, the devices are not connecting to the nearest APs at all, which suggests that there is an issue with the configuration or settings of the nearest APs, rather than a problem with the power level.","upvote_count":"8","poster":"JakeCharles","comment_id":"790249"},{"comment_id":"730668","timestamp":"1685373900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIts C.
