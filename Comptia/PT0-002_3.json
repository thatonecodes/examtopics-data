This can be used by a penetration tester to maintain persistence after rebooting a system, or by an adversary to gain unauthorized access to a system."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"nickwen007","timestamp":"1709769840.0","content":"A one-shot system is a type of service that will only run once, usually to perform a specific task such as setting up a reverse shell or downloading a malicious file.
