It allows the recipient's email system to check that an email was actually sent by the domain it claims to be sent from and that it hasn't been modified in transit. When a DKIM-signed email is received, the receiving mail server can retrieve the public key published in the domain's DNS records, and use it to verify the signature on the email.\n\nBy enabling DKIM on a company's email system, the security analyst can help mitigate the risk of email impersonation. This is because the recipient's email system can check that the email was sent from an authorized source and wasn't modified in transit, which makes it less likely that an attacker could successfully impersonate a company executive.","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1675515960.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1690333920.0","comment_id":"963226","poster":"kill_chain","upvote_count":"2","content":"thanks for the elaboration"}],"comment_id":"797962","poster":"gnnggnnggnng"},{"content":"Same as #81","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Dutch012","timestamp":"1688488740.0","comment_id":"943003"},{"timestamp":"1679350860.0","comment_id":"845293","poster":"2Fish","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDKIM is the only BEST option here."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nEvery time you see something about mail, choose Domain Keys Identified Mail","timestamp":"1676346540.0","comment_id":"808058","poster":"Cock"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-02-04 14:06:00","question_images":[]},{"id":"cxm44oPC55v1jIpRYGvQ","question_text":"A Chief Information Officer wants to implement a BYOD strategy for all company laptops and mobile phones.

They typically use endpoint data gathering and monitoring capabilities paired with central processing and analysis to provide high levels of visibility into what occurs on endpoints. This use of data gathering, search, and analysis tools is intended to help detect and respond to suspicious activity. The ability to handle multiple threat types, including ransomware, malware, and data exfiltration, is also a common feature for EDR systems.","comments":[{"poster":"Adrian831","content":"This is about \"guest device\", so could be a personal computer.
