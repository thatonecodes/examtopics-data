A content delivery network (CDN) would be the most appropriate solution to eliminate the latency issue. A CDN is a network of geographically distributed servers that cache and deliver content to users based on their geographic location, resulting in reduced latency and faster content delivery. By using a CDN, the company can store and distribute the training videos from multiple locations, closer to the end-users, reducing the distance the data must travel, and therefore, reducing latency.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"871170","poster":"BeauChateau","timestamp":"1713202500.0"},{"timestamp":"1701991680.0","poster":"DocHacker","comment_id":"738464","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/\n\"A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.\"","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"How is this not auto-scaling?","poster":"Sal","timestamp":"1698276180.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1701997920.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Auto scaling wouldn't help with latency.
