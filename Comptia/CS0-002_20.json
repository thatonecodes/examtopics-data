Sandboxing systems watch systems and\nthe network for unknown pieces of code and, when they detect an application\nthat has not been seen before, immediately isolate that code in a special\nenvironment known as a sandbox where it does not have access to any other\nsystems or applications. The sandboxing solution then executes the code and\nwatches how it behaves, checking to see if it begins scanning the network for\nother systems, gathering sensitive information, communicating with a\ncommand-and-control server, or performing any other potentially malicious\nactivity.\nIf the sandboxing solution identifies strange behavior, it blocks the code from\nentering the organization's network and flags it for administrator review.
