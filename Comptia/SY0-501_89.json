A default gateway is the address to which packets are sent if there is no specific gateway for a given destination listed in the routing table. \n\nBottom line...

It is a VLAN question regardless of the deceiving IP routing and the answer should be switch related. Now when you implement multiple VLANs across a network, trunk links are necessary to ensure that VLAN signals remain properly segregated for each to reach their intended destination.
