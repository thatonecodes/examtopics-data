There are misconfigured firewall rules.\n\nWhen users access resources from within the local network (on-site), they typically do not encounter the same firewall restrictions as remote users. However, remote users often need to traverse network boundaries, which may involve passing through firewalls or other network security devices.","poster":"surfuganda","timestamp":"1726249980.0"}]},{"id":"1Xe2QTLajMyy9vpSDJM6","timestamp":"2024-03-13 20:56:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Issue the setenforce 0 command.","C":"Create a firewall rule to allow port 3306 through the firewall.","D":"Issue the yum -y update mysql command.","A":"Download the update manually and run a checksum utility to verify file integrity."},"question_id":242,"question_text":"A server technician is installing application updates on a Linux server.

Issue the setenforce 0 command.\n\nThe error message \"AVC denial\" typically indicates an SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) permission issue. SELinux enforces mandatory access controls on Linux systems, and AVC denial suggests that SELinux is preventing the MySQL update from installing due to security policies.\n\nThhe \"setenforce 0\" command temporarily sets SELinux to permissive mode, which means that SELinux policies will be logged but not enforced. By setting SELinux to permissive mode, the technician can attempt the MySQL update again. If the update completes successfully in permissive mode, it confirms that SELinux was indeed blocking the update. However, leaving SELinux in permissive mode is not a recommended long-term solution as it reduces the security posture of the system.","timestamp":"1726250160.0"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135960-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-359-discussion/"},{"id":"khJ9XHaGi3juBBZHDBHb","question_id":243,"isMC":true,"question_text":"A large number of connections to port 80 is discovered while reviewing the log files on a server.
