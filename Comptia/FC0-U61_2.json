One example of a container construct is a simple array. For example, say that you want your program to store a list of user names who have logged on to the computer in the last 24 hours. You would declare the array with the data type of the values it will contain and the number of elements or \"rows\" that the array can contain:\ndeclare Logons(9) as string\nOne of the limitations of the array container type is that it cannot be resized. Most programming languages support container types called vectors that can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.","comment_id":"471906"}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-11-03 05:11:00"},{"id":"1sOyvowNXZMnjdhoXX2T","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Workstation","B":"Tablet","A":"Laptop","D":"Server"},"discussion":[{"poster":"Dion79","comment_id":"471907","content":"CPUs and their chipsets for mobile phones/smartphones and tablets are often based on the ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) microarchitecture, such as the Apple A, Samsung Exynos, and nVIDIA Tegra, derivatives.

Wireless router\nExplanation:\nA wireless router is responsible for managing network traffic, security settings, and port forwarding on a home network. To allow inbound connectivity for chat functions on a gaming console, users typically configure port forwarding or UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) on the router to permit external connections.\n\nWhy Not the Other Options?\nA. Cable modem – A modem only provides Internet access; it does not manage network traffic or allow inbound connectivity.\nC.

Wireless router\n\nExplanation:\nIn a home network, the wireless router (or sometimes just called a router) typically acts as the gateway between the local area network (LAN) and the Internet. To allow inbound connectivity for services like gaming chat functions, the user would need to configure port forwarding or a DMZ (demilitarized zone) on the router. This ensures that the necessary ports are open and that incoming data for those ports is directed to the appropriate device, in this case, the gaming console.","poster":"yenessy","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1724516220.0","poster":"PatrickH","comment_id":"989331","content":"Its B.
