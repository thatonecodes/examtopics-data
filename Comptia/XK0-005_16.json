The -n option displays the port numbers in numerical form, and the -t option displays only TCP sockets.\n\nC. netstat -pn - This command displays information about network connections, routing tables, and a variety of network statistics.

These queries can be used for a variety of purposes, such as user authentication and authorization, group policy enforcement, and other security-related tasks.\n\nTo perform these queries, the security gateway needs to communicate with the Active Directory Domain Controllers. This communication is typically done using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is a client-server protocol used for accessing directory services.
