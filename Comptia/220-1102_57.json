Quarantining should have been done during the removal process.\nInvestigate how the system was infected with malware (Option C): Investigation is essential, but it can happen concurrently with user education.\nCreate a system restore point (Option D): Creating a restore point is useful, but it’s not the priority right after malware removal.","timestamp":"1725832380.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"GeePete","comment_id":"1169161"},{"timestamp":"1715245080.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1066360","poster":"Patypus"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Turrtle","comment_id":"1056748","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCreating a system restore point is generally a good practice but isn't directly related to educating the end user or mitigating future risks.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1725526620.0","poster":"Janky00","content":"its the next step of how to remove to malware from your computer. so the answer is \nD","comment_id":"1166366","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1714379700.0"}]},{"id":"O0ikKrtt9Qpti1gvsjG7","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721564700.0","poster":"Naqeeb1","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1316713","timestamp":"1732375860.0","poster":"032e128","content":"In the scenario described, the breach already occurred (the employee copied financial data and left the company with it).
