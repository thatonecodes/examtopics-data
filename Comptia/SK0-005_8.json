Teaming\n\nNetwork teaming, also known as NIC teaming or bonding, involves grouping multiple network interfaces together to form a single, logical network interface. This configuration provides redundancy and load balancing, enhancing network reliability. If one network interface fails, the traffic is automatically routed through the remaining interfaces, ensuring continued network connectivity. Teaming can be configured to operate in various modes, including fault tolerance for redundancy and load balancing for improved performance.","timestamp":"1721111460.0","comment_id":"1124018"},{"poster":"David_IT_guy","content":"NOT D. \nTeaming (or more loosely, bridging) makes multiple network cards appear as one card.
