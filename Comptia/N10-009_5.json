Update the firmware.\n\nExplanation:\nA vulnerability in a router CPU is likely related to firmware or software running on the device that could be exploited by attackers. To resolve this, the network engineer should look for a firmware update from the vendor that addresses the vulnerability. Firmware updates often contain security patches or fixes for known vulnerabilities in hardware and software.","timestamp":"1736178960.0","poster":"HeatSquad77","comment_id":"1337228","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_id":21,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1736178960,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153978-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-117-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (86%)","14%"],"question_text":"A network engineer receives a vendor alert regarding a vulnerability in a router CPU.

LC\n\nExplanation:\nThe LC (Lucent Connector) is the most commonly used fiber connector type on network interface cards (NICs), especially for modern high-speed networks. LC connectors are smaller in size, making them more suitable for devices like network cards and switches where space is a consideration.

Non-overlapping channel\n\nExplanation:\nB. 5GHz frequency: The 5GHz frequency band is less prone to interference from industrial equipment, which often operates in the 2.4GHz range. By switching to 5GHz, you can avoid interference and improve network performance.\n\nD. Non-overlapping channel: In the 2.4GHz range, there are only three non-overlapping channels (1, 6, and 11). If the network is using overlapping channels, it can cause interference.
