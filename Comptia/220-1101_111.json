Liquid crystal display\nVertical lines on a laptop screen are often indicative of a faulty LCD panel. The LCD panel is responsible for displaying the image on the screen. If it's damaged or malfunctioning, it can cause various display issues, including vertical lines.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Inverter: The inverter converts DC power to AC power for the LCD backlight. While a faulty inverter can cause display issues, vertical lines are more likely caused by a problem with the LCD panel itself.\nB. Motherboard: A faulty motherboard can cause various hardware issues, but it's less likely to cause specific display problems like vertical lines.\nC. Low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) cable: The LVDS cable connects the motherboard to the LCD panel. A faulty cable can cause display issues, but it's more likely to result in a complete loss of display or distorted images.\nTherefore, replacing the LCD panel is the most likely solution to resolve the vertical line issue.\n\nGG","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732408860.0","comment_id":"1316865"},{"comment_id":"1278505","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1725485640.0","poster":"dvdlau","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
