All the other methods provide mutual authentication. The fact that ordinarily EAP-PEAP uses TLS only to authenticate the server to the client just means that the client doesn't use TLS to authenticate; it doesn't mean that the client doesn't authenticate at all! It means it will use some other method instead of a certificate (for example username and password), but of course the client DOES authenticate someway! The purspose of this authentication framework is exactly that. What kind of authentication system would it be if the client did NOT authenticate at all??? The client ALWAYS authenticate in some way!

Using public key cryptography, communicating parties may authenticate themselves to each other using public key certificates. In web applications, only the server typically has a certificate and authenticates itself to the client so that the user can have confidence that his communication has not been redirected or intercepted by an imposter. In this case, TLS provides unidirectional authentication. But if both parties have certificates, TLS can provide mutual authentication. Following the authentication phase, the two parties use a key agreement protocol such as Diffie-Hellman to derive a session key which is used to authenticate and encrypt messages exchanged during the TLS session.","poster":"Pietervh","upvote_count":"4","comments":[{"content":"so are u saying B is correct , pietervh?","poster":"babypoo","timestamp":"1591578120.0","comment_id":"104936","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Yes, Pietervh is saying that B is the correct answer.
