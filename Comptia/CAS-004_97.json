It replaces sensitive data with masked values that are still functional for verification but do not reveal the actual sensitive information. By masking sensitive fields (e.g., Social Security numbers, account numbers), the organization can prevent technicians from seeing the full PII. Technicians can still verify identities using the partially masked data since enough information is available to match with the caller's responses. For example, displaying only the last four digits of an identification number.\nWhy not Tokenization: Tokens do not carry meaningful information that technicians can use for identity verification.

C. To balance the need for identity verification with the risk of improper use of sensitive information, C. Tokenization is the best option. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive equivalents (tokens) that can be used for verification without exposing the actual data. This means technicians can verify identities without having direct access to sensitive information, thereby reducing the risk of misuse, while data masking obscures data, it can still be reversed or improperly accessed, which doesn't fully mitigate risks."},{"comment_id":"1289181","content":"Selected Answer: C\ntokenization is commonly associated with payment processing, where sensitive credit card information is replaced with tokens. However, it can also be applied to other sensitive data, including PII, for secure identity verification.\n\nData masking is often used in situations where data needs to be visible but with obfuscation to protect sensitive details. The choice between these methods depends on the specific use case and the level of security required. For identity verification without exposing PII, tokenization is generally more secure.\n\nTokenization is more effective in providing unique identifiers that do not reveal any sensitive information, thereby minimizing potential misuse.","timestamp":"1727303040.0","poster":"HereToStudy","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"ServerBrain","comment_id":"1259989","content":"Selected Answer: A\nData masking","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1722623760.0"}],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (80%)","C (20%)"],"topic":"1","question_id":485,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/144911-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-534-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"name":"CAS-004","numberOfQuestions":642,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","id":343,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":97},"__N_SSP":true}
