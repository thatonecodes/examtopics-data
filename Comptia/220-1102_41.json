This can either be assumed or not, but should not change the outcome. The main issue is what follows. The technician sets the phone to silent, and continues with working. THIS is what the question is asking for. CompTIA wants to know what the technician did.\nThe technician silenced the phone to avoid distractions while troubleshooting.\n\nB and C are both very similar, but unless the technician is receiving a video call while troubleshooting customer's personal data, they [B and C] do not apply.\n\nAnd D is not applicable because we cannot assume that a timeline was ever set or needs to be met. Because there is not enough info, and/or the question is only asking for an explanation of what the technician did by silencing the phone.\nTherefore the answer is A. Avoid distractions.","timestamp":"1698788700.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733408340.0","poster":"Raffaelloo","content":"Selected Answer: A\nUnlike the airplane mode, the silent mode still allows the device to receive and send calls and messages.

Add a user account to the local administrator's group.\n\nBy adding the user account to the local administrator's group, you grant the user elevated privileges that are necessary for installing software and making system-level changes. This allows the user to perform administrative tasks without encountering UAC prompts for each action. It's important to note that while this solution provides the necessary permissions, users should exercise caution and only use administrative privileges when required to minimize security risks.","poster":"kekejon","timestamp":"1717632540.0","comment_id":"1088959","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-12-06 03:09:00","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[]},{"id":"f1kg0DltcHzPNnwYlCrJ","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"The incorrect DNS address was assigned.","A":"A firewall is blocking the application.","B":"The wrong VLAN was assigned.","D":"The browser cache needs to be cleared."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/115673-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-282-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-07-18 20:21:00","unix_timestamp":1689704460,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":340,"question_text":"A user is unable to access a web-based application.
