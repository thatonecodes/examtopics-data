Configure an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to authorized domains\n\nExplanation:\nCross Domain Misconfiguration often refers to improper handling of cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policies. CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.\nThe Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is used in CORS to specify which domains are allowed to access the resources on a web server. If this header is misconfigured, it could allow any domain to access sensitive resources, leading to security vulnerabilities.\nBy configuring the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to only authorized domains, you restrict access to those resources to only the specified, trusted domains, mitigating the risk associated with cross-domain requests.","poster":"gomet2000","timestamp":"1726907040.0","comment_id":"1265917","upvote_count":"5"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1304187","timestamp":"1730149260.0","content":"C is the best answer.\nIn this context, Configure the \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains.","poster":"KANKALE"},{"comments":[{"content":"Why would you choose B?","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1306265","poster":"IE17","timestamp":"1730569080.0"}],"timestamp":"1729099440.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Frannie23","comment_id":"1298833","content":"Answer is B had this on my exam"},{"timestamp":"1728391980.0","comment_id":"1294722","upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer is B: \nThe output shows that the web application is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks which wouls allow a badguy to overlay a hidden frame on top of a legitimate page and trick users into clicking on malicious links.

The output shows that the web application has a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) header that allows any origin to access its resources. The tuning recommendation is to configure the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to only allow authorized domains that need to access the web applications resources.
