Updating the OpenSSL library:\n\nReason: The Heartbleed vulnerability is a flaw in certain versions of the OpenSSL library. Updating to a version of OpenSSL that is not affected by this vulnerability (e.g., 1.0.1g or later) directly addresses the issue by removing the vulnerability.\nImpact: This is the most critical step to ensure that your web server is no longer vulnerable to Heartbleed.\nA. Deploying a WAF signature:\n\nReason: Deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with a specific signature to detect and block Heartbleed exploitation attempts adds an additional layer of security. This measure helps protect your system from attacks targeting the vulnerability until the underlying issue is fully resolved by updating OpenSSL.\nImpact: This provides immediate protection against exploitation attempts and helps mitigate the risk until the update can be applied.","comments":[{"content":"The Heartbleed vulnerability is related to OpenSSL, not PHP.

While using open source components is a practical and fruitful strategy for application developers, those components do have to be managed properly. You have to know which components you’ve used in your applications, and you must be aware of any known vulnerabilities in those components. When new vulnerabilities are published about the software components you’ve used, you need to know right away so you can take action if necessary. (Likewise, you should know the software licenses of those components to ensure you are not using something improperly, but that is not the focus of this article.)
