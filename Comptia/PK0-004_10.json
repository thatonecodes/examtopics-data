That will start the ball rolling and get it added to the log and a number assigned to it. This request can be done by any stakeholder, team member, client, etc. So a team member wants to wants to enhance the code for his specific reason. \n\nThe question asks what is the PROJECT MANAGER to do next? The PM will do the impact analysis with the SME, in this case I'm assuming the team member who wants to change code. Remember the team member isn't concerned with the same attributes of the project as the PM. So the team member may just want their sweet totally awesome code added because it would be better. The PM needs to look at it from all angles, time, budget, resources, risk, etc. \n\nOnce the impact analysis is hammered out the PM will figure out who needs to approve it and hand it over to the CCB for decision.
