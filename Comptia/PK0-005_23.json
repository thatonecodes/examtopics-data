Social Engineering.\n\nHere's why:\n\n Social engineering: This involves manipulating people to gain access to sensitive information or systems. In this case, the impersonation of a tax agency official and the attempt to gain access to the project repository through a team member suggest this tactic.\n Phishing: While phishing often involves emails, its goal is typically to lure the recipient into clicking malicious links or attachments to steal their credentials. Here, the focus is directly on gaining access through trust and impersonation, not a malicious link.\n Spoofing: This involves forging data to make it appear authentic. While the email might involve spoofing the tax agency email address, it's the social engineering aspect of impersonation that's more prominent.\n Hacking: This involves technical methods to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. While this scenario could involve a hacker trying to exploit human behavior, the social engineering aspect takes precedence here."}],"isMC":true,"question_id":115,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Spoofing","D":"Hacking","A":"Social engineering","B":"Phishing"},"question_text":"Someone claiming to be from a tax agency sent an email to a team member asking for access to the project repository.
