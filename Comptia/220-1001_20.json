Reservation\n\nA reservation is an IP address that is assigned to a network device based on its MAC address. This is often used in DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to ensure that a specific device always receives the same IP address, even if the network is using dynamic IP addressing. By reserving an IP address for a specific MAC address, administrators can ensure that a particular device is always reachable at the same IP address.\n\nA dynamic IP address is assigned to a network device by a DHCP server, and can change each time the device connects to the network.\n\nA static IP address is manually assigned to a network device, and does not change unless it is manually reconfigured.\n\nA link-local address is a type of IP address used in local networks that do not have a DHCP server."},{"comment_id":"264284","timestamp":"1610313000.0","comments":[{"content":"However the DHCP also assigns by the MAC address by using a broadcast via ethernet so the answer technically is all of them","comment_id":"266595","poster":"DohJayVeh","timestamp":"1610575560.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"So I did some research to find out why they said Link Local...

Link-local addresses are most often assigned automatically with a process known as stateless address autoconfiguration or link-local address autoconfiguration, also known as automatic private IP addressing or auto-IP. A link-local address is an IPv6 unicast address that can be automatically configured on any interface using the link-local prefix FE80::/10 (1111 1110 10) and the interface identifier in the modified EUI-64 format. Link-local addresses are not necessarily bound to the MAC address (configured in a EUI-64 format).

The tone probe emits a sound when it is placed near a cable connected to the tone generator.
