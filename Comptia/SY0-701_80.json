Load balancing\n\nExplanation:\nLoad balancing is an optimal solution for improving application availability. It distributes traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that if one server goes down or needs to be replaced, the load can be redistributed to the remaining servers without causing downtime. This approach requires minimal effort, as it can automatically redirect traffic to healthy servers without manual intervention, meeting the company's goal of minimal effort when adding or replacing servers."},{"comment_id":"1321459","upvote_count":"4","poster":"kambam","content":"Selected Answer: D\nReplication is the correct answer.
