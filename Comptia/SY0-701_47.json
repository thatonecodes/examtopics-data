Masking\n\nExplanation:\nMasking is used to conceal credit card information (or other sensitive data) in a way that makes the data partially visible but still useful for certain operations. For example, credit card numbers can be masked by showing only the last four digits, such as **** **** **** 1234.

Masking\nMasking is the process of concealing certain parts of sensitive data, such as credit card information, by replacing part of the data with a non-sensitive placeholder or character. In the case of a credit card, this could involve showing only the last four digits (e.g., ****-****-****-1234) while hiding the rest of the number. Masking is commonly used when sensitive data needs to be logged or displayed but without revealing the full information.\n\nNOT A. Tokenization: Tokenization replaces sensitive data with a unique identifier, or \"token,\" that has no meaningful value outside of the system that generated it.
