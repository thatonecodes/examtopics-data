Conversely, a vulnerability with low exploitability may be less urgent as it is less likely to be exploited. The exploitability of a vulnerability depends on many factors, including its attack complexity (AC), the availability of tools and techniques to exploit it (weaponization), and any security measures already in place to defend against the vulnerability. Vulnerability scanning tools and penetration testing can help quantify a vulnerability's exploitability. It is important to note that low exploitability does not mean that a vulnerability is not severe. Analysts must carefully consider all aspects of a vulnerability, including its potential impact, to make informed decisions about remediating it.","timestamp":"1732675260.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1732675260.0","comment_id":"1081141","upvote_count":"5","content":"3/3\n\nExamples of Vulnerability Score Adjustments\nConsider a hypothetical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability with a CVSS score of 10. During the risk assessment process, the organization discovers that successfully exploiting the vulnerability requires an attacker to be connected to the same network as the vulnerable application. Further analysis reveals that the vulnerable application only runs on a single, fully air-gapped system. This information would be a justifiable reason to lower the score since the computer is not accessible via the network. Another example might include a vulnerability marked as \"informational\" and not designated with a CVSS score, such as vulnerabilities associated with web applications. Further investigation of these vulnerabilities often reveals that the web application is easily exploitable and could result in significant damage.","poster":"[Removed]"}],"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1081140"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB) Weaponization \n\nCertmaster Topic 6B: Exploring Vulnerability Context Considerations \n\nAssessing the severity of a vulnerability is a crucial component of vulnerability analysis. It is important to remember that vulnerability scores are not static; they are subject to change based on several factors. When adjusting vulnerability scores, organizations must consider a variety of special considerations, such as the availability of patches, the impact of the vulnerability, and the level of sophistication of the threat actors targeting them. By taking the time to consider these additional factors, organizations can ensure that their vulnerability scores are appropriately adjusted and accurately reflect the actual risk posed by the vulnerability.\n\nOrganizations consider several factors to ensure that vulnerability scores are appropriately adjusted.

Weaponization\n\nWeaponization in the context of vulnerability assessment and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) refers to the development and availability of tools, exploits, or malware that can take advantage of a vulnerability. When a widely available exploit, such as one used to deliver ransomware, becomes accessible to attackers, it significantly increases the severity of the vulnerability. This is because the exploitability of the vulnerability is heightened, leading to a higher CVSS score.","timestamp":"1725424260.0","comment_id":"998198","upvote_count":"5","poster":"nmap_king_22"}],"answer":"B","choices":{"C":"CVSS","A":"Scope","B":"Weaponization","D":"Asset value"},"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1693801860,"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-04 06:31:00","question_text":"An older CVE with a vulnerability score of 7.1 was elevated to a score of 9.8 due to a widely available exploit being used to deliver ransomware.
