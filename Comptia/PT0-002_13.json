The network must be segmented.\n\nExplanation:\n\nB. The network must be segmented:\n\n • PCI DSS Requirement 11.3 specifies that penetration testing must be conducted to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise the security of the cardholder data environment (CDE). One of the key requirements is to ensure that the CDE is segmented from other networks to reduce the scope of PCI DSS requirements and limit exposure.","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720132980.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think it is B\nnot A because - Certifications held by a penetration tester may be an indication of the skill level and competence of a potential penetration tester or company.
