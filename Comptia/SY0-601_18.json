Hashing will VERIFY the integrity of a particular file and tell you whether or not it has changed, but it will not prevent anyone from actually making the change. Also, answer A says to hash the source logs, not the aggregate logs.\n\nThe best way to ENSURE that integrity is maintained is by storing them on a write-protected server with limited access. Hashing would be a good idea as well but again, will not PREVENT a change, only DETECT. \n\nI would encourage everyone to not jump to conclusions based on keywords like \"hashing = integrity\".

These hashes are unique representations of the log data. By storing and periodically recalculating these hashes, SIEMs can detect any changes or tampering with the log files. If the calculated hash differs from the stored hash, it indicates that the log data has been altered, and the integrity may have been compromised.\nWhile write protection can be a part of overall security measures, it primarily prevents unauthorized modifications to log files. It doesn't provide a direct method to verify the integrity of log files. Instead, it helps maintain the log files in a read-only state to prevent tampering.\n\nSo, for ensuring the integrity of aggregated log files within a SIEM, hashing is the more directly relevant mechanism."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nHashing is a cryptographic technique used to verify the integrity of data.

It is commonly used to ensure the integrity and security of a system's boot process and to support local and remote attestation.\n\nHere's how TPM can provide the solution:\n\n1. Boot integrity: TPM can store cryptographic measurements of the system's boot process, including the firmware, bootloader, and operating system components. These measurements are known as Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) and create a \"hash chain\" that represents the system's boot state. Any unauthorized changes to the boot process will result in a different hash value, indicating potential tampering.\n\n2. Remote attestation: TPM enables remote attestation, where the system can provide proof of its boot integrity to a remote server or entity. This is crucial for verifying that the system's software and configurations have not been altered by unauthorized parties. Remote attestation can be used to ensure the integrity of the system before allowing access to sensitive data or services."},{"timestamp":"1726972320.0","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","comment_id":"928686","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTPM is a hardware-based security feature that provides cryptographic functions and secure storage for cryptographic keys.

TPM can measure and store hashes of critical components and compare them against known good values, ensuring that unauthorized changes or tampering are detected.\n\nRemote boot attestation enables the verification of a system's integrity even when it is booted remotely or in a networked environment.
