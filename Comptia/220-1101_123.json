Enable multithreading.\n\nTo create and run VMs on a workstation, it is essential to have a processor that supports virtualization. One of the critical aspects of a virtualization-capable processor is support for multithreading. Enabling multithreading will allow the workstation to run multiple threads simultaneously, which is necessary to manage and run multiple VMs effectively. Also, make sure that hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI settings.\n\nTrusted Platform Module (TPM) is not the correct answer because it is a dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware by integrating cryptographic keys into devices. It provides hardware-level security features like secure boot, full disk encryption, and key storage. While TPM enhances the security of a system, it is not directly related to the ability to create or run virtual machines.\n\nIn the given scenario, the issue is with creating VMs, which is more related to processor capabilities and enabling features like multithreading and hardware virtualization, rather than the security features provided by TPM."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
