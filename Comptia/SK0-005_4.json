LVM\n\nThe Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel. LVM allows for flexible disk management, enabling the resizing of partitions (logical volumes) on the fly without the need for unmounting or reformatting them. This capability makes it an ideal choice for systems where disk space requirements may change over time, providing administrators with the ability to increase or decrease the size of partitions as needed without disrupting services.","comment_id":"1171292"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nLVM why creating confusion ?","timestamp":"1723559940.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AzadOB","comment_id":"1149368"},{"comment_id":"999960","content":"LVM is the best tool to allow a technician to increase a partition's size in the future without reformatting it. LVM provides flexibility in managing storage by abstracting physical storage devices into logical volumes that can be resized, extended, or shrunk without the need to reformat or repartition the file system. This makes it an ideal choice for dynamically managing storage on a Linux server.","timestamp":"1709683560.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"H_A_79"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"971255","content":"A. LVM\nLVM allows a Logical Volume to span multiple physical disks/RAID sets. If you run out of space on your current disk, just add a new disk to the system, use it to extend the volume group that needs more space, and add the necessary space to your logical volume. If you need to move your data to new disks and remove the old ones, you can use pvmove or LVM-level mirroring to migrate the data to the new disks. All this can be done while filesystems are mounted and applications are running.\n\nWith FDISK, you can extend an existing partition only if there is free space on the disk immediately after the partition. So extending any partitions other than the last one on the disk will require moving partitions around, which cannot be done while the partition is mounted.","timestamp":"1706981940.0","poster":"zoro99"},{"timestamp":"1705394160.0","comment_id":"953091","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDiskpart to extend or resize without formatting","poster":"Isaiah44","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIsn't this C?","poster":"comptiaboy","comment_id":"873059","timestamp":"1697573220.0"}],"exam_id":365,"timestamp":"2023-04-17 22:07:00","answer":"A","question_text":"A technician is laying out a filesystem on a new Linux server.
