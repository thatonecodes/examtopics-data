Implement file integrity monitoring.\n\nFile integrity monitoring involves regularly scanning and monitoring the files and directories on the web server for any unauthorized changes or modifications. By comparing the current state of files against a known baseline or checksum, file integrity monitoring tools can detect alterations made by hackers attempting to deface the website or exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to internal systems.\n\nWhile changing default credentials (option B), using SSL encryption (option C), and updating web-server software (option D) are important security measures, they primarily focus on preventing unauthorized access and securing data in transit.
