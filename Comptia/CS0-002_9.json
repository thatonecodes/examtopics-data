Input validation is the process of checking all input for issues such as proper format and proper length. In many cases, these validators use either the blacklisting of characters or patterns or the whitelisting of characters or patterns. Blacklisting looks for characters or patterns to block. It can be prone to preventing legitimate requests. Whitelisting looks for allowable characters or patterns and allows only those.
