Edit the bootloader configuration file and change the first kernel stanza to reflect the file location for the last known-good kernel files.\n\nThis approach allows the server to boot using a previous, stable version of the kernel that is known to be compatible with the server's hardware. By editing the bootloader configuration, the administrator can ensure that the system bypasses the problematic kernel version during the boot process, effectively mitigating the immediate issues caused by the incompatible kernel update. This solution is preferable because it directly addresses the problem without the need for more drastic measures such as a complete OS reinstall or adjusting unrelated security settings like BIOS passwords. Moreover, it preserves the server's configuration and data, avoiding the downtime and work associated with reinstallation.","poster":"surfuganda","timestamp":"1726252140.0"}],"choices":{"B":"Perform a complete OS reinstall on the server using the same media that was used during the initial install.","D":"Set a BIOS password to prevent server technicians from making any changes to the system.","C":"Edit the bootloader configuration file and move the newest kernel update stanza to the end of the file.","A":"Edit the bootloader configuration file and change the first kernel stanza to reflect the file location for the last known-good kernel files."},"timestamp":"2024-03-13 21:29:00","unix_timestamp":1710361740},{"id":"VjgygHqOcMWH339S2SSW","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
