STP cables have shielding that helps protect the data signals and improve performance, especially in environments with high interference.\n\nHigh-Quality Cat6a or Cat7 Cabling: For 10GBASE-T, which supports data rates up to 10 Gbps, using high-quality cabling like Cat6a or Cat7 is crucial. Cat6a is rated for 10 Gbps over 100 meters, and Cat7 offers even better shielding and performance.
