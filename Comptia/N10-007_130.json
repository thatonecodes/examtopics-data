My thoughts: A and B are correct. OTDR to test fiber cable continuity (OC-12 implies fiber cable). A loopback is essentially a physical layer test (test the ability of an interface transmit data (Tx) and receive that data back to itself (Rx). Performing a loopback at the demarc and router checks both sides of that physical connection to see if the physical ports or maybe internal electronics are faulty). As far as cleaning the cables: this is just one of their nasty wording tricks: even if the cables are dirty, we don't care ... we'd care if the *connectors* were dirty, but the choice says cables, not connectors.
