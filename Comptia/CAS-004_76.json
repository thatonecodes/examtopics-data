Private-key CSR signage prevents on-path interception: This option is incorrect. Private-key CSR (Certificate Signing Request) signage refers to the process of digitally signing the CSR with the private key, which is a message sent from an applicant to a certificate authority (CA) to apply for a digital certificate. While it adds a layer of security to the certificate creation process, it does not prevent on-path interception. On-path interception attacks target the communication between the client and the server, not the certificate itself. On-path interception, also known as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, is prevented by using certificates issued by trusted third-party CAs. These certificates ensure that the identity of the server is verified by a trusted authority, making it difficult for attackers to impersonate the server and intercept communications."}],"comment_id":"1366216","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCRL is used to track revoked certificates. When a client attempts to validate a certificate, the client's system consults the CRL to see if the certificate has been revoked. If it has, the validation fails, and the connection is denied. While a CRL is an important security measure, its benefit is diminished when using a self-signed certificate because self-signed certificates are not trusted by third-party validation systems. Since a self-signed certificate does not have a trusted issuing Certificate Authority (CA), its revocation status is irrelevant to the trust chain. Therefore, the argument that there is minimal benefit in using a CRL is valid in the context of using self-signed certificates.","timestamp":"1741343940.0"},{"poster":"ChopSNap","timestamp":"1721164560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

The server staples the OCSP response to the certificate and returns it to the client during the TLS handshake. This approach enables the presenter of the certificate, rather than the issuing CA, to bear the resource cost of providing OCSP responses. It also enables the server to cache the OCSP responses and supply them to all clients.

The idea behind OCSP is straightforward. A CA certificate contains a reference to an OSCP server. A client validating a certificate transmits the certificate serial number, a hash of the issuer name, and a hash of the subject name to that OSCP server. The OSCP server checks the certificate status and returns an indication as to the current status of the certificate. This removes the need to download the entire list of revoked certificates and also allows for essentially instantaneous revocation of invalid certificates. It has the design trade-off of requiring that clients validating certificates have network connectivity to the required OCSP server.","comment_id":"713985"},{"comment_id":"1298983","poster":"IT_Master_Tech","content":"B.","timestamp":"1729119660.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"23169fd","timestamp":"1720711320.0","comment_id":"1246199","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBoth B and C will do the job but B will fir the requirements:\nReduced Traffic: Delta CRLs are significantly smaller than full CRLs as they only contain the changes since the last CRL update.

OCSP does not provide lists of revoked certs or send copies of anything anywhere. In OCSP, a user or client must submit a certificate to the website for verification. It will come back with one of three results: good, revoked, unknown. For example, a company has 100 certs. They must submit all 100 to find out which are revoked. That is not what the architect is looking to do here. They want delta CRLs. This process sends updates on certificate statuses as they happen if they happen. So if a cert expires today, the delta CRL will send that revocation status after it has expired. If nothing expires or changes, then nothing is sent.

This also ensures that the branch offices receive the latest copy of revoked certificates issued by the CA at the organization's headquarters location. Additionally, using Delta CRLs has a low power requirement on the CA as it only needs to publish changes to the CRL.
