ARP poisoning. This is a type of attack where an attacker sends false ARP messages to a network to associate their own MAC address with the IP addresses of other devices. This allolws the attacker to intercept, modify, or block the network traffic intended for those devices. \nThe command output shows the same MAC address is associated with multiple IP addresses on the network, which is a sign of ARP poisoning. The attacker is likely using the this techinque to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and disrupt the network connectivity of the users.","timestamp":"1705242120.0","comment_id":"1122593","poster":"johnabayot"},{"timestamp":"1713965100.0","poster":"shady23","comment_id":"1201398","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
