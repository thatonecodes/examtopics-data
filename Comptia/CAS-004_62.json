PFS ciphers help protect against chosen ciphertext attacks and other types of attacks by ensuring that session keys are not derived from a master key. With PFS, even if a private key is compromised in the future, past communications remain secure because the session keys are not stored and are generated for each session independently. Enabling PFS ensures that each session uses a unique set of encryption keys, thus enhancing security against various attacks. While AEAD ciphers, such as AES-GCM, provide both confidentiality and integrity in a single operation and are generally more secure than other ciphers. While enabling AEAD ciphers would improve overall encryption security, the specific mitigation of chosen ciphertext attacks is best achieved through PFS. However, it’s worth noting that enabling AEAD ciphers is also a good practice for overall security.","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nGiven the focus on mitigating chosen ciphertext attacks, the primary concern is to ensure that the data is not only encrypted but also authenticated to prevent such attacks.

Enable AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data).\n\nAEAD is a form of encryption which simultaneously provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity assurances on the data. This means that the data is not only encrypted, but the system can also verify who created the data and whether or not it has been tampered with. This can help protect against chosen ciphertext attacks, which involve an attacker attempting to decrypt a ciphertext by exploiting the properties of the encryption scheme.
