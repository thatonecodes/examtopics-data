System Hardening \nSystem hardening enhances the security of an operating system, application, device, or service by reducing its attack surface. Hardening involves enabling or disabling specific features and restricting access to sensitive areas of the system, such as protected operating system files, windows registry, configuration files, and logs. Hardening includes disabling unnecessary services, limiting user privileges, patching the operating system, and many other changes. Best-practice hardening configurations can be very complex. Examples of best-practice hardening guides include DoD STIGs (https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/) and CIS Benchmarks™ (https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/). Version 1.0.0 of the CIS Microsoft Windows 11 Enterprise Benchmark contains over 1,200 pages of recommendations.","timestamp":"1713307140.0"},{"timestamp":"1711631700.0","comment_id":"1184779","upvote_count":"3","poster":"j904","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
