Depends what CompTIA thinks\n\nTransport encryption can use ephemeral (session) keys.\nData in use—this is the state when data is present in volatile memory, such as system RAM or CPU registers and cache. Examples of types of data that may be in use include documents open in a word processing application, database data that is currently being modified, event logs being generated while an operating system is running, and more. When a user works with data, that data usually needs to be decrypted as it goes from in rest to in use. The data may stay decrypted for an entire work session, which puts it at risk. However, some mechanisms, such as Intel Software Guard Extensions (https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx/details) are able to encrypt data as it exists in memory, so that an untrusted process cannot decode the information.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"LokiSecure","timestamp":"1621310760.0","content":"I read in cryptography that data in RAM in not encrypted while in use.
