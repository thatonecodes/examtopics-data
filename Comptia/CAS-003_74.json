That has always been my reason. According to a website I found:\n\"Once data has reached the end of its life or is deemed trivial, obsolete or redundant, it’s important to dispose of that data securely.\"\nhttps://www.blancco.com/resources/article-data-sanitization-definition/\nSame as data deduplication, you are just getting rid of junk. The PaaS provider may even charge by the amount of data. It would be a good time to clean out the junk data.\nBut, for this question, I am still leaning towards data sovereignty.\nFWIW: according the data sanitation.org website, the definition of data sanitation is: \nData sanitization is the process of deliberately, permanently and irreversibly removing or destroying the data stored on a memory device to make it unrecoverable. A device that has been sanitized has no usable residual data, and even with the assistance of advanced forensic tools, the data will not ever be recovered. There are three methods to achieve data sanitization: physical destruction, cryptographic erasure and data erasure.\nhttps://www.datasanitization.org/data-sanitization-terminology/","poster":"D1960","timestamp":"1615751040.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"vorozco","timestamp":"1646332260.0","comment_id":"560286","content":"The question is asking about data SANITIZATION, not data deduplication.
