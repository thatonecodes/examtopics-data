Poor input sanitization\nC. Null pointer dereferences\n\nAn application security assessment report addressed to developers would most likely include information about poor input sanitization and null pointer dereferences. Poor input sanitization refers to the failure to properly validate or filter user input, which could leave the application vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Null pointer dereferences occur when a program attempts to access memory that has not been allocated, which can cause the program to crash or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\nInformation such as use of non-optimized sort functions (A), non-compliance with code style guide (D), use of deprecated Javadoc tags (E) and a cyclomatic complexity score of 3 (F) are not considered security vulnerabilities and would not be included in a security report.

Disable HTTP/301 redirect configuration: This recommendation is likely related to the use of HTTP rather than HTTPS. HTTP/301 redirects can be used to redirect users from HTTP to HTTPS to ensure secure communication. However, if the network device does not support HTTPS, then the redirect could expose users to man-in-the-middle attacks. Disabling the redirect would prevent this exposure, but it would be better to enable HTTPS and use redirects to ensure all traffic is encrypted.\n\nE. Implement a better method for authentication: Given that Basic Authentication is not secure over HTTP, it is crucial to implement a more secure authentication method. Options could include using HTTPS to encrypt the connection along with Basic Authentication, or better yet, implementing stronger authentication methods such as two-factor authentication or using digital certificates, which provide a higher level of security.","comment_id":"1100858","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1702160220.0","poster":"mehewas855","comment_id":"1092105","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nManagement devices should always have their own VLAN, which means D is right for sure\n\nSSH version is old and with existing 0-days, there is also weak BASIC password with base64 encoding. \nWhich tells me, that B is right for SSH, but E is right for authentication as a whole, which means using stronger passwords, better protocols AND newer ssh versions probably as well"},{"content":"Based on the findings, the following recommendations would be BEST to add to the final report:\n\nB.
