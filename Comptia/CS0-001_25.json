Question does not specify a compromise/event, just behavior/incident to investigate. The only issue with the elevated permission login at this time is that the analyst (you/us) doesn't recognize the naming scheme of the account. Also if it's a Windows Domain Controller then there are NO local accounts on the Server itself, only Domain Accounts. Windows Member Servers can have local accounts; but not Domain Controllers. If Admin accounts are compromised, taking this Server offline would not help with an Admin account breach in this situation...only to kick the bad actor off this one server. Ultimately there's no security event here, just unrecognized user naming convention."},{"timestamp":"1601315100.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"The user's account not following the standard corporate naming scheme implies that there's already a standard in place so should be B?","comment_id":"189198","poster":"[Removed]"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1593011340.0","poster":"Blind_Hatred","comment_id":"118510","content":"I'm going with B on this one, albeit the remediate step is insufficient."},{"timestamp":"1591596120.0","poster":"shoop","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"108174","timestamp":"1591920000.0","poster":"s3curity1","comments":[{"content":"crap question, re-reading it all.... there is just so little in the question to decide between the answers","poster":"Rowlandmarc","comment_id":"108481","timestamp":"1591948500.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"I'm still torn with B or D.
