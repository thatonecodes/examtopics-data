LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) can be used as a central repository of Linux users and groups. LDAP is a widely used protocol for accessing directory services and is commonly used to store user and group information in a central repository. This central repository can be used to manage user and group information for multiple systems, making it easier to manage and maintain user and group information across an organization.","upvote_count":"8"},{"poster":"JSHack","timestamp":"1733844960.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nLDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): A protocol used to access and maintain distributed directory information services over a network. It is commonly used for authentication and managing user information in enterprise environments.\nMFA (Multi-factor Authentication): A security process in which a user is required to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, such as a website or application. These factors typically include something the user knows (password), something the user has (a mobile phone or token), and something the user is (fingerprint or other biometrics).\nSSO (Single Sign-On): A user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials. This reduces the need to remember multiple passwords and improves user convenience.\nPAM (Pluggable Authentication Module): A framework that allows system administrators to configure authentication methods for applications on Unix-like systems. It enables the integration of different authentication technologies (like password-based, biometrics, or MFA) without changing the applications themselves.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1324627"},{"poster":"Alizadeh","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723834320.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A.
