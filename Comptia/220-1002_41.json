A sandbox box is a containerised isolated environment. An example of this is Microsoft Intune company portal. Intune is Microsoft cloud(some else's datacentre)based mobile device management platform. The company portal app(ios/andriod) is \"sandboxed\" from rest of the mobile environment. Another specific example is virtualization, when you run a Virtual machine it's \"sandboxed\" from other virtual machines or host(unless networked). In terms of security it's mainly used as a test environment, for example you can execute a virus in a sandbox environment and it will not affect rest of the host.","comments":[{"content":"So it could be sandbox, if the admin believes the program is a malicious software that needs to be isolated in a sandbox environment so that it run without affecting the rest of the network or hosts...","upvote_count":"1","poster":"iLikeBeagButt","timestamp":"1651941840.0","comment_id":"598206"}],"comment_id":"478531","poster":"[Removed]"},{"comment_id":"650391","poster":"Nat2down","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSandboxing protects \"live\" servers and their data, vetted source code distributions, and other collections of code, data, and/or content, proprietary or public, from changes that could be damaging to a mission-critical system or which could simply be difficult to revert, regardless of the intent of the author of those changes.\n\nSince the question is stating \" To ensure corporate data is not exchanged to the cloud servers\" I would pick D.","timestamp":"1661192400.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"535696","content":"if it says encrypt data then i will choose that, but the option says device encryption its not the right one. maybe another question that doesn't have any points.","poster":"ronah","timestamp":"1643486880.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1643151840.0","comment_id":"532476","content":"A seems the correct answer to me but could be wrong any idea?","poster":"[Removed]"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"385726","timestamp":"1624129740.0","content":"is it D?","poster":"fnwilliamson"},{"poster":"dnbly","comment_id":"336535","timestamp":"1618512240.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"This is probably a psychometric question, on the exam but not marked.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1627427880.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"benpike","comment_id":"415765","content":"I think psychologists should stop using us as guinea pigs.lol"}]},{"content":"A is the best answer to me","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"316748","timestamp":"1616372520.0","poster":"examdominator"},{"comment_id":"302500","content":"can anyone explain this to me ?
