This vulnerability is very dangerous, as it does not require any user interaction or attachment opening to trigger the exploit. The attacker only needs to send an email to the victim's Outlook account, and the code will execute automatically when Outlook connects to the Exchange server. This vulnerability has a high severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, and it affects all supported versions of Outlook."},{"content":"'Click' is the keyword in this question. \"User interaction: Yes.\"","timestamp":"1724767140.0","comment_id":"1160787","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Instguy"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI would go for D, everyone is overlooking the last part of the question, if a user clicks on a malicious link and their system gets hijacked, they are already part of the local network and thus the AC:Low, No Auth Required and No User interaction needed vulnerability is very easily exploited.","comments":[{"poster":"deeden","comment_id":"1087768","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1717511400.0","content":"Yes D is scary but the AV is local, and no UI means no click required from email users, no?

You can rule out B and D right away as they are local attack vectors and networks poses higher risk. You can rule out C since High attack complexity and Authentication Requirement is a lower risk than no Authentication and Low Complexity. Low complexity attacks are easier to pull off and no authentication is required.
