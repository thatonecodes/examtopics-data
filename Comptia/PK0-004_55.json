A scheduler may have no idea how long it takes to paint a 3000 sqft house because they've worked in a car manufacturing environment before. But you know who would be great as giving that estimated time? Yup the people who do it, the painters.

But ultimately B\n\nThe project team members who are responsible for completing the tasks are typically the ones who have the most knowledge and experience with the tasks and can provide more accurate estimates of the duration. The project scheduler can use these estimates to develop the project schedule, taking into account dependencies between tasks and the available resources.\n\nIt's important to note that estimating task duration can be challenging, and there are many factors that can impact the accuracy of the estimate. It's essential to involve the project team members in the estimation process and to use techniques such as historical data analysis and expert judgment to improve the accuracy of the estimates.","comment_id":"831397","upvote_count":"1","poster":"joe99999","timestamp":"1678147080.0"},{"comment_id":"736368","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis is C - project team","poster":"Geodude","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1670279400.0"},{"timestamp":"1669251960.0","comment_id":"725478","upvote_count":"1","poster":"brvndvnwolf","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C.\nCatastrophie's explanation is spot on"},{"timestamp":"1668891060.0","poster":"ExamTopics274","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"722243","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis is C - Project Team"},{"comment_id":"579915","timestamp":"1648911900.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"I believe the project team is the answer, they relay their estimates to the scheduler.","poster":"devildog"}],"question_id":271,"answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"ITQgmYeqVO2uCULpCsQa","timestamp":"2023-02-25 11:24:00","unix_timestamp":1677320640,"question_images":[],"exam_id":359,"question_text":"The quarterly financial statement has been released, and portfolios are losing funding for projects.
