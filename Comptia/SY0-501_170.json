After personnel handle an incident, security personnel perform a lessons learned review. Itâ€™s very possible the incident provides some valuable lessons and the organization might modify procedures or add additional controls to prevent a reoccurrence of the incident. A review might indicate a need to provide additional training to users or indicate a need to update the incident response policy. The goal is to prevent a future reoccurrence of the incident. \n\nCompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead SY0-501 Study Guide Darril Gibson pg. 723","comment_id":"284617"}],"comment_id":"266376","content":"why not a >?","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1610549460.0"}],"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/42272-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-818-discussion/","topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Chain of custody","D":"Penetration test","C":"Lessons learned","A":"Risk assessment"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_text":"A security operations team recently detected a breach of credentials.
