You can simply use a wiping tool on your computer. It is more cost affective than using a shredder which would have been my second choice."},{"timestamp":"1734261780.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Exam_Prep221","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect Answer: Wiping:\n\nWiping a hard drive involves securely overwriting all data on the drive using specialized software tools.\nIt is cost-effective, especially when compared to physical destruction methods like shredding, and ensures data cannot be easily recovered.\nThis method is practical for decommissioned laptops, as it allows for the reuse or resale of the hardware while safeguarding client data.\nWhy not the others?\n\nB. Recycling:\nRecycling addresses environmental concerns but does not inherently protect against data theft unless data is securely wiped first.\n\nC. Shredding:\nShredding physically destroys the hard drive, making it impossible to reuse. While secure, it is not cost-effective compared to wiping, as it wastes the hardware.\n\nD. Deletion:\nDeletion merely removes file pointers but does not actually erase the data. It can be easily recovered using basic data recovery tools.","comment_id":"1326806"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1320052","timestamp":"1732941300.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWiping is the process of securely erasing all data on a storage device by overwriting it with random data multiple times. It ensures that the data cannot be recovered using standard recovery tools. Wiping is a cost-effective solution for decommissioned laptops because it allows the hardware to be reused or resold while protecting sensitive client data","poster":"Fourgehan"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nShredding physically destroys the hard drives, making data recovery impossible. This is the most effective method to prevent data theft from decommissioned laptops. While wiping and deletion can remove data, determined attackers may still be able to recover it under certain circumstances.

IaC (Infrastructure as Code)\n\nExplanation:\nIaC (Infrastructure as Code) allows IT teams to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of servers using code. This ensures consistency, reduces manual errors, and significantly lowers the time needed to build new servers by automating the entire process.\nIt is particularly beneficial for large IT operations, as it enables standardization and version control, making deployments faster and more reliable.\nOther Options:\nA. IoT (Internet of Things): IoT refers to interconnected devices and sensors, which is unrelated to server provisioning.\nC. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): While IaaS provides virtualized resources, it does not inherently standardize or automate the provisioning process without IaC tools.\nD. ICS (Industrial Control System): ICS is used for managing industrial processes and is not relevant to building and managing servers.","timestamp":"1738017300.0","poster":"Anyio"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIaC is the most suitable architecture to meet the company's objectives of controlling, standardizing, and reducing the time to build new servers. IaC allows administrators to define and manage infrastructure (like servers) through machine-readable configuration files. IaaS provides on-demand access to compute resources, it does not inherently address the need for automation and standardization in server builds. IaC can be used in conjunction with IaaS.","timestamp":"1732559640.0","comment_id":"1317692","poster":"AriGarcia"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/152001-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-443-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1732559640,"question_text":"A company that has a large IT operation is looking to better control, standardize, and lower the time required to build new servers.
