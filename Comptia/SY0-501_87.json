The question was asked how much any person can differentiate between hashing and encryption. So if we are talking about integrity, then we are referring to hashing because hashing is a one way deal that confirms the document is not modified. However if we are talking about protecting the information not to fall in the hands of hackers ,then we are taking about encryption.
