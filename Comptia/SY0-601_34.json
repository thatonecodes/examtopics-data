The objective is to redirect DNS queries for a legitimate domain to a malicious IP address, which could be controlled by the attacker. In this scenario, when the user enters \"comptia.org\" into the web browser, the DNS response is manipulated, and the user is directed to a malicious website hosted by the attacker instead of the legitimate comptia.org site.

In this case, the analyst observed that a user enters comptia.org into a web browser, but the website that appears is not the actual comptia.org site. Instead, it's a malicious site controlled by the attacker. This behavior indicates that the attacker has poisoned the DNS server, causing the server to return the wrong IP address for the domain name comptia.org.
