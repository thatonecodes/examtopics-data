In most companies, authorized AP are being controlled and setup to use some form of connection/login control and encryption for users to connect to the AP and access the network. A rogue AP are not setup to provide such controls and encryption and thus are a Security Risk. Rogue AP allows anyone to connect to the network thru the rogue AP and still able to obtain IP from the actual DHCP server, and (depending on any further security prevention) access to company information. Another security issue is Rogue AP may imitate actual company AP and obtain login credentials. Also, actual company users may access thru the rogue AP and transmit information wirelessly without encryption and thus allowing MITM attack to obtain informations.","comments":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"285319","poster":"eR1csg","timestamp":"1612677660.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"285321","upvote_count":"2","content":"The arguements of unplugging a person own computer to plug in rogue devices is kind of dragging the questions and answers too much.
