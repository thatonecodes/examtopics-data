This streamlines the authentication process, enhances user experience, and improves security by centralizing user authentication and access control.","timestamp":"1707770760.0","poster":"actingnurse1","comment_id":"979531"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1691865960,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"bhaQMzwpjeXyd8IUUp9N","exam_id":357,"answer_ET":"C","question_id":477,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Jitter\n\nJitter is the variation in delay of packet transmission over a network. In the case of a satellite WAN link, the signals travel a significant distance to reach the satellite in orbit and then back down to the ground station. This round-trip distance introduces noticeable latency, and variations in this latency are known as jitter.","comment_id":"992486","timestamp":"1724867040.0","upvote_count":"6","poster":"Hchfyvggjg"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1687450740,"choices":{"B":"Collisions","A":"Duplex","C":"Jitter","D":"Encapsulation"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/112966-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-528-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-06-22 18:19:00","isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_text":"A company has a geographically remote office.

In this case, where there are multiple switches and dual firewalls in a high availability (HA) setup, enabling STP would help prevent any potential loops that could disrupt network stability.","timestamp":"1723488540.0","poster":"actingnurse1"}],"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/112967-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-529-discussion/","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1687450800,"answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"lCZXqYWILhB4KTsBI4gK","choices":{"A":"FHRP","D":"STP","B":"LACP","C":"OSPF"},"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/69993-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-53-discussion/","topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-01-14 08:03:00","answer_description":"","answer":"A","question_id":479,"question_text":"Which of the following technologies provides a failover mechanism for the default gateway?","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1642143780,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"523389","timestamp":"1657774980.0","content":"First-hop\nredundancy protocols (FHRPs) work by giving you a way to configure more than\none physical router to appear as if they were only a single logical one.","upvote_count":"35","poster":"Pongsathorn"},{"poster":"RobJob","content":"Selected Answer: A\nfirst hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) is a computer networking protocol which is designed to protect the default gateway used on a subnetwork by allowing two or more routers to provide backup for that address","timestamp":"1662602580.0","comment_id":"563014","upvote_count":"22"},{"poster":"fritts","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1731856860.0","comment_id":"1212906","content":"Selected Answer: D\nusing an FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol) provides a fail over by providing multipathing for your default gateway. \n\nLACP (Link Aggregation Protocol) is combining two physical interfaces into one logical channel\n\nSTP (Spanning Tree Protocol) is preventing against switching loops\n\nOSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol that uses I believe its a cost metric to calculate the best/ most efficient path to take."},{"timestamp":"1729896600.0","content":"why no ospf :(","upvote_count":"1","poster":"BozoBenty","comment_id":"1202275"},{"comment_id":"1062499","upvote_count":"1","poster":"phoenix98","timestamp":"1714862460.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nredundancy protocol (FHRP) \nProvisioning failover routers to serve \nas the default gateway for a subnet. \nAlso referred to as Virtual Router"},{"comment_id":"828831","poster":"Zemuran","timestamp":"1693816980.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFHRP is used to prevent network failure at a default gateway.

Proxy server\n\nA proxy server is commonly used to filter web traffic based on content. By acting as an intermediary between the user and the internet, a proxy server can inspect the content of the web requests and responses. This allows organizations to implement content filtering policies, restrict access to certain websites, and enhance security by blocking malicious content.\n\nOptions B (Load balancer), C (Media converter), and D (Access point) do not typically perform content filtering:\n\n- B. A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure efficient use of resources. It is not designed for content filtering.\n- C. A media converter is used to convert between different types of media signals (e.g., between copper and fiber optic), and it does not perform content filtering.\n- D.
