However, if an attacker intercepts an encrypted message, they can still tamper with the message or replace it with a different one. Encryption alone does not provide any assurance that the original message has not been tampered with.\n\nTo ensure message integrity, additional measures such as message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures can be used in combination with encryption.
