Special characters for use in passwords are a selection of punctuation characters that are present on standard U.S. keyboards. These include !\"#$%&’()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_’{|}~.

The users can still create a 14 character dictionary password without using special characters (!\"#$%&’()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_’{|}~) unless you implement complexity to the password settings. Even then, they can still create passwords like Password12345!! or Windows54321++ so the words can still be found in dictionaries.
