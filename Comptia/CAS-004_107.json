Implement OpenID Connect with granular scopes for data access. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a widely adopted identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides authentication services. OIDC allows for secure user authentication and supports session management with features such as session expiration and revocation, helping mitigate session takeover risks. By using granular scopes, the system can define fine-grained permissions for data access, helping to meet the requirement for controlling access and ensuring compliance with data handling practices. It also supports the ability to revoke access if a system compromise is suspected, as OAuth 2.0 allows for token revocation.","comment_id":"1346280"}],"timestamp":"2025-01-25 02:31:00","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155358-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-577-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"A security architect is making recommendations for a new system that will be built to store and exchange health records.

Persistence: Persistence refers to maintaining access to a system over time. If an attacker uses a buffer overflow to escalate privileges, it could be an attempt to establish or maintain access to the system after initial exploitation. A file integrity monitoring alert triggered by an escalation indicates the attacker may be attempting to gain elevated privileges to remain in the system and continue the attack. This is closely aligned with the Persistence phase, where the attacker aims to establish a foothold for continued access."}],"answer_description":"","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1737768960,"question_images":[],"question_text":"During an active attack, a security analyst evaluated a system for indicators of compromise.

It can be implemented using relatively inexpensive hardware or even existing infrastructure, like local servers or dedicated caching devices.\nBandwidth Preservation: By storing frequently accessed data locally, the satellite office reduces the need to repeatedly download the same data over the limited bandwidth connection, which preserves bandwidth.\nImproved Speed: Accessing cached data locally is much faster than downloading it over a constrained network connection, which improves speed for both internal and external resources.\nThreat Visibility: Local caching does not compromise security as the cached data can still be monitored and scanned by local security infrastructure.","upvote_count":"8"},{"comment_id":"1299479","timestamp":"1729206840.0","poster":"IT_Master_Tech","upvote_count":"3","content":"B."},{"timestamp":"1719926220.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nKeyword is budget constraints.","poster":"cyspec","comment_id":"1240813","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"loucrass","timestamp":"1714089600.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nLocal caching is the correct answer","comment_id":"1202296","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1131241","poster":"Trap_D0_r","timestamp":"1706146320.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt's CDN\nPreserve Bandwidth -- CDN Caches data so external resources eat less local bandwidth since they are retrieving via CDN.\nIncrease Speed -- CDN increases speed by being geographical dispersed, and handling queries for content to and from the local site.\nNot sacrificing threat visibility -- CDN again.
