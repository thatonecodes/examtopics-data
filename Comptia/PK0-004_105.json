While this technique can be effective in some situations, it may not be the best approach in this case for a few reasons:\n\n The vendor's aggressive behavior is not the main issue at hand. The project manager is more concerned with completing the project successfully, rather than addressing the vendor's behavior.\n\n The project is almost completed, and there may not be enough time to fully address the vendor's behavior.\n\n Forcing the vendor to change their behavior may not be practical or effective, especially if the project is almost completed and the vendor is no longer needed for the project.\n\nOverall, the smoothing technique may be more effective in this situation because it allows the project manager to focus on the goal of completing the project, while minimizing the impact of the vendor's behavior on the project.","poster":"kmanb","comment_id":"767279"}],"poster":"jksdbfb","timestamp":"1662761100.0"}]}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"sE1wZXI5nsgOf2HTu2Dm","timestamp":"2023-01-06 05:45:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe best document to reference in this scenario would be the project charter.\n\nThe project charter is a document that outlines the high-level details of the project, including the project's purpose, objectives, stakeholders, deliverables, and resources.
