When the DHCP scope is exhausted, new devices trying to connect to the network won't receive an IP address, leading to connection issues. This scenario is consistent with the symptoms described, where the TV couldn't connect initially, but the technician was able to connect it the next day, possibly after some IP addresses were released from the DHCP pool.

An incorrect pinout on the patch cable is being used.\n\nThe total length of the cables (177ft from core switch to access switch + 115ft from access switch to wall jack + 26ft patch cable) is well within the Ethernet limit of 100 meters (approximately 328 feet). Therefore, the cable distance is not exceeded.\n\nThe use of both UTP and STP cables in a network is not typically an issue, and the plenum rating of a cable refers to its fire safety rating, not its ability to transmit data.\n\nHowever, if the patch cables were not properly crimped, resulting in an incorrect pinout, this could prevent the network connection from being established. Incorrect pinout means that the wires inside the Ethernet cable are not arranged correctly, which can disrupt the data transmission.

The fact that the existing cable runs (177ft and 115ft) are working, while the newly crimped patch cables in the room are causing connection problems for users, suggests that there may be a problem with the pinout configuration on the newly crimped cables.\n\nThe total cable distance of 150ft (54m + 35m) is well within the Ethernet distance limitations, so the cable distance itself is not the likely cause of the issue.
