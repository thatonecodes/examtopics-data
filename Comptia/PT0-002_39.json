Check for an open relay configuration: An open relay SMTP server allows anyone on the internet to send email through it without authentication. This is a significant vulnerability that can be exploited to send phishing emails. By identifying and exploiting an open relay, the penetration tester can use the SMTP server to send phishing emails in later stages of the assessment.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Test for RFC-defined protocol conformance: While important for understanding how the SMTP service adheres to standards, it doesn’t directly contribute to enabling phishing activities.\n\nB. Attempt to brute force authentication to the service: This might help in gaining unauthorized access to the SMTP server, but it is not specifically aimed at enabling phishing.\n\nC.
