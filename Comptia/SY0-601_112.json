Compensating control\n\nIn a legacy system where modern security practices or network segmentation may not be fully implemented, a compensating control could be used to provide additional security or restrict access. In this case, the host-based firewall rule allowing connections from specific internal IP addresses serves as a compensating control to restrict access and enhance security within the limitations of the legacy environment.","comment_id":"1008577","upvote_count":"2","poster":"touisuzuki"},{"timestamp":"1693294380.0","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"992888","poster":"John_Ferguson","content":"Selected Answer: A\nKey word being legacy here, so it's compensating"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Abdul2107","comment_id":"968014","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
