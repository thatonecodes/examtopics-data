With that being said the google IP address might not be cached and it’s outside your LAN because if you notice the DNS and Gateway are the same. The DDoS attack against a DNS server would be a DNS flood where queries for entries do not exist fill up the cache and leads to resource exhaustion so that leaves just C as the most correct answer. Also if the Recursive DNS can’t find the IP address cached it goes to the authoritative DNS server.
