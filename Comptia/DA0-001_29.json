The number of datapoints increases each day by approximately 20% of the total number from the day before. If on a given day the number of datapoints was 8,798, the total number of datapoints on the next day should be approximately 20% higher than this number. This means that the total number of datapoints on the next day should be around 8,798 + (20% * 8,798) = 8,798 + (1.6 * 8,798) = 8,798 + 14,087.6 = 22,885.6.

Normalize the variables. Normalization is the process of scaling a variable to have a values between 0 and 1. This can be done by subtracting the minimum value of the variable from all the values, and then dividing the resulting values by the range (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). Normalizing the variables ensures that they all have the same weight in the score calculation, since they are all on the same scale. The other options would not have the same effect.
