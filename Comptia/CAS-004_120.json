Use an out-of-band method to obtain the certificate. Certificate pinning involves associating (or \"pinning\") a specific certificate or public key to a particular host or service. In this case, pinning the X.509 certificate to the device means the device will only trust a specific certificate for that remote host, ensuring the identity of the remote host can be verified.\nBefore pinning a certificate, you must first securely obtain the correct certificate from the remote host. This is typically done via an out-of-band method, meaning you get the certificate securely through a trusted channel (e.g., via secure email, a trusted administrator, or a physical method) to ensure you're not receiving a potentially compromised certificate from an untrusted or attacker-controlled source.\nOnce you have the correct certificate, you can then store (pin) it to the device and compare any future certificates presented by the remote host against the pinned certificate to ensure the identity is genuine.","comment_id":"1365158","poster":"Bright07"}],"timestamp":"2025-03-05 01:14:00","choices":{"D":"Compare the retrieved certificate with the embedded certificate.","C":"Use an out-of-band method to obtain the certificate.","B":"Extract the private key from the certificate.","A":"Use Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) for the certificate."}},{"id":"dcFb77dbzMZgNryrDVqy","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"exam_id":343,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/168899-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-639-discussion/","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1741741980,"isMC":true,"question_id":597,"question_images":[],"question_text":"A company recently acquired a SaaS company and performed a gap analysis.

The attacker obtained the systems' private keys. New key pairs must be generated. The fact that the web server was running an outdated version of OpenSSL is a significant clue. OpenSSL vulnerabilities, such as those discovered in Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160), can allow attackers to access private keys used for encrypting communications. If an attacker can access the private keys, they can potentially decrypt traffic or impersonate the server, leading to unauthorized access to systems, as seen in this case with logins after normal business hours. Since the user confirms that the log-ins after hours were unauthorized, it suggests that an attacker may have gained access to the private keys through a vulnerability in the outdated OpenSSL version, allowing them to log in with the compromised credentials.
