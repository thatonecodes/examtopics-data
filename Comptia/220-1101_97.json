Connection latency: The ping tests (ping of the default gateway and ping of the localhost) will help determine the latency or delay in establishing communication with these destinations. Higher latency could indicate network congestion or connectivity issues.\n\nE.

Connection latency\nThe ping and tracert commands measure response times, helping to determine network latency between the laptop and the default gateway.\nC. Firewall status\nIf the ping of the localhost (127.0.0.1) fails, it could indicate that the local firewall is blocking ICMP requests, which suggests a firewall is active.\n\nA. DNS suffix – These tests check connectivity, not DNS settings. The ipconfig /all command would show the DNS suffix.\nD. Wireless signal strength – These commands do not measure signal strength.

DNS is used for address translation, while DHCP is used for IP address assignment.\n\nExplanation:\n\nDNS (Domain Name System) is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. It resolves human-readable domain names like \"example.com\" into machine-readable IP addresses like \"192.0.2.1\". Essentially, it maps domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.\n\nDHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings (like subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server addresses, etc.) to devices on a network. It dynamically provides IP addresses to devices, allowing them to communicate with other devices and services on the network.\n\nTherefore, while DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, DHCP handles the assignment of IP addresses to devices on a network.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Duke_CT"}],"unix_timestamp":1715563800,"question_id":485,"answer":"A","exam_id":339,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"question_text":"Which of the following describes the difference between a DNS server and a DHCP server?","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-05-13 03:30:00","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140465-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-535-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"id":339,"provider":"Comptia","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":625,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"220-1101","isBeta":false},"currentPage":97},"__N_SSP":true}
