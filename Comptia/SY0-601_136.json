Most modern browsers and other applications that use digital certificates can use OCSP to check CRLs automatically for certificate validity. OCSP permits users (through Internet browser and other certificate-aware applications) to check for certificate expiration, suspension, and revocation before the certificate is accepted.”\n“The CA publishes a certificate revocation list (CRL) that contains the certificates the entity has issued and subsequently revoked. Users can access this list to determine the validity of a certificate. If a certificate has been revoked, it is considered no longer valid and cannot be used.

The HIDS will ONLY tell you when there is a problem, it doesn't do anything to stop it. Therefore, still allowing any problem to persist. \nIf you disable unnecessary services (A.), then you stop the problem right at the source where it starts.","timestamp":"1716938280.0"},{"comment_id":"1203183","poster":"Geronemo","timestamp":"1714231800.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nHere's why:\n\nMinimizing attack surface: By disabling unnecessary services, the security team reduces the attack surface of the servers. Services running on non-standard ports for applications that are no longer in use can be potential entry points for attackers. Disabling these services removes unnecessary points of vulnerability.\nReducing resource utilization: Unnecessary services consume system resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. Disabling these services can free up resources, potentially improving the performance and stability of the servers without impacting production services.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - This is because the question mentions that there are non-standard ports open for applications that are no longer in use.
