Mostly, we have two factor, first one may be the normal login credentials and the second one can be an otp(one time password) or biometrics such as fingure prints or some kind of software token.\nIn OTP, when a user puts correct credentials then an otp is sent to the user via sms or email and the user needs to verify that in order to get authenticated. This helps increasing the security and is widely used in many fields such as payment gateway, organizations sensitive data handling etc.\n\nSSO is a single sign on option where user needs to put a single credential.\nRADIUS is used for authentication scenarios but not for multifactor authentication. It is based on client server protocol.\nTransitive trust is used in case of domains. It can be one way as well as two way.
