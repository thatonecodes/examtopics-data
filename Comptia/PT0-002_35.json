A trie is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Tries are well-suited for this kind of comparison task because they can quickly look up strings by their prefixes, which is useful for matching against a large set of strings to find the correct one.\n\nA trie provides efficient insertion and search functionalities, which are typically faster than binary search trees for strings.
