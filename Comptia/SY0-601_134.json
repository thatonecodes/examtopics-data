This way, users do not need to create and remember multiple usernames and passwords for different websites. OpenID also gives users more control over their personal information and privacy.\nSSO(Single Sign-on) is a similar concept to OpenID, but it is usually implemented within a specific domain or organization, such as a company or a school.","poster":"johnabayot"},{"timestamp":"1715216400.0","comment_id":"1208613","content":"Selected Answer: D\nit's D. the reason why A is not right, becasue SSo doesn't necessarily increase the user base.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"spearous"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1715074560.0","content":"SSO (Single Sign-On) allows users to securely authenticate across multiple applications or websites with one set of credentials.

Public information presents no risk to an organization if it is disclosed but does present a risk if it is modified or not available.\nConfidential (secret)—the information is highly sensitive, for viewing only by approved persons within the owner organization, and possibly by trusted third parties under NDA.\nCritical (top secret)—the information is too valuable to allow any risk of its capture.
