I researched this quite a bit. Then in the book \"All-In-One Comptia Server+ Certification\" Exam Guide, on page 94 I found what they (CompTia) are looking for. They referred to Server Installation \"Methods\" and listed \"Core\" (as well as GUI). Obviously, Core will take less resources. \"Bare Metal\" is used for better performance and having direct access to the hardware (as you do not share it with other clients). Also (fyi) a Bare Metal Hypervisor is a Bare Metal server but with a Hypervisor installed which also restricts some access to direct hardware (type1 vs type2).

This involves a series of steps that should result in a server that offers a minimum of attack points to a hacker. Let's look at six steps that can lead to this result.\n\nDisable Unused Services/Close Unneeded Ports\nAny services that are not required on the server should be disabled. Only those required for the server to perform its role in the network should be left on. The easiest way to do this is to install a host firewall on the system and adopt a “disable by default” policy with respect to services by closing the port used for the service.
