AirPrint utilises a wireless network, so access must be granted. The only options left are USB and Bluetooth. The question doesn't state anything about not using a 'wireless connection'. It only says about the wireless network. Another keyword is 'granted access', which clearly states about the company's wireless network, not the wireless connection.","comment_id":"691349"},{"comment_id":"546771","timestamp":"1644791280.0","poster":"ElPato80","upvote_count":"3","content":"It think because they say without wireless we must eliminate Airprint, NFC and Bluetooth. Parallel, Serial and USB are wired. Serial is not used on mobile devices like laptops, tablets and phones. USB is the newer wired connection for printers and new laptops and tablets/phones use USB to make connections, so USB is one answer. Parallel could be the other answer because older laptops might have this connection or if we used a USB to Parallel adapter it could work maybe. That is my reasoning for the answer in terms of not using wireless."},{"timestamp":"1629880560.0","comment_id":"431280","upvote_count":"3","content":"The answer is definitely NFC and BT.

The reason being, the question says they should not have access to the network. With Airprint, you will have to access the printer through the local area network. The other options aren't available with phones. The only two that are available with phones and won't give you access to the network are NFC and BT.

A PC will post with a faulty hard drive and with no hard drive.\n\nIncompatible Ram is strange phrasing. Ram can be incompatible physically and electronically. If it's incompatible physically it isn't going to even be on the motherboard. If it's incompatible electronically it will most likely post but not be at the right frequency or be at a lower clock speed. It is unlikely that it would not post probably not impossible but unlikely. I've seen questions like this before regarding PC upgrades and PC not posting. Seems like CompTIA wants you to know that bios updates can make sure PC parts like the processor are compatible which is true. I would go with CPU support as the issue."},{"comment_id":"439795","timestamp":"1630856040.0","content":"The system will still post without hard drives installed.
