All of the ports in the target range are closed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nB. The response received (RST packets) is definitive and indicates the state of the ports, so additional time would not change these results.\nC. The ports listed (21-25, 67, 80, 139, 8080) are primarily TCP ports (except for port 67 which is typically used for DHCP, a UDP service). However, the response being an RST indicates the scan was conducted over TCP.\nD. If the ports were open, the target would not send RST packets in response to a Xmas scan. Typically, open ports would simply ignore the Xmas scan packet (no response).","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000"},{"poster":"aee9303","content":"There are a few circumstances in which a TCP packet might not be expected; the two most common are:\n\nThe packet is an initial SYN packet trying to establish a connection to a server port on which no process is listening.\n\nThe packet arrives on a TCP connection that was previously established, but the local application already closed its socket or exited and the OS closed the socket.\nOther circumstances are possible, but are unlikely outside of malicious behavior such as attempts to hijack a TCP connection.","comment_id":"1163933","timestamp":"1709355720.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Big_Dre","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709219100.0","comment_id":"1162730","content":"Selected Answer: A\nall targeted ports are close"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/134913-exam-pt0-002-topic-1-question-293-discussion/","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1709219100,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"The ports in the target range cannot be scanned because they are common UDP ports.","A":"All of the ports in the target range are closed.","D":"All of the ports in the target range are open.","B":"Nmap needs more time to scan the ports in the target range."},"question_id":216,"exam_id":362,"question_text":"During a vulnerability scan a penetration tester enters the following Nmap command against all of the non-Windows clients:\n\nnmap –sX –T4 –p 21-25, 67, 80, 139, 8080 192.168.11.191\n\nThe penetration tester reviews the packet capture in Wireshark and notices that the target responds with an RST packet flag set for all of the targeted ports.

If a variable in C/C++ is not initialized, it contains whatever value happens to be at that memory location. Using this uninitialized variable can lead to unpredictable and incorrect program behavior. In Java, local variables must be initialized before use, but instance variables are automatically initialized to default values. However, not explicitly initializing variables can still lead to logical errors.\n\n\nB. This is not accurate. In C/C++, uninitialized variables contain garbage values, not null. In Java, uninitialized instance variables of object type are set to null, but local variables must be explicitly initialized.\nC. Race conditions are related to concurrent access to shared resources in multi-threaded environments, not to the initialization state of individual variables.\nD.

When a variable is declared, it is created in the memory with an undefined value. Initialization gives this variable a defined value.\n\nIn different programming languages, variable initialization can look slightly different.
