This means that the cost of the solid-state storage was $10 million * 50% = $5 million. We also know that the company is estimating that 5% of the solid-state storage will need to be replaced per year. This means that the annual cost of replacing the storage is $5 million * 5% = $250,000.\n\nTo determine the ALE, we need to multiply the annual cost of replacement by the probability that the replacement will be necessary. In this case, the probability that the replacement will be necessary is 5%, so the ALE is $250,000 * 5% = $12,500.\n\nTherefore, the ALE due to storage replacement is $12,500."},{"timestamp":"1668311580.0","poster":"Protocol0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n10m*.05 = 500k","comment_id":"717078","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","exam_id":343,"choices":{"A":"$50,000","D":"$500,000","B":"$125,000","E":"$1,000,000","C":"$250,000"},"answers_community":["C (90%)","6%"],"unix_timestamp":1668311580,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","question_text":"A company invested a total of $10 million for a new storage solution installed across five on-site datacenters.
