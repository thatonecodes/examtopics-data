I know this is where the discussions start falling off. Study all the PBQs because all of them were on my exam. A lot of people in this community did a great job at explaining concepts, really remember them. I did so many other practice test and this was by far the best. I failed the first time by one question the second time by 2 questions (while using other practice test). Found this source and benefited the most from it. Also really take a look at the new questions added because if I didn't do that last night, I don't think I would have managed to scrap on by and pass. Good luck everyone and thanks for all the useful information.","timestamp":"1705422780.0","poster":"Bmack2134","comment_id":"1124354","comments":[{"timestamp":"1705552260.0","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"1125541","poster":"david124","content":"Thank you for your post kind sir! may god bless you."}]},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1713132720.0","poster":"mikzer","comment_id":"1195705","content":"Thanks, Bmack.
