Logging and monitoring are done by the service provider.\n\nWhen using a public cloud service, the responsibility for logging and monitoring typically lies with the service provider. Public cloud service providers have robust logging and monitoring systems in place to ensure the security, performance, and availability of their services.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"935905"},{"timestamp":"1680685320.0","comment_id":"861918","poster":"ksr933","upvote_count":"1","content":"Comptia material says SLA\nLogging and Monitoring\nAgain, as part of standard secure software development practices, the API should provide sufficient logging and monitoring. Monitoring should provide alerts when an API is being bombarded with requests in a potential DoS attack, or being subject to multiple authentication or other errors, indicating a potential brute force or fuzzing attack.\n\nAnother potential issue is if the cloud provider does not supply access to log files or monitoring tools.

Use the Built-in Activity Monitoring\nAll leading cloud providers can be set to monitor every cloud activity — human, script or API-based — basically at no cost other than the storage used. These cloud activity logs can be sizable and verbose, so most enterprises keep them in the cloud to reduce bandwidth costs, allowing for larger datasets and longer retention.\n\n2. Activate Logging on Everything You can and Retain it For at Least a Year\nIn addition to activity logs, the leading cloud providers offer detailed logging for every IaaS/PaaS capability offered — networking, containers, serverless and other services. The best practice is to log everything possible, including network flow logs. This pervasive visibility can be baselined and analyzed for patterns, providing the foundation for behavioral analytics-based threat detection","comment_id":"716693","timestamp":"1668258180.0"},{"comments":[{"poster":"SolventCourseisSCAM","timestamp":"1667845200.0","content":"I am changing my answer to D","comment_id":"713233","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nwhen entering public cloud relationship, before beginning to use public cloud service, there is a SLA/contract which mentions how the logging and monitoring service works while using the service.
