It's either A or D, with A seeming to be more likely.

Unzip -v decompresses and then extracts the files and directories contained.\nthe -v just shows the listing of the files as they are being extracted\nB. bzip2 -z is just doing compression\nC. gzip is also just doing compression here (there is no -d to decompress and the -d wouldn't extract, just decompress)\nD. funzip is only designed to decompress and extract .zip files, whereas the question asks for a undisclosed format.

It is part of the Info-ZIP suite and is used to extract the contents of a single file from a compressed .zip archive, sending the decompressed data to standard output (stdout).

We can see that there is a local DNS entry mapping portal.comptia.org -> 10.10.10.55. But, the actual DNS resolution, from the `host` command, is different, portal.comptia.org -> 192.168.1.55. Something is taking priority over the local DNS in /etc/hosts. If we delete the entry in /etc/hosts, I doubt it will resolve our connection problem, because the system is getting its DNS resolution from something else, possibly a cache.\nI think we should flush the local DNS cache and try again. We should also verify what is the correct IP it should resolve to. Perhaps we SHOULD also remove the entry from /etc/hosts, but for the reason that the private DNS server (at 10.10.10.5) should be responsible for resolving DNS, not workstations."}],"answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (67%)","D (33%)"],"unix_timestamp":1708376100,"answer":"B","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Update the name server in resolv.conf to use an external DNS server.","D":"Clear the local DNS cache on the workstation and rerun the host command.","B":"Remove the entry for portal.comptia.org from the local hosts file.","C":"Add a network route from the 10.10.10.0/24 to the 192.168.0.0/16."},"isMC":true,"question_text":"A Linux administrator is troubleshooting an issue in which users are not able to access https://portal.comptia.org from a specific workstation.
