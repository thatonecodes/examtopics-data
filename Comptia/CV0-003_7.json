DLP solutions can identify, monitor, and protect sensitive data by enforcing policies that prevent unauthorized access, sharing, or copying of data. By monitoring outbound traffic, DLP solutions can also detect and prevent data exfiltration attempts, ensuring that data remains secure while hosted in the cloud. HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System) can detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity on the server. FIM (File Integrity Monitoring) can detect changes to files or configurations, helping to identify any unauthorized modifications. WAF (Web Application Firewall) can protect web applications against common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery. However, WAF is not specifically designed to protect against data exfiltration.","poster":"BeauChateau","timestamp":"1713202080.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"971106","poster":"Tomtom11","content":"Data loss prevention is a security solution that identifies and helps prevent unsafe or inappropriate sharing, transfer, or use of sensitive data.

Implement microsegmentation on the network.\n\nMicrosegmentation is a security technique that divides a network into smaller, isolated segments or microsegments. Each microsegment can have its own security policies and controls. This is an effective approach to prevent lateral movement by limiting communication between different parts of the network. If lateral-moving malware infects one segment, it won't be able to easily propagate to other segments because communication is restricted.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1011075"},{"timestamp":"1686409380.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"920145","poster":"SecPlus2022","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"Another characteristic of APTs is that they move laterally by exploiting open ports and gaps in firewall rules.
