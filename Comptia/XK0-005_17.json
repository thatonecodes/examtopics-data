The feature allows administrators to create policies that specify which applications are allowed to access the network and what actions are allowed for each application.\n\nThe main objective of Application Control is to ensure the security and privacy of information by controlling the applications that are allowed to access the network. This helps to prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, and other security risks that may arise from the use of unapproved applications. By enforcing policies on allowed applications, administrators can ensure that sensitive information remains secure and confidential.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: D.

It allows administrators to define and enforce policies for application usage, helping to secure the system by controlling which applications can execute and how they interact with the network. The focus is on enhancing security and managing the traffic associated with various applications.","poster":"salthehash","timestamp":"1717296120.0","comment_id":"1085703","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"I have a startup that utilizes some sophisticated technology.

To assist the firewall blade with handling traffic.\n\nApplication Control is a security feature that allows administrators to control and manage application usage by defining rules that specify which applications are allowed or blocked from running on the network. The main objective of Application Control is to assist the firewall blade with handling traffic by allowing administrators to define and enforce policies based on the specific applications or application categories. This enables administrators to block known vulnerabilities and exploits that could be used to compromise network security, as well as to prevent unauthorized applications from running on the network.","poster":"KnifeClown1","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"807425","timestamp":"1691925600.0"},{"poster":"Veteran903","comment_id":"726952","content":"right answer is D","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1685025600.0"},{"comments":[{"content":"The main objective of Application Control is to ensure security and privacy of information by controlling and monitoring the applications that are allowed to run on a network or device.

Users can fine-tune the rate at which a Linux kernel can move pages into and out of active memory using the swappable parameter, which can be set between 0 and 200. The higher the number, the more aggressively the VM swaps data to disk. By default, the swappiness value on most Linux computers is set to 60. The user can change this level to a different setting either temporarily or indefinitely.\nSome database servers managed cache to use RAM, and is capable of managing what should be in RAM and what shouldn’t be.
