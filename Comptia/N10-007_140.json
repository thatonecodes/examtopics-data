The question states that patch panel to wall jack is within spec, but if you then run a cable to a table, that's adding distance. Neither the patch panel in the IDF nor the wall jacks amplify/boost the signal, so that signal has basically attenuated throughout the trip between MDF <--> IDF <--> wall jack <--> table. IDF <--> wall jack may be in spec, but the total distance may not be. A switch re-transmits the signal (ie. resets the max distance). Placing a repeater between the switch and each wall jack would work, but you'd lose all the other benefits of having a switch. While a repeater may be a good option, a switch is more effective in this case since there are so many cables and repeaters usually only work for an individual cable. Switch has other benefits aside from boosting the signal, so it is a better option than putting repeaters all over the place behind walls."},{"comment_id":"404231","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1626042060.0","poster":"jojomax","content":"The answer here is... both!
