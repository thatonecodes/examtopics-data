Security-related shortcomings have seen the usage of the Telnet protocol drop rapidly,[11] especially on the public Internet, in favor of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, first released in 1995. SSH has practically replaced Telnet, and the older protocol is used these days only in rare cases to access decades-old legacy equipment that does not support more modern protocols.\"","comment_id":"695679","poster":"NotAHackerJustYet","upvote_count":"11"}]},{"id":"uNKbaW5yNngdr2WEUi9E","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"A":"DVI","D":"Lightning","C":"USB","B":"eSATA"},"unix_timestamp":1692176880,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/118239-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-131-discussion/","topic":"1","exam_id":339,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe main answer is that a printer would typically use a USB or Ethernet connection.

Utilize a grounding strap.\n\nIt is important to ensure that the server remains properly grounded when working on it, particularly when handling internal components like RAM. This helps prevent static discharge which can damage delicate components like RAM. By using a grounding strap, the technician is connected to the earth ground and thus any static charge is safely discharged before it can cause harm. Additionally, it is not recommended to unplug one power cable as the redundant power supply may not provide sufficient power to the server. Verifying the RAM temperature is not necessary, as it is not the cause of the issue. And replacing the RAM while the server is running is not safe, as it may cause the server to crash or corrupt data.","upvote_count":"9","poster":"ronniehaang","timestamp":"1723656300.0","comment_id":"808739"},{"poster":"deverser","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"793868","timestamp":"1722408720.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis was on my exam from 1/25/23.
