Elasticity allows access to a large pool of compute resources.\n\n • Cloud platforms provide elasticity, allowing users to scale up or down the computing resources as needed, which is especially beneficial for resource-intensive ML/AI tasks.\n\nE. A pay-as-you-go approach allows the company to save money.\n\n • The pay-as-you-go model in the cloud allows companies to pay only for the resources they use, which can result in cost savings compared to maintaining and scaling on-premises infrastructure.\n\nThese advantages highlight the flexibility and cost efficiency that cloud environments offer for ML/AI workloads.","poster":"SophyQueenCR82","timestamp":"1723896780.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1267695"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["BE (100%)"],"answer":"BE","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-08-17 14:13:00","choices":{"A":"Cloud providers offer enhanced technical support.","E":"A pay-as-you-go approach allows the company to save money.","C":"The shared responsibility model offers greater security.","B":"Elasticity allows access to a large pool of compute resources.","D":"AI enables DevOps to build applications easier and faster.","F":"ML enables DevOps to build applications easier and faster."},"exam_id":344,"unix_timestamp":1723896780},{"id":"V3CZipIlaUGoZ6xoOvzR","topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1242002","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720091340.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nRecovery time objective (RTO)—specifies how quickly recovery needs to\noccur to maintain business continuity.
