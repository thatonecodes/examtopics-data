Using an ESD strap ensures that any static charge is safely discharged to ground, protecting the internal components from electrostatic damage.\nGrounding equipment, including the computer and work surface, helps to dissipate any static electricity and prevents electrostatic discharge from damaging internal components.

Placing the PSU in an antistatic bag are the best safety procedures to protect the internal components in the PC.\n\nAn ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) strap helps to prevent damage to sensitive electronic components by grounding the technician, thereby preventing any static electricity discharge. Placing the Power Supply Unit (PSU) in an antistatic bag can also protect it from electrostatic discharge during the replacement process.\n\nDisconnecting the computer from the power source is also important to prevent electrical shocks, but it will not protect the internal components from ESD. Ensuring proper ventilation and removing dust from the ventilation fans are important for maintaining the computer's cooling system but do not protect the internal components during a processor replacement. Ensuring equipment is grounded is also important but may not be sufficient to protect against ESD.","poster":"IconGT","comments":[{"content":"\"Prior to opening the computer\" is the key phrase here.
