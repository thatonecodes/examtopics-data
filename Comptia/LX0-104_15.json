It can convert text files from one encoding to another, allowing you to view or use text that was written in one character set on a computer or operating system that uses a different character set.\n\nThe iconv command is commonly used to convert text files between character sets, such as converting text encoded in ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8. The basic syntax for the command is:\n\niconv -f [input encoding] -t [output encoding] [input file] > [output file]\n\nwhere -f stands for \"from\" and -t stands for \"to\". The input file is specified as the last argument and the output file can be specified by redirecting the output to a file with the > operator.","timestamp":"1675983900.0","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"803757"}],"answer_description":""},{"id":"oOYOOLNkcxMmXOeDyaoS","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"In case neither cron.allow nor cron.deny exist in /etc/, which of the following is true?","timestamp":"2023-02-10 00:06:00","topic":"7","isMC":true,"exam_id":354,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98622-exam-lx0-104-topic-7-question-21-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer":"B","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1675983960,"choices":{"B":"Without additional configuration, all users may have user specific crontabs.","A":"Without additional configuration, no users may have user specific crontabs.","C":"The cron daemon will refuse to start and report missing files in the system's logfile.","D":"When a user creates a user specific crontab the system administrator must approve it explicitly."},"question_images":[],"question_id":72,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"803758","timestamp":"1675983960.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
