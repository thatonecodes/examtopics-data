The project manager's authority is limited, and they may not have the authority to make decisions or allocate resources. In this type of organization, the project manager may need to report project performance issues to the functional manager, who can then take appropriate action.","timestamp":"1676835240.0","comment_id":"814440","poster":"MJVIS"},{"content":"Functional or weak matrix could be answers. \nHere the PM has little authority and it's actually the department managers that maintains the most control.","poster":"ItsMeAgain99","comment_id":"688809","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1665159900.0"},{"content":"From reading all these questions I get that most of the time CompTIA wants to get the answers from the same question not assuming anything so if it doesn't say it reports to a functional manager it must be weak matrix because in that kind of matrix you do have a project manager but with limited authority","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1658978040.0","comment_id":"638407","poster":"Lagmental"},{"poster":"catastrophie","timestamp":"1650370200.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nGotta break this down into a few parts since you cant submit a large amount of text.\n\nI think if we slow down and look at the broader picture here, we can figure this out. I could be wrong (it’s happened once before lol). Anyways here are my thought on this, it’s lengthy so bear with me.\n\nFirst, we will take a look at what they are asking. \n\n“Which of the following organization types requires the project manager to report performance issues to another department?”\n\nThe initial thing I looked as was “requires a project manager” this would illude to the fact that there is a project manager present. This being the case that would eliminate both Functional and Weak Matrix. Both of those structures do not require the presence of a project manager and often times they are just coordinators or expeditors if they are involved.\n\nWe can further eliminate Functional because reporting under this structure is a top down or vertical reporting structure. If there was a project manager around, he would only report to the functional manager of that department.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"catastrophie","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1650370320.0","content":"And finally part 3.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is:\n1. A project manager is always involved in a strong matrix so there is no question like there is in a functional or weak matrix.\n2. The only way or reason a PM would have to report to another department is if they are also involved in the project. Within projectized you are not always working on the same project as the other project team.\n3. Within the strong matrix you maintain the functions or departments but manage from a horizontal structure which would require the PM to report any performance issues with another department that may be affected.\n4. It’s CompTIA so we can never assume things in questions like assuming there is a project manager in the functional org set up or weak matrix.","poster":"catastrophie","comment_id":"588139"}],"comment_id":"588137","content":"Part 2.\n\nOk so now onto the next part that will help eliminate another one. The question mentions reporting to another “department” \n\nWe can eliminate “projectized” since these are vertical reporting as well. In addition the projectized structure does not contain departments since resources from the various departments are formed into the vertical teams.\n\nBased on these key points I’ve came to the conclusion that a strong matrix or B would be the most appropriate answer for the question.","timestamp":"1650370320.0"}],"comment_id":"588136","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Wes_60","content":"I think answer is (A) Functional.

The purpose of the closure meeting is to identify what worked well, what did not work well, and what could be done differently in future projects.
