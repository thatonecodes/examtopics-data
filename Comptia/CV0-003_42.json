The date on the companyâ€™s identity server is configured incorrectly.\n\nTokens used for federated identity often have an expiration date for security reasons. If the date on the companyâ€™s identity server is incorrect, it could cause valid tokens to be considered expired. This would result in users receiving an error message indicating their tokens are expired, even when using the correct credentials.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1138085","timestamp":"1722562980.0"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1706845380},{"id":"pfesV1mKbfhLo71SZiDn","unix_timestamp":1687418040,"exam_id":349,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-06-22 09:14:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (43%)","B (29%)","D (29%)"],"question_id":207,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nExplanation:\nWhen deploying domain controllers in a public cloud environment with 500,000 users and objects, the lowest cost per I/O is crucial.

It connects hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs) to a computer or server using a point-to-point serial protocol, offering several advantages:\nHere are three benefits of using SAS storage over SSD\n1. Cost-Effectiveness: SAS drives generally offer a lower cost per gigabyte compared to high-capacity SSDs, making them more economical for large-scale storage needs, especially in environments where high capacity is required over speed.\n2. Reliability: SAS drives are designed for 24/7 operation and include advanced error recovery features, making them highly reliable for critical enterprise applications that require consistent uptime and data integrity.\n Yes, SSD has the highest I/O but is cost-intensive which makes it not the best option for this scenario."},{"timestamp":"1711652040.0","comment_id":"1184968","poster":"Therealjosh","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is da way"},{"timestamp":"1709163540.0","poster":"FasterN8","comment_id":"1162050","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSSD has the highest I/O by far and therefore the lowest cost per I/O."},{"timestamp":"1694668920.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nFor a scenario where you need to deploy domain controllers to authenticate a large number of users and computer objects with a focus on achieving the lowest cost per I/O, \"SAS\" (Serial Attached SCSI) storage would be a reasonable choice.\n\nSAS drives provide a good balance between performance and cost. They are often less expensive than Flash (solid-state drives or SSDs) but offer better I/O performance compared to traditional HDDs (hard disk drives).
