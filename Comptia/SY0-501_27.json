User-supplied input may contain code designed to interact with a database, manipulate the browsers or future visitors to the site, or perform any of a number of other attacks. Elsewhere in this series of courses, you've learned about some of those attacks, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting. One of the most important ways that we can protect against input-based attacks is the use of input validation. This technique filters user input, making sure that the input provided by end users does not contain malicious or otherwise unexpected values. There are two different approaches that you can take to input validation, whitelisting and blacklisting. Whitelisting is the most powerful approach to input validation. In this approach, the developer specifies the exact type of input that is allowed from the end user, and any input not matching that specification is rejected","comments":[{"poster":"study_Somuch","comment_id":"102438","upvote_count":"2","content":"As above, answer is C. Input Validation is the first layer of defense. Error handling comes in after the input is submitted and then passed to another process:\n\nInput validation means checking the data before performing operations that could fail, for example: check for malicious or unexpected values. (divide by zero, or a word like \"apple\" when a number is expected)\n\nError handling means well defined behavior IF an operation fails, for example if a database query times out.\n\nHow to choose between the two depends on what you are doing. It is not elegant to use error handling to catch a 0 divisor since you can easily check it with Input Validation before, but you have to use error handling on operations that communicate with other resources (database queries or TCP sockets will fail, or even disks will run out of space).","timestamp":"1591281420.0"}]}],"comment_id":"100189"},{"comment_id":"96780","upvote_count":"2","content":"I think answer is C input validation","poster":"Sunmmy","timestamp":"1590582420.0"},{"comment_id":"76734","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1587357600.0","content":"B.
