Once the tester has the hashes, they can then use PsExec, a command-line utility from Sysinternals, to pass the hash to the remote system and authenticate with the new credentials. This provides the tester with persistence on the system, allowing them to access it even after a reboot.\n\n\"A penetration tester who has extracted password hashes from the lsass.exe memory process can use various tools to pass the hash and gain access to other systems using the same credentials. One tool commonly used for this purpose is Mimikatz, which can extract plaintext passwords from memory or provide a pass-the-hashcapability. After gaining access to a system, the tester can use various tools for persistence, such as PsExec or WMI.\" (CompTIA PenTest+ Study Guide, p. 186)","comment_id":"837142"},{"timestamp":"1709947140.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"nickwen007","comments":[{"content":"D is correct","comment_id":"833748","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1709974740.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"content":"lsass.exe is a Windows process that is responsible for local security authentication and authorization.
