Retention policy.\n\nReasoning:\n\nSecurity policy: While a security policy is important for protecting sensitive information, it doesn't specifically address the retention and destruction of records.\nClassification policy: A classification policy helps categorize information based on its sensitivity and value, but it doesn't provide guidelines for how long records should be retained or when they should be destroyed.\nRetention policy: A retention policy establishes rules for how long different types of records should be kept and when they can be destroyed. This is exactly what the company needs to meet compliance requirements and minimize the number of records it needs to store.\nAccess control policy: An access control policy governs who can access different types of information. While it's important for data protection, it doesn't directly address the retention and destruction of records.\nTherefore, a retention policy is the best option for the company to meet its requirements of keeping the fewest records possible, meeting compliance needs, and ensuring destruction of records that are no longer needed.","poster":"Glacier88"},{"timestamp":"1724263200.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"jafyyy","content":"C\nRetention policy specifies how long a record should be kept & when it should be disposed.","comment_id":"1270322"}],"choices":{"D":"Access control policy","A":"Security policy","B":"Classification policy","C":"Retention policy"},"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/146272-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-261-discussion/"},{"id":"UHf39PGiAuzjE9gIUq2s","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1271797","upvote_count":"7","poster":"pokii1992","timestamp":"1724524380.0","content":"A. Code repositories\n\nCode repositories often contain hardcoded credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information that developers may accidentally commit without proper security measures. This can expose these credentials when the code is shared or made public, leading to unintentional leakage of corporate credentials in cloud environments."},{"poster":"fmeox567","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1316306","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Code repositories\n\nExplanation: Code repositories (such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) are frequently used for storing and sharing code, but they are often mishandled. Developers sometimes inadvertently upload sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or private credentials into these public or even private repositories. This can lead to accidental exposure, especially if the repository is not properly secured or if access controls are misconfigured.","timestamp":"1732279560.0"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_id":182,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is a common source of unintentional corporate credential leakage in cloud environments?","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":368,"topic":"1","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1723422240,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/145582-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-262-discussion/","choices":{"D":"State actors","E":"Vulnerability databases","B":"Dark web","A":"Code repositories","C":"Threat feeds"},"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2024-08-12 02:24:00"},{"id":"GP4anUUtjCn4S2swG1Si","question_id":183,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1271799","poster":"pokii1992","upvote_count":"7","content":"The answer C is the best reason because it directly addresses the core benefit of data classification policies:\n\nCreating security requirements based on classification levels allows organizations to implement tailored, appropriate security measures for different types of data. This approach ensures that the most sensitive information receives the highest level of protection, while less critical data may have less stringent controls. This targeted approach optimizes security efforts and resource allocation, providing a more effective and efficient way to protect an organization's information assets.","timestamp":"1724524740.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Non-credentialed scan\n\nA non-credentialed scan is a vulnerability scan conducted without using login credentials. This type of scan is limited to detecting vulnerabilities that are exposed without needing privileged access. Itâ€™s commonly used to assess what an external attacker could potentially see or exploit without having any system account access, which aligns with the scenario described.","comment_id":"1308220","poster":"ViciousAkira","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726153980.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWithout system account.","poster":"FrozenCarrot","comment_id":"1282695"},{"content":"A\nType of scan conducted without logging into the system","comment_id":"1270326","poster":"jafyyy","timestamp":"1724263500.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/146273-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-264-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2024-08-21 20:05:00"},{"id":"JiPnaItTiVbzhRQEz1I8","answer":"A","question_text":"A security administrator is hardening corporate systems and applying appropriate mitigations by consulting a real-world knowledge base for adversary behavior.
