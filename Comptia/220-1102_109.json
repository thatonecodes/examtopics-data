If the user is working remotely and not connected to the correct VPN site, they won't be able to access network resources like file servers.\n\nThe other options are less likely to affect a single user:\n\nB. The file server is offline: This would affect multiple users, not just one.\nC. A low battery: This wouldn't directly prevent network access.\nD.

Ransomware has infected the computer. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files on a victim's computer, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. When a user receives a message stating that files are encrypted and cannot be accessed, it is likely that ransomware has infected the computer. Cryptominers are malware that use a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. Phishing is a social engineering attack that tricks victims into providing sensitive information. Keyloggers are malware that record a user's keystrokes to steal login credentials or other sensitive information. While these types of malware can cause issues on a computer, they would not likely result in a message stating that files are encrypted and inaccessible.","timestamp":"1698277500.0"},{"comment_id":"1184442","upvote_count":"3","content":"Do crypto miner encrypt your file? phishing encrypt your file?
