Furthermore, we must note the firewall's location means only cross firewall access is recorded to the log. Lateral movement is not recorded.\nLet's get rid of the incumbent answer: 22 can't be the origin because we must take the host log on the 17th as fact that 22 was clean at that time, otherwise the scan should have triggered the heuristic match on the 17th. It would not have started its own infection when it was perfectly fine and there is no proof of other file transfers other than the firewall itself.\nNo, I believe 22 was selected as a host with persistence and the process looks like this:\n37 is infected at 16:01 via a malicious file.\n12 is infected at 16:35 via SMBv2.\n12 sends out a ping sweep at 23:58, identifying active machines on the network.\n22 executes post-exploit payload at 02:30.\n18 performs what looks like exfiltration (9GB) at 02:39.\nThis is the limit of what I see with these logs.

Here's why:\n\nNGFW Capabilities: NGFWs provide deep packet inspection, advanced threat detection, and the ability to identify and block malicious traffic based on patterns and behaviors. They can also enforce security policies at the network level, which helps prevent exploitation attempts before they reach the application.\n\nWAF Limitations: While WAFs are designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic, they primarily focus on application-layer attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
