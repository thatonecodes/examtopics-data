Enable dynamic ARP inspection.\n\nDynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is a security feature that helps prevent ARP spoofing attacks and VLAN hopping. VLAN hopping occurs when an attacker sends frames from one VLAN to another VLAN, exploiting the lack of proper VLAN separation.\n\nDynamic ARP Inspection helps mitigate VLAN hopping by inspecting ARP packets and ensuring that ARP requests and responses are valid within the associated VLANs. It builds a binding table that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses and VLANs, and it drops ARP packets that are inconsistent with this table.\n\nWhile other options like configuring private VLANs (Option A), changing the default VLAN (Option B), and implementing ACLs (Option C) can contribute to network security, they may not specifically address VLAN hopping concerns.

VLAN hopping occurs when an attacker sends packets with a false VLAN ID to gain unauthorized access to frames belonging to a different VLAN.\n\nBy enabling dynamic ARP inspection, the network switches can validate ARP packets to ensure that the source MAC address and IP address match.
