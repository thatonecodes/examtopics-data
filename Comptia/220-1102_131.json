This means that you need to connect your Android device to a computer and use an application on the computer to update the firmware of the device1. This can be different from an over-the-air (OTA) update, which is an update by Settings > About Phone > System Updates on your device1.\nBased on this definition, I think the best option to do next is D. Confirm a strong internet connection is available using Wi-Fi or cellular data.
