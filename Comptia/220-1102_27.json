DNS servers\n\nWhen a user attempts to access a website and gets redirected to a different site, the issue often relates to DNS (Domain Name System) resolution problems. DNS is responsible for translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to locate and connect to websites.\n\nIf the DNS servers are misconfigured or compromised, it can result in incorrect mappings, leading to unexpected website redirections. Therefore, the technician should first check the DNS server settings to ensure they are correct and not tampered with. This can involve verifying the DNS server IP addresses configured on the user's system or router and, if necessary, using a reliable DNS service or resetting the DNS settings to defaults.","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1708170360.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","poster":"Footieprogrammer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"983448"}]},{"id":"2XmqIKOy7qhakf3z9qvt","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nTo detect a phone's orientation, the accelerometer communicates with the gyroscope and the magnetometer.
