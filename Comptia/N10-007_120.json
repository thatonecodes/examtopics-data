Each position has its benefits and drawbacks. Placing an IDS appliance in front of a firewall allows the IDS appliance to monitor all incoming and outgoing network traffic. However, when deployed in this manner, the IDS appliance does not normally detect traffic that is internal to the network. An internal attacker taking advantage of vulnerabilities in network services would remain undetected by the external IDS appliance.
