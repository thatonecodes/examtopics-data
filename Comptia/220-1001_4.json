Same question was posted by Dion training on Udemy and the explaination makes the most sense. \n- Explanation: Since a RAID 5 has some built-in redundancy, it will continue to operate while in this degraded state without any additional redundancy since one of the drives has failed. It is best to schedule an authorized downtime period, replace the failed drive, rebuild the array, and confirm that the RAID is no longer reporting itself as degraded. During the rebuilding of the array, the system may perform extremely slowly, and users may experience a loss of service, which is why scheduling some downtime is necessary. Formatting the logical drive or changing a RAID 5 to a RAID 0 will cause data loss, and therefore they are not the correct answers.","timestamp":"1610728500.0","upvote_count":"14"},{"comment_id":"170351","content":"B - When a single disk in a RAID 5 disk array fails, the disk array status changes to Degraded. ... If a hot spare disk is available, the controller can rebuild the data on the disk automatically. If a hot spare disk is not available, you must replace the failed disk and then initiate a rebuild. Can we assume that the array is configured with hot-swappable drives? If not then Answer A is correct.

The question does not mention that the disks can be hot swapped plus rebuilding the array will impact performance which is not desirable during work hours.
