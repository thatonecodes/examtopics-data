Common VPN protocols include SSL/TLS (used on port 443) and IPsec (which can use various ports, but UDP 500 for IKE negotiation is common). SMB (Server Message Block) ports (137-139 and 445) are typically associated with file sharing and may not be needed for a VPN tunnel.\n\nSo, the **best option** for secure VPN communication in this scenario would be:\n\n**B. 22, 443, 445**\n\n- Port 22 is for SSH, which can be used for secure remote administration.\n- Port 443 is commonly used for SSL/TLS encrypted communication, which is secure.\n- Port 445 is associated with SMB, which is less likely to be needed for a VPN tunnel and is often used for file sharing.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1694942160.0"},{"comment_id":"959068","timestamp":"1689992940.0","content":"B. 22, 443, 445","poster":"Sunshine_boy38","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"909748","content":"Selected Answer: B\nGiven the VPN is taking care of the secure part of the equation, I guess you could technically get away with \"D\", but NetBIOS is deprecated.
