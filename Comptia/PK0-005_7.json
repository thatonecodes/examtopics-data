A CCB would be for major changes that impact the scope and cost of the project, a typo is NOT one of them. But I definitely see why academia would say “well actually by the book every change must be amended by a CCB.” I host CCB’s in real life and small edits like typos don’t go through a CCB.","poster":"95d3b92"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1739903160.0","poster":"044f354","comment_id":"1358404","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe PM can authorize minor, non-impacting edits like typo corrections without formal approval.\n\nDon't overthink it..."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1184995","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn the Real World I think the PM would just fix the typo.

Typo changes are considered minor and do not impact the project scope, schedule, or budget significantly. The project manager has the authority to make such changes as part of their day-to-day responsibilities. However, it is good practice for the project manager to inform the CCB or relevant stakeholders about the change to ensure transparency and maintain proper documentation.

The purpose of change control is to manage changes to the scope, time, and cost baselines. Therefore, changes that do not affect the baselines would not activate the change control process (certmaster-learn-for-project-pk0-005#read/section/change-control-overview-2)"},{"timestamp":"1701316800.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe Change Control Board (CCB) is a designated group or committee responsible for reviewing and approving changes to the project's scope, schedule, budget, or other project components. The CCB ensures that changes are evaluated and approved based on their potential impact on the project's objectives, constraints, and overall management.\n\nIn this case, a typo in the project management plan is considered a change to the document.
