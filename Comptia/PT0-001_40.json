SOW?\nBlanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)? - seems unlikely:\n> A blanket order, blanket purchase agreement or call-off order[1] is a purchase order which a customer places with its supplier to allow multiple delivery dates over a period of time, often negotiated to take advantage of predetermined pricing.
