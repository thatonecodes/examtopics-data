The locale is a set of information that specifies the language, cultural, and regional preferences for a system or a user. Setting the LC_ALL environment variable allows you to override the individual LC_* environment variables for all categories, giving you full control over the locale settings for the current process and its child processes. This can be useful for testing purposes or for temporarily changing the locale for a particular process.","comment_id":"804348","timestamp":"1676035500.0","poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"q58bsGNby9h1h4FPUp3t","unix_timestamp":1676035620,"topic":"3","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"exam_id":354,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer":"B","question_text":"Which command will set the local machine's timezone to UTC?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","content":"The command \"ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime\" creates a symbolic link from the file \"/usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC\" to the file \"/etc/localtime\". The symbolic link acts as a pointer to the original file, and when the link is accessed, the file it points to is accessed instead. In this case, \"/usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC\" is a file containing information about the UTC time zone, and \"/etc/localtime\" is a file used by the system to determine the local time zone. By creating the symbolic link, the system will use the UTC time zone information instead of the information it would normally use. This can be useful if the system needs to use a specific time zone other than the one it is configured for.","comment_id":"804351","timestamp":"1676035620.0"}],"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98695-exam-lx0-104-topic-3-question-5-discussion/","choices":{"A":"cat UTC > /etc/timezone","C":"date --timezone=UTC","D":"mv /usr/timezone/UTC /etc","B":"ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime"},"timestamp":"2023-02-10 14:27:00","question_id":32},{"id":"jRvMZCYs4wxkmvjlAxOc","timestamp":"2023-02-10 14:36:00","topic":"3","choices":{"D":"The at command e-mails results to the user.
