Quality of service (QoS)\n\nQuality of service (QoS) is a set of technologies and techniques that are used to manage network resources and prioritize certain types of network traffic. QoS is particularly useful for video conferencing, as it can ensure that video traffic is given priority over other types of traffic, such as file transfers or web browsing, to improve performance.\n\nA. Packet shaping is a technique that is used to regulate the flow of traffic in a network. It can be used to limit the amount of bandwidth that certain types of traffic can use.\n\nC.
