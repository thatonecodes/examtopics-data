It specifies who needs what information, how the information will be communicated, and when to distribute it. By first reviewing the Communication Plan, the PM can identify the predefined communication needs and expectations, and then align the incoming requests with what has been planned. If the requests are not in alignment, the PM will have a basis for a conversation with stakeholders or the sponsor about potentially revising the Communication Plan."},{"poster":"jksdbfb","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD - The first step for the project manager should be to review the communication plan. This plan outlines how project information is communicated to stakeholders, including the frequency, format, and content of project reports. By reviewing the communication plan, the project manager can ensure that the requests from stakeholders align with the established communication approach. If necessary, adjustments can be made to the plan to accommodate the requests. This ensures that communication is consistent and aligned with the project's overall strategy.","comment_id":"994604","timestamp":"1725064680.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1693442280,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":360},{"id":"G4FNmuhtCjozvhtmm4hg","answer":"C","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC - When a team member discovers a malfunctioning procedure in the system, the first step should be to create a record in the issue log.

Issue a change request.\"\n\nIn a formal project management environment, change requests are the standard method for proposing changes or actions such as bug fixes. These change requests are usually documented and go through a formal review process, which often includes an impact analysis, a review by a change control board, and proper authorization before the change (in this case, the bug fix) is implemented. Issuing a change request ensures that the problem is properly documented, analyzed, and approved, maintaining the integrity of the project and ensuring that everyone is on the same page."},{"poster":"jksdbfb","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC - When a bug is identified during user acceptance testing, issuing a change request is the most appropriate method for communicating the bug to the development team. A change request outlines the need for a change (in this case, fixing the bug) and provides the necessary details for the development team to address the issue. This process ensures that the bug is formally documented, tracked, and managed in a structured manner. While communication with the development lead and stakeholders is important, issuing a change request is specifically designed for addressing and resolving issues such as bugs.","timestamp":"1725065280.0","comment_id":"994616","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"VAG8VtRyWKL1Jqa6LSPv","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"994619","timestamp":"1725065580.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - In most cases, internal issues and potential delays are handled within the project team and stakeholders before they are communicated to end users.

Scrum.\"\n\nScrum is an agile framework that aims for the incremental delivery of a high-value product. It operates in timeboxed intervals known as \"sprints,\" which typically last two to four weeks. During each sprint, a potentially shippable product increment is developed and delivered, offering stakeholders an opportunity to interact with a working version of the product early in the project.
