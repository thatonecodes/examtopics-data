The question mentions that the analyst is looking for TCP connections, but then asks the BEST way to view \"Active Internet Connections.\" Anyone who's ever run netstat, will know that it ALWAYS says \"Active Internet Connections.\" So literally any of these commands could be interpreted as correct. \n\nIf we are only truly interested in ESTABLISHED TCP connections - which can be interpreted as an \"active\" connection, B is the obvious answer. \n\nIf we are interested in only outgoing connections for both protocols, then D is the best choice - however I am inclined to think that we only care about TCP.\n\nE seems silly since the better idea would be to just omit -u and not to the grep, however it does achieve only showing tcp connections, however it will include TIME_WAIT and CLOSED connections - which aren't considered \"active\" in some senses, however because of their word choice being the same word choice that netstat ALWAYS outputs, I would have to go with E."},{"comment_id":"1246080","poster":"23169fd","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: E\nE is correct.","timestamp":"1720696800.0","comments":[{"content":"e command sudo netstat -nlt -p | grep \"ESTABLISHED\" has a mistake due to the combination of options -l (for listening) and filtering for \"ESTABLISHED\" state.
