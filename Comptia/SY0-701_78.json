Multifactor authentication\n\nExplanation:\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) is the most effective way to prevent brute-force attacks, as it requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before gaining access to sensitive systems. Even if an attacker is able to guess or crack a password through brute-force, they would still need the second factor (such as a code sent to a mobile device or a hardware token) to gain access. This greatly increases the security of accounts and systems by making unauthorized access much more difficult."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) requires users to provide multiple forms of verification (e.g., a password and a one-time code sent to a phone).

Multifactor authentication\nBrute-force attacks involve attempting many combinations of usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access. Multifactor authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication (e.g., a one-time password, biometric verification, or a hardware token) in addition to a password.
