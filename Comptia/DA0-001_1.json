The diagram shows a schema for a relational database, which is a type of database that stores data in tables that are related to each other through common columns or keys.

These columns are foreign keys that reference the primary keys in the \"Athletes\" and \"Races\" tables.

This means you can define a view once with the necessary joins and filters, and then reuse that view in queries without having to rewrite the complex join logic each time. This simplifies query writing, improves maintainability, and reduces the risk of errors.","poster":"Swift_and_Quick"},{"timestamp":"1713297720.0","comment_id":"1196795","upvote_count":"1","content":"D. Views can be used to restrict sensitive information.\n\nWhile all the options have their own merits, option D stands out as a fundamental advantage of using views. Views allow you to control access to sensitive data by defining subsets of data from one or more tables and limiting access to certain columns or rows based on predefined criteria. This capability is crucial for enforcing data security and access control policies without compromising the integrity of the underlying data structure. It helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, ensuring data privacy and confidentiality.","poster":"Swift_and_Quick"}]},{"id":"I5GW1CmGawVwbhqpFFfs","discussion":[{"poster":"Swift_and_Quick","comment_id":"1196796","content":"A.

By using user-group-based access, the report can be distributed to the entire team without revealing individual identities.
