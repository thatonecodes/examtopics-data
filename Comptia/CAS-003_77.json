A common approach (brute-force attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password.[2]\n\nThe purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password (installing an entirely new password is less of a security risk, but it involves System Administration privileges), to gain unauthorized access to a system, or to act as a preventive measure whereby system administrators check for easily crackable passwords. On a file-by-file basis, password cracking is utilized to gain access to digital evidence to which a judge has allowed access, when a particular file's permissions are restricted.","timestamp":"1624293600.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Hercolardey","comment_id":"387282"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"205380","timestamp":"1603583880.0","content":"D is correct","poster":"yassias"},{"comments":[{"content":"If a file with hashed values is the password file, the D should be correct.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"168203","timestamp":"1598599500.0","poster":"PaulLi"}],"poster":"PaulLi","upvote_count":"1","content":"I think that D is the wrong answer.","timestamp":"1598599320.0","comment_id":"168199"}],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04030/0006500001.png"],"answer":"D","question_text":"An information security officer is responsible for one secure network and one office network.
