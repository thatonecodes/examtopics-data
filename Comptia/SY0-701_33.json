Performing code obfuscation\n\nExplanation:\nCode obfuscation makes the source code harder to understand by altering its structure without changing its functionality. This technique complicates the reverse engineering process, making it more difficult for attackers to analyze and exploit the software.\n\nOther Options:\nA. Digitally signing the software: Ensures the authenticity and integrity of the software but does not prevent reverse engineering.\nC. Limiting the use of third-party libraries: Reduces dependency risks but does not directly address reverse engineering.\nD. Using compile flags: Can improve performance or security during compilation but is not designed to prevent reverse engineering.","poster":"Anyio","timestamp":"1737769740.0"}],"question_text":"A software development team asked a security administrator to recommend techniques that should be used to reduce the chances of the software being reverse engineered.
