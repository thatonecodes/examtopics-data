Digital signatures are just that, signatures that should apply to only you. It provides non-repudiation (you can't deny that you sent it, or at the very least that your machine sent it, or that someone who has the crypto keys sent it)\nB- This doesn't really stop anything. Sure you have to log in to use your email, but anyone can still spoof you (email is inherently and insanely insecure)\nC- DKIM is nice as part of email authentication (use DMARC with SPF/DKIM), but DKIM doesn't care about 'friendly from' headers that users see in their mailbox. You can still very much spoof the 'from' field and still pass DKIM (I've had to explain this scenario to customers a gazillion times). \nD- Doesn't stop the spoofing. Just checks links.","comments":[{"poster":"saci_frosty","content":"Answer A\nI agree with you, DKIM won't stop \"friendly from\" headers, also D doesn't work as the scammer might be trying to trick the user to send them gift cards for instance.

Implement DKIM to perform authentication that will prevent the issue.\n\nPhishing attacks often involve spoofed emails that appear to come from legitimate sources within the organization.

It won't prevent all phishing attacks, but it can significantly reduce the effectiveness of attacks that rely on impersonating internal senders.\n\nOption A, including digital signatures on messages originating within the company, is related to DKIM, but DKIM is a more specific and widely adopted standard for email authentication.","timestamp":"1703174580.0","comment_id":"1102711"},{"poster":"skibby16","comment_id":"1086444","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email authentication method designed to detect email spoofing.
