This means the cloud architect can confidently pursue this SLA if minimizing downtime is a top priority for his deployment.\nLet me break it down step by step:\n1. Calculate Total Hours in a Year:\nThere are 365 days in a year:\n365 days × 24 hours/day = 8,760 hours/year\n2. Determine Uptime Allowed by 99.99% Availability:\n\nIf your service has 99.99% availability, the downtime can be calculated as:\nDowntime = (1−0.9999) × 8,760 hours ≈ 0.876 hours/year\nThis is approximately 52.56 minutes of downtime annually.\nComparison to Five Hours:\nSince 52.56 minutes is significantly less than five hours, a 99.99% SLA not only meets but far exceeds the requirement of allowing for no more than five hours of downtime annually.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1301419"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"SoleKalibur","timestamp":"1716077280.0","comment_id":"1213524","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTotal uptime considering the maximum allowed downtime is 8755/8760 hours = 99.942.

However, developers of serverless applications are not concerned with capacity planning, configuration, management, maintenance, fault tolerance, or scaling of containers, VMs, or physical servers.\n\nIts Serverless.","poster":"PatrickH","comment_id":"1178059","timestamp":"1710925080.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Jay987654","timestamp":"1706831880.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is D. Serverless.\n\nServerless computing is a cloud computing model that abstracts away infrastructure management tasks like server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. In serverless computing, the cloud provider automatically allocates, scales and manages the infrastructure required to run the code once it’s triggered by specific events. This allows developers to focus more on the application logic and less on infrastructure or maintenance tasks, which seems to align with the requirements stated in the question.","comment_id":"1138005"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Pongsathorn","content":"Selected Answer: B\nUsing containers would be the BEST option for deploying a new cloud application with minimal effort and reducing maintenance tasks for several reasons:\n\nEfficiency: Containers package applications and their dependencies into a single unit, making it easy to deploy and replicate across various environments. This reduces the effort required for provisioning VMs, configuring volumes, and managing operating systems.\n\nIsolation: Containers provide process isolation, allowing multiple applications to run on the same host without interfering with each other. This reduces the risk of conflicts and simplifies maintenance.\n\nScalability: Containers can be orchestrated using tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or AWS ECS to automate scaling based on demand. This eliminates the need for manual autoscaling configurations.","comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"Containers can simplify application deployment and ensure consistency across different environments.
