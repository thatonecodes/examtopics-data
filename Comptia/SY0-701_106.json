Encryption\nExplanation:\nEncryption is the process of converting data into a secure format that can only be read or decrypted by authorized parties. It protects data while it is in transit across the network, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed even if intercepted.

Configure firewall rules to block external access to internal resources.\nExplanation:\nNetwork segmentation ensures that only authorized internal systems can access specific servers while preventing unauthorized access.\nFirewall rules can enforce this by blocking external access and allowing only approved internal traffic.\nThis approach aligns with compliance audit requirements by implementing strict access controls and reducing the attack surface.\nWhy Not the Other Options?\nB. Set up a WAP to allow internal access from public networks → A Wireless Access Point (WAP) extending access from public networks is insecure and contradicts the goal of segmentation.\nC. Implement a new IPSec tunnel from internal resources → IPSec tunnels encrypt traffic, but they do not inherently segment networks. Segmentation is about access control, not just encryption.\nD.
