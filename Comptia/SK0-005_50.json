Warranty\n\nWhen processing the replacement of a faulty server component, the warranty documentation is commonly referenced. Warranties typically outline the terms and conditions under which the manufacturer or vendor is obligated to repair or replace faulty components within a certain timeframe or under specific circumstances. This documentation helps ensure that the replacement process is carried out according to the terms agreed upon during the purchase of the server or its components."}],"topic":"1","question_id":246},{"id":"48YSpehdIhGXZZ2MYoPy","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","question_text":"A systems administrator notices a newly added server cannot see any of the LUNs on the SAN.

A single-mode fiber cable is a type of optical fiber cable that has a small core diameter and allows only one mode of light to propagate through it. A single-mode fiber cable can transmit data over long distances at high speeds, but it requires more expensive transceivers and connectors than multimode fiber cables. A multimode fiber cable is a type of optical fiber cable that has a larger core diameter and allows multiple modes of light to propagate through it. A multimode fiber cable can transmit data over short distances at lower speeds than single-mode fiber cables, but it is more compatible and cost-effective than single-mode fiber cables. If a single-mode fiber cable is used in place of multimode, it can cause signal loss, attenuation, or mismatch between the devices.","poster":"ccoli"},{"timestamp":"1710360660.0","poster":"surfuganda","comment_id":"1172876","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. The zoning on the fiber switch is wrong.\n\nIn a Storage Area Network (SAN) environment, zoning is a method of partitioning or segmenting the SAN fabric to control access to specific devices or resources such as LUNs. If the newly added server cannot see any of the LUNs on the SAN and both the SAN switch and the local HBA do not display any link lights, it suggests that there might be an issue with the zoning configuration. Zoning needs to be properly configured to allow communication between the server's HBA and the LUNs on the SAN. If the zoning is incorrect, the server will not be able to access the LUNs, resulting in the observed behavior."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. The zoning on the fiber switch is wrong.\n\nIf the SAN switch and the local HBA do not display any link lights, it indicates a physical connectivity problem between the server and the SAN. Zoning on the fiber switch is a common cause of such issues. Zoning determines which devices can communicate with each other over the Fibre Channel fabric. If the zoning is incorrect, the server may not be able to establish a connection with the SAN and access the LUNs. Therefore, checking and correcting the zoning configuration on the fiber switch would likely resolve the issue.","comment_id":"1165766","timestamp":"1709567400.0","poster":"AzadOB","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","question_id":247},{"id":"u3ZqTlZ8zfJoeyw5vw4m","choices":{"D":"Hybrid","B":"Private","A":"SaaS","C":"Public"},"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"answer":"C","exam_id":365,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1196879","timestamp":"1729120740.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"option C.

This method reduces disk writes and network load while creating a data set similar to a full backup.\n\nSynthetic full backups are suitable for database backups because they must conserve system resources while maintaining the data from the full backup.\nIt does not require the actual acquisition of a full backup, and can efficiently maintain a full backup using incremental or differential data, which is less likely to impact performance on a production database server."},{"timestamp":"1727615760.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOpen file backup will allow for data to be backed up even while the file open which is perfect for databases that are constantly in use.","comment_id":"1291153","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ronn_Burgandy"}],"exam_id":365,"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following backup types should be chosen for database servers?","timestamp":"2024-09-29 15:16:00","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (67%)","C (33%)"],"isMC":true},{"id":"S2NPLeNMOL1xMwrvEfPc","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Close port 3389 and rerun the scan.","B":"Close ports 80 and 443 and rerun the scan.","A":"Close ports 69 and 1010 and rerun the scan.","D":"Close all ports and rerun the scan."},"answer":"A","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":365,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sk0-005/image10.png"],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A server administrator has received tickets from users who report the system runs very slowly and various unrelated messages pop up when they try to access an internet-facing web application using default ports.
