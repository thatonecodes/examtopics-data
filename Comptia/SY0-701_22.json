Virtualization and isolation of resources\n\nIn a cloud-based environment, virtualization and isolation of resources are critical to maintaining security best practices. Virtualization allows multiple workloads to run on the same physical infrastructure while keeping them isolated from each other, which is a foundational practice in cloud environments to prevent data leakage or unauthorized access between different tenants or applications.","timestamp":"1727836620.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1739637180.0","poster":"585402e","comment_id":"1356933","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSince it is in the Cloud and theoretically can be compromised at some point, in my opinion, the first thing that needs to be ensured is the confidentiality of the data.
