Isolate the employee's network segment and investigate further.\n\nIn this scenario, where an authenticated but unauthorized employee accessed files from their workstation, it is crucial to take immediate action to prevent any further unauthorized access or potential data exfiltration. The first step should be to isolate the employee's network segment. This will help contain any potential threat and prevent it from spreading further within the network.\n\nAfter isolation, a thorough investigation should be conducted to understand the extent of the unauthorized access, identify any potential data breaches, and determine if any further actions are necessary. This investigation may involve reviewing logs, examining the affected workstation, and possibly involving the appropriate authorities within the organization.","timestamp":"1694382780.0","comment_id":"1004330"}],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-09-10 23:53:00","question_text":"A security analyst is monitoring an organization's IDS and DLP systems for an alert indicating files were removed from the network.
