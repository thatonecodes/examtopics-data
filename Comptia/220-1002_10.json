The A+ 1002 exam objective 2.9 calls this drive wipe.\n\nI understand this doesn't make things much clearer but from what I am gathering - Overwrite is what is done (the action) during a low-level format. Low-level Format is the METHOD (making D the correct answer). Both will get the job done, but low level is more correct because they are asking for a METHOD. The book also describes there are 2 different types of Low-level formatting. One can be done w/ special software by a user and one is done at the factory.

You already learned about standard\nformatting back in Chapter 9, so how is low-level formatting different? With\nolder drives (pre-1990s), low-level formatting would create the physical\nmarks on the disk surface so that the drive knew where to store data; in the\nprocess, it erased the data from the drive. This was initially done at the\nfactory, but utilities existed to repeat this operation later. As drives became\nmore complex, hard drive manufacturers disabled the ability to perform low-\nlevel formats outside the factory.\nToday, the term “low-level formatting” is often used to describe a zero-fill\nor overwrite operation.
