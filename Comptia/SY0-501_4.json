For example, an organization can have two locations. One is its headquarters and the other is a remote office. It can use two VPN servers to act as gateways to connect the networks at the two locations together\n\nA benefit of the site-to-site model is that it connects both networks without requiring additional steps on the part of the user. Users in the remote office can connect to servers in the headquarters location as easily as if the servers were in the remote office. Connecting to the remote server might be slower than connecting to a local server, but, otherwise, it’s transparent to end users. \n\nIn contrast, in a traditional remote access VPN (also called a host-to-gateway model), the end user makes the direct connection to the VPN server and is very much aware of the process.\n\nGibson, Darril.
