Check WHOIS and netblock records for the company.\n\nB: Checking WHOIS and netblock records for the company is the best option to start the reconnaissance activities. WHOIS records are a good source of information to understand the scope of the network and the range of IP addresses used by the company. Netblock records, on the other hand, provide information on the Internet Service Provider (ISP) used by the company and the type of services they provide. This information can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited."},{"timestamp":"1720228680.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Check WHOIS and netblock records for the company.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • WHOIS and netblock records provide essential information about the ownership of IP addresses, domain names, and associated netblocks. This information is publicly available and helps identify the scope of the company’s external-facing assets without alerting the company’s defenses.\n • WHOIS queries can reveal details about domain registration, including contact information, which might give insights into the organization’s structure.\n • Netblock records will help identify the range of IP addresses allocated to the company, which is critical for mapping the external network perimeter.","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000","comment_id":"1243113","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1691343360.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn the initial phase of reconnaissance, particularly when information is limited, a penetration tester typically starts by collecting publicly available information.

Send an email from the CEO's account, requesting a new account.\n\nSending an email from the CEO's account, requesting a new account is a likely method to gain access to the network.
