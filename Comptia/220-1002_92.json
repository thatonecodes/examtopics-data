It sounds like something you might want to do if giving away a hard disk or perhaps discarding an old computer that may have contained useful and important private information. Standard formatting of the drives could allow for the data to be restored and could make the data vulnerable to exposure. Drilling or hammers the HDD platters would physically destroy the drives and the data, but it would make the laptops useful for the community center. Degaussing the drives would also render the drives useless to the community center. Therefore, the safest method is a low-level format since it fully destroys the data and allows the drives to be reused by the community center.","upvote_count":"31","comment_id":"143293","poster":"betty_boop","timestamp":"1595673420.0"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1591835220.0","poster":"PurpleWinter","comment_id":"107299","upvote_count":"5","comments":[{"comment_id":"278300","timestamp":"1611810420.0","poster":"Bobo55","content":"True.
