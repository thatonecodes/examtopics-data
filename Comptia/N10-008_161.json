However, due to its security vulnerabilities (FTP sends credentials in plain text), it's not the preferred choice for secure file transfer over the internet.\n\nIn a typical secure setup, FTP would be replaced with a more secure protocol like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS).\n\nIn the context of a screened subnet, services like RADIUS (A) are more likely to be found because they're used for authentication, which is often needed to control access to resources inside the internal network from external users.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"jcre","content":"By far, this is the BEST explanation.
