It can be configured to block devices that do not match the allowed list.\n-Control Over Physical Access: By enabling port security on the network jacks, the organization can ensure that only authorized devices with specific MAC addresses are allowed to connect. Any unauthorized devices, such as a visitor's laptop, would be blocked from accessing the network.\n-Dynamic or Static Configuration: Port security can dynamically learn and store allowed MAC addresses or use a predefined list, providing flexibility in securing physical network ports.\nThis why it is the best answer: Port security directly addresses the issue of unauthorized access through physical network connections by controlling which devices can use the network ports.
