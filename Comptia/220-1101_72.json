The technician should establish a theory of probable cause, which is an educated guess as to why the issue is occurring. This can be done by reviewing the information gathered from the user and the findings so far, and researching the issue internally or externally (e.g., online forums, vendor support) as needed. Once the technician has a better understanding of the issue, they can then move on to determining the next steps to resolve the issue and documenting their findings, actions, and outcomes (A. Determine the next steps to resolve the issue and document it and C. Document the findings, actions, and outcomes).

Once a plan of action has been developed, the technician can move on to establishing a probable cause of the issue and researching internally or externally as necessary to find potential solutions. After finding a solution, they should then be able to implement it with confidence in order to resolve the issue. Documenting findings, actions, and outcomes at each stage is important for future reference and problem-solving.
