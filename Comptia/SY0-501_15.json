It’s faster and simpler to restore from a single file that contains all the data, which is an important advantage.\nSingle file storage. Keeping all the backed up data in a single file results in better storage management. Besides, full backups are self-contained.\nHigh storage space requirements compared to other backup types. Also, since you likely don’t change all your data that often, using only full backups wastes a lot of storage space.\nPotential security issues. Since all the data is stored in one place, if your backup media somehow gets accessed or compromised, you lose it all.\nSlowest type of backup.
