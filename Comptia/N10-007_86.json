There are 12 unique segments on a 12 port switch. an isolated hub would count as 1 segment because all ports share the segment with each other, BUT the hub becomes a Member of one of the switch's segments when it connects to the switch, so it Doesn't Count as another one. The same goes for the connection to the router. One port is sharing an ethernet with the switch. But the Router has TWO ports, so the second port is on it's own segment (with the ISP presumably). therefore, the total number is 13. \n\nIt's also fairly well defined in the official CompTIA study guide chapters 3 and 4."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\n14?

Each port on the router is a collision domain (2), each port on the switch is a collision domain (8), and all of the ports on the hub make up a single collision domain (1). But, since one of the ports on the router is connected to one of the switch ports, they are in the same collision domain (-1).
