By installing UPS units with battery backup, the data center can ensure that its systems remain available even during under-voltage events.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1683030600.0","content":"-A\n\nThe most cost-effective solution for the data center to implement in the given scenario would be to install Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) with battery backup.\n\nUPS systems provide backup power to critical systems in the event of power interruptions, brownouts, or blackouts. The battery backup feature of a UPS can provide power to the data center for a short period of time, allowing time for a generator to be started or for systems to be properly shut down to prevent data loss or damage.\n\nManaged power distribution units (option B) would provide information about the under-voltage events but would not address the underlying issue. It may be helpful to track these events, but it will not prevent the occasional losses of system availability.\n\nDual power supplies (option D) can distribute the load more evenly, but they do not address the issue of under-voltage events caused by power grid maintenance. Additionally, adding dual power supplies may also require additional infrastructure and equipment, resulting in higher capital and operational costs.c","poster":"mouettespaghetti","comment_id":"887330"}],"unix_timestamp":1683030600,"answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-02 14:30:00"}],"exam":{"provider":"Comptia","name":"SY0-601","id":367,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":860,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":73},"__N_SSP":true}
