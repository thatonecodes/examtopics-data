The corporate firewall log (in zulu time 6 hours ahead) shows 3389 - the port number for Remote Desktop Protocol. (RDP), accepted at 14.01.16 on 2015-03-25 - and the workstation firewall log shows allowed during that same timeframe from 2015-03-25 08:00.00 until 09:01.17 when “action=drop is logged (due to idle timeout?). So E is incorrect because RDP is accepted and allowed until timeout. B is also incorrect because user not locked out - after 3 attempts the user finally succeeds at 2015-03-25 08:01.11. Time synchronization ( C ) or latency ( A) are possible. I don’t see any evidence of D being correct (malware). But the sequence would likely be first the VPN timeout threshold is exceeded, then the workstation firewall log would register the “action=drop.” But that sequence is reversed. Action=drop at 09:01.17 is logged before the VPN timeout is logged at 09:01.35. So network latency is unlikely. How could a VPN condition be logged at the workstation firewall before it even occurred? So A is likely wrong.
