Pay-as-you-go.\n\nIn a pay-as-you-go model, users are charged based on their actual usage of the service or resource. This often involves paying for the amount of resources consumed over time, such as compute power, storage, or network bandwidth. The charges are typically calculated based on usage metrics, such as the number of hours of compute time, the amount of data stored, or the volume of data transferred.","comment_id":"1210489","poster":"Duke_CT","timestamp":"1731466440.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140402-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-405-discussion/","question_id":341},{"id":"aPxI23lojgNFd5EBjm19","unix_timestamp":1701961200,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/128028-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-406-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1701961200.0","poster":"lamborghini","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1090392","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. SPF\n\nHere's why:\n\n SPF (Sender Policy Framework) allows domain owners to specify a list of authorized IP addresses that can send email for their domain. When an email is received, the receiving mail server checks the SPF record of the sender's domain to see if the IP address used is authorized.

SPF helps prevent email spoofing and phishing by verifying the sender’s identity and preventing unauthorized use of their domain name12.\nWhen an email is received, the receiving server checks the SPF record of the sender’s domain, which is a DNS TXT record that lists the valid IP addresses for that domain12. The server then compares the sender’s IP address with the SPF record and determines if it matches or not. If it matches, the email passes the SPF check and is accepted; if it does not match, the email fails the SPF check and is rejected or marked as spam12.","timestamp":"1740586860.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"dvdlau","comment_id":"1278293","timestamp":"1725456300.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC.
