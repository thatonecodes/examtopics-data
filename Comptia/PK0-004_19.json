It involves doing something new, which means that the end result should be a unique product or service. These products may be marketed to others, may be used internally, may provide support for ongoing operations, and so on.\n Temporary: Projects have definite start and end dates. The time it takes to complete the work of the project can vary in overall length from a few weeks to several years, but there is always a start date and an end date.\n Reason or Purpose: A project comes about to fulfill a purpose. This might include introducing a new product, fulfilling a business objective or strategic goal, satisfying a social need, and any number of other reasons. It's important to document and communicate the purpose and reasons for the project so that team members remain focused on achieving the goals of the project.\n Stakeholder Satisfaction: A project starts once it's been identified, the objectives have been outlined in the project charter, and appropriate stakeholders have approved the project plan. A project ends when those goals have been met to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["BC (100%)"],"exam_id":359,"timestamp":"2020-08-06 20:28:00","answer_ET":"BC","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following are characteristics of a project?
