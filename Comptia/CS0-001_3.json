POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) is the name of the vulnerability that enables the exploit.\n\nPOODLE can be used to target browser-based communication that relies on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0 protocol for encryption and authentication. The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol has largely replaced SSL for secure communication on the Internet, but many browsers will revert to SSL 3.0 when a TLS connection is unavailable. An attacker who wants to exploit POODLE takes advantage of this by inserting himself into the communication session and forcing the browser to use SSL 3.0.","timestamp":"1595075700.0","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"137894","poster":"jcwilson4th"},{"timestamp":"1622410080.0","poster":"Hobbes26","comment_id":"370460","upvote_count":"1","content":"Downgrade attacks: a client try to negotiate a connection and in doing so tells the server that its cypher-suite does not includes the latest (more-resistant) cyphers - thus forcing the communication to take place using a less desirable cypher which is vulnerable to attack.\nDROWN: forces the use of SSL 2.0\nPOODLE: forces the use of SSL 3.0\nBEAST: forces the use of TLS 1.0\nSeems like everything is fixed with TLS 1.2\nFor this question I would go with DROWN."},{"timestamp":"1612500600.0","poster":"Kuku55","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"283963","content":"Quick google or wiki shows the right answer.

An attacker could interfere with a client's handshake with the server so that it failed, resulting in the client downgrading the version. If they could be forced down to using SSL 3.0, then the attacker can exploit the knowledge that there are no secure cipher suites in SSL 3.0. The solution is to disable use of SSL 3.0 in servers.\n\nDROWN is different - it doesn't directly interfere with the client's connection. Instead, DROWN is an attack on an even older protocol version, SSL 2.0, which is still supported by many servers. It works on any server that uses the same private keys for SSL 2.0 and higher versions of SSL/TLS (likely). The attacker connects using SSL 2.0, and is able to eventually determine the secret session keys of a currently connected user session (which might be using TLS 1.2). This enables the attacker to decrypt the user's current session data. Here the solution is to disable support for SSL 2.0.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"203166","poster":"Sach"},{"content":"A server is vulnerable to DROWN if:\n\nIt allows SSLv2 connections OR\nIts private key is used on any other server that allows SSLv2 connections, even for another protocol","timestamp":"1598418060.0","comment_id":"166460","upvote_count":"1","poster":"xose"}],"answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03139/0006900001.png"],"answer_ET":"E","answer_images":[],"answer":"E","choices":{"D":"Heartbleed","E":"POODLE","B":"DROWN","C":"Zeus","A":"ShellShock"},"question_text":"When reviewing network traffic, a security analyst detects suspicious activity:\n//IMG//\n\nBased on the log above, which of the following vulnerability attacks is occurring?","answer_description":"","exam_id":345,"question_id":12,"unix_timestamp":1590932280,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/21661-exam-cs0-001-topic-1-question-113-discussion/","timestamp":"2020-05-31 15:38:00"},{"id":"UXl42spgRvvM5tj1ZgsT","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Privilege escalation","A":"Impersonation","C":"Directory traversal","D":"Input injection"},"unix_timestamp":1588978560,"answer_description":"","question_text":"An analyst was testing the latest version of an internally developed CRM system.

The data is placed in the body of the request and sent to a specific URL on a web server that is designed to handle the request. There is generally no limit to the amount of data that can be transferred using this method, except for those imposed by the web server. If a file is too big for a server to handle in one POST request, it can be split up and sent in multiple requests. Properly configured web servers will automatically reconstruct the data as it is received.\n\nhttps://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/cyber-security/conducting-and-detecting-data-exfiltration/","comments":[{"comment_id":"109050","content":"I disagree, based on the article lupinart shared.
