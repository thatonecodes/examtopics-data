Operational state replication, whether synchronous (AZs) or asynchronous (geo-redundancy) is NOT backup. We are fortunate when our DR can benefit from operational replicated data, but to rely on operational replication SOLELY as one’s DR backup-restore option is foolish at best and professional malpractice at worst.\nA straightforward example: as part of their operations, availability zones replicate data/resources among “nearby” data centers (DC) within the zone. A natural disaster may have expansive impact – clobber an entire zone – thus eliminating both the operational data and its replicated copy. For best practice DR, you must include archived backups.","comment_id":"231193","poster":"JD_TDG","timestamp":"1606752120.0","upvote_count":"9"},{"comment_id":"88240","poster":"iqilito","timestamp":"1589370360.0","content":"Correct is B)","upvote_count":"7"},{"content":"Yes, I’m sure that B. Replication is the correct answer, not D. Archiving.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Replication: This involves creating real-time or near-real-time copies of data across multiple locations or systems. The primary goal of replication is to ensure data availability and to minimize data loss in the event of a failure, which directly impacts and reduces the Recovery Point Objective (RPO). RPO is about minimizing the amount of data loss during a disaster, and replication is the best method to achieve a lower RPO.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"SophyQueenCR82","comment_id":"1268851","timestamp":"1724087940.0"},{"content":"B is correct","comment_id":"1167359","timestamp":"1709744880.0","poster":"broman","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"PatrickRei","content":"B.

Hybrid.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Hybrid: A hybrid cloud approach allows a company to combine on-premises infrastructure with cloud services. Given that the human resources application requires legacy infrastructure that cannot be moved to the cloud, a hybrid approach would enable the company to keep the legacy components on-premises while integrating cloud services where feasible. This way, the company can still achieve some reduction in capital expenses by leveraging cloud resources for parts of the infrastructure that are cloud-compatible, while maintaining the necessary legacy systems on-premises."},{"poster":"LeDarius3762","timestamp":"1674543420.0","content":"The answer is C) Rip and Replace, because if it's hybrid they have to keep the legacy infrastructure, which fails the request of reducing capital expenses, which is the main purpose of the migration","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"786236"},{"comment_id":"476691","poster":"suL33T","upvote_count":"1","content":"The correct answer is selected here and it is B.

Resource Tagging.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Resource Tagging: This allows you to assign metadata (tags) to cloud resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and databases. These tags can include information like the application name, department, project, or cost center. By using resource tagging, the business analysis team can track and report on costs specific to the cloud application by filtering resources based on their tags.
