Turnstiles are physical barriers commonly used in facilities to control the flow of people by allowing only one person to pass at a time. They can be operated manually or electronically and are often found in areas where access control is required, such as entrances to buildings, stadiums, or restricted areas.\n\nDetective controls focus on identifying and detecting security incidents or policy violations after they occur. Corrective controls are implemented to remedy or mitigate the impact of a security incident or policy violation. Technical controls involve the use of technology, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or encryption, to enforce security policies and protect systems and data.
