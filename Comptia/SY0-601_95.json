Creating a change control request allows the organization to document and track the proposed change, assess its potential impact, and get approval from relevant stakeholders. This process ensures that the patching procedure is well-documented, planned, and communicated to all necessary parties, reducing the risk of unexpected issues or disruptions to the production environment.\n\nAfter the change control request is approved and the necessary preparations are made, the technician can proceed with applying the patch to the production system.","timestamp":"1690581840.0","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","upvote_count":"12","comments":[{"content":"Thank you, chatGPT","poster":"CS3000","comment_id":"990967","upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1693070220.0"}],"comment_id":"965867"},{"content":"C.
