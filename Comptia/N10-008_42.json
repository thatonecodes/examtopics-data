It is used to power a variety of devices, such as cameras, phones, access points, and other networking equipment.Cameras are particularly well-suited for PoE because they are often installed in locations where it is difficult or impossible to run electrical power. By using PoE, cameras can be powered directly over the Ethernet cable, eliminating the need for separate power cables and outlets.Other devices, such as printers, hubs, and modems, are less likely to utilize PoE because they typically do not need to be powered over Ethernet.

It works by allowing the switch to monitor and validate DHCP traffic on the network, ensuring that only legitimate DHCP messages are forwarded to clients.

In addition, information on hosts which have successfully completed a DHCP transaction is accrued in a database of bindings which may then be used by other security or accounting features.\n\nOther features may use DHCP snooping database information to ensure IP integrity on a Layer 2 switched domain.
