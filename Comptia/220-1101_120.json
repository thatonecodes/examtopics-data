In general, CompTIA A+ emphasizes the importance of two-factor authentication in securing user accounts and devices.\n\nTo answer the specific question about what meets the two-factor authentication requirement according to CompTIA A+, the answer is the same as my previous response: Option C, Password/thumbprint.

I think if it were a thermal printer that used direct thermal printing (with a printhead), it would not be unevenly smudged where only some letters are illegible and others are legible. So based on the description in the question, I believe it is caused by a misfed ribbon in a thermal printer that uses thermal transfer printing. It is possible to not feed the ribbon properly, this is mentioned in Mike Meyers All-In-One A+ certification guide.","poster":"oatmealturkey","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe most likely cause for the reported printer issue is that the ribbon is jammed and is rubbing on the paper (option A). The black smudges over the entire image and dark, illegible text could be the result of the ink on the ribbon being transferred to the paper unevenly or rubbing against the paper, causing smudging.\n\nThe best solution for this issue would be to clear the bad ribbon and feed it through properly. The technician should inspect the printer ribbon and check for any signs of damage or debris that could cause the jam. They should then carefully remove any obstructions and ensure that the ribbon is properly aligned and tensioned. Once this is done, the technician should feed the ribbon through the printer again, making sure it is loaded correctly and without any tangles.","comment_id":"816572","poster":"CATTAC23","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676983440.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is A","poster":"wepaid","comment_id":"773988","timestamp":"1673573340.0"}],"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/85551-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-76-discussion/"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Comptia","isMCOnly":false,"id":339,"name":"220-1101","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":625,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":120},"__N_SSP":true}
