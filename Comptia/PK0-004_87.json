Risk planning is the process of identifying and evaluating potential risks and developing strategies to address them. In this case, the project team is identifying a potential risk (the remodeling on the production floor) and debating different options to keep delivering without adjusting the schedule. This is an example of risk planning because the team is taking proactive steps to address a potential risk before it occurs. Other risk activities, such as mitigation (taking action to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk), quantification (assessing the probability and potential impact of a risk), or identification (recognizing and documenting the existence of a risk), may also be relevant to the project team's work, but risk planning is the activity that is being performed in this situation.","comment_id":"768760","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1673111400.0","poster":"kmanb"}],"answer":"C","choices":{"D":"Identification","B":"Quantification","A":"Mitigation","C":"Planning"}},{"id":"O3GICSLigqFvDoGWom9h","question_text":"A project manager needs to identify the resources assigned to a particular task.\nIn which of the following documents can this information be found?","question_id":433,"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1677273540,"exam_id":359,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1677273540.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"The correct answer is A. Project schedule.\n\nThe project schedule is a document that outlines the timeline for completing all the tasks and activities involved in a project. It includes information such as the start and end dates for each task, the dependencies between tasks, and the resources assigned to each task. Therefore, a project manager can find information on the resources assigned to a particular task in the project schedule. The project schedule is an important tool for managing the project, as it provides a roadmap for the project team to follow and helps ensure that the project stays on track and within budget.","comment_id":"820957","poster":"CyberRooster"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/100703-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-72-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-24 22:19:00","answer_description":"Reference: Kim Heldman, CompTIA Project+ Study Guide, 2nd Edition, Sybex, Indianapolis, 2017, p. 156","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Impact assessment","B":"Cost plan","C":"Scope statement","A":"Project schedule"}},{"id":"0TErScl8gOR4oKVlCJhM","exam_id":359,"question_id":434,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-01-07 18:11:00","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"comment_id":"819707","poster":"MJVIS","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe Project Manager is primarily responsible for developing the timeline.\n\nThe timeline, also known as the project schedule, is a critical component of project management that outlines the sequence and duration of activities necessary to complete the project. Developing the project schedule involves identifying the activities, estimating the duration and resources required for each activity, and sequencing them in the correct order to achieve the project objectives.\n\nWhile other project roles, such as the project sponsor, project coordinator, or project scheduler, may contribute to the development of the project schedule, the primary responsibility for developing the timeline lies with the Project Manager.

Arrange a face-to-face meeting with the team member. In a weak matrix organizational structure, the project manager has limited authority over the project team members, who typically report to functional managers. In this situation, it would be appropriate for the project manager to arrange a face-to-face meeting with the team member to discuss the inappropriate behavior and the company's acceptable use policy. This allows the project manager to address the issue directly and gives the team member the opportunity to explain their actions. If the team member's behavior continues after the meeting, the project manager can escalate the issue to the team member's manager or take other appropriate actions, such as restricting the team member's equipment access."}],"exam_id":359,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","answer":"B","question_id":435,"unix_timestamp":1673119860,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-01-07 20:31:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/94333-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-724-discussion/","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.global-integration.com/insights/functional-matrix-weak-matrix-or-vertical-matrix-organization/#:~:text=In%20a%20weak%20%2F%\n20functional%20matrix,the%20functional%20matrix%20management%20structure","answer_images":[],"question_text":"In a weak matrix, a highly skilled project team member has been using company equipment to view inappropriate content.
