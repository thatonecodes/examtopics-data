Embedded cryptoprocessor: A cryptoprocessor is a specialized processor designed for performing cryptographic operations securely.

This enhances the security of corporate resources accessed remotely, which aligns with the organization's goal of protecting sensitive data.\n\nC. Hardware-backed public key storage: Storing public keys and private keys in hardware (such as an HSM) ensures that the keys are securely stored and protected from being extracted or tampered with.
