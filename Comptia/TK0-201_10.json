Create groups with members from different backgrounds. This can increase the diversity of ideas and perspectives within the group and promote more discussion and collaboration.\n\nE. Clearly define the role for each of the group members. This can help ensure that everyone knows what is expected of them and can contribute to the group's success. Clear roles and responsibilities can also help prevent free-riding and increase accountability.\n\nEmphasizing conformity (B) or limiting individual accountability (D) is not likely to increase group interaction or engagement, as it can lead to groupthink and a lack of motivation. Additionally, tying group participation to individual rewards (C) can create competition and undermine the collaborative spirit of the group."}],"unix_timestamp":1678239120},{"id":"l0bUTGy9SYppFSO3NreZ","answer":"B","question_images":[],"question_text":"A learner asks the instructor a question that was covered before the lunch break.

This approach acknowledges the learner's question and provides a brief answer while also reminding the learner where the information was previously covered. This can help reinforce the material for the learner and encourage them to pay closer attention in future sessions. Redirecting the question to the class (Option B) may not be helpful if other learners do not remember or understand the material, and it can also make the learner who asked the question feel unsupported. Providing a more in-depth answer (Option C) can be time-consuming and may not be necessary if the information was already covered. Asking the learner to remain after class (Option D) can be helpful for individualized support, but it may not be necessary if the question can be answered quickly in class.","timestamp":"1725752100.0"},{"poster":"JimGrayham","comment_id":"825373","timestamp":"1725138420.0","content":"A learner asks the instructor a question that was covered before the lunch break.

Ask probing questions to trigger the learner's memory of the procedure.\n\nIf the demonstration exercise is not flowing well, it is likely that the learners are having difficulty recalling the procedural details presented in the previous presentation. Asking probing questions can help the learners remember the procedure and apply it to the exercise. This can also help the instructor identify areas where the learners may need additional explanation or clarification. Reviewing the presentation in more detail or quickly leading the learners in a question and answer session may not be as effective, as the learners may not be able to retain the information or apply it to the exercise. Handing out copies of the procedure from the slide presentation may also not be as effective, as it may not help the learners apply the procedure to the exercise.","timestamp":"1725138540.0"}],"exam_id":369},{"id":"QgjAeDgbWLWnMjtAhPxp","exam_id":369,"answer":"A","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"During a tedious technical exercise the instructor notes that the learners are nervous and apprehensive about starting.
