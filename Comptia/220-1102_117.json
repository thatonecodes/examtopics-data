While a surge protector can protect against power surges, it doesn't address voltage drops. Ventilation and PDUs (Power Distribution Units) are also not designed to handle under-voltage situations.","timestamp":"1743725160.0","poster":"4626694","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1441198"}],"exam_id":340,"answer":"B"},{"id":"VHqoaRG6DU80RVmAqqGT","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1741543440,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/163720-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-627-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":583,"choices":{"B":"Use bootable antivirus media to scan the system.","A":"Enable the system firewall.","C":"Download software designed to specifically target the virus.","D":"Run the operating system update process."},"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2025-03-09 19:04:00","question_text":"A user's workstation was infected with a newly discovered virus that the AV system detected.

Using bootable antivirus media allows the antivirus to scan and clean the system before the virus has a chance to load and resist removal.","comment_id":"1387943"},{"timestamp":"1741543440.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is B. Use bootable antivirus media to scan the system.\n\nExplanation:\nBootable antivirus media allows the user to run a virus scan outside the infected operating system. Since the virus is still present after a full scan and reboot, it might be actively interfering with the OS, preventing its removal. By booting from antivirus media, the scan is performed in a clean environment, ensuring the virus is not running and can be effectively removed.","poster":"Isuckatexams","comment_id":"1373363","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":340,"answer":"B"},{"id":"XAAPYcGrpfB559JuwW6y","answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2024-11-15 18:38:00","question_text":"A user is unable to see transaction details on a website, and nothing happens when the user clicks the details button.
