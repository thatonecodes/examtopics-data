Kerberoasting\n\nKerberoasting involves requesting a service ticket for the service account from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). The ticket is then encrypted with the service account's password. By capturing the ticket and attempting to crack it offline, the tester can potentially recover the account's plaintext password.\n\nHere's why the other options are less suitable in this context:\nA. Password spraying: This involves trying common passwords against many accounts to avoid lockouts, but it doesn't leverage the obtained hash.\nB. Golden ticket: This attack requires the hash of the KRBTGT account, not a service account.\nC. Cache poisoning: Typically targets DNS or ARP caches, unrelated to the scenario of having a service account hash.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1740848220.0","content":"But Kerberoasting is a post-exploitation attack used in Microsoft Active Directory environments to obtain password hashes for service accounts. The question states the pen tester already obtained the has of the service account. So by your own explanation for kerberoasting and how the account's plaintext password can be recovered, I would think that using that password and password spraying to see what other account can be exploited/breached without being detected. This is a pen test exam so this is where my head goes and why I'd think the answer would be A. Would love others thoughts on this as these options are somewhat flawed here and feel these exams test to see how well you can read and interpret their questions lol.","comment_id":"1363646","poster":"Ric350"}],"comment_id":"1348053","poster":"Snagggggin","timestamp":"1738084980.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (75%)","D (25%)"],"question_text":"A penetration tester obtains the hash of a service account within a customerâ€™s Active Directory.
