Push notifications.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide additional evidence of their identity beyond just a username and password. When implementing MFA, it is essential to consider user experience, convenience, and ease of use factors. Push notifications can be an effective technology for implementing MFA because they are non-disruptive and user-friendly. With push notifications, users can receive a notification on their mobile devices when they need to authenticate themselves. They can then tap on the notification to complete the authentication process, without having to enter any additional information.

Like TOTP, push notifications fall under the “On-Device Prompt” classification, meaning it’s significantly more secure than using a set of credentials alone.\n\nBut unlike TOTP, push notifications utilize smartphone notifications to assert authentication. In doing so, end users simply have to press a button on their phone to approve or deny access. If an unauthorized party attempts to access their account, they can deny them outright. End users generally find this method of MFA to be convenient. Additionally, push notification-based MFA provides increased levels of security compared to SMS MFA while avoiding the hassles of implementing physical keys.\n\nThe downside of Push Notifications is that it requires another app on your phone. Many end users are reluctant to add additional applications, so this can stunt the roll-out of Push-based MFA.\n\nhttps://jumpcloud.com/blog/push-notification-mfa","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1626072480.0","content":"Try For Free\nUsing Push Notifications for MFA\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is now one of the core methods for securing user access to IT resources.
