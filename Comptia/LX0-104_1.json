It takes two arguments, represented by the variables $1 and $2. These arguments can be passed to the function when it is called. The function performs a calculation that adds the two arguments together and the result is stored in the $(($1 + $2)) expression. The echo command then outputs the result of this expression.\n\nThe keyword function is used to define a function, followed by the function name sumitup. The commands that the function will perform are enclosed in curly braces {} and separated by semicolons ;. In this example, the function only has one command, which is echo $(($1 + $2)).\n\nThis function can be called by simply typing sumitup followed by the two numbers that should be added. For example, sumitup 4 5 will output 9.","comment_id":"804306","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin"}]},{"id":"3ftcGsDfBnhMi9nUvaLX","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"A","choices":{"C":"result: 6 5 4","D":"result: 6 5 4 3 2 1","B":"result: 1 2 3 4 5 6","E":"result: 3 2 1","A":"result: 3 4 5 6 2 1"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98571-exam-lx0-104-topic-1-question-11-discussion/","question_id":2,"timestamp":"2023-02-09 16:09:00","unix_timestamp":1675955340,"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"803364","comments":[{"timestamp":"1676149680.0","content":"Disregard, answer A is correct.","comment_id":"805676","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin"}],"content":"Result: 3 2 1 \nHere's what's happening:\n\nThe echo '1 2 3 4 5 6' command outputs the string 1 2 3 4 5 6 to the standard output.\n\nThe pipe | symbol is used to redirect the standard output of the echo command as the standard input to the next command in the sequence, which is the while loop.\n\nThe while loop reads from the standard input, and read is used to read three values at a time from the standard input into the variables a, b, and c.\n\nThe do keyword starts the body of the while loop, which contains the echo command echo result: $c $b $a.

It is the exit value of the command executed immediately before echo\n\nThe echo $? command in a shell outputs the exit value of the last executed command. In this case, if it outputs 1, it means that the command executed immediately before the echo command terminated with a non-zero exit value. A non-zero exit value usually indicates an error or failure of some sort. The value of the exit status can be used by shell scripts or other programs to determine the success or failure of a previous command. This makes it a useful mechanism for controlling the flow of a shell script or program based on the success or failure of individual commands.","poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676033340.0","comment_id":"804308"}]},{"id":"0N0g13vqawuXoAstaEFT","answer_ET":"VALUES -or- values","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98828-exam-lx0-104-topic-1-question-13-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":4,"unix_timestamp":1676149980,"isMC":false,"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-02-11 22:13:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"805679","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1676149980.0","content":"The word missing from the following SQL statement is values.\n\nThe complete SQL statement would be:\n\ninsert into tablename values (909, 'text');\n\nThis statement inserts a new row into the table tablename with two columns, the first with the value 909 and the second with the value 'text'.
