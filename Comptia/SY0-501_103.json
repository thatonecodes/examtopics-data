It is a severe security breach to give any Security account Domain Admin rights and privileges. A Domain Admin is just a Domain User with more rights and privileges. But a Service account is created to run a Windows Service app. You can display those services (stopped and started services) with the Net Start command or via Administrative Tools.","comment_id":"50247","upvote_count":"6","poster":"MelvinJohn","timestamp":"1581627180.0"}]},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nUser Account.

Some applications and services need to run under the context of an account and a service account fills this need. As an example, SQL Server is a database \n application that runs on a server and it needs access to resources on the server and the network. Administrators create a regular user account, name it something like sqlservice, assign it appropriate privileges, and configure SQL Server to use this account. Note that this is like a regular end-user account. The only difference is that it’s only used by the service or application, not an end user.","comment_id":"10098"}],"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2019-09-07 23:20:00","unix_timestamp":1567891200,"choices":{"A":"Shared account","D":"User account","C":"Service account","B":"Guest account"},"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":515,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/4872-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-52-discussion/","answer":"D"}],"exam":{"name":"SY0-501","isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":1043,"id":366,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Comptia","isBeta":false},"currentPage":103},"__N_SSP":true}
