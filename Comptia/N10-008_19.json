Secure web access to internal corporate resources.\n\nGPT says the most appropriate use case for the deployment of a clientless VPN is to provide secure web access to internal corporate resources. Clientless VPNs are designed to allow users to access internal resources using a web browser without the need for a dedicated VPN client. This use case is suitable when employees or remote users need to securely access internal web-based applications, documents, or services from outside the corporate network.","comment_id":"1049019"},{"comment_id":"981988","timestamp":"1723756680.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"A. Secure web access to internal corporate resources.\n\nClientless VPNs are typically used for providing secure remote access to internal resources without requiring the installation of a dedicated client software on the user's device. They are well-suited for scenarios where users need to access internal resources, such as web applications, files, or services, securely from remote locations using standard web browsers.\n\nOptions B, C, and D might involve different types of VPN technologies, but they don't specifically require the clientless VPN approach. Option A aligns with the primary use case of a clientless VPN, which is to provide secure access to internal resources via a web interface without needing to install a dedicated VPN client.","poster":"paobro"},{"timestamp":"1706590920.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

I would think the gateway would be routing between the client and the server pointing to correct configuration. But, it could also be the case that the packets are being switched at layer 2 vs. routed at layer 3 which would preclude involvement of the gateway. That would leave us able to access local resources (being switched) but running into problem when we need to be routed (at the gateway).","timestamp":"1706726340.0"},{"timestamp":"1697827560.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. The gateway address\n\nIn the scenario described, the end user can access local network shares and intranet pages but is unable to access the internet or remote resources. This indicates that the local network connectivity is working (as evidenced by the ability to access local resources), but there is a problem with accessing external resources.\n\nThe most likely cause of this issue is a misconfiguration of the gateway address. The gateway is responsible for routing traffic from the local network to external networks, including the internet. If the gateway address is incorrect or misconfigured, it can prevent the user's device from reaching external resources while allowing access to local resources.\n\nTherefore, reconfiguring the gateway address on the end user's device should be the first step in troubleshooting this issue.

This indicates that the local network is accessible and the gateway is correctly configured. \n\nIf there was an issue with the gateway address, the user would likely have trouble accessing local network resources as well. However, the user is unable to access the internet or remote resources, which suggests an issue with resolving domain names into IP addresses. This is a function of DNS (Domain Name System) servers. Therefore, reconfiguring the DNS servers would be the appropriate solution in this case.

If the gateway address is misconfigured or not set correctly, it can prevent the user's device from accessing external networks. Local network resources are accessible because they are within the same network, but external resources require the gateway to be properly configured to route traffic beyond the local network.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the issue is a misconfigured gateway address, and it needs to be reconfigured to point to the correct gateway/router for accessing external networks."},{"timestamp":"1677500940.0","poster":"bitezadusto","comment_id":"823648","content":"Selected Answer: C\nits C , if it specified the internet only then it would be D","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1675258860.0","content":"stupid questions, think it is the gateway indeed. because all other could be accesed on a same lan i gues...","comment_id":"795184","poster":"Dogster","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\ngateway I guess","timestamp":"1675134480.0","comment_id":"793582","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JakeCharles"},{"comments":[{"poster":"Will954","timestamp":"1674437700.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"No sir.
