Book definition below\nContent Delivery Network (CDN) is an example of implementing horizontal \nscalability. CDNs leverage the global footprint of cloud platforms by distributing and \nreplicating the components of any service, such as web apps, media, and storage, \nacross all the key service areas needing access to the content. This approach \nallows for the fastest delivery of content to local regions and provides unmatched \nscalability and performance. Typically, CDN Edge Servers are placed at the Internet \nExchange Points (IXP) between different networks. The CDN Servers handle traffic \noriginating in each network and communicate back to the Origin Server. CDN \narchitecture improves website load times; improves availability and redundancy; \nreduces costs by limiting the amount of content delivered directly by an origin \nserver; and improves website security by mitigating DDoS attacks, distributing \ndigital certificates, and facilitating the use of specialized encryption hardware.","timestamp":"1716205740.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSimply addressing availability to international users.","comment_id":"1023181","poster":"Meep123","timestamp":"1727880480.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"A cloud engineer is tasked with improving the responsiveness and security of a company’s cloud-based web application.
