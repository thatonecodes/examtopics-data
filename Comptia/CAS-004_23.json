Introduction to SQL REGEXP\nA regular expression in standard query language (SQL) is a special rule that is used to define or describe a search pattern or characters that a particular expression can hold. For example, a phone number can only have 10 digits, so in order to check if a string of numbers is a phone number or not, we can create a regular expression for it. It is an in-built specification supported in almost all SQL databases.\n\nRegular expressions are very helpful as they let us place multiple lines of code or information in just 1 line. It is particularly helpful in SQL databases when we want to perform validation tasks like if the information provided is a valid PIN code, Contact No, email address, etc. Regular expressions also help in pattern matching or searching the database. https://www.educba.com/sql-regexp/","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/cas-004/image1.png"],"answer":"D","question_id":111,"exam_id":343,"question_text":"A security analyst discovered that a database administrator's workstation was compromised by malware.

Modifying the AllowUsers configuration directive\n\nExplanation:\n\nModifying the AllowUsers configuration in the SSH server's configuration file allows you to specify which users are permitted to log in via SSH. This can restrict access to only specific, authorized accounts, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Given unusual activity on the SSH jump server, tightening access to only essential users would help mitigate potential threats.\n\nWhy Other Options Are Less Suitable:\nA. Alerting the misconfigured service account password: This option would address a specific misconfiguration but is not directly related to controlling SSH access based on the logs.\nC. Restricting external port 22 access: While restricting port 22 may help, it could also disrupt legitimate access.

Modifying the AllowUsers configuration directive\n\nExplanation: The AllowUsers configuration directive in SSH is used to limit the users who can log in to the server. If the logs show unusual activity, it could mean that unauthorized users are attempting to or have gained access to the server. By modifying the AllowUsers configuration, the security analyst can restrict access to only those users who are authorized, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nOption A, altering the misconfigured service account password, might not be the best solution if the issue is not related to a specific service account. Option C, restricting external port 22 access, could potentially disrupt legitimate users who need to access the server. Option D, implementing host-key preferences, is more about ensuring the identity of the server to the client, not about controlling who can access the server.","poster":"Bright07","timestamp":"1717112700.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1678086660.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Pic is missing.","comment_id":"830605","poster":"smqzbq"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/88895-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-20-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-11-26 19:41:00","answers_community":["B (60%)","C (40%)"],"question_text":"A security analyst receives an alert from the SIEM regarding unusual activity on an authorized public SSH jump server.
