This approach allows the security team to see how well the existing defenses work against realistic threats and to identify gaps where improvements are needed.\n\nThis technique is particularly useful when the concern is not just about whether a breach can occur, but how long an attacker could remain undetected in the network, which aligns with the CISO's concern.\n\nThe other options, while useful in different contexts, do not directly address the CISO's specific concern.","timestamp":"1723744560.0","poster":"gomet2000"},{"timestamp":"1722171960.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAdversary emulation involves simulating the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of known threat actors to test the effectiveness of an organization’s defenses.
