Traps are typically used to alert the network team to issues that require immediate attention, such as the power issue described in the scenario.\n\nMIB (Management Information Base) is a database of information used for managing and monitoring network devices. It is not typically used for sending notifications about status changes or other events.\n\nNetFlow is a protocol used for collecting and exporting information about the flow of network traffic.

Traffic shaping is used to optimize or guarantee performance, improve latency, or increase usable bandwidth for some kinds of packets by delaying other kinds.

SNMP\n\nTo retrieve the metrics needed to assess and diagnose performance issues like network latency, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is often used. SNMP allows you to monitor various aspects of network devices and systems, including network latency, bandwidth usage, and performance metrics. By querying the in-house database server and relevant network devices (e.g., switches, routers) via SNMP, you can gather data and statistics to determine if network latency is a contributing factor to the slow response times when fetching records. SNMP provides valuable insights into network performance, making it a suitable choice for troubleshooting such issues."},{"timestamp":"1707396000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nit is A","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Juliana1017","comment_id":"975489"},{"poster":"Doaa81","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
