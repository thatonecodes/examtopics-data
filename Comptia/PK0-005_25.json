Exploit the risk is the BEST action for the project manager to take if an opportunity emerges in the middle of a project lifecycle.\n\nOpportunities are positive risks (also known as opportunities) that can have a beneficial impact on the project. When opportunities emerge, the project manager should take advantage of them by exploiting them. Exploitation involves changing a project management plan in order to enhance the probability of achieving the opportunities. For example, a project manager could assign more resources, speed up a process, or take other proactive measures to exploit the opportunity and maximize the benefits.","poster":"SkylarC","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"879746"}],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Exploit the risk.","D":"Transfer the risk.","B":"Accept the risk.","C":"Avoid the risk."},"exam_id":360,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/107372-exam-pk0-005-topic-1-question-39-discussion/","answer_description":""},{"id":"d9WiGVXIoG9yhEFfPNAA","question_images":[],"question_id":123,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/107364-exam-pk0-005-topic-1-question-4-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Closing the contracts","B":"Releasing the resources","D":"Reconciling the budget","A":"Evaluating the project"},"answer_images":[],"exam_id":360,"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1682373000,"question_text":"Which of the following is an activity that should be used in the closing phase of a project to support the project triple constraint?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"879719","timestamp":"1682373000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Reconciling the budget is an activity that should be used in the closing phase of a project to support the project triple constraint.\n\nThe project triple constraint refers to the relationship between scope, time, and cost in a project.
