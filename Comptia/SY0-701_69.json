This indicates a classic race condition vulnerability, where the attacker takes advantage of a window of opportunity before the legitimate update completes.\n\nSuch attacks are often referred to as time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) attacks.\n\nMalicious update: While this term could describe an attack involving unauthorized data modification, it is not a specific vulnerability type. It lacks the technical specificity to describe the timing-based attack in the scenario.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743039900.0","comment_id":"1410698","poster":"5047e6e"},{"timestamp":"1741197060.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"nocwyn","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA race condition occurs when multiple processes access and manipulate shared data concurrently, leading to unintended behavior.

This can allow attackers to breach networks, steal data, and cause financial loss and reputational damage."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Race condition.\n\nA race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the timing of events, and the order of execution can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful results. In the context of software updates, a race condition can arise when multiple processes or threads attempt to modify the same resource simultaneously. This can lead to corrupted files, security vulnerabilities, or system instability.","timestamp":"1733636820.0","comment_id":"1323391","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Cocopqr"},{"timestamp":"1733296620.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1321754","poster":"soutphote","content":"Selected Answer: A\nisn't it race condition?

PAM (Privileged Access Management)\n\nExplanation:\nPrivileged Access Management (PAM) is the best approach to securing a shared backup account. PAM helps enforce security practices like access controls, session monitoring, and audit logs for privileged accounts. In the event of an SSO failure, PAM can secure and manage access to the shared account, ensuring only authorized users can access the backup account.\n\nOther Options:\nA. RAS (Remote Access Service): This provides remote access functionality but does not offer the specific access control and management needed for securing a shared account.\nB. EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol): A framework used for network authentication, not for managing privileged accounts.\nC.
