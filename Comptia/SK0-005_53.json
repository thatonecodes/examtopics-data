OS security updates\n\nIn this scenario, the mission-critical server has had new components added to it, which may introduce potential security vulnerabilities. To ensure the server remains secure and compliant with corporate policies, it's crucial to apply OS security updates. These updates include patches, fixes, and security enhancements provided by the operating system vendor to address known vulnerabilities and strengthen the overall security posture of the system. Hardening requirements typically involve keeping the system up to date with the latest security patches to mitigate the risk of exploitation by malicious actors. While definition, driver, and application updates are also important for maintaining system integrity and functionality, OS security updates are paramount for addressing security vulnerabilities and maintaining server hardening standards.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1722958020.0","comment_id":"1261727","poster":"[Removed]","content":"No. Adding components will not magically make new OS security updates appear.

A load average of 1 is a machine under full load. Anything over 1 is extremely high and means that the machine is getting behind on its processing. If your machine has a load average near or over 1, and you are not running anything really resource intensive on the machine, then you probably have a runaway process sapping your machine's processing power.\n\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/load-average-in-linux\nhttps://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=runaway-processes"}],"timestamp":"1715147880.0","comment_id":"713581","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nLoad Average in Linux is a metric that is used by Linux users to keep track of system resources. It also helps you monitor how the system resources are engaged.\nTo understand the Load Average in Linux, we need to know what do we define as load. In a Linux system, the load is a measure of CPU utilization at any given moment.\nIt refers to the number of processes which are either currently being executed by the CPU or are waiting for execution.\nAn idle system has a load of 0. With each process that is being executed or is on the waitlist, the load increases by 1.\n\nOccasionally a process will stop responding to the system and run wild. These processes ignore their scheduling priority and insist on taking up 100% of the CPU. Because other processes can only get limited access to the CPU, the machine begins to run very slowly.\n\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/load-average-in-linux\nhttps://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=runaway-processes","poster":"Pongsathorn"},{"content":"Users logging off does not seem to be the answer here.
