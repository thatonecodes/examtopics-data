Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values with no possible values in between. These values are often countable and finite, such as integers. In contrast, continuous data can take on an infinite number of possible values within a given range, including decimal points.

CSV (Comma-Separated Values)\n\nCSV files are plain text files that store tabular data, with each line representing a row and commas separating the values within each row. CSV files are widely supported by statistical software and are easy to import into programs like R, Python (with libraries like pandas), and many others. They are lightweight, simple to create, and can handle large datasets efficiently, making them ideal for exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n\nWhile other file formats like XLSM (Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) have their uses, CSV is typically preferred for initial exploratory analysis due to its simplicity, ease of use, and compatibility with statistical software.","comment_id":"1196764","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","choices":{"D":"JSON","B":"XLSM","C":"XML","A":"CSV"},"answer":"A"},{"id":"1iPLj3axHAcIPYLZ81r7","discussion":[{"poster":"Swift_and_Quick","content":"C.

Logical functions would be appropriate to flag “Yes” for every salesperson who has a number above 1,000,000 in the Quantity_sold column. Logical functions in data analysis are used to make decisions based on a set of conditions. In this case, the analyst can use a logical function such as an IF statement, where the condition is that the salesperson's Quantity_sold is above 1,000,000. If the condition is met, then the Promotion_flag is set to “Yes,” otherwise it is set to “No.”\n\nFor example, the formula could be something like:\nIF(Quantity_sold > 1000000, \"Yes\", \"No\")\n\nThis formula would then be applied to the entire column of Quantity_sold values, and the resulting Promotion_flag column would indicate whether each salesperson is eligible for a promotion based on the number of items they have sold. Logical functions are an essential tool in data analysis, as they allow analysts to make decisions based on specific criteria and automate certain processes in the data analysis process.","poster":"ronniehaang","timestamp":"1690902900.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1688270760.0","content":"C. A logical function would be appropriate for creating a new variable called \"Promotion_flag\" that is based on the values in the \"Quantity_sold\" column. A logical function allows you to perform a logical test and returns a value of TRUE or FALSE based on the test. In this case, the analyst could use a logical function to flag \"Yes\" for every salesperson who has a quantity sold above 1,000,000. For example, the analyst could use the IF function, which has the following syntax: IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false). The logical_test would be a comparison of the \"Quantity_sold\" column to 1,000,000, and the value_if_true would be \"Yes\" and the value_if_false would be \"No\". The other options (Date, Mathematical, and Aggregate) are not related to logical functions.","poster":"CineFeX","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"763531"}],"exam_id":351,"question_id":209,"topic":"1","answer":"C","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image4.png"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-01-02 07:06:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1672639560,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/93519-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-9-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"question_text":"A data analyst has been asked to derive a new variable labeled “Promotion_flag” based on the total quantity sold by each salesperson.
