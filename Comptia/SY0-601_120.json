Based on this, the scenario appears to exhibit MAC address duplication for different IP addresses, specifically, 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.115 having the same MAC address (00-18-21-ad-24-bc). This situation suggests an anomaly known as MAC flooding, which occurs when an attacker overloads the switch's MAC table, associating multiple MAC addresses with a single port. As a result, traffic intended for different devices gets directed to a single port, which can lead to network performance issues or potential security threats.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.

This helps ensure that the team can focus on the real security incidents and respond effectively.\n\nWhy it's not B according to ChatGPT:\n\n- Option B, modifying access so the IT team has full access to the compromised assets, is not a recommended action as it may lead to a conflict of interest and hinder proper investigation and containment.
