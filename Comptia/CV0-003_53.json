Migrate the data to flash storage.\n\nThe best action to correct the latency issue is to migrate the data to flash storage. NL-SAS (Nearline Serial Attached SCSI) storage typically offers lower performance compared to flash storage, which includes SSD (Solid State Drive) technology. Flash storage provides faster read and write speeds, lower latency, and better overall performance compared to traditional spinning disks like NL-SAS.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1169683","poster":"Joshuac1392","timestamp":"1725896220.0"}],"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","exam_id":349,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1710005820,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"czPwdcFqGh4hQFOupJE4","unix_timestamp":1710005880,"question_id":262,"discussion":[{"poster":"BigM","comment_id":"1363913","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nExplanation:\nCloud providers charge for compute resources (such as virtual machines, containers, and databases) as long as they are running. To reduce costs, the best approach is to automate the shutdown of the environment when it is not needed (after work hours).\n\n✔ Shutting down the environment ensures that compute resources are not consuming billable usage when they are not actively needed.\n✔ Most cloud platforms provide scheduling tools (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Automation, Google Cloud Scheduler) to automate start/stop tasks based on time.\n✔ This method significantly reduces cloud expenses by eliminating unnecessary resource usage.","timestamp":"1740913200.0"},{"comment_id":"1249983","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721249340.0","poster":"54a6b25","content":"D.

Shutting down the environment after work hours\n\nAutomating the process of shutting down the environment after work hours is the best option to reduce costs in this scenario. By automatically shutting down the environment during non-working hours, the architect can avoid paying for compute resources that are not being utilized. This approach can result in significant cost savings, especially for environments with high resource consumption during working hours and minimal usage during non-working hours.","timestamp":"1710005880.0","comment_id":"1169685","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Joshuac1392"}],"timestamp":"2024-03-09 18:38:00","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Shutting down the environment after work hours","A":"Scaling of the environment after work hours","B":"Implementing access control after work hours","D":"Blocking external access to the environment after work hours"},"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135586-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-343-discussion/","answer":"C","exam_id":349,"question_text":"A cloud solutions architect has an environment that must only be accessed during work hours.

If this pertains to software being vulnerable then a network scan will do nothing. Network based scans work at layer 4 of the OSI model and cannot detect application layer vulnerabilities.
