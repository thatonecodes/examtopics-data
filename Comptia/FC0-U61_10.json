This helps to prevent unauthorized access in case the default password is known or easily guessable.\n\nChanging the SSID and creating a guest network are also good security practices, but they do not directly address the specific issue of repeated attacks. Switching to WEP security is not recommended, as it is less secure than WPA2.
