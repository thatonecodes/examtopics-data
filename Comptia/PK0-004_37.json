This is known as analogous estimating, which is a top-down estimation technique that uses actual durations and costs from past similar projects as a basis for estimating the duration and cost of the current project. This method can provide an initial estimate of project schedule and can help the project manager identify critical path activities. However, the project manager should also consider other factors, such as team availability, resource constraints, and risks, when developing the project schedule.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1680765120.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"812115","poster":"ramrod1738","content":"C. Hold a full team workshop to review the complete WBS.\n\nThe best way for the project manager to determine the initial sequence and durations is to hold a full team workshop to review the complete Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The team members who will be responsible for executing the tasks are likely to have the most knowledge and experience with the specific tasks, so it is important to involve them in the planning process.\n\nDuring the workshop, the team can collaborate to identify any dependencies between tasks and determine the most logical sequence for completing the work.
