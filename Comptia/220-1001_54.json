In the real world you would tell the end user to select card stock / thick paper in the printer paper settings menu and the laser printer would automatically optimize its settings for this paper type by increasing the fuser temperature. In an office setting, on leased commercial laser printers, most settings are locked out so people don't screw up the printer.
