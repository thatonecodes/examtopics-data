Recovery time objective, B. Uninterruptible power supply, and C. NIC teaming are not directly related to mitigating high CPU utilization of a firewall. Recovery time objective is a measure of how quickly a system can be recovered after a disruption, while uninterruptible power supply provides backup power in the event of a power outage, and NIC teaming is a way to combine multiple network interfaces into a single logical interface to provide redundancy and increased network throughput. While these are important considerations for risk assessment and infrastructure planning, they are not directly related to mitigating high CPU utilization of a firewall.","comment_id":"862320","poster":"RobV"},{"poster":"bjola","timestamp":"1696088220.0","comment_id":"855920","upvote_count":"1","content":"D\n\nLoad balancers should be considered when planning to mitigate high CPU utilization of a firewall?"},{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"856732","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe key word is \"Risk assessment\" RTO (Recovery Time Objective) should be seriously be considered because the company needs to know how long downtime can be tolerated in the process of resolving the high CPU utilization of the firewall.\n\nLoad balancing is not the first thing to consider here so A is absolutely correct.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1062083","poster":"jeanj","upvote_count":"1","content":"no key words are \"following should be considered when planning to mitigate high CPU utilization of a firewall\" its asking for something to stop the problem","timestamp":"1714817460.0"}],"poster":"1Abel1","timestamp":"1696059660.0"},{"comment_id":"848408","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nwhat does a load balancer have to do with a firewall though?
