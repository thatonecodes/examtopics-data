This can prevent the reception of any wireless transmissions outside the facility. It is useful to know that by using a high-powered antenna (which is illegal) a hacker can be far away from your building and still receive these signals. While many building materials such as metal and concrete will provide limited protection, you can also use special paint on the walls that will block these signals.\n\nSometimes emissions coming from the servers themselves can disclose sensitive information. This issue can be addressed by placing the server inside enclosures that can block signals. One example is called a Faraday cage, which implements an outer barrier or coating called a Faraday shield."},{"comment_id":"694268","timestamp":"1665693600.0","poster":"nixonbii","upvote_count":"2","content":"Let's start with the basics.
