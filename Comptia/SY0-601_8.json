In this scenario, the data leak occurred when the proprietary information was downloaded from an employee's COPE tablet and passed to the competitor via cloud storage. DLP can help prevent data loss by monitoring and controlling how data is being used, identifying sensitive data and its location, and setting policies to prevent data exfiltration.\n\nOption A, user training, is important but not sufficient to prevent data loss. Even with proper training, employees may still inadvertently or intentionally leak sensitive information. Option B, CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker), can provide visibility and control over cloud services to detect and prevent data leaks, but it may not be sufficient in this scenario where the data was downloaded from a COPE tablet.

While DLP is probably the right answer, I think MDM may be better (depending on how it is implemented). MDM can force an always on VPN, so the user couldn't send the file out to the cloud. It can restrict the storage of files, or at least place them in secure storage on the device. It can restrict what apps can be used within the corporate partition of the device, preventing access to unapproved cloud storage.

DLP (Data Loss Prevention) would be the best remediation for this data leak. DLP solutions are designed to identify and prevent sensitive data from leaving an organization's network. In this case, the employee's COPE tablet should have been protected by a DLP agent that would have prevented the sensitive documents from being copied to cloud storage. Additionally, the use of data classification labels is a good practice, but it must be coupled with technical controls such as DLP to be effective.
