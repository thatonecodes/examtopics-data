Have the developers use the company's VPN. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) would enable the developers to securely connect to the company's internal network as if they were within the U.S. The VPN ensures that the developers can access the website and work on it without exposing the company’s infrastructure to unwanted traffic from their country. Since the VPN would create an encrypted tunnel from the developers' location to the company’s network, they can bypass the block on foreign IP addresses.\nD. Give the developers access to a jump box on the network. A jump box (or jump server) is a secure machine that the developers can connect to first. From the jump box, they can access the website or the internal systems that are restricted. The jump box acts as an intermediary between the developers and the company's website, allowing controlled access while keeping unwanted traffic blocked. This can be a secure way of providing access without opening up the company’s network to the entire country."},{"comment_id":"1306050","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nThe question states that the company \"plans to\" block the internet traffic from other countries.

This prevents unauthorized access to the website's resources while allowing legitimate developers to access it through approved means.\n• Have the developers use the company's VPN: By requiring developers to connect to the company's network via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), the company can enforce secure and controlled access. The VPN connection ensures that developers' traffic is encrypted and authenticated, providing a secure tunnel through which they can access the website and other company resources.","poster":"isaphiltrick"}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-07-06 18:00:00","question_id":387,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"AB"},{"id":"viEEcOCUYTLIB17BP0H9","question_id":388,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"B":"Characterize safety-critical versus non-safety-critical systems, isolate safety-critical systems from other systems, and increase the directionality of RF links in the field.","A":"Implement a one-way guard between enterprise IT services and mission-critical systems, obfuscate legitimate RF signals by broadcasting noise, and implement modern protocols to authenticate ICS messages.","C":"Create a new network segment for enterprise IT servers, configure NGFW to enforce a well-defined segmentation policy, and implement a WIDS to monitor the spectrum.","D":"Segment supervisory controllers from field PLCs, disconnect the entire network from the internet, and use only the 750MHz link for controlling energy distribution services."},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741363200.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\no Network Segmentation: Separating enterprise IT servers from supervisory industrial systems reduces the risk of lateral movement by attackers.\no Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): Enforcing a well-defined segmentation policy with an NGFW enhances security by controlling and monitoring traffic between segments.\no Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS): Monitoring the spectrum with a WIDS helps detect and respond to unauthorized or malicious wireless activities.","comment_id":"1366321","poster":"Steel16"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727825400.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\n- Establish a unidirectional gateway (data diode) that allows data to flow in only one direction—from mission-critical systems to enterprise IT—but blocks any data from flowing back.
