An HSM is a dedicated computing device that is designed to provide secure storage and management of cryptographic keys and other sensitive data. HSMs are designed to provide a secure environment for the generation, storage, and use of cryptographic keys, as well as the execution of cryptographic operations such as encryption and decryption. This secure environment is necessary to protect the keys from theft or unauthorized access and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. By offloading cryptographic functions to an HSM, organizations can improve the security of their data and reduce the risk of security incidents.","poster":"gnnggnnggnng"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"kumax","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a dedicated, tamper-resistant hardware device that is used to safeguard and manage cryptographic keys and perform secure cryptographic operations.
