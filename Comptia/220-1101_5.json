Power supply wattage rating is the MOST important for the technician to consider before building the gaming computer. This is because a high-end graphics card, video capture card, high-end processor, multiple hard drives, and USB 3.0 hub will require a large amount of power to function properly. The wattage rating of the power supply must match the requirements of these components to avoid power problems and instability in the computer.
