The criteria specified in this command are:\n\n-uid 0: The owner of the file must be the user with the user ID 0, which is usually the root user.\n-perm +4000: The file must have its SUID (Set User ID) bit set. The SUID bit is a permission bit that allows a user to execute a file with the permissions of the file's owner, rather than the user who is executing the file. When the value of the SUID bit is set to 4,000 in binary, it is represented as +4000 in the find command.\nSo, the command will search for all files in the /usr directory that are owned by the root user and have the SUID bit set, and print a list of these files.","comment_id":"803795","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1675986120.0"},{"content":"A. find /usr -uid 0 -perm +4000","comment_id":"803792","timestamp":"1675985940.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin"}],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","exam_id":354,"answer":"A","topic":"7","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"find -type suid -username root -d /usr","B":"find -user root +mode +s /usr","D":"find /usr -ls \\*s\\* -u root","E":"find /usr -suid -perm +4000","A":"find /usr -uid 0 -perm +4000"},"question_id":92,"timestamp":"2023-02-10 00:39:00"},{"id":"a0eMepwgg0xLJk8aMpcc","answer_description":"","topic":"7","question_id":93,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98641-exam-lx0-104-topic-7-question-51-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"FILL BLANK -\nWhich directory holds the files that configure the xinetd service when using several configuration files instead of an integrated configuration file?
