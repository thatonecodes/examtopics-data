For better user experience, however, you might consider using client-side validation. This type of validation is done on the client using script languages such as JavaScript. By using script languages user’s input can be validated as they type. This means a more responsive, visually rich validation.\nWith client-side validation, form never gets submitted if validation fails. Validation is being handled in JavaScript methods that you create (or within frameworks/plugins) and users get immediate feedback if validation fails.\nMain drawback of client-side validation is that it relies on JavaScript. If users turn JavaScript off, they can easily bypass the validation.
