With sticky keys enabled, a user can press and release each modifier key (e.g., Shift, Control, Alt) individually, instead of having to hold down all the keys at once.

It is used to add or remove host names or user names from the list of hosts that are allowed to connect to the X server. The xhost command allows for a fine-grained control of the access permissions to an X server, which can improve security. For example, an administrator can use xhost to allow connections only from trusted hosts, or to block connections from untrusted hosts. It is important to note that the xhost security mechanism should not be relied upon as the sole security measure, as it has some limitations and is relatively easy to bypass.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"804322","timestamp":"1676034240.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675956960.0"}],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"2","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98582-exam-lx0-104-topic-2-question-3-discussion/","question_id":15,"question_text":"What is the purpose of the xhost program?","choices":{"A":"Grant or revoke access to a X11 session.","E":"Display the MOTD and other important information when a user logs in via X11.","D":"Send informational messages to all users logged into a host using X11.","B":"Install all packages and video drivers required to run X11 on a host.","C":"Start the X11 server and announce its availability within the local network."},"answer":"A","exam_id":354,"unix_timestamp":1675956960}],"exam":{"name":"LX0-104","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","id":354,"numberOfQuestions":99,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":3},"__N_SSP":true}
