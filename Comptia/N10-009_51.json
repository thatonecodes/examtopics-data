Single-mode fiber\n\nExplanation:\nAt a distance of 492 feet (150 meters), single-mode fiber is the best choice for connecting network closets. Single-mode fiber is designed for long-distance transmission and provides high bandwidth with minimal signal loss over distances far exceeding the 150 meters required in this scenario.","comment_id":"1320005","poster":"SuntzuLegacy","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1732934700.0"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/152364-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-80-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1732934700,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"A network administrator needs to connect two network closets that are 492ft (150m) away from each other.

Implementing enterprise authentication\n\nExplanation:\nEnterprise authentication (e.g., using WPA3-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise) ensures that each network connection can be uniquely traced back to a user by requiring individual authentication credentials for each user. Typically, enterprise authentication uses an 802.1X authentication framework with a RADIUS server to authenticate users and devices.

Reverse the fibers.\n\nExplanation:\nIn fiber optics, multimode cables often use duplex connectors, and the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) fibers need to be properly aligned. If the indicator light does not turn on, it could be due to the Tx and Rx being mismatched. Reversing the fibers is the quickest and easiest troubleshooting step to verify this alignment issue before moving on to more complex checks like examining the cable or reterminating fibers.","poster":"HeatSquad77","comment_id":"1334987","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1732934880.0","comment_id":"1320010","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. Reverse the fibers.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen terminating and connecting fiber cables, it's common to inadvertently reverse the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) fibers. In a fiber connection, one strand of the cable is used for transmitting data, while the other is used for receiving. If these strands are reversed, the devices cannot communicate, and the indicator light will not turn on.\n\nReversing the fibers is a quick and easy step to verify if the issue is due to Tx/Rx mismatching.","poster":"SuntzuLegacy","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1732934880,"answer_description":"","exam_id":358,"question_id":255,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer":"A","choices":{"B":"Reterminate the fibers.","A":"Reverse the fibers.","D":"Examine the cable runs for visual faults.","C":"Verify the fiber size."},"timestamp":"2024-11-30 03:48:00"}],"exam":{"provider":"Comptia","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"name":"N10-009","numberOfQuestions":271,"id":358,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":51},"__N_SSP":true}
