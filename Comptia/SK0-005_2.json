The proposed solution is wrong, as it seems, you can't change primary/secondary PDU selection on the static installments of the switches,SAN and DC. That gives PDU1 of Rack 2 a remaining capacity of 4.6A, which does not allow HOST1 (6A) to use it as primary power source (9.6A target).\n2. There is no solution in case of a PDU failure in Rack 1.
