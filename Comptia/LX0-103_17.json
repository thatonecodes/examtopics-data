It defines the structure and location of files and directories on the system, specifying where different types of files should be located and how they should be named, as well as common directories and files that should be present in every compliant system. The FHS is important for software developers and system administrators to ensure that their software and systems are compatible with the wider Unix ecosystem."}],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1676219700,"answer_ET":"D","topic":"4","answer":"D","question_id":81,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"adpJow1f1j3rxnrKZl8z","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-02-12 17:37:00","answer_ET":"CE","question_text":"Instead of supplying an explicit device in /etc/fstab for mounting, what other options may be used to identify the intended partition?
