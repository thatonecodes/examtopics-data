Salting involves adding random data, known as a \"salt,\" to each password before it is hashed. This makes it more difficult for attackers to crack the passwords by using pre-computed hash tables, known as \"rainbow tables.\" Hashing involves applying a one-way mathematical function, known as a \"hash algorithm,\" to the salted password to produce a fixed-length output, known as a \"hash value.\" This makes it impossible to determine the original password from the hash value, even if the attacker has access to the database.

When passwords are salted and hashed, they are transformed into a random string of characters that cannot be easily reversed back to the original password. Salting adds an additional random value to each password before hashing, making it more difficult for attackers to guess or crack passwords using precomputed tables or rainbow tables.\n\nBy implementing salting and hashing, even if the username and password database is compromised, the actual passwords will be protected and not immediately usable by attackers.

When users attempt to connect to the legitimate WAP, they may unknowingly connect to the fake WAP instead, which allows the attacker to intercept and potentially modify their network traffic. This type of attack is particularly likely to be successful in areas where there are multiple WAPs, such as in the section of the building closest to the parking lot, where users may be returning to their desks after using their devices elsewhere in the building.
