Cold site\n\nA cold site is the most cost-effective recovery solution for lower-priority applications. Cold sites are disaster recovery sites that are minimally equipped and lack the real-time data replication and immediate failover capabilities of more expensive options like hot sites and cloud sites.\n\nIn a cold site, you have the physical infrastructure (data center space, power, cooling, and basic hardware) available, but it is not continuously running in sync with your primary data center. The equipment is powered off, and the data may not be up to date. In the event of a disaster, you would need to procure and install the necessary hardware and restore data from backups. This process can take longer and may result in a longer recovery time compared to hot or cloud sites.\n\nHowever, for lower-priority applications where extended downtime is acceptable and budget constraints are a significant concern, a cold site provides a cost-effective option to have some level of disaster recovery readiness without the expense of maintaining real-time replication or high availability.","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1698022560.0"},{"poster":"caloke1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA warm site would not have any applications backed up so it must be cloud","comment_id":"992348","timestamp":"1693237500.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1691491260.0","poster":"Juliana1017","comment_id":"975491","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncloud is the chapest, think of virtual vs a physical place"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"891833","timestamp":"1683523860.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nMOST cost-effective recovery solution - this is the most important part","poster":"dev6"},{"comment_id":"875142","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1681945260.0","content":"they should have put rto and rpo time here so it was more clear to answer.
