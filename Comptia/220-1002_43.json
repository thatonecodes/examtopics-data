If the certificate is valid and comes from an authentic certificate provider, your browser confirms that the site is secure and displays a padlock icon in the address bar. This certificate ensures that the website is indeed a legitimate one and not a fake site set up by malicious actors.\nSo, in summary, the browser relies on certificates to establish the authenticity of the remote site when accessing an HTTPS website.","comment_id":"1173367","poster":"Tp2008"},{"poster":"lance12","timestamp":"1643302980.0","comment_id":"533951","upvote_count":"3","content":"Keyword: Authenticity \"CERTIFICATE\""}],"question_text":"When a computer accesses an HTTPS website, which of the following describes how the browser determines the authenticity of the remote site?","exam_id":338,"answer":"A","topic":"1","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/70681-exam-220-1002-topic-1-question-305-discussion/","answers_community":[]},{"id":"4EZc3hnVUxmRF80E7awQ","answer":"B","answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":338,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/45752-exam-220-1002-topic-1-question-306-discussion/","timestamp":"2021-03-01 14:35:00","discussion":[{"comments":[{"content":"a really spooky screensaver might scare those awful hackers tho.","poster":"maw619","comments":[{"comment_id":"698949","content":"Ye maybe a picture of my broken toenail","timestamp":"1666177500.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ITGuy14"}],"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1634003460.0","comment_id":"460865"}],"upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"336802","poster":"dnbly","timestamp":"1618555980.0","content":"B is definitely correct.
