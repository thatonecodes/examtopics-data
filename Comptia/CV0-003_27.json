In this scenario, the systems administrator needs to modify the replication factor of an automated application container from 3 to 5.\n\nTypically, the configuration files for automated application containers are stored in YAML format. The YAML file specifies the properties and settings of the container, including its replication factor. Therefore, the systems administrator should modify the .yaml file on the master controller to change the replication factor from 3 to 5.\n\nThe other file types listed (B. .txt, C. .conf, and D. .etcd) are also used for configuration files in some contexts, but they are less commonly used for automated application containers.","timestamp":"1710978480.0","poster":"poyzerj"},{"comment_id":"844140","timestamp":"1710876900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCould someone explain to my why it's not A. yaml?","poster":"StaticK9","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2023-03-19 20:35:00","isMC":true,"exam_id":349,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/103303-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-221-discussion/","question_text":"A systems administrator needs to modify the replication factors of an automated application container from 3 to 5.

For cloud services, this information is useful for determining scalability settings.

NSGs allow you to filter network traffic to and from network interfaces, VMs, or subnets based on rules that you define. \n\n2. **Granular Control:** NSGs provide granular control over network traffic, allowing you to permit or deny specific types of traffic between resources.

They can ensure that specific virtual machines (in this case, your application) are either kept together on the same host (affinity) or kept separate from each other (anti-affinity).\n\nHere's how affinity rules apply to your requirements:\n\n1. **Application on its own virtual machine:** You can create an affinity rule that ensures your application's virtual machine always runs on its own dedicated host or with specific other virtual machines, depending on your compliance needs.","comments":[{"content":"2. **Hardware does not change:** By specifying an affinity rule, you can prevent the virtual machine from migrating to another host due to load balancing or failover events.
