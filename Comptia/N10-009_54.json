This allows multiple VLANs to be transmitted over a single physical connection by tagging Ethernet frames with VLAN information. This is essential for transferring data across multiple networks between Layer 2 switches"},{"comment_id":"1320021","poster":"SuntzuLegacy","timestamp":"1732935420.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 802.1Q tagging\n\nExplanation:\n802.1Q tagging is a standard for VLAN tagging on Ethernet frames, which allows Layer 2 switches to transfer data for multiple VLANs across a single trunk link. When switches are connected using 802.1Q tagging, they can handle traffic from different VLANs by adding a VLAN tag to each Ethernet frame. This ensures that data for multiple networks (VLANs) is properly identified and routed across the trunk connection."}],"timestamp":"2024-11-30 03:57:00"},{"id":"hA6qA7VIaB1TF6S31rGj","question_id":267,"timestamp":"2024-11-30 03:58:00","isMC":true,"question_text":"A network administrator wants users to be able to authenticate to the corporate network using a port-based authentication framework when accessing both wired and wireless devices.

Direct Connect\n\nExplanation:\nDirect Connect is a service provided by cloud providers (such as AWS Direct Connect) that establishes a dedicated, private link between a companyâ€™s on-premises network and the cloud environment. This connection is typically used for high-bandwidth, low-latency communication and may not include encryption by default, as the link itself is private and separate from the public internet."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. Direct Connect\n\nExplanation:\nDirect Connect (or similar services, depending on the cloud provider) refers to a dedicated, private connection between an organization's on-premises network and a cloud environment. This connection does not go through the public internet and provides higher performance, lower latency, and more reliable bandwidth.\n\nSince it is a private link, encryption is often not included by default, as the data does not traverse the public internet. However, encryption can be added if needed for additional security.","poster":"SuntzuLegacy","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1320023","timestamp":"1732935480.0"}],"topic":"1","question_id":268,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/152378-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-96-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-11-30 03:58:00","question_text":"Which of the following is most closely associated with a dedicated link to a cloud environment and may not include encryption?","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":358,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1732935480,"question_images":[],"answer":"A"},{"id":"lB07qgVdl72DlynHPEoT","answer_images":[],"question_id":269,"question_text":"A systems administrator is investigating why users cannot reach a Linux web server with a browser but can ping the server IP.

Running tcpdump on the server will help the administrator observe if the server is receiving the HTTP requests (on port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS) from users and whether the server is responding to those requests. This would be the first step to identify if the issue lies with the server not receiving or not responding to web traffic.","comment_id":"1314104","timestamp":"1731951120.0","upvote_count":"5","comments":[{"timestamp":"1739365260.0","poster":"Big_Wes","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1355609","content":"Yes, but it asks which you should do FIRST.

Switch\n\nExplanation:\nA switch can operate at multiple layers of the OSI model, depending on its type:\n\nLayer 2 (Data Link Layer):\nMost switches are Layer 2 devices. They forward traffic based on MAC addresses and use a MAC address table to direct frames to the appropriate ports.\n\nLayer 3 (Network Layer):\nLayer 3 switches (often called multilayer switches) can perform routing functions, forwarding traffic based on IP addresses. These switches combine the functionality of traditional Layer 2 switches and routers, making them versatile in modern networks.","poster":"SuntzuLegacy","timestamp":"1732935780.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1320025"}],"unix_timestamp":1732935780,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/152379-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-98-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following devices can operate in multiple layers of the OSI model?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-11-30 04:03:00","answer_images":[],"answer_description":""}],"exam":{"provider":"Comptia","id":358,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"name":"N10-009","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":271},"currentPage":54},"__N_SSP":true}
