According to the specifications, an IPv6 address consists of 8 blocks of 16-bit hexadecimal values separated by colons (:). Each block can be represented by 4 hexadecimal characters, or can be abbreviated using a double colon (::) to represent consecutive blocks of zeros. For example, the address 2001:db8:3241::1 is a valid IPv6 address, where 2001:db8:3241 are the non-zero blocks, and the double colon represents multiple blocks of zeros.\n\nIn contrast, the addresses 2001::db8:4581::1 and 2001%db8%9990%%1 are not valid IPv6 addresses, as they do not follow the specified format. The address 2001.db8.819f..1 is also not valid, as it uses dots instead of colons to separate the blocks.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676046960.0","comment_id":"804575","poster":"linux_admin"}],"exam_id":354,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98747-exam-lx0-104-topic-5-question-25-discussion/","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":57,"unix_timestamp":1676046960,"answer":"A","question_text":"Which of the following is a valid IPv6 address?","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-10 17:36:00","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"2001:db8:0g41::1","B":"2001::db8:4581::1","D":"2001%db8%9990%%1","E":"2001.db8.819f..1","A":"2001:db8:3241::1"},"isMC":true},{"id":"9qNckuSRk7rAVovhpsAT","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"topic":"5","answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":354,"choices":{"B":"nameserver","D":"lookup","E":"method","A":"substitute","C":"search"},"answer_ET":"BC","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98749-exam-lx0-104-topic-5-question-26-discussion/","question_id":58,"question_text":"Which of the following keywords can be used in the file /etc/resolv.conf?

The /etc/services file is a database of well-known port numbers and their associated service names. The port numbers are used by Internet servers to identify the type of service being requested by a client. For example, when a client connects to a web server, it typically connects to port 80. The /etc/services file maps the port number 80 to the service name http. When programs like netstat display network connections, they use the information in /etc/services to display the service name instead of just the port number.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"804547","timestamp":"1676045400.0"}],"answer_ET":"E","unix_timestamp":1676045400,"question_id":59,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-10 17:10:00","answers_community":[],"choices":{"B":"/etc/portmapper","C":"/etc/protocols","D":"/etc/resolv.conf","E":"/etc/services","A":"/etc/networks"},"answer":"E","topic":"5","exam_id":354,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98738-exam-lx0-104-topic-5-question-3-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following files is consulted when programs like netstat try to match port numbers to names?"},{"id":"OHMDkJitaiHvKeTZerZD","timestamp":"2023-02-10 17:14:00","discussion":[{"content":"A correct entry in the /etc/hosts file would be:\n\n127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost\n\nThis entry maps the hostname localhost to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1.
