It only changes IPs from private to public and vice versa. PAT is similar to NAT but it only changes ports (port forwarding).\n\nDMZ also doesn't have much to do with routing. Its purpose is to separate more trustworthy network segments from the less trustworthy. Hosts may still know about routes between zones but they may not be able to access them.\n\nOut of these 4 answers, VPN makes actually the most sense. I agree the question, as usually is vague, but let's consider this:\nA company sets up site-to-site and client VPNs. When a user connects to his VPN, it will likely download internal routes that would allow him to go to internal resources. Same with site-to-site VPN. Normally a VPN hub would advertise routes to the company internal network and a site would advertise its subnet(s). In each case it would look like a site or a client are within the same network. For the public Internet all the routes would be hidden within encrypted ESP packets.\n\nAnother vague & poorly written question...","comment_id":"411882"},{"content":"The way I believe is that router is placed in side of network to manage internal network and go outside to public.
