These enclosed entryways are designed to restrict and monitor access to a building by allowing only one person to enter at a time, typically through a series of interlocking doors.\n\nThe function is not to restrict users WITHIN the data center.

Your entire datacenter should be a restricted area (perhaps with some areas more restrictive than others). The ONLY way a third party should be on the floor of your datacenter is with an escort.\n\nThat said, the CompTIA study guide doesn't really go into escorts as a security measure. But they do say:\nPhysical security can be thought of in terms of zones. Each zone should be separated by its own barrier(s). Entry and exit points through the barriers need to be controlled by one or more security mechanisms. Progression through each zone should be progressively more restricted. \n\nSo I suspect they would argue that if you have different zones with different restrictions, there should be a physical separation between them.

Customers can access these applications over the internet, typically through a web browser, and pay only for the services they use. SaaS applications are often fully managed and maintained by the provider, so customers do not need to worry about installing, configuring, or maintaining the applications themselves. In contrast, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Anything as a Service (XaaS) providers offer more generic services, such as storage, computing, or networking resources, that customers can use to build and deploy their own applications.","poster":"FMMIR","timestamp":"1670796120.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect ans is B","timestamp":"1670169960.0","comment_id":"735223","poster":"JSOG","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"735142","timestamp":"1670164200.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","content":"B: SaaS - totally managed by cloud provider, ready to use by customer"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1670164200,"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"D":"XaaS","B":"SaaS","C":"PaaS","A":"IaaS"}},{"id":"nJ6APG4WT3AVmxMgOHaV","timestamp":"2022-12-04 15:31:00","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1670164260,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/89972-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-292-discussion/","answer":"C","question_text":"Which of the following BEST helps to demonstrate integrity during a forensic investigation?","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"question_id":214,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1670856240.0","upvote_count":"14","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHahshing = Checksum = Integrity","comment_id":"742931","poster":"sauna28"},{"poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"940339","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHashing is a cryptographic technique that generates a unique fixed-size string of characters (hash value) based on the input data. The hash function takes the original data and produces a hash value that is unique to that specific data. Even a slight change in the input data will result in a significantly different hash value. Hashing is commonly used in forensic investigations to verify the integrity of digital evidence.\n\nDuring a forensic investigation, investigators can calculate the hash value of a file or a set of data using a specific hashing algorithm (such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256). The calculated hash value can then be compared with the original hash value to verify if the data has remained unchanged or if any tampering has occurred.\n\nBy comparing the hash values, investigators can demonstrate the integrity of the evidence by showing that the original data has not been modified since the hash values match. If the hash values differ, it indicates that the data has been altered or tampered with, raising concerns about the integrity of the evidence.","timestamp":"1688247960.0"},{"comment_id":"736740","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1670324280.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHashing using checksum","poster":"[Removed]"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1670321700.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHashing provides integrity.
