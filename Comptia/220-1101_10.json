Switches only send data to the specific computer, while hubs send data to all computers inside the network.\n\nSwitches operate on the data link layer of the OSI model and are designed to send data only to the specific computer that is intended to receive it, based on the computer's media access control (MAC) address. This makes network communication more efficient and secure. In contrast, hubs operate at the physical layer of the OSI model and simply broadcast all data to all connected computers, which can lead to network congestion and security issues.","comment_id":"825569"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nBecause that hubs operate at OSI Layer 1 and switches operate at OSI Layer 2, the hub sends all traffic to all hosts connected to the hub. Hubs only run in half-duplex meaning it can only send and receive traffic one at a time. Switches in the other hand floods out its port except the given VLAN. While hubs create more collision domains, switches divides out collision domains and increases broadcast domains. Switches can run in either full, or half duplex.","comment_id":"869590","poster":"ScorpionNet","timestamp":"1728835260.0"},{"poster":"Tomeq","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\n.
