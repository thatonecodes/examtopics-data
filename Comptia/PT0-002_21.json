Web archive. Web archives, such as the Wayback Machine, store and index websites at different points in time, allowing users to view a website as it looked in the past. As the penetration tester has learned that the complete phone catalog was published on the company's website a few months ago, the tester should first look in the web archive to try to locate the employees' phone numbers. \n\nB. GitHub is a code repository and does not store or archive websites, so it would not be the first place for the penetration tester to look.\n\nC. File metadata is data about data, such as the author, creation date, location and other file properties. It would not be the first place to look for the employees' phone numbers.\n\nD. Underground forums are online discussion boards where users can share information, often anonymously. They would not be the first place to look for the employees' phone numbers.","poster":"RRabbit_111","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"780347","timestamp":"1705605300.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"973226","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIf the company's complete phone catalog was published on the website a few months ago and then removed, the Web Archive would be the most likely place to find a snapshot of the website from that time period.

It doesn't fix this SPECIFIC vulnerability.\n\nEncryption is just another best security practice that doesn't remediate the underlying vulnerability in question.\n\nThe secure SDLC is just a theoretical framework.
