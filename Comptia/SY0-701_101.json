Patching\n\nExplanation:\nPatching is the process of applying updates to software, firmware, or operating systems to fix security vulnerabilities, improve functionality, and maintain stability—all while preserving critical application data. Regular patching ensures that security flaws are addressed without disrupting the application or losing important data.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. Reformatting: Involves wiping and reinstalling the system, which results in data loss unless backed up.\nB. Decommissioning: Refers to retiring an application or system, often leading to data archiving or removal.\nD.

Obfuscation\n\nExplanation:\nObfuscation is the process of modifying code to make it difficult for unauthorized parties to understand, reverse-engineer, or modify while maintaining its functionality. This helps protect proprietary software from intellectual property theft when exporting to external customers.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. Code signing: Ensures authenticity and integrity but does not prevent reverse engineering or IP theft.\nC.
