An issue occurs.\n\nThe project risk register is a document that is used to track and manage risks throughout the life of a project. It typically includes a list of identified risks, along with information about the probability and impact of each risk, the risk response plan, and the current status of each risk. When an issue occurs – that is, when a risk event occurs and has a negative impact on the project – it is important to update the risk register to reflect the current status of the risk. This may involve revising the risk response plan, reassessing the probability and impact of the risk, and updating the status of the risk to reflect its current status.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"kmanb"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAn issue is def something you want to update the risk register","upvote_count":"1","poster":"brvndvnwolf","timestamp":"1669135320.0","comment_id":"724486"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nA stakeholder initiating a change request sounds like a RISK to me","poster":"Netlink","timestamp":"1666880700.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"705654"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1663884540.0","comment_id":"676583","poster":"boxv4","upvote_count":"3","content":"The key words are \"MOST likely.\" When an issue occurs you're going to update the risk registry to have an up-to-date log of these things.

Update the issue log and discuss it with the stakeholders.\n\nWhen a change is requested by stakeholders that could potentially impact the projected budget for a project, it is important for the project manager to carefully consider the implications of the change and its potential impacts on the project. One key step in this process is to update the issue log – a document that tracks issues, risks, and other items that need to be addressed by the project team – to reflect the change request and any associated impacts on the project. The project manager should then discuss the change request with the stakeholders to understand their motivations for the request, assess the potential impacts on the project, and determine the best course of action.","poster":"kmanb","comment_id":"767244","timestamp":"1672976160.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-01-06 04:36:00"},{"id":"86FJuBUThIZVTobHOqIG","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C","timestamp":"1669135020.0","poster":"brvndvnwolf","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"724476"},{"poster":"all4one","timestamp":"1667500140.0","comment_id":"710720","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"Virtual\" team so that rules out face-to-face.
