This entry point could be a malware-infected machine that connects to the network, a stolen set of user credentials (username and password), a vulnerability exploit via a server's open port, or a number of other attack methods.\nIf they entered a network through a vulnerability or malware infection, attackers may use a keylogger (which tracks the keys users type) to steal user credentials.
