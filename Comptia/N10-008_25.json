But I can't see any case where this would help the situation. \nMIBs on the other hand, there is not much detailed information from any of my resources. So I went to cisco support community forums, if this \"VIP Mentor\" is correct, then A should be the answer. They state \"SNMP MIBS are not installed on the switch but used for SNMP Manager Software solutions where they can be imported for monitoring your device.\" I thought that MIBs would be installed on the device itself, but if it's on the monitoring software, I'd have to guess that's the problem, as it would seem to me the whole problem here is the monitoring software is old and can't read data from the device with a newer OS."},{"timestamp":"1725913920.0","comment_id":"1281240","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA system baseline is a snapshot of a system's configuration, performance, and security metrics at a specific point in time.
