Suppose you have this bunch of SCADA devices, right, and you're responsible for them and what not. What is the absolute first thing you have to do? It's obvious! You have to put them in their own network! Segmentation goes first, that's a no-brainer. But what next? The next obvious step really is putting a Firewall in place. Limiting the amount of connections towards the SCADA devices (from the admin network to the scada network) and limiting the amount of ports that can be reached out to. After all that, it's time to disable unused services. And after that it's patching. And after that it's continuous monitoring.

Then, the college’s cybersecurity analysts could perform scans on any devices that are connected to the network using the active scanning engine at the desired intervals. Agent-based scanning would be ineffective since the college cannot force the installation of the agents onto each of the personally owned devices brought in by the students or faculty. A cloud-based or server-based engine may be useful, but it won't address the centrally-managed requirement.
