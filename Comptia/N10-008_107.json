Both are valid for this subnet.\n\nThe correct answer is D, because the PC is not getting a valid IP address from the DHCP server. The PC has an APIPA address, which is in the range of 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254. This indicates that the PC could not contact a DHCP server and assigned itself a link-local address.
