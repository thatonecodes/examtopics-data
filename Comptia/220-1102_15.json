There's only 70-90 questions per core tests (My Core 1 had 70). Don't tell me you honestly believe every correct answer is worth 10+ marks each? If that was the case, why didn't they just grade it from 0%-100% instead of an odd scale to 900?\n\nIt works like this:\nThe test questions have a \"Most Correct\" answer, a \"semi-correct\" answer, a \"Mostly Wrong\" and a \"Completely Wrong\" answer.\n\nI don't know the exact numbers, but a completely wrong answer would likely give you 0 pts. Mostly wrong would probably be around 3 pts, semi correct around half marks, and fully correct would grant full marks.

Without AutoPlay, the malicious file will not be executed automatically upon plugging in the flash drive, reducing the risk of infection.
