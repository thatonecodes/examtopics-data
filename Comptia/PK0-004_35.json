The project manager can also evaluate if the current schedule is achievable or if it needs to be adjusted.\n\nOnce the project manager has reviewed the task start and finish dates, they can then analyze the assigned hours, assess the risk register's new items, and explore the possibility of obtaining additional resources if necessary.\n\nHowever, the first step should be to review the task start and finish dates to gain a clear understanding of the situation and identify any potential issues with the project schedule.
