The action would be to deceive the night guard with falsified employee IDs and permit the testing team into the building. The goal is not to circumvent the alarm, which B and D effectively do.

However, it is less effective at preventing and detecting complex fraudulent activities that occur through electronic systems.\n\nD.

Enforce mandatory employee vacations:\n\n • Enforcing mandatory employee vacations is a well-known fraud prevention strategy. It ensures that employees must take time away from their duties, which can disrupt and potentially expose ongoing fraudulent activities.
