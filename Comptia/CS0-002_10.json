The SIEM alert indicates that an IDS signature detected an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 (CVE-2017-5638), which allows remote code execution via a crafted Content-Type header4. The packet capture and TCP stream show that the attacker sent a malicious request with a Content-Type header containing an OGNL expression that executes the command “whoami” on the target server. However, this does not necessarily mean that the attack was successful, as it depends on whether the target server was running a vulnerable version of Apache Struts 2 or not.
