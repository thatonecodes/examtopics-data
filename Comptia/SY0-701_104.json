Insider threat\n\nExplanation:\nARP poisoning (or ARP spoofing) involves sending fake Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local network, which can cause network traffic to be misdirected or intercepted. The analystâ€™s discovery of the attack and their immediate response to terminate access indicates that someone may be intentionally disrupting the network.\n\nGiven the context that the attack is occurring during a sensitive time (state testing) and considering that the attacker was able to execute such an attack and cause significant disruption, it's likely that the attacker has access to the internal network and knowledge of its operation, which aligns with an insider threat. Insiders, whether employees, contractors, or others with network access, are often responsible for these types of attacks.","timestamp":"1739239500.0"}],"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156337-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-565-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"exam_id":368},{"id":"HZdzOVYpONSeaPtHUqUp","exam_id":368,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Typosquatting","D":"Vishing","B":"Pretexting","A":"Cross-site scripting"},"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1739239560,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156338-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-566-discussion/","question_text":"A user needs to complete training at https://comptiatraining.com.

Typosquatting\n\nExplanation:\nTyposquatting is a form of cyber attack where an attacker registers a domain name similar to a legitimate website but with a slight typo or variation. In this case, the user manually entered the URL \"https://comptiatraining.com\", which is likely a misspelling or variation of a legitimate website, and was redirected to a fake website designed to look similar to the legitimate one. The noticeable difference in the website suggests that the user may have been directed to a typosquatted site that attempts to trick the user into providing sensitive information or interacting with malicious content.","poster":"test_arrow","timestamp":"1739239560.0","comment_id":"1354792"}]},{"id":"z6rvoXL6zuskcFmThqnZ","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1739239620,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. MSA (Master Service Agreement)\n\nExplanation:\nAn MSA (Master Service Agreement) is a contract that establishes the general terms and conditions for an ongoing or long-term relationship between a company and a service provider. It typically covers standard terms for multiple engagements or projects and can be revisited periodically, as in the case described (every three years), without needing to renegotiate the entire agreement each time.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nB. NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): An NDA is focused on protecting confidential information and does not typically govern the general terms of a business relationship.\nC. MOU (Memorandum of Understanding): An MOU is a non-binding document that outlines the intent to collaborate but is not typically used for establishing the detailed terms of service.\nD. SLA (Service Level Agreement): An SLA defines the specific performance metrics, deliverables, and quality standards for services provided but is usually a more detailed agreement tied to specific engagements, not a general framework for the entire relationship.","timestamp":"1739239620.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"test_arrow","comment_id":"1354793"}],"topic":"1","exam_id":368,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":518,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156339-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-567-discussion/","choices":{"D":"SLA","A":"MSA","B":"NDA","C":"MOU"},"timestamp":"2025-02-11 03:07:00","answer_ET":"A","question_text":"A company has yearly engagements with a service provider.

Be alert to unexpected requests from familiar email addresses\nExplanation:\nCompromised email accounts are a common attack vector. If a vendor's email account is compromised, attackers may use it to send legitimate-looking, but malicious, emails. Employees should be trained to recognize unexpected requests from familiar email addresses, as this could indicate that an email is fraudulent or part of a phishing attack.\n\nwhy not A:\nA.
