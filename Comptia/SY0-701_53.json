Creating a false text file in /docs/salaries\n\nExplanation:\nThis technique is an example of setting up a honeypot or decoy. A false text file labeled something enticing like \"salaries\" could attract the attention of an insider threat. If the malicious insider attempts to access it, their behavior can be monitored or flagged. This method does not compromise system security but instead acts as bait to detect malicious activity.\n\nOther Options:\nB.

Setting weak passwords in /etc/shadow\n\nExplanation:\nIn an insider threat scenario, one of the most likely techniques to attract the attention of a malicious attacker is setting weak passwords in the /etc/shadow file. This file stores password hashes for user accounts, and if an insider sets weak passwords, attackers can potentially crack these passwords through brute force or other methods. Once an attacker has access to weak passwords, they can escalate privileges, access sensitive information, or exploit the system for malicious purposes.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"laternak26","comment_id":"1331120","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCreating a false text file in /docs/salaries attracts insiders, which usually looking for sensitive information.","timestamp":"1735045260.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Kokoh23","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis question is from a security operations prospective and focuses on how to catch an insider threat. \n\n#1 Never set a weak password.

Insider threat detection.\nInsider threat detection focuses on identifying and mitigating risks posed by individuals within the organization who may intentionally or unintentionally compromise the organization's sensitive assets, such as intellectual property. Since intellectual property is a key asset, employees (whether disgruntled, negligent, or malicious) can be a significant threat to its security. Training employees to recognize warning signs of insider threats, along with appropriate actions to take if they suspect suspicious behavior, is critical for protecting intellectual property.","poster":"Segunmx","timestamp":"1732546080.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/151975-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-335-discussion/","question_text":"An organization maintains intellectual property that it wants to protect.
