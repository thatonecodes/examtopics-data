The issue of invalid data types can often be resolved by converting the values to a consistent data type, such as converting character values to integer values, or vice versa.","comment_id":"795318"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Invalid data type is the BEST description for the issue in which character values are mixed with integer values in a data set column. In this case, the data set column has a mix of two different data types - character values (e.g. text or string) and integer values (whole numbers). This is considered invalid as a data set column should have a consistent data type for all values in the column.\nWhen character values are mixed with integer values, it can cause problems during data analysis and processing, as the software may not know how to handle these mixed values. For example, if the analyst tries to perform mathematical operations on the column, the software may produce an error or incorrect results, as it does not know how to handle the character values.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ronniehaang","timestamp":"1690901040.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"CineFeX","content":"D. Invalid data type\n\nIf a data set column contains character values mixed with integer values, it would be considered to have an invalid data type. A data type refers to the type of information that a column can contain, such as numbers, text, or dates. Mixing character values with integer values in the same column would be considered invalid because it violates the expected data type for the column. The other options (duplicate data, missing data, and data outliers) are not related to the data type of the values in the column.","comment_id":"763527","timestamp":"1688270520.0"},{"content":"D: is correct","timestamp":"1684901400.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"725589","poster":"lordguck"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"702979","poster":"wanyu","timestamp":"1682337000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's D"}],"timestamp":"2022-10-24 13:50:00","unix_timestamp":1666612200,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Missing data","C":"Data outliers","D":"Invalid data type","A":"Duplicate data"},"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following BEST describes the issue in which character values are mixed with integer values in a data set column?","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (80%)","C (20%)"],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/86330-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-6-discussion/","exam_id":351,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_id":176},{"id":"82P1UoaTWZ8mnlIszANw","isMC":true,"exam_id":351,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image21.png"],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Include a line chart using the site and the percentage of new customers data.","A":"Include a bar chart using the site and the percentage of new customers data.","C":"Include a pie chat using the site and percentage of new customers data.","D":"Include a scatter chart using the site and the percent of new customers data."},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728403860.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"A. the bar chart would be better then a pie chart (usually used for percent) because, the data set shows percent increases not percent of a whole.","comment_id":"864837","poster":"Correct_Damage"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/105601-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-60-discussion/","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-08 18:11:00","question_id":177,"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1680970260,"question_text":"An analyst is designing a dashboard to determine which site has the highest percentage of new customers.
