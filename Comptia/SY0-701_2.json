Social engineering\n\nExplanation:\nSocial engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. In this scenario, the suspicious caller was attempting to deceive the user into providing credit card information by falsely claiming to be acting on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer. This tactic is a classic example of social engineering, where the attacker uses social manipulation rather than technical hacking methods to obtain sensitive information.\n\nIt is not D because this is a type of phishing attack that specifically targets high-profile executives (also known as \"whales\") to steal sensitive information. While the scenario does involve the mention of a high-ranking executive, it is broader in scope and fits under the general category of social engineering rather than a specific whaling attack through email.","poster":"Bimbo_12","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1721628960.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1250549","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHow I understand it is Whaling is when they impersonate an executive, executive whaling is when they target an executive (spearfishing in a sense), and social engineering is a broad form of trickery to deceive whoever the target is (not specific) to divulge information.","poster":"TheMichael","timestamp":"1721318640.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn CompTIA's lessons for 701, the only reference I could find for \"whaling\" is a definition of \"targeting employees that have influential roles.\" \n\nI'm going with C.
