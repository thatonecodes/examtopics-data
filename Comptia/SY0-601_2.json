By restricting network access, unauthorized parties are less likely to exploit vulnerabilities in the unsupported systems.

By limiting the network access of these systems, you can minimize their exposure to potential threats from the internet or unauthorized users.

Increase the frequency of vulnerability scans would be the BEST option to reduce the security risks introduced when running systems that have expired vendor support and lack an immediate replacement.\n\nWhen vendor support for a system has expired, it is no longer receiving security updates or patches from the vendor. This leaves the system vulnerable to known and unknown vulnerabilities. Increasing the frequency of vulnerability scans allows for the identification and remediation of any vulnerabilities that may be present. By identifying vulnerabilities earlier, the organization can take action to minimize the risk of exploitation.","timestamp":"1680003060.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"monzie","comment_id":"853176","comments":[{"content":"I would agree except that if you do identify a new vulnerability you cannot remediate it so increasing the scans will only increase the risks that you must accept and do nothing to mitigate them.","timestamp":"1681344780.0","comment_id":"868929","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Confuzed"}]},{"comment_id":"799035","timestamp":"1675618920.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"TinyTrexArmz","content":"Maybe it's my lack of imagination, but I can't think of a case where you wouldn't Implement proper network access restrictions by default even on a system with vendor support still active and can be immediately replaced."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"737489","poster":"mick1","timestamp":"1670393340.0","content":"I would say D - as system is not changing role, and in ANY use case, network access should be minimized (or at least planned for system) - so if i don't want to change device role, just reduce risk, I would go with more scans.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1673657940.0","poster":"KingDrew","content":"Unfortunately that doesn't reduce the risk, they can still attack, and the scans will only detect that attack not reduce the probability of chance of it happening.
