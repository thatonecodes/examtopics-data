Ensuring that network requirements are met is important, but licensing typically presents more immediate and potentially blocking issues.\n\nRight-sizing is important to optimize resource utilization and cost in the cloud, but this typically follows after ensuring that the software can be legally and compliantly rehosted in the new environment. Licensing issues need to be resolved before detailed performance and resource planning can be effectively done.\n\nERP systems typically come with complex licensing agreements that may include specific terms for deployment on different types of environments, such as on-premises versus cloud. Many software vendors have distinct licensing models for cloud deployments which might differ in cost and terms from on-premises licenses. Ensuring that the licenses are compliant with the new deployment in the public cloud is crucial to avoid potential legal and financial penalties.
