The server staples the OCSP response to the certificate and returns it to the client during the TLS handshake. This approach enables the presenter of the certificate, rather than the issuing CA, to bear the resource cost of providing OCSP responses. It also enables the server to cache the OCSP responses and supply them to all clients. This significantly reduces the load on the OCSP responder because the response can be cached and periodically refreshed by the server rather than by each client.

Delta CRLs contain only newly revoked certificates since the last full CRL was issued, and therefore have smaller file sizes than full CRLs. This reduces the amount of traffic between the headquarters and branch offices. Additionally, using Delta CRLs will have the lowest power requirement on the CA compared to other solutions, such as deploying an RA on each branch office or configuring clients to use OCSP.
