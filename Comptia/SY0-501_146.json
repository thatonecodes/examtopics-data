As the name suggests, an ABAC system is capable of making access decisions based on a combination of subject and object attributes plus any context-sensitive or system-wide attributes. As well as group/role memberships, these attributes could include information about the OS currently being used, the IP address, or the presence of up-to-date patches and anti-malware. An attribute-based system could monitor the number of events or alerts associated with a user account (in this case, if the web server application is compromised) or with a resource, or track access requests to ensure they are consistent in terms of timing of requests or geographic location. \nConditional access is an example of rule-based access control.
