In the cloud, orchestration is often key to ensuring that automated spin-up activities like auto-scaling take place in the right order, with the right security rules and permissions in place.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1607039460.0","poster":"seho"}],"answer":"D","topic":"1","exam_id":348,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/34597-exam-cv0-002-topic-1-question-181-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-10-15 20:25:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1602786300,"question_images":[],"question_id":62,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"A cloud technology vendor has released an update to its product.

Use alert correlation rules to group alerts that are related.\n\nFor example, if a server in your organization goes offline, you do not need to see additional alerts that show that the virtual machines or applications running on the server are also down. Instead, these additional alerts, or secondary alerts, are grouped under the root alert called the primary alert. You can see these grouped alerts in the alert list in Alert Intelligence.\n\n A primary alert identifies the root cause of an event.\n A secondary alert is another alert that the same event generates, but is considered less important than the primary alert.\n\nI think the answer could be A or B","timestamp":"1617217260.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1602786300},{"id":"96RchOb0xvVAA2GF8iTy","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"A consultant is helping a gaming-as-a-service company set up a new cloud.

Community clouds are built and operated specifically for a targeted group who have common cloud requirements and whose ultimate goal is to work together to achieve a specific business objective.\n\nImages\n\nA community cloud provides a segregated approach to cloud computing for increased security. The key to a community cloud is that it can be scoped to a specific group.\n\nCommunity clouds are usually implemented for organizations working on joint projects that require a central cloud for managing and executing those projects. A finance community cloud, for example, could be set up to provide specific security requirements or optimized to provide low latency to perform financial transactions. A community cloud can be either on premises or off premises and can be managed by a cloud provider or by the organizations themselves.","poster":"seho"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Right anser is A","poster":"Alizadeh","timestamp":"1606325340.0","comment_id":"227744"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1602786420}],"exam":{"id":348,"isImplemented":true,"name":"CV0-002","numberOfQuestions":183,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Comptia","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":13},"__N_SSP":true}
