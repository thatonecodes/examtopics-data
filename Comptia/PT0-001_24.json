I would say A because the intention by the n00b to achieve persistence with the A is higher than the D, thanks to the errouneous \"/run\" switch. The A would be the most straight foward way to accomplish.\nNow the D, the problem is that saving the reg is useless. It would be better to add to the registry, and in consequence, I don't see any intention from the n00b writting the D command to want to achieve persistence, it would more be information gathering.\nIf we follow the logic of \"correcting\" the answers, the C can be also a correct answer, by adding \"&& Sv.ps1\", altought this wouldn't work for multiple reasons.\nI would anwser A.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1637139300.0","comment_id":"479882","poster":"juandante"},{"poster":"staccata","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"439629","content":"PenTest+ Practice Tests Book - SYBEX\nMany Q's are from Sybex Practise Tests Book..\nCorrect Answer is D from the book if you care..","timestamp":"1630836240.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1616439300.0","comment_id":"317449","poster":"ken111","content":"The answer is D PowerShell \nVersion 1 has only 129 Cmdlets and schtasks is not one of them\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13769.powershell-1-0-cmdlets.aspx"},{"content":"None are correct.

The best answer is D. The very link you posted shows it being created as a scheduled task using the /sc and /ru parameters. In this answer, though, it's not actually created as a scheduled task. Rather, it's something to be ran immediately (hence /run). \n\nThe \"spirit\" of the question is to achieve persistence in the system; if you are to use the task scheduler to do this, you would want to set up a schedule to do something like a reverse shell. If you only run the powershell just once, it will no longer persist once the computer is restarted. That's why I believe the /run command eliminates answer A.
