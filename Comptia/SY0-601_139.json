Contain the impacted hosts.\n\nContaining the impacted hosts involves isolating or quarantining the affected systems from the rest of the network to prevent further spread of the malware and mitigate potential damage. Once contained, the incident response team can proceed with investigating the malware, analyzing its behavior, and determining the appropriate remediation steps. This initial containment step helps prevent the malware from spreading to other systems and compromising additional parts of the network while the investigation and response efforts are underway.","timestamp":"1714737300.0","comment_id":"1206088","upvote_count":"2","poster":"shady23"},{"timestamp":"1696947180.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1039586","poster":"BlackSpider","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
