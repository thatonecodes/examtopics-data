It is used for DNS queries and responses. DNS is a fundamental service on the internet that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses and vice versa.\nPort 389:\n\nPort 389 is associated with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is used for accessing and managing directory information, such as user and group data, typically in directory services like Microsoft Active Directory, OpenLDAP, or Novell eDirectory.\n\nPort 445 is used for the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. SMB is a network file sharing protocol commonly used for accessing and sharing files, printers, and other resources on a network. It's often associated with Windows file sharing.\n\nPort 1443 is not associated with any well-known service. It is not assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as a standard port for any specific protocol. The use of port 1443 can vary depending on local configurations and specific applications, but it's not associated with a widely recognized service.","comment_id":"1040026","upvote_count":"5","poster":"osmaster","timestamp":"1712798340.0"},{"poster":"badguytoo","timestamp":"1705910640.0","content":"SMB=445!","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"959246"}],"unix_timestamp":1643251680,"question_text":"Which of the following TCP ports is used by the Windows OS for file sharing?","answer_description":"","answer":"C","exam_id":357,"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/70652-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-73-discussion/","choices":{"C":"445","B":"389","D":"1433","A":"53"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_id":701,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"Y4ZywztKg9lZkLcnRmeX","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1225815","timestamp":"1733532720.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nshow interface is correct.","poster":"bdemps98","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","exam_id":357,"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"show arp","B":"show interface","A":"show route","D":"show port"},"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2024-06-07 00:52:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/142063-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-730-discussion/","question_text":"A network technician is troubleshooting a specific port on a switch.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)\n\nWhen reusing a switch at a remote site and wanting to ensure that no network settings persist, the administrator should delete the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache. ARP maintains a mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses in a table, and clearing the ARP cache helps prevent any potential conflicts or issues when connecting the switch to a new network.\n\nOptions A (VLAN), B (STP), and D (Trunking) are not databases but rather configuration settings that may need attention depending on the specific requirements of the new network. Deleting VLAN configurations, spanning tree protocol settings, or trunking configurations may be necessary, but they are not referred to as databases.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1709861760.0","poster":"Bunaventi","comment_id":"1168488"},{"comment_id":"1167891","timestamp":"1709806920.0","content":"ARP maintains a mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses on a local network. When a switch is moved to a new location, ARP entries associated with the old network settings may persist.
