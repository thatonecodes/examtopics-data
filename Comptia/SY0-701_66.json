CVSS\n\nExplanation:\nCVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is the most widely used method for prioritizing vulnerabilities. It provides a standardized score (ranging from 0 to 10) that indicates the severity of a vulnerability, helping organizations assess the risk it poses to their systems. The CVSS score takes into account factors such as exploitability, impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, making it an essential tool for vulnerability prioritization.","timestamp":"1735493100.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1734399900.0","poster":"ProudFather","comment_id":"1327721","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe exposure factor is the potential loss or damage that could occur if a vulnerability is exploited.
