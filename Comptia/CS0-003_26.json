By scheduling these scans and correlating their timing with a temporary suspension of alerts, the SOC can reduce the number of false positives or irrelevant alerts that analysts have to deal with.\n\nSOAR solutions can indeed help reduce the number of alerts by deduplicating and filtering out irrelevant notifications. However, without proper configuration, there is a risk of dropping alerts that might be relevant. This option is effective but not specifically tailored to internal security activities like option B.\n\nTherefore, scheduling tasks to disable alerting during known internal security activities (like vulnerability scans) is a targeted approach to reducing the number of alerts during those activities. It's important that this is done carefully to ensure that only the alerts generated by the scans are disabled and that other monitoring continues uninterrupted.","timestamp":"1712549160.0","comment_id":"1191344","poster":"section8santa","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"content":"Go with D","timestamp":"1713040860.0","poster":"section8santa","comments":[{"content":"you took the test?","timestamp":"1713372360.0","poster":"Kmelaun","comment_id":"1197346","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1195131"}]},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1188658","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's D do not listen to tcgod unless you want to get this wrong","poster":"j904","timestamp":"1712147580.0"},{"comment_id":"1188333","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
