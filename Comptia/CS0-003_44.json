Penetration testing\n\nSince the source code is not available, static testing and vulnerability scanning are not feasible options. Dynamic testing, while useful, might not be sufficient to uncover deep-rooted vulnerabilities.\n\nPenetration testing is the most suitable approach in this case. It involves simulating real-world attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the application. This approach doesn't require access to the source code and can reveal critical security flaws that other testing methods might miss."},{"timestamp":"1736910360.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSource code isn't available, dynamic testing definitely fits better due to it's broad nature. Assessing the application during runtime will allow you to check for issues with input validation, improper session handling and memory leaks or crashes. Penetration testing is usually done after broader testing such as dynamic testing.","comment_id":"1340642","poster":"Popeyes_Chicken","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nDynamic testing evaluates an application while it is running, simulating real-world usage to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or authentication flaws.

Dynamic testing\n\nAnalysis: Given that the application's source code is not available, dynamic testing is an appropriate method to evaluate the security of the software. Dynamic testing involves analyzing the application by executing it and observing its behavior during runtime, which allows for the identification of security vulnerabilities that may not be evident through code inspection alone.","timestamp":"1733517720.0","poster":"luiiizsoares","comment_id":"1322909","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"zecomeia_007","comment_id":"1317060","timestamp":"1732455600.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPenetration testing simulates real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities and assess the overall security posture of the application.","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"SheikS","timestamp":"1731863100.0","comment_id":"1313672","content":"D Penetration testing\nPenetration testing simulates real-world attacks on the application to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.

IDS\n\nAn Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is designed to monitor network traffic for malicious activity. In this case, an IDS can detect non-secure connections to the identity provider, potentially indicating malicious intent.

Implementing credentialed scanning: While credentialed scanning can provide more accurate vulnerability information, it won't address the underlying issue of inconsistent asset information.\n\nB.
