Information subject to legal hold might be defined by regulators or industry best practice, or there may be a litigation notice from law enforcement or lawyers pursuing a civil action. This means that computer systems may be taken as evidence, with all the obvious disruption to a network that entails. \n\nChain of Custody\nChain of custody documentation reinforces the integrity and proper handling of evidence from collection, to analysis, to storage, and finally to presentation. When security breaches go to trial, the chain of custody protects an organization against accusations that evidence has either been tampered with or is different than it was when it was collected. Every person in the chain who handles evidence must log the methods and tools they used.\n\n__\nSo, the answer is Legal hold","poster":"Eluis007","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"content":"What?
