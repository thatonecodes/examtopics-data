Incremental backups are smaller and faster to create compared to full or differential backups.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694797560.0","comment_id":"1008605","poster":"touisuzuki"},{"comment_id":"997194","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption D strikes a balance between backup speed and storage space by performing a full backup once a week and differential backups every night. This ensures that all data is captured at least once a week, while minimizing the amount of data that needs to be backed up each night. In the event of a failure, the company can restore from the most recent full backup and the most recent differential backup, which should provide a relatively fast restore time.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1693698180.0","poster":"sujon_london"},{"poster":"revolt54","content":"I think C as it wants the FASTEST (FULL Backups) while also being mindful of limited space.
