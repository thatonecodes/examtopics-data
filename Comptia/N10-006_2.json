In a corporate environment, business-related traffic may be given priority over other traffic.\nTraffic can be prioritized based on the ports used by the application sending the traffic. Delayed traffic is stored in a buffer until the higher priority traffic has been sent.","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/1423-exam-n10-006-topic-1-question-4-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following is used to define how much bandwidth can be used by various protocols on the network?","answer":"A","question_id":6,"unix_timestamp":1558357500,"answer_ET":"Explanation","timestamp":"2019-05-20 15:05:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"exam_id":355},{"id":"leQA2ryec6zMZ10xJitH","question_id":7,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1022934","content":"idk lol but ok","poster":"milkybits","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1696235880.0"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/122142-exam-n10-006-topic-1-question-5-discussion/","choices":{"D":"RADIUS","E":"802.1x","C":"Virtual PBX","B":"VTP trunking","A":"OSPF"},"question_text":"Which of the following is used to authenticate remote workers who connect from offsite?

RADIUS servers are commonly used by ISPs to authenticate their customers Internet connections.\nRemote users connect to one or more Remote Access Servers. The remote access servers then forward the authentication requests to the central RADIUS server.\nE: 802.1X is an IEEE Standard for Port-based Network Access Control (PNAC). It provides an authentication mechanism to devices wishing to attach to a network.\n802.1X authentication involves three parties: a supplicant, an authenticator, and an authentication server. The supplicant is a client that wishes to attach to the network. The authenticator is a network device, such as an Ethernet switch, wireless access point or in this case, a remote access server and the authentication server is the RADIUS server.","unix_timestamp":1696235880,"timestamp":"2023-10-02 10:38:00","answers_community":[]},{"id":"riLMjt185aSuSj22iZFO","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1560420420,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2019-06-13 12:07:00","choices":{"B":"Packet analyzer","D":"Network sniffer","C":"Protocol analyzer","A":"Network analyzer"},"question_text":"A company is experiencing accessibility issues reaching services on a cloud-based system.\nWhich of the following monitoring tools should be used to locate possible outages?","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"content":"All four answers can be ambiguous and in this day and age blurred in terms of the functionality that it provides.
