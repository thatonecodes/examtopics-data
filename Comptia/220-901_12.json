IMAP and POP3 are the two most commonly used Internet mail protocols for retrieving emails. Both protocols are supported by all modern email clients and web servers.\n\nWhile the POP3 protocol assumes that your email is being accessed only from one application, IMAP allows simultaneous access by multiple clients. This is why IMAP is more suitable for you if you’re going to access your email from different locations or if your messages are managed by multiple users.\n\nBy default, the IMAP protocol works on two ports:\n\n Port 143 – this is the default IMAP non-encrypted port;\n Port 993 – this is the port you need to use if you want to connect using IMAP securely."}],"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/48669-exam-220-901-topic-5-question-73-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":341,"topic":"5","question_id":60,"unix_timestamp":1617292800,"answer":"C","question_text":"A technician has been tasked with setting up email on a users phone.
