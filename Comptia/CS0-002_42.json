Senior management will assess the impact and potential fallout of the breach and determine the appropriate parties to notify, such as regulatory bodies and affected individuals.

The plan should include criteria for determining when an incident is reportable to regulators, customers, partners, or the public, as well as the appropriate channels for communicating the breach to these entities. The decision to disclose should be based on the severity of the breach, the sensitivity of the data that was compromised, and other relevant factors that may impact the organization's reputation or legal obligations.

The plan ensures that the incident is communicated in a consistent, controlled manner that protects the interests of the organization and its stakeholders, such as customers and employees.
