A container is a lightweight and portable software package that includes everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers can be used to package and deploy applications, as well as to manage the underlying OS.\n\nFor example, Googleâ€™s Container-Optimized OS is an operating system image that is optimized for running Docker containers. With Container-Optimized OS, you can bring up your Docker containers on Google Cloud Platform quickly, efficiently, and securely.","poster":"Robenger","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1130193","timestamp":"1706068680.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"959067","poster":"Sunshine_boy38","timestamp":"1689992400.0","content":"A.
