Install a directional WAP in the direction of the patio.\n\nInstalling a directional WAP is the best solution to provide a strong signal in the patio area without interfering with the building's Wi-Fi signal. Directional WAPs use a focused beam to provide a strong signal in a specific direction, which helps to reduce interference with neighboring Wi-Fi networks. This solution will also ensure that the signal is only available in the patio area, preventing signal bleed into the building.","timestamp":"1726990200.0","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"846878"},{"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1718643240.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption A (disabling the SSID broadcast on the WAP in the patio area) would not necessarily improve connectivity in the patio, and it could make it more difficult for users to connect to the wireless network.
