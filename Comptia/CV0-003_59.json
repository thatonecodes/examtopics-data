Opening TCP port 3389.\n\nExplanation:\n\nRDP uses TCP port 3389 by default for communication between the client and the server. If users are experiencing connection timeout errors, it typically indicates that the port through which RDP traffic should flow is not open or accessible. By opening TCP port 3389 on the firewall or network security group (NSG) rules in the cloud environment, you allow incoming RDP connections to reach the server hosting the application.","timestamp":"1720896960.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nRDP is port 3389","timestamp":"1675526520.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"798142","poster":"AustinKelleyNet"}],"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","topic":"1","isMC":true},{"id":"f3RkiNTtoO9Wpud1sgd6","question_id":292,"answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1740927060,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"BigM","comment_id":"1363998","timestamp":"1740927060.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nExplanation:\nThe poor 3D rendering performance in the VDI solution suggests that the virtual desktops lack sufficient graphical resources, particularly video RAM (vRAM).
