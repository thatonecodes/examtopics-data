Mesh\n\nExplanation:\nA mesh network is the best solution for providing reliable service to public safety vehicles. In a mesh network, each node (or vehicle) can communicate directly with others, and the network creates multiple paths for data to travel. This redundancy ensures that if one node or path fails, the data can still reach its destination via another route, enhancing reliability. Mesh networks are also scalable and can easily accommodate a large number of mobile devices, such as public safety vehicles.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736179380.0","comment_id":"1337235","poster":"HeatSquad77"},{"poster":"jmcd2","comment_id":"1335699","timestamp":"1735841880.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

A hot-cold\n\nExplanation:\nThe hot-cold aisle setup is specifically designed to address thermal dissipation in data centers. In this design, cold air is directed into the fronts of servers, while hot air is exhausted from the backs of the servers into a separate aisle. This arrangement helps maintain a clear distinction between hot and cold air, preventing hot air from mixing with cold air, which improves cooling efficiency and reduces the risk of thermal hotspots.","comment_id":"1337236"},{"comment_id":"1333170","timestamp":"1735420680.0","poster":"c7e3f8e","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct terminology likely refers to hot aisle/cold aisle containment, a data center design practice where racks are arranged so that hot air (exhaust) and cold air (intake) are separated to optimize cooling efficiency and maximize thermal dissipation."}],"answer":"B"},{"id":"dHoxweU0EroByhNqKdKx","timestamp":"2024-11-03 14:09:00","exam_id":358,"question_id":29,"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"The router interface is a broadcast address.","D":"The subnet is in a private address space.","C":"The IP address space is a class A network.","A":"The web server is in a different subnet."},"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1730639340,"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"A network administrator configured a router interface as 10.0.0.95 255.255.255.240.
