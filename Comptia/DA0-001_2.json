Extract, transform, load (ETL).\n\nETL processes involve extracting data from the source database, transforming it according to the requirements (which may include data manipulation), and then loading it into the destination database. This approach allows for flexibility in manipulating the data during the transfer process, such as converting data types, aggregating values, or applying business rules.\n\nWhile options like application programming interfaces (APIs) and export/import can also facilitate data transfer, they may not offer the same level of flexibility and data manipulation capabilities as ETL. Delta load is a technique used to synchronize changes between databases but may not necessarily involve data manipulation. Therefore, ETL is the most suitable option for transferring data between databases while performing data manipulation tasks.","comment_id":"1196801","timestamp":"1729109280.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Swift_and_Quick"}],"answer":"C","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":351},{"id":"kCQmqj5NoW0bEZUch6yJ","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138877-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-105-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-04-16 22:11:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Python","D":"SAS","C":"Microsoft Power BI","B":"R"},"exam_id":351,"question_text":"Which of the following best describes a business analytics tool with interactive visualization and business capabilities and an interface that is simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards?","answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer":"C","question_id":8,"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729109460.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1730774700.0","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","content":"I meant C.","comment_id":"1206730","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"B.

A waterfall chart is specifically designed to illustrate how positive and negative values contribute to a total over a series of sequential steps or categories.
