Asymmetric routing is the most likely explanation for the different hops between the client and server when performing a traceroute in both directions. Asymmetric routing occurs when the path taken by packets from the source host to the destination host is different from the path taken by packets from the destination host to the source host. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as different routing protocols being used by different devices on the network, or different link costs being assigned to different links in the network."},{"poster":"AlbinoBonobo","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis is an excellent explanation of the answer. https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/asymmetric-routing-issue/","timestamp":"1686518640.0","comment_id":"742202","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"701069","poster":"alwaysrollin247","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAsymmetric routing is when the flow of packets in one direction passes through a different interface than that used for the return path.
