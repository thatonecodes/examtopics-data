Length\nB. Complexity\n\nExplanation:\nLength (A) and Complexity (B) are fundamental components of a strong password policy. Increasing password length and requiring a mix of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols) significantly enhances security by making passwords harder to crack.\n\nLeast privilege (C) is an access control principle, not directly related to password policies.\n\nSomething you have (D), Security keys (E), and Biometrics (F) are related to multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is a separate security measure and not part of the password policy itself.\n\nThus, Length and Complexity are the most relevant elements to include in an improved authentication policy following a password audit.","comment_id":"1348035","timestamp":"1738082220.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Anyio"},{"comment_id":"1347064","timestamp":"1737915960.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Length:\n Description: A longer password is generally more secure, as it increases the number of possible combinations that an attacker would need to guess or brute-force.\n Policy Implementation: Requiring a minimum length for passwords (e.g., 12 or more characters) significantly improves security.\nB. Complexity:\n Description: Complexity ensures that passwords include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This makes passwords less predictable and harder to crack.\n Policy Implementation: Requiring complexity prevents users from choosing weak or easily guessable passwords like \"password123.\"","upvote_count":"1","poster":"dbrowndiver"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is A : length and B : complexity","comment_id":"1344902","poster":"ramzie","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737569880.0"},{"timestamp":"1737454020.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAB is the correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Justyna1685","comment_id":"1344093"},{"timestamp":"1737395400.0","poster":"TechNewb1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe other answer is..?","comment_id":"1343768","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155014-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-546-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Least privilege","A":"Length","F":"Biometrics","E":"Security keys","D":"Something you have","B":"Complexity"},"exam_id":368,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-01-20 18:50:00","answers_community":["A (67%)","B (33%)"],"question_id":496,"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A security analyst needs to improve the company’s authentication policy following a password audit.

Continuous risks are threats that persist over time and require ongoing security measures.\n\nPhishing attacks are a continuous risk because cybercriminals frequently attempt to deceive users via email.\nAn email gateway is a technical control that continuously scans, filters, and blocks malicious emails to reduce phishing attempts.\nSince phishing is an ongoing (continuous) threat, deploying an email gateway is a proactive treatment strategy to mitigate it.\nGPT","poster":"Kamalt","timestamp":"1742162340.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"1366022","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBranch protection in a CI/CD pipeline helps prevent:\nUnauthorized code changes\nIntroduction of insecure or vulnerable code\nSupply chain attacks","poster":"nocwyn","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741294800.0"},{"timestamp":"1739238240.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Branch protection as part of the CI/CD pipeline\n\nExplanation:\nA continuous risk refers to an ongoing or persistent risk that must be actively managed over time. Branch protection in a CI/CD pipeline helps mitigate continuous risks related to software development, such as unauthorized code changes, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. By enforcing rules like required code reviews and automated security checks, organizations continuously manage risks in their development workflow.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"test_arrow","comment_id":"1354770"}],"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Background checks for new employees","A":"Email gateway to block phishing attempts","C":"Dual control requirements for wire transfers","D":"Branch protection as part of the CI/CD pipeline"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156322-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-547-discussion/","exam_id":368,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-02-11 02:44:00","answers_community":["A (57%)","D (43%)"],"question_id":497,"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following is an example of a treatment strategy for a continuous risk?"},{"id":"Zwqgjub3xDcumoIPDRP2","choices":{"D":"Monolithic code","C":"Kernel version","A":"Regulatory compliance","B":"Patch availability"},"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-02-11 02:45:00","question_id":498,"answer":"D","answer_images":[],"exam_id":368,"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1739238300,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156323-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-548-discussion/","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"test_arrow","comment_id":"1354771","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1739238300.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
