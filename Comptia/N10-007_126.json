We recommend setting a TTL value of 3600, which tells servers across the Internet to check every hour for updates to the record. The shorter TTL will only take effect after the prior period expires. This means that next time you update the record, your change will take up to one hour to go into effect. To make subsequent changes happen even more quickly—for example, if you think you might want to quickly revert a change—you can set a shorter TTL, such as 300 seconds (5 minutes). Once the records are configured correctly, we recommend setting a TTL value of 86400, which tells servers across the Internet to check every 24 hours for updates to the record."},{"poster":"Pshappyyou","comment_id":"419581","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1628064900.0","content":"Not B?"}],"unix_timestamp":1628064900,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2021-08-04 10:15:00","question_id":629,"question_images":[]},{"id":"Hro2goIMjqkuxqeJ3lJM","topic":"1","exam_id":356,"timestamp":"2021-07-07 19:21:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1625678460,"answer_ET":"C","question_id":630,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/57405-exam-n10-007-topic-1-question-824-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"1000BASE-SX","B":"100BASE-T","C":"1000BASE-LX","A":"10BASE-T"},"question_text":"A network administrator needs to extend an organization's network to a nearby building that has unused SMF already installed.
