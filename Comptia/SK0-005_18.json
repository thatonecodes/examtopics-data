Reconfigure the RAID.\n\nWhen a motherboard is replaced, especially if it's similar in specifications, the RAID configuration may be affected. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) configurations are often tied to the specific hardware on which they were configured. Reconfiguring the RAID ensures that the array is recognized and functions correctly with the new motherboard, minimizing downtime and allowing the system to operate with the original set of components.","timestamp":"1717411380.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1086810"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"cEhR2aHy5PZTOeg9plsT","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726109940.0","poster":"surfuganda","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
