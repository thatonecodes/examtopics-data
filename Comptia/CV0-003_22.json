This means that, on a daily basis, you are only backing up the data that is new or has been modified since the last backup. This approach is efficient in terms of storage space because it doesn't duplicate unchanged data.\n\nDifferential backups would back up all the data that has changed since the last full backup. While they are more efficient in terms of storage space than full backups, they are less space-efficient than incrementals for daily backups because they include all changes since the last full backup, not just the changes since the last backup of any type.","timestamp":"1710227400.0","poster":"Pongsathorn","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1005405"},{"poster":"ROCompTIA","timestamp":"1702900200.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIncremental backups only back up the data that has changed since the last backup, which in this case is the previous day's backup. It saves space by not duplicating unchanged data and only capturing the changes made to the VMs since the last backup. This approach ensures efficient use of storage resources.\n\nEach day, the incremental backup will only capture and store the data that has been modified or added since the last backup.

Having multiple copies reduces the risk of losing everything if one fails.\n2. 2 Different Storage Media**: Store the backups on at least two different types of storage media. This could include combinations like hard drives, solid-state drives, cloud storage, USB drives, or tape backups. Using different media types protects against media-specific failures.\n3. 1 Offsite Location**: Keep at least one backup offsite.

Since the DR site has been operational for a week, setting up replication would allow the primary datacenter's block storage to quickly catch up with the changes made at the DR site. This approach ensures that the primary datacenter becomes up-to-date with minimal data loss and downtime.\n\nOption B (Copy the data across both sites) would likely be inefficient and time-consuming, especially if the amount of data is large, as it involves manually copying data across both sites, which may not capture changes made during the past week.\n\nOption C (Restore incremental backups) and option D (Restore full backups) are not as efficient in this scenario because they involve restoring data from backups, which may not capture all changes made at the DR site since the failure occurred.
