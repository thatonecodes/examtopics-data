D can be a good answer but I actually think this is A. If its that segmented and they want to minimize firewall rules, deploying a scanner sensor on every segment doesn't seem practical. It specifically says they're assessing systems, and if the option to deploy the agent directly to the systems is there, then it is less resource heavy and less maintenance to do an agent-based discovery.","timestamp":"1700751300.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt's not D. Key to eliminate it is credentialed scans, you often need to make exceptions in firewall rules for credentialed scans.

The agents can perform the scans locally and then report the results back to a central management server. This approach significantly reduces the need for extensive firewall rule configurations because the scanning traffic doesn't have to traverse the network segments. The communication between the agents and the central server can be streamlined, requiring minimal firewall rule changes.","poster":"section8santa","comment_id":"1192038","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1712643600.0"},{"poster":"CyberJackal","comment_id":"1185652","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis one is D in my opinion.\nAs I read the question, the organization has already selected the software they are intending to use, and it will be a traditional network-based scanner. Often times in segmented environments, explicit firewall rules will need to be implemented to ensure the scanner isn't blocked by IPS as it conducts it's scan across hosts in other VLANs- or scanner sensors are deployed in said target VLANs.\nThat's what they're getting at- is to have you come to that conclusion here, though like many questions from CompTIA it should be worded better or remove the agent option from potential answers.","timestamp":"1711742700.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"MMK777","content":"Selected Answer: D\nwe had the same scenario in the company where I work and we deployed a scanner sensor on every segment of the network.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1169202","timestamp":"1709948940.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nI believe there is a slight difference in creating FW rules for:\nA. agent plug-in installed on existing IP, versus\nD. new sensors deployed on each segment.\nThe first one you'll only need to allow the Manager node and port from the corporate supernet, versus allowing scanner to each sensor on each vlan.
