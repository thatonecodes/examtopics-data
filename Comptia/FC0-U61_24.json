Pop-up blocker exceptions\nExplanation:\nMost modern web browsers include pop-up blockers that prevent new windows from opening automatically. If a web-based application requires multiple windows to open upon login, the technician should configure pop-up blocker exceptions to allow the necessary pop-ups.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n\nA. Unrestricted PowerShell execution policy – This controls the execution of PowerShell scripts, not browser behavior.\nC. Applications to run in private mode – Private (incognito) mode prevents tracking and history storage but does not affect pop-up settings.\nD. Security extensions setting to disable – Disabling security extensions could reduce protection but would not directly solve the issue of blocked pop-ups.\nSince pop-up blockers prevent necessary windows from opening, configuring pop-up blocker exceptions is the best solution.","poster":"fcc_class","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1360823","timestamp":"1740362880.0"},{"poster":"_denw","timestamp":"1723472340.0","comment_id":"1148341","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Pop-up blocker exceptions\n\nTo ensure the browsers open new windows properly as part of a web-based application, especially when multiple windows are required to open upon user login, the technician should configure pop-up blocker exceptions for the specific site(s) needed. This action allows the web application to open new windows without being blocked by the browser's built-in pop-up blocking feature, ensuring the application functions as intended.","upvote_count":"2"}],"exam_id":352,"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1707754740,"answer":"B","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_description":""},{"id":"g73rHdoEzYAqZ5JXXzKT","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157055-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-246-discussion/","exam_id":352,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1740363000,"timestamp":"2025-02-24 03:10:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Visual diagramming","C":"Presentation","B":"Word processing","D":"Conferencing"},"question_id":117,"question_text":"Which of the following software types is MOST likely to use stencil files?","answer":"A","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1360824","poster":"fcc_class","timestamp":"1740363000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Visual diagramming\nExplanation:\nStencil files are commonly used in visual diagramming software (such as Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or SmartDraw). These files contain predefined shapes, symbols, and icons that help users create flowcharts, network diagrams, organizational charts, and other structured visual representations.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n\nB. Word processing – Used for text documents, not visual elements requiring stencils.\nC. Presentation – While presentations may contain graphics, they do not rely on stencil files.\nD.
