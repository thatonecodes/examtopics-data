Enforcing DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)\nThe scenario described suggests that an attacker might be intercepting or manipulating DNS requests to redirect web traffic to a competitor's site. This type of attack is known as DNS spoofing or DNS cache poisoning, where the attacker manipulates DNS responses to redirect legitimate users to malicious or unintended websites. DNSSEC is a security extension for DNS that protects against these types of attacks by ensuring that DNS responses are authentic and have not been tampered with. DNSSEC uses cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of DNS records. When DNSSEC is enabled, it prevents attackers from modifying DNS records, which would stop them from redirecting traffic to a malicious or competitor's site."},{"content":"For the CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+) exam, the most suitable answer to prevent the described attack would be **A.
