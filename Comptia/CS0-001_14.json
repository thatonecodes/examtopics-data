Look at this line from Cybersecurity Analyst Certification Bundle:\n\n\"A very straightforward and perhaps tempting approach would be to look at the lengthiest legal or regulatory retention requirement on your organization and then apply that timeframe to all your data retention. The problem with this is that it will probably make your retained data set orders of magnitude greater than it needs to be. Not only does this impose additional storage costs, but it also makes it more difficult to comply with electronic discovery (e-discovery) orders. A better approach is to find the specific data sets that have mandated retention requirements and handle those accordingly. Everything else has a retention period that minimally satisfies the business requirements.\""},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Technical constraints are factored in creating a data retention policy, however the main factor is most definitely governing regulations.. if technical constraints only let you keep data for 6 months but regulations say you are required to keep for a year, you literally have no choice but to increase your orgs resources. https://thinksis.com/insights/what-to-consider-when-developing-a-data-retention-policy/","comment_id":"110081","poster":"TheThreatGuy","timestamp":"1592136540.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"shoop","content":"Agreed","timestamp":"1591413000.0","comment_id":"103541"},{"comment_id":"99841","timestamp":"1591001640.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Isn't this supposed to be letter C?
