In the real world, FN function can be a pain and on old systems can trigger issues. While it's a cheap easy fix, it doesn't catch all the problems. It also doesn't neccesitate that a reboot will keep the same FN settings. For instance a laptop may switch us FN only to have powerpoint be configured poorly and when doing the slideshow you get terrible resolution issues, poor pairing, or more. I'd agree with display settings just being the more wise solution and testing afterwards with whatever needs to be used. Since this is a permanent setup too, restarting once to make sure the setting sticks will save an extra trip back to fix things :)","timestamp":"1575527700.0","upvote_count":"11","comment_id":"26795","poster":"MrCompTIA"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1667202300.0","poster":"cpaljchc","comment_id":"708263","content":"You cannot adjust the resolutions, select extend/mirror, change the position of screens with fn key I believe.\nFn key can only adjust brightness sort of things, isn't it?"}],"content":"So in the CompTIA books, it always states the FN key for laptop displays.
