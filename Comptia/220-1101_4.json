Virtual machines (VMs) are often used to create sandboxes since they allow users to isolate the test environment from the host system. By using a VM as a sandbox, users can install and test new software without worrying about damaging their host system or losing important data.\n\nWhile virtualization technology can also increase the efficient use of computing resources, allow for running multiple machines on the same hardware, and provide dedicated hardware for a single system, these are not the BEST reasons to use a virtual machine as a sandbox. The primary advantage of a virtual machine as a sandbox is to provide a secure and isolated environment for testing new software."}],"answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-04-08 13:33:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/105583-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-115-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"To have dedicated hardware for a single system","B":"To increase the efficient use of computing resources","A":"To test new software in a safe environment","C":"To run multiple machines on the same hardware"},"exam_id":339,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":""},{"id":"1Uyca7VA9g9eHrlsS2E7","topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following would MOST likely be used to connect one or more devices to the internet in a SOHO?","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-12-01 12:17:00","choices":{"C":"Wireless access point","A":"Hub","D":"Router","B":"Ethernet gateway"},"answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"comments":[{"poster":"ronniehaang","comment_id":"808714","timestamp":"1707937080.0","content":"In conclusion, the use of a router in a SOHO environment is the best option to provide internet connectivity to multiple devices, as well as to provide advanced network control and security features.","upvote_count":"2"}],"comment_id":"808713","poster":"ronniehaang","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Router is the most likely device that would be used to connect one or more devices to the internet in a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO).\n\nA router is a networking device that directs data packets between networks. In a SOHO environment, a router is typically used to provide Internet connectivity to multiple devices by connecting to a broadband modem. The router acts as a bridge between the local network and the internet, allowing devices on the network to access the internet and allowing incoming traffic from the internet to reach the appropriate device on the local network.\n\nRouters generally have multiple Ethernet ports for connecting devices, such as computers, printers, and other networking devices. They also have wireless capabilities for connecting wireless devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Additionally, routers typically have advanced features, such as firewalls, Quality of Service (QoS) settings, and network security settings, which allow the network administrator to control and secure the network.","timestamp":"1707937080.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"wepaid","timestamp":"1705329180.0","comment_id":"776669","content":"Question says Most Likely.
