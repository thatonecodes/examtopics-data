However, this approach does not utilize full advantages and benefits of cloud computing. The administrators have to manage and maintain all necessary infrastructure that can be offload by PaaS solution.\n\nExample: Azure SQL Database is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring without user involvement.

IaaS and PaaS can and do offer options to run databases, but these methods require more training and personnel to manage it.
