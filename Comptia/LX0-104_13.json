It can be used as a tool for querying DNS servers.\n\nThe dig command is a tool for querying DNS (Domain Name System) servers. It can be used to obtain detailed information about a domain's DNS records, including the IP addresses associated with the domain, the mail servers handling email for the domain, and more. By using dig, you can troubleshoot DNS issues, verify the correct configuration of a domain's DNS records, and get a better understanding of how the domain name system works."}],"question_id":61,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98741-exam-lx0-104-topic-5-question-7-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"It can be used as a tool for querying DNS servers.","B":"It can be used for searching through indexed file content.","C":"It can be used to look for open ports on a system.","D":"It can be used to ping all known hosts on the current subnet."},"question_text":"What is the purpose of the dig command?","unix_timestamp":1676045760,"answer_description":"","topic":"5","answer":"A"},{"id":"Pn0t5bJrD0eJGxevgZ7m","answers_community":[],"topic":"5","answer":"/etc/hosts","isMC":false,"question_images":[],"question_text":"SIMULATION -\nGiven the following line from /etc/nsswitch.conf:\nhosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\nBy default, which file will be queried first for hostname lookups?
