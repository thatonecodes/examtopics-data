A bank that has security concerns regarding employee activity:\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) can be beneficial in scenarios where security is a top priority. In a banking environment with security concerns, VDI allows for centralized control over desktop environments, making it easier to monitor and manage user activities. It helps in ensuring data security and compliance by keeping sensitive information within a controlled virtual environment.\n\nC. A manufacturing plant that has high turnover:\nIn an environment with high turnover, providing and managing traditional desktops for every employee can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. VDI allows for a more flexible and scalable approach, enabling employees to access their virtual desktops from various devices.
