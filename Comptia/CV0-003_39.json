This sudden increase in transaction volume can overload the integration service and impact the performance for other integrated companies. The correct answer is:\n\nB. Incorrect configuration in the message queue length\n\nThe message queue length or capacity may not have been configured to handle such a high volume of incoming and outgoing transactions. This can result in queuing delays, slowing down the integration service for all companies.\n\nWhile the other options (A, C, and D) could potentially cause issues, they are less likely to be the root cause of slowness in the integration service, especially when a specific event like a significant increase in transaction volume has occurred."},{"poster":"BigM","timestamp":"1740837540.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1363545","content":"Selected Answer: B\nExplanation:\nThe integration service handles web service transactions, and processing more than 100,000 transactions per second introduces a huge workload.\nMessage queues manage these transactions by temporarily storing requests until they are processed.\nIf the queue length is not properly configured, it can become overwhelmed, causing delays and performance issues for all integrated companies.\nAdjusting the message queue length ensures the system can handle the increased traffic without impacting other users."},{"comment_id":"1187500","poster":"Therealjosh","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBe is the correct answer","timestamp":"1727794680.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"FasterN8","timestamp":"1724810160.0","comment_id":"1161240","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

API request limit: SaaS-based email services often have limits on the number of API requests that can be made within a certain time frame.

API request limit.\n\nWhen using a SaaS-based service to send emails in an automated manner, such services often have API rate limits in place to prevent abuse or overuse of their infrastructure. These rate limits restrict the number of API requests (in this case, sending emails) that can be made within a certain timeframe. If the CRM system attempted to send 50,000 emails in a short period and hit the API request limit, it would result in only a portion of the emails being sent, which aligns with the described issue.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are less likely to be the cause of the problem. An incorrect billing account typically doesn't affect the number of emails that can be sent. Misconfigured auto-scaling and bandwidth limitations are more related to infrastructure scaling and network performance, which might not be the primary issue when dealing with email API requests.","poster":"Pongsathorn","comment_id":"1009493","timestamp":"1694914920.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"betty_boop","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Many SaaS-based services have API request limits which determine the number of requests that can be made to their systems within a certain period of time. If the marketing team exceeded this limit, the service may have stopped processing the remaining requests, resulting in only a portion of the emails being sent.
