Switch ports are the ports on a network switch that are used to connect devices to the network. By disabling unneeded switchports, you can prevent unauthorized devices from being connected to the network. This is more effective than enabling MAC filtering, which only blocks devices with unknown hardware addresses and may not fully protect the network.

Disabling unneeded switchports will disable unused switchports ENTIRELY, making unauthorized switchport connections impossible in the first place.\n\nA is incorrect because it has nothing to do with the question in hand. You are not going to share corporate data with guests in a waiting area, and furthermore, NDAs do not harden the network.\n\nC is incorrect because it is not the best option. Sure, you can limit the range of the WAP antenna's signal to stop outsiders from connecting to the wireless network, but that would cause attenuation issues for guests unless you know what you are doing.\n\nD is incorrect because that is security through obscurity.
