For example, before allowing someone to log in, a security system first receives their username and password and then checks it against a database before allowing access. Attackers can exploit this fact by interfering with processes to access secure areas and content in what's known as a race condition attack.\"\n\nhttps://www.veracode.com/security/race-condition","poster":"vorozco","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\n\"Race condition attacks (also called Time of Check to Time of Use, or TOCTTOU attacks) take advantage of the need that computing systems must execute some tasks in a specific sequence. In any such sequence, there is a small period of time when the system has carried out the first task but not started on the second. If this period is long enough or the attacker is lucky and knowledgeable, a race condition vulnerability exists where an attacker can trick the system into carrying out unauthorized actions in addition to its normal processes.\"","poster":"bribri2021","timestamp":"1638404820.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"492036"}],"answer":"B","question_id":256,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1638404820,"topic":"1"},{"id":"uz040VpU3oKKvz6ehiuI","unix_timestamp":1628203620,"discussion":[{"content":"java applets is the right answer because they limit the access to the host","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"420499","timestamp":"1628203620.0","poster":"SoniSoni"}],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_id":257,"timestamp":"2021-08-06 00:47:00","answers_community":[],"exam_id":342,"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","choices":{"B":"The developer established a corporate account with a non-reputable certification authority","C":"The developer used fuzzy logic to determine how the web browser would respond once ports 80 and 443 were both open","A":"The developer inadvertently used Java applets","D":"The developer did not consider that mobile code would be transmitted across the network"},"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_text":"A small firm's newly created website has several design flaws.
