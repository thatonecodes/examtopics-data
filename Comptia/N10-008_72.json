Port mirroring, also known as SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer), is used to copy traffic from one or more ports on a network switch to another port, where the traffic can be analyzed. This feature is commonly used for network monitoring, troubleshooting, and security purposes."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nNetFlow only analyzes packet metadata. C might be the better answer.

SRV.\n\nSRV (Service) record is used to define the location (hostname and port number) of servers for specified services. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a signaling protocol used for controlling communication sessions such as voice and video calls over IP networks. Therefore, SRV record type is used to define where SIP is found by specifying the hostname and port number of the server that provides the SIP service.","poster":"swiggharo","timestamp":"1712178540.0","upvote_count":"12","comment_id":"860350"},{"poster":"Mehsotopes","comment_id":"1087178","timestamp":"1733268360.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSRV specifies a host & port for a specific service such as chat rooms.","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nSRV (Service) records are used in DNS (Domain Name System) to define the location of specific services or protocols.","timestamp":"1715859600.0","poster":"rah555","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"899127"}],"unix_timestamp":1680556140,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer":"A","exam_id":357,"question_text":"Which of the following record types would be used to define where SIP is found?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/105015-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-422-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"CNAME","A":"SRV","C":"A","D":"MX"},"answer_description":"","question_id":360,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A"}],"exam":{"name":"N10-008","id":357,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":877,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false},"currentPage":72},"__N_SSP":true}
