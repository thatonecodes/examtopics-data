ICMP\n\nThe fact that the administrator is not seeing any attempts by the users to access the application in the application logs suggests that the issue may be related to network connectivity. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a network protocol used to test for connectivity between two devices on a network. If ICMP traffic is being blocked by a firewall or other network device, it could prevent the human resources department users from accessing the application server.\n\nNAT (Network Address Translation) (A) is a technique used to remap IP addresses in a network packet, and would not be directly related to the issue of users not being able to access the application server. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) (C) is a logical group of network devices that share a common broadcast domain, and would also not be directly related to the issue.

Round robin\n\nExplanation:\nLoad balancing is the process of distributing network traffic or workloads across multiple servers to optimize resource use, improve performance, and ensure high availability.\n\nRound robin (A) is a load balancing technique where requests are distributed sequentially across a group of servers. It helps balance the workload among multiple servers.\nActive-active (B) refers to a high availability configuration where multiple servers actively handle traffic, which can include load balancing but is not a specific technique itself.\nActive-passive (C) refers to a setup where one server is active while another remains on standby, which is more related to redundancy than load balancing.\nFailover (D) is a redundancy mechanism where a backup system takes over when the primary system fails, not a load balancing method.\nThus, Round robin is the best example of load balancing.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"proservices","comment_id":"1362277","timestamp":"1740601560.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\n(A) Round Robin is the only Load Balancing example, the rest are all Server Cluster terms.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Stache","comment_id":"1332435","timestamp":"1735308120.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"fluke92","content":"Selected Answer: A\nLoad balancing is the process of distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
