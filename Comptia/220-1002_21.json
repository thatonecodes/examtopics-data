Overwriting or formatting the drive may still leave the drive in a recoverable state.\nEven drilling or hammering a drive would be less than correct. Every component of the drive must be thoroughly destroyed, which is why incineration is the right answer. A high enough temperature will disrupt circuit paths and melt the chips within. An industrial mechanical shredder would also be a feasible destruction method.
