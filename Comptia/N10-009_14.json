Based on the options provided, the best answer is:\n\nD. The switch should be configured for RSTP.\nExplanation:\n\n RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol): Unlike traditional STP, RSTP converges faster, reducing downtime when topology changes occur. Without RSTP, redundant links may cause a temporary loop until STP reconverges.\n The equal port cost isn't inherently an issue unless the root bridge is not correctly identified, but this doesn't seem the immediate issue here.\n Link aggregation (Option B) might help with bandwidth but is unrelated to the current STP problem.\n Identifying a root bridge (Option C) is essential, but modern switches should automatically determine this unless configured otherwise.\n\nSwitches may be encountering loops due to delays in spanning tree reconvergence. Configuring RSTP would address this problem by allowing quicker recovery and preventing connectivity loss.","comment_id":"1323542","timestamp":"1733663100.0"},{"poster":"fd1eda1","comment_id":"1314447","timestamp":"1731995640.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"B Link aggregation is the best solution here to ensure both links are utilized effectively and STP does not block one of them, providing redundancy without causing connectivity issues."},{"comment_id":"1308528","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer C","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1731009180.0","poster":"a484b2b"},{"comment_id":"1308167","poster":"a484b2b","timestamp":"1730927760.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Answer C \nSince both switches have a cost of 2 on each port, they might be competing to determine which path is the preferred route to the root.
