Adopt a compiled programming language instead.\n\nHere's why:\n\nCompiled programming languages like C++ or Java convert the code into a machine-readable format before execution. This makes it more difficult for attackers to extract sensitive information like the interpreter's version, binary file paths, and user ID.\nMessage handling routines and user-generated input validation are important security measures, but they don't directly address the specific issue of preventing the dump of debugging information.\nSAST vulnerability scans can help identify potential vulnerabilities in the code, but they might not detect this particular issue if it's not explicitly checked for.\nBy adopting a compiled programming language, the application's code will be less exposed, making it harder for attackers to extract sensitive information.

Validate User-Generated Input\nBy rigorously validating and sanitizing all user inputs, the application can prevent malicious data from causing unexpected behavior or triggering errors that might expose sensitive information. Proper input validation helps protect against various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, overflow attacks, remote code execution, fuzzers, etc) that can exploit vulnerabilities in the application to manipulate its behavior. By catching invalid inputs early, the application can handle errors gracefully without exposing internal details, maintaining both security and user experience.\nWhy not A: This option is more about mitigating the impact after an issue occurs rather than preventing the issue from happening in the first place.","timestamp":"1727557620.0","comment_id":"1290782"},{"comment_id":"1242768","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTo mitigate the risk of the application leaking sensitive debugging information, the best course of action is to include routines in the application for message handling.
