The hacker may have changed firewall rules to allow the server to call home, or they have have been unsecure to begin with. The problem is not the users computers having adware, the server is what is running slow, causing a denial of availability for the users. Server has malware. and server is calling home, a clear B & C for me.

Confirm the network has a helper address for the DHCP server.\n\nA helper address (also known as IP Helper) is required when DHCP requests need to be forwarded across different network segments or VLANs.
