The IP address on the printer\nE. The subnet on the workstation\n\nThe printer’s IP address and subnet place it in a different network segment than the workstation. The workstation and router are on the 10.0.0.0/26 network, while the printer is on the 10.1.0.0/25 network. Changing the printer’s IP address to match the workstation’s subnet or modifying the workstation’s subnet to match the printer’s network can resolve the issue. The other options involve changing router settings or subnets that do not align with the existing network configuration and would not directly address the connectivity problem.","poster":"a87d6a4","comment_id":"1281087"},{"poster":"Dadadagreat","comment_id":"1275784","timestamp":"1725157560.0","content":"B and E","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1725157500.0","poster":"Dadadagreat","comment_id":"1275783","content":"B and C are the answers","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1725119940.0","poster":"jcre","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis question has 2 answers ...

Back up and erase the configuration.\n\nBefore recycling a network router, it’s essential to back up any important configuration data and then erase the configuration to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed. Turning on port security or shredding the hard drive (if applicable) are good practices for maintaining security, but the latter is less relevant if the device does not have a hard drive.
