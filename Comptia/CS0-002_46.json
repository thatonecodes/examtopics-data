Masking involves replacing sensitive information with fake data while still maintaining the appearance of the original information. This fake data can be anything from random characters to a fixed set of characters that do not represent the original information.

With this, an exact low-level copy of all the contents of the hard disk is obtained in addition to certifying the correspondence of its content with the original by matching the hash signatures. A hash signature is nothing more than an alphanumeric character string obtained from cloned information. When the hash signature of the source device and the destination device are generated, both have to match to certify the chain of custody. If a single bit changes in the cloning process, it will mean that the hash signature of the source and destination devices do not match, the chain of custody has not been maintained and the test has been altered.\n\nBased on the question, the cloning task it's done (hashes has been generated as well), so next step is to create the chain of custody document."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCreate a hash of each file on the original hard drive. If we have the hash of an overall drive and a file gets changed, we know the overall hash will be altered.

You notice the HDD hash is different, check out partition hashes, yup this one changed, wonder what folder, oh this one cool, now what file.
