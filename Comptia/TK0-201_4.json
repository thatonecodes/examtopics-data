Option C is the correct choice in this scenario.\n\nEnd-of-course objectives provide a framework for measuring whether learners have achieved the intended learning outcomes of the course. By evaluating the learners' attainment of end-of-course objectives, the instructor can determine whether the course was successful in meeting its goals, despite not covering the last concept.\n\nMonitoring learner performance during instruction in option A and administering tests in option B are important instructional practices, but they do not address the issue of evaluating whether the course was successful in meeting its goals. Judging the adequacy of the evaluation in option D is not applicable, as the evaluation results indicate that the learners achieved the intended learning outcomes, regardless of whether the last concept was covered or not.","poster":"JimGrayham","upvote_count":"2"}],"topic":"1","answers_community":[]},{"id":"4EpKbrPQxLzFalDAoH0p","discussion":[{"content":"B.
