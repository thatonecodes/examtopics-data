Reverse Proxy\nMy first question to this question was why would they want to do that? So I investigated and these are some of the examples I found for why:\n\nA reverse proxy can be used to protect a website because the websites IP addresses are hidden behind the reverse proxy and are not revealed to clients. This makes it much harder to target a DDoS attack against a website.\n\nA reverse proxy is also used for load balancing. A popular website handling millions of users every day is unlikely to be able to handle the traffic with a single server. A reverse proxy can balance a large amount of incoming requests by distributing the traffic to a large pool of web servers, and effectively preventing any single one of them from becoming overloaded. Services like cloudflare put reverse proxy servers in hundred of locations all around the world. This puts the reverse proxy close to the users and at the same time provides a large amount of processing capacity","timestamp":"1707408960.0","poster":"7308365"},{"timestamp":"1707856260.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
