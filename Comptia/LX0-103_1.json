The bootloader is typically stored on the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the hard drive, or on a separate boot partition, and is responsible for loading the operating system kernel into memory, passing any necessary parameters to the kernel, and starting the operating system.","comment_id":"805793","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin"},{"comment_id":"446886","timestamp":"1631934720.0","poster":"ant_man","upvote_count":"1","content":"BIOS\nBOOTLOADER\nKERNEL\nINIT"}],"exam_id":353,"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/62305-exam-lx0-103-topic-1-question-10-discussion/","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2021-09-18 05:12:00","choices":{"A":"The bootloader","B":"The inetd program","C":"The init program","D":"The kernel"},"answer":"A"},{"id":"b8GBSgONVe44gufgenZo","question_text":"Which run levels should never be declared as the default run level when using SysV init?
