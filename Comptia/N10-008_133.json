WLAN controller\n\nA WLAN (Wireless LAN) controller is designed to manage multiple access points centrally. It allows an administrator to change configurations, deploy updates, and monitor the status of all the connected access points from a single interface, making it the best option for managing a network with multiple access points remotely. This device streamlines the process of adjusting settings across the entire wireless network."}],"unix_timestamp":1710556800,"exam_id":357,"topic":"1"},{"id":"9B174snmQ6Qrwk2esqcR","choices":{"B":"RPO","D":"MTTR","A":"RTO","C":"MTBF"},"discussion":[{"poster":"subaie503","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1174688","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. MTBF\n\nMTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) is used to estimate the average life span or reliability of a device. It is a measure of how reliable a hardware product or component is, and it predicts the time between inherent failures of a system during operation. MTBF is typically used in the context of hardware components, systems, or devices to represent average time periods when the device is expected to operate without failure under specified conditions.","timestamp":"1726447260.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-03-16 03:41:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/136202-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-695-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1710556860,"question_id":662,"exam_id":357,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following is used to estimate the average life span of a device?"},{"id":"8q3B5upWauuI8n0iKJ9o","topic":"1","question_text":"An IT administrator is creating an alias to the primary customer's domain.

It encrypts data in transit.\n\nThe application layer is responsible for providing network services directly to end-users or applications. One of the characteristics of the application layer is the ability to encrypt data in transit to ensure secure communication. Encryption is a process of encoding data to make it secure and confidential during transmission over the network. This is commonly seen in secure communication protocols used by applications such as HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for secure web browsing.","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":664,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2024-03-07 13:11:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"It relies upon other layers for packet delivery.","D":"It performs address translation.","B":"It checks independently for packet loss.","C":"It encrypts data in transit."},"answers_community":["A (70%)","C (30%)"],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","exam_id":357,"question_text":"Which of the following is a characteristic of the application layer?","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1709813460,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135415-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-697-discussion/"},{"id":"CMJFmbMJOHBpolKNNNkg","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-03-03 22:52:00","answer_description":"","exam_id":357,"choices":{"D":"Layer 2","B":"Site-to-site","A":"Split-tunnel","C":"Client"},"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1709757960.0","upvote_count":"6","poster":"Toukaleh","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSplit-tunnel VPN allows you to selectively route traffic through the VPN tunnel.
