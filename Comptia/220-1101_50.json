However, in the context of the scenario provided, there's an audible noise when the laptop is repositioned. This suggests a physical issue inside the laptop, like a loose part or component, rather than just a cable that might be disconnected or damaged.\n\nChoosing to inspect for loose parts first (especially after hearing a noise) can help identify if something is rattling or moving inside, which can cause shorts or physical damage to other components. After ensuring there are no loose parts, then inspecting connections and cables would be a logical subsequent step.\n\nIn the A+ exam (and in real-life scenarios), the order of operations is essential.

Turn on the laptop and move it again to replicate the issue.\nOne of the basic troubleshooting techniques is to reproduce the problem and observe the symptoms. This can help to identify the cause and the solution of the issue. By turning on the laptop and moving it again, the technician can verify if the noise is related to the laptop’s movement, and if it affects the laptop’s performance or stability. The noise could indicate a loose or damaged component, such as a fan, a hard drive, or a cable, that needs to be fixed or replaced","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1360881","timestamp":"1740378000.0","content":"The other options are not the best next steps, because they do not confirm the source of the problem, and they may cause more damage or complications. Reseating the memory modules and the SSD (option B) may be helpful if the laptop has booting or performance issues, but it is unlikely to solve the noise problem.\nRemoving the internal battery and looking for loose parts (option C) may be risky if the technician does not follow proper safety precautions, such as disconnecting the power cord and wearing an anti-static wrist strap. Inspecting the connections for a damaged cable (option D) may be part of the troubleshooting process, but it should be done after replicating the issue and narrowing down the possible causes.","poster":"JonHin"}],"comment_id":"1360880","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JonHin"},{"poster":"realOneThrive","timestamp":"1731352980.0","comment_id":"1209890","content":"Selected Answer: C\nYeah I think it's C by elimination; none of the answers make sense, but C is the most reasonable one.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1004938","poster":"Onero_1z","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt’s C","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1710177420.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A technician is troubleshooting a laptop that shuts down intermittently.
