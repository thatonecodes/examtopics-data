Instead of attempting numerous passwords for a single user (as in a brute-force attack), the attacker spreads out login attempts across many accounts using a small set of common passwords. They hope that at least one of these attempts will result in a successful login.\n\nWe can see multiple failed login attempts (audit failures) for different usernames (USER1, USER2, USER3, USER4) with variations of \"UNKNOWN USERNAME OR BAD PASSWORD.\" This indicates that the attacker attempted to log in with different usernames using a limited set of passwords. When they succeeded in gaining access to USER4 (\"SUCCESSFUL LOGON\"), it suggested that one of the username and password combinations used in the password-spraying attempt was correct.","timestamp":"1693845180.0","upvote_count":"22"},{"poster":"TM78","comment_id":"1156598","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI believe it’s Brute Force.

Brute force attacks involve systematically trying all possible combinations of passwords until the correct one is found or until the account is locked out due to too many failed attempts.\n\nOn the other hand, password spraying involves using a few commonly used passwords or a small set of passwords across multiple usernames. The attacker tries these passwords against many different user accounts, hoping to find one that is vulnerable. Unlike brute force attacks, password spraying focuses on spreading the attack surface thin across multiple accounts, often to avoid triggering account lockouts or detection mechanisms.","poster":"An381038"},{"upvote_count":"12","comment_id":"1211548","timestamp":"1715702880.0","poster":"Mimikatz4Exam","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPassword Spraying looks like ; \nUser1 : F*ckyouCompti4\nUser2 : F*ckyouCompti4\nUser3 : F*ckyouCompti4\n\nBrute-Force looks like;\nUser1 : Password1\nUser1: Spring2022\nUser1: Qwerty123!"},{"comment_id":"1209137","poster":"9e20f4f","upvote_count":"1","content":"Wouldn`t password spraying stop after 2 failed attempts ?
