Support may not available during all business hours. When the vendor is located in a different time zone, there can be significant challenges related to the availability of support. If the vendor's support team operates on a different schedule, there might be delays in receiving assistance during the organization's critical business hours. This can exacerbate issues during equipment failures and affect the organization's ability to maintain business operations effectively. Whereas Shipping delays can indeed impact the organization's operations and incur costs. However, the immediate concern during an equipment failure is often how quickly the issue can be diagnosed and resolved. Shipping delays become a concern after the immediate support and troubleshooting process."},{"poster":"Trap_D0_r","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nShipping delays aren't a risk necessarily limited to non-US vendors. Even a local vendor may experience delays because who knows where they source material from? Realistically it's inefficient and practically impossible to source every piece of revenue-generating hardware to ensure it will be replaceable quickly--as someone else stated, that's why we keep spares (and track MTTF and RTO/RPOs).\nThe concern with non-US sourcing is lack of vendor support during regular business hours. If you're located in the central US and source from a German company, they're SIX HOURS ahead of your organization. That means that every single day (depending on DST), active support for your hardware stops dead at 11am. Part of the service contract you sign includes support, and you have to pay for it regardless, so why source from someone who's only providing 3 hours of appliance support per day because of time zones?\nThis one is obviously A to me.","comment_id":"1114766","timestamp":"1704484620.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1702951980.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWe should be more concerned about the device getting replaced because of system failures not support being available.
