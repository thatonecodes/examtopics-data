They need to require badges or code. For the badge part teachers use the badge to print out worksheets either if it's English, Math, History, Science, even Reading classes. My college uses the code authentication method. I use it to print out my essay for my English class.

This mitigates the risk of confidential information being intercepted from the output tray before the user has had time to collect it. Authentication to release the print job might be supported using different formats:\n\nPIN entry requires the user to input the correct password or code via the device control panel.\nBadging means the print device is fitted with a smart card reader.

The problem is that users are printing material that they are never retrieving. By requiring a badge or code the document won't print until the user physically goes to the printer to retrieve the documents. If the user never goes to the printer, the documents never get printed, and no waste accumulates.

DHCP.\n\nDHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. When a device, such as a computer or smartphone, connects to a network, it sends a broadcast message requesting an IP address. The DHCP server responds by assigning an available IP address from its pool of addresses.   \n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nDNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names (like [invalid URL removed]) into IP addresses. It doesn't assign IP addresses to devices.   \nIPSec (IP Security): A protocol suite for securing IP communications. It doesn't assign IP addresses.   \nSMB (Server Message Block): A network file sharing protocol.
