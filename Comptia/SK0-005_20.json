In the case of dual power supplies connected to different power sources, the primary goal is to create a fault-tolerant system that can continue operating even if one power source fails.\nComponent redundancy is indeed a part of this setup, as there are two power supply units.

RAID 6 provides two levels of parity protection, which means that data can be reconstructed even if two drives fail simultaneously. This is achieved by storing two sets of parity data across all drives in the array, which allows the array to survive multiple drive failures while maintaining data integrity.\n\nRAID 0 does not provide any redundancy and does not protect against drive failures. RAID 1 provides mirroring of data between two drives, but it only protects against the failure of a single drive.
