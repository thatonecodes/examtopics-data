This can help to prevent DoS attacks, which can disrupt the availability of the network and its applications.\n\n Mutual certificate authentication: To ensure that configuration updates to the SD-WAN routers can only be initiated from the management service, the network architect should implement mutual certificate authentication. This involves requiring the management service to present a valid certificate before it can initiate configuration updates, and requiring the SD-WAN routers to present a valid certificate before they can accept updates.\n\n Cloud proxy: To ensure that documents downloaded from websites are scanned for malware, the network architect should implement a cloud proxy.
