Project deliverables completed behind schedule is the BEST indicator of project failure.\n\nWhile each of the options listed could be a potential problem for a project, completing project deliverables behind schedule is the most significant and critical indicator of project failure. Meeting project timelines is a fundamental measure of project success, and delays in project completion can lead to cost overruns, missed opportunities, and loss of stakeholder trust. In contrast, product deficiencies, disagreements among team members, and changes to the project are all issues that can be addressed and resolved through effective project management practices, provided that the project stays on schedule. However, falling behind schedule can impact all aspects of the project, making it much more challenging to achieve success and meet stakeholder expectations."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI am thinking its D here.

RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix) component is missing.\n\nThe RTM is a document that links requirements to the corresponding test cases and verifies that each requirement is fulfilled by the system. It is a critical component of the testing process and ensures that the system meets the requirements of the stakeholders. In this scenario, the stakeholders who are available for the user acceptance test do not understand the project's requirements, indicating that there may be a gap in the requirements gathering process or that the requirements have not been clearly defined and documented. The tester is trying to identify who requested the feature, but there is no information available, which further indicates that the requirements have not been effectively traced and documented in the RTM. Without a complete and accurate RTM, it can be challenging to identify the origin of a feature or requirement, and stakeholders may not have a clear understanding of what to expect from the system.","comment_id":"812488","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676676240.0"},{"comment_id":"725489","timestamp":"1669252740.0","poster":"brvndvnwolf","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A"},{"timestamp":"1663863180.0","comment_id":"676351","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a tabular document that links the project or\nproduct requirements to their origin and traces them throughout the project life cycle.
