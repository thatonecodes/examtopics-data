It may not be as effective for hard drives or other storage devices, especially if the data is not completely overwritten. For example, if you had a bunch of old paper documents that contain important or sensitive information, you would use a paper shredder to cut the documents into tiny, unreadable pieces. That way, even if someone finds the shredded pieces, they won’t be able to reconstruct the original document. For computers, shredding can refer to securely deleting files, so they’re not just \"deleted\" in the normal sense but are instead permanently destroyed in a way that can’t be undone. Key difference\nPurging is about wiping data clean from a device so it’s unrecoverable.\nShredding is about physically destroying something (like a paper document or data on a drive) into small, unusable pieces.","poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1347148","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737932640.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1347146","poster":"Bright07","timestamp":"1737932280.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPurging involves using a method that ensures data is completely erased from a storage device in such a way that it cannot be recovered. Purging typically involves overwriting the storage media multiple times with random data or using other specialized techniques to ensure that the original data is thoroughly destroyed. This is particularly important for sensitive data, as it ensures that even if someone tries to recover it later, they cannot.\nFor example, If you’re getting rid of an old computer, and you want to make sure no one can recover the sensitive data you had on it (like passwords, bank info, etc.), you might use a purging tool to overwrite all the data on the hard drive multiple times. This ensures that even if someone tries to recover the old files, they’re completely gone."},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1344471","timestamp":"1737503100.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

This allows IPv6 traffic to pass through networks that only support IPv4, but it can also be used to bypass security filters or monitoring systems that do not properly inspect tunneled traffic. In this case, the event logs show that the traffic is IPv6 encapsulated within PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet), which is a hint that tunneling might be involved.\nThe engineer suspects data exfiltration because 6to4 tunneling is commonly used by attackers to hide traffic and evade detection mechanisms in place, such as those monitoring only IPv4 traffic or that don't inspect the contents of the tunneled packets. The use of IPv6 for communication (shown in the logs) and the presence of large data transfers could be indicative of an attempt to exfiltrate data in a covert manner.","poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1347155","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737935040.0"}],"question_id":563,"answer":"B","timestamp":"2025-01-27 00:44:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1737935040,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/cas-004/image68.png"],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"7yTnfaVN9mfcDqeqOt4P","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155455-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-606-discussion/","question_id":564,"timestamp":"2025-01-27 00:49:00","exam_id":343,"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"A":"Configuring a honeypot for adversary characterization","D":"Utilizing decoy accounts and documents","B":"Leveraging simulators for attackers","C":"Setting up a honey network for attackers"},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"During an adversarial simulation exercise, an external team was able to gain access to sensitive information and systems without the organization detecting this activity.
