The client and server communicate over the FTP protocol to facilitate the exchange of files between them.","poster":"salah112"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nFTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a client-server based protocol, meaning that the two computers involved communicate with each other in a request-response\npattern. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the requested data. This type of architecture is known as client-server, and it is used\nfor many different types of applications, including FTP. \n\nOther architectures, such as service-oriented, connection-oriented, and data-centric, are not used for FTP.","poster":"Ali3ngazer","comment_id":"916255","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1717678680.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Alizadeh","timestamp":"1712581500.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Traffic shaping\n\nTraffic shaping is a bandwidth management technique that involves controlling the rate of traffic sent or received on a network. It uses buffers to smooth the traffic flow and prevent packet loss. In the context described, when the ISP starts to drop packets exceeding the agreed-upon traffic rate, traffic shaping at the client side helps manage the flow of traffic and avoid TCP retransmissions by buffering the data. This allows for a more controlled and efficient use of the available bandwidth.","upvote_count":"7"},{"timestamp":"1733520180.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"j904","content":"buffers*","comment_id":"1089788"},{"poster":"ja1092m","timestamp":"1723589160.0","comment_id":"980330","content":"Traffic policing and traffic shaping have the following differences: Traffic policing directly discards packets with rates that are greater than the traffic policing rate.

Traffic Shaping\n\nFrom Emmett Dulaney's Exam Cram N10-008: \n\n\"The term traffic shaping describes the mechanisms used to control bandwidth\nusage on the network. With this, administrators can control who uses network\nbandwidth, for what purpose, and what time of day bandwidth can be used.\nTraffic shaping establishes priorities for data traveling to and from the Internet\nand within the network.\"\n\nAnd when searching online for Traffic prioritization (SimpleWAN.com), it provides a means to control the volume of traffic being sent into a network in a specified period, or the maximum rate at which the traffic is sent. It's used to optimize or guarantee performance, improve latency, and/or increase usable bandwidth for some kinds of packets by delaying other kinds. \n\nIn this scenario, both A and D are the more likely choices but since Traffic Priortization is not listed in the CompTIA N10-008 objectives, it's A.","timestamp":"1717679700.0","poster":"Ali3ngazer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"916277"},{"timestamp":"1716999720.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"coolwhip","comment_id":"909539","content":"vceUP says the answer is Traffic prioritization..."},{"timestamp":"1711350960.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A. Traffic shaping.\n\nTraffic shaping is a bandwidth management technique that allows the administrator to control the flow of traffic from the network to the client. The technique uses buffers at the client side to prevent TCP retransmissions from occurring when the ISP starts to drop packets of specific types that exceed the agreed traffic rate. Traffic shaping enables the administrator to prioritize traffic types and specify the maximum bandwidth that each traffic type can consume.","poster":"StellarSteve","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"849865"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Exactly.
