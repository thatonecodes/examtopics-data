Viruses and Trojans may spawn pop-ups without the user opening the browser.Another symptom is redirection. This is where the user tries to open one page but gets sent to another. Often this may imitate the target page. In adware, this is just a blunt means of driving traffic through a site, but spyware may exploit it to capture authentication details.","poster":"PythonWolf","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1665895680.0","comment_id":"696003"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":338,"question_id":121,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/45090-exam-220-1002-topic-1-question-217-discussion/","question_text":"A Windows user reports that clicking on links when browsing the Internet results in unexpected destination pages with advertisements or virus infection warnings.\nThe user reboots the computer, but the issue persists.
