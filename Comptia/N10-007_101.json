This means less protocol overhead, e.g., if one ACK were sent every 8 packets, that ACK is now acknowledging 72,000 bytes of data vs 12,000 bytes of data. This results in less network chatter.\n\nLet’s assume we need to transfer 20 gigabytes (21,474,836,480 bytes) of data as quickly as possible. With a standard 1500 byte MTU that will take 14,316,558 packets, but with an MTU of 9000 we are sending 2,386,093 packets. That’s a difference of 11,930,465 packets.\n\nThat’s our advantage.
