A brute-force attack relies on trial and error and isn’t limited to passwords—you can brute-force usernames, URLs, directories, parameters, MFA, etc.\n\nThis could very well be a case of someone whose credentials (username and password) were leaked on the dark web, which also rules out B.

When brute force occurs, it means that the attacker is running a script to input different kind of password until it hit the right one. In this case the attacker knew the password since the password authentication successful for all four logins. And someone that say MFA failed is a brute force. yes that can be true but the right answer would be still B since the keylogger was the main issue.
