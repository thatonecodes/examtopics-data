In the vi editor, commands such as moving the cursor or copying lines into the buffer can be issued multiple times or applied to multiple rows by specifying the number right in front of a command. For example, to move the cursor four spaces to the right, you can type \"4l\". Similarly, to copy two lines into the buffer, you can type \"2yy\". This is known as a count, and it applies the command to the specified number of lines or characters.","timestamp":"1676211600.0","poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"806412"}],"poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"805872"}],"question_id":42},{"id":"5Shv8eX9EiP3hwUkTcTQ","question_text":"Which of the following files, located in the user home directory, is used to store the Bash history?","answers_community":[],"exam_id":353,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98875-exam-lx0-103-topic-3-question-25-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-02-12 03:10:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1676167800.0","comment_id":"805874","content":"The file used to store the Bash history in the user home directory is .bash_history","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin"}],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1676167800,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":43,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":".bash_histfile","A":".bash_history","D":".bashrc_history","E":".history_bash","C":".history"},"topic":"3"},{"id":"fZxGANmh1NeM9dUR5Gpr","answer":"HISTFILE","answer_images":[],"question_id":44,"discussion":[{"poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"806420","content":"HISTFILE is an environment variable used in Unix-based operating systems to specify the location and filename of the file where the shell history is stored. The shell history is a record of the commands that have been entered at the command line by the user, and it can be used to recall and re-execute previous commands.\n\nBy default, the shell history is saved in a file named .bash_history in the user's home directory, but the location and filename can be customized by setting the HISTFILE variable. For example, to store the shell history in a file called my_history in the user's home directory, you can add the following line to the user's shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc for the Bash shell):\n\nHISTFILE=$HOME/my_history","timestamp":"1676211780.0"}],"question_text":"SIMULATION -\nWhich Bash environment variable defines in which file the user history is stored when exiting a Bash process?

In this case, it is \"archive.tgz\".\nWhen you run this command, the output will list the contents of the compressed tar archive in the terminal window.
