The requirement implies multiple subnet masks will be in use, so VRRP would not be as effective here.","upvote_count":"46","comments":[{"poster":"reemaplus","comments":[{"poster":"Halaa","content":"it is one of the Dynamic route's protocols.","comment_id":"535596","timestamp":"1643475000.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"I did not see IS IS protocol in the Network+ Objectives...
