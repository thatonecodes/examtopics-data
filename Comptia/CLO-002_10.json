Compute report.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Compute Report: This report tracks the usage of computing resources such as CPU and memory. Since the company is running tests on an algorithm, which typically requires significant computational power, the compute resources are likely the primary driver of the higher-than-expected bills. Examining the compute report first will help the company understand how much CPU or GPU resources were consumed during the testing phase and identify opportunities to optimize or reduce costs.","timestamp":"1724075520.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SophyQueenCR82","comment_id":"1268746"},{"poster":"BlueMan93","comment_id":"1232570","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNetwork - this is based in the cloud.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718736120.0"},{"timestamp":"1695594540.0","comment_id":"1016205","content":"Not enough Information?\nDepends what is more important the responsiveness of the application or the bill?\nIf the new revenue from increased responsiveness offsets the cost, then the responsiveness of the app is more important. \n\nChecking the Network Report can determine how fast the app loads - maybe its a issue with load balancing? (macxsz stated it relates to latency and speed. )\n\nIf we are checking application responsiveness we'll be checking the network.\nBut what if we are concerned about the bill more as it may not be offset by future revenue. \nIs the algorithm run more memory/compute/network/storage intensive (this is not stated).\nIf we are looking for the best answer what assumptions can we make. \nAssuming this is a load balancing issue that causes delayed response times maybe it'd require more compute cycles to determine which server to query(finding the best alternative algorithm to round robin)?","upvote_count":"1","poster":"techcreators"},{"comment_id":"884267","content":"The question is a little bit tricky, \"responsiveness of the application\" futher it could be Latency on the ACCESS on both ways.\n\nHowever it also says what to check FIRST. but in real world our Network is set 1 Time constant configuration however we are talking Internet Networking over the cloud so in the base of Cloud matters latency first comes suspected is the link.\n\nNetwork\nMemory\nand lastly Compute.","poster":"Arnel101","timestamp":"1682767500.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"macxsz","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI also think it is compute report.\nThat is my experience when I have used clouding services like AI.

Shared Responsibility.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Shared Responsibility: In cloud computing, security is a shared responsibility between the cloud service provider and the customer. The cloud provider is typically responsible for the security of the cloud (such as physical security, network infrastructure, and hypervisor security), while the customer is responsible for security in the cloud (such as data protection, identity and access management, and network security). Understanding and managing this shared responsibility model helps mitigate the risk of a network breach by clearly defining which party is responsible for which aspects of security."}],"question_text":"Which of the following cloud principles will help manage the risk of a network breach?","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/146021-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-33-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","exam_id":344,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_images":[]},{"id":"hFZPUdtkvqcq7TAe9nmL","timestamp":"2020-03-11 08:43:00","unix_timestamp":1583912580,"choices":{"A":"Shadow IT","D":"Vendor lock-in","B":"Sensitive data","C":"Encryption"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":50,"discussion":[{"poster":"raytay3","comment_id":"62304","upvote_count":"8","content":"Shadow IT is the use of IT-related hardware or software by a department or individual without the knowledge of the IT or security group within the organization.
