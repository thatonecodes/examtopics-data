If a user has exceeded the data cap, the phone may no longer allow internet browsing over a cellular connection. This is usually because the cellular data usage has exceeded the allotted amount for the particular plan the device is on, and the service provider has temporarily suspended the data connection.\nIt is unlikely that the child accidentally connected to a neighbor's WLAN because this would not affect the cellular data connection. Similarly, it is unlikely that the company's group policy has disabled the device, as this would likely affect all devices under the same policy. If the device's plan has been unpaid, the service provider would likely temporarily suspend all services, not just the cellular data connection.\nReference: CompTIA A+ Core 1 Exam Guide, page 329.","poster":"JonHin","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A\nB: Memory issues typically result in system crashes, error messages, or application crashes, rather than symptoms of slowing down and fan fluctuations.\nC: Power supply issues may cause the system to fail to power on or experience random shutdowns\nD: Hard drive issues may lead to slow performance or data access errors, but they are unlikely to cause symptoms of fan fluctuation","poster":"e643de3","timestamp":"1730938800.0","comment_id":"1207596","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"877510","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt looks like the device has a data cap and reach its limits.

The staff's child used it to stream videos online. This is against company's policy, it is possible for the company to disable the phone to have access to the internet. so, Answer is B","comments":[{"timestamp":"1695823560.0","comment_id":"852180","content":"I don't think so. I think they are trying to get us to confuse group policy with acceptable use policy. First since the company issued the phone, the company should have an MDM solution, so it should have blocked the user's child from streaming movies in the first place, much less several different movies at different times. But let's say they were not blocked and the company saw that the user violated the AUP so the phone's internet access is going to be disabled, then why would they only disable internet browsing over a cellular connection and not internet browsing over a WiFi connection as well? So as long as the user is on WiFi she can still do non-work-related stuff. I think the data cap limit is the correct answer.","poster":"oatmealturkey","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"861062","upvote_count":"4","content":"It says that the phone no longer allows internet browsing via *cellular data*, not that it is completely incapable of browsing the internet at all.","poster":"lborden","timestamp":"1696424640.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694417520.0"}],"exam_id":339,"answers_community":["C (75%)","A (25%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/102273-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-167-discussion/"},{"id":"4sDGKM769iIjI7rOWt2o","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1680825180,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"CPU fan","D":"Hard drive","B":"Memory","C":"Power supply"},"exam_id":339,"isMC":true,"question_id":77,"answer_description":"","question_text":"A user’s desktop computer slows down after a few minutes of use, and the fans alternate between silent and very loud.
