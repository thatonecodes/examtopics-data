Encryption at rest\n\nEncryption at rest is specifically designed to protect data stored on devices such as hard drives, USB drives, or mobile devices. When data is encrypted at rest, it remains encrypted even if the device is stolen or compromised. This ensures that the data cannot be accessed without the appropriate decryption keys, thereby safeguarding it from unauthorized access.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726094280.0","comment_id":"1171370"},{"poster":"Frank9020","comment_id":"1123256","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Encryption at rest\n\nEncryption at rest is a method used to encrypt data stored on a device or media, such as hard drives, ensuring that even if the device is stolen, the data remains secure.
