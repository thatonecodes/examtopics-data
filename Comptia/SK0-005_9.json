Share permissions\n\nThe most likely cause of the access issue is the share permissions. Even though Group A was granted full control over the files, it's possible that the share permissions are restricting access to the files. Share permissions are used to control access to a shared folder or file across the network, and they can be set independently of the NTFS permissions that control access to the files on the local system.\n\nSIEM policies, IDS rules, and firewall ports are all security measures that could potentially impact access to the files, but they are less likely to be the cause of the access issue in this scenario.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728243360.0"},{"poster":"Pongsathorn","comment_id":"715711","content":"Selected Answer: C\nShare Permissions\nWhen a resource is shared over a network, it can be assigned Read, Change, Full Control, or Deny permissions on the share. Windows supports user-level security; users have permissions depending upon who they are. Share permissions only protect the resource from access over the network. Local access can only be secured by NTFS permissions.\nThe Official CompTIA Server+ Study Guide (Exam SK0-005) page 264.\n\nResource Access\nMany help desk tickets and user complaints center around access to resources. Frequently, these issues are tied to permissions. In Windows, file access is managed by NTFS permissions and by Share permissions when accessing the file from across the network. In Linux, file access is controlled by standard permissions and by NFS permissions when accessing the data from across the network. Ensuring these permissions are set correctly eases many user frustrations and provides users access to the files that they need. Viruses and other malware also impact the ability of users to access resources.\nThe Official CompTIA Server+ Study Guide (Exam SK0-005) page 224.","timestamp":"1715387940.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":365,"unix_timestamp":1668134340,"choices":{"D":"Firewall ports","B":"IDS rules","A":"SIEM policies","C":"Share permissions"}},{"id":"dqeQcIaOHhHXcy9qPaWo","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/82639-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-141-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Reinstall the ESX server.","A":"Check the power supplies.","D":"Reseat the processors.","B":"Review the log files."},"exam_id":365,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"gingasaurusrex","comment_id":"863269","timestamp":"1728243360.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Review the log files.\n\nThe purple screen with white letters is commonly known as the \"purple screen of death\" (PSOD), which is an error screen that appears when there is a fatal error on an ESX/ESXi host. The first step in troubleshooting this issue should be to review the log files, which can provide additional information about the error that occurred.\n\nChecking the power supplies or reseating the processors would be unlikely to resolve this type of issue, as it is typically a software or configuration issue rather than a hardware issue.

Failed or failing RAM causes OS instability. With Windows Server, this usually causes a Blue Screen to occur.

DNS\n\nDomain Name System (DNS) is the best solution to configure a server's networking information so that a list of names and IP addresses will no longer need to be maintained in a file on the server. DNS is a distributed system that translates domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. By using DNS, servers can be identified by their domain names instead of their IP addresses, and the IP addresses can be managed by the DNS server.\n\nDHCP can assign IP addresses to servers dynamically, but it does not eliminate the need for maintaining a list of names and IP addresses. A hosts file can be used to map names to IP addresses, but it needs to be maintained manually on each server. VLAN is a technology used to separate traffic on a network, but it is not related to managing server names and IP addresses."},{"comment_id":"822111","content":"so sad to see A is the answer ..\nC definitely is the Correct one","timestamp":"1708929900.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"agabeen"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1699670760.0","comment_id":"715714","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDNS resolves \"names and IP address\" things","poster":"Pongsathorn"},{"comment_id":"694325","timestamp":"1697237280.0","poster":"nixonbii","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSo sad.

Partition the drive.\n\nThe administrator needs to partition the drive to make it available for use. Partitioning involves dividing the disk into one or more sections that can be used for storing data. Once the partition is created, the administrator can format it with a file system and assign a drive letter or mount point to make it accessible.\n\nCreating a new disk quota, configuring the drive as dynamic, or setting the compression are not necessary steps to make the drive available.
