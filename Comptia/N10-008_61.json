It is typically expressed in terms of time, and it helps to inform the design and implementation of the backup solution.\n\nFor example, if an organization has a critical service that must be available 24/7, it may have a very low RTO, requiring that the service be restored within a matter of minutes or even seconds. On the other hand, if the service can be down for a longer period of time without significantly impacting operations, the organization may have a higher RTO.\n\nWhen selecting a backup solution, it is important to consider the organization's RTO requirements and ensure that the solution is capable of meeting those needs.
