RG6\n\nIn a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) situation where a cable modem is being installed, the most appropriate demarcation connection is typically RG6. RG6 is a type of coaxial cable commonly used for cable television (CATV) and cable modem installations. It is well-suited for carrying broadband signals, including those used by cable modems for internet connectivity. Therefore, RG6 is the preferred choice for connecting a cable modem in this context.","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"IckyNicky","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) situation where a cable modem is being installed, the most appropriate demarcation connection to use would typically be option A: RG6.\n\nRG6 is a type of coaxial cable that is commonly used for connecting devices like cable modems to the cable wall outlet. It's designed to carry high-frequency signals and is widely used in cable television and internet connections, making it suitable for connecting the cable modem in a SOHO setup.","timestamp":"1700345940.0","comment_id":"1074315","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2023-11-18 23:19:00","choices":{"A":"RG6","D":"Multimode fiber","C":"RJ11","B":"Cat 6"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":357,"question_text":"Which of the following demarcation connections would be MOST appropriate to use with a cable modem being installed in a SOHO situation?","answer_description":""},{"id":"aDI82t3qdudl5fA0dtPW","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-11-18 23:20:00","topic":"1","answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1700346000,"question_id":547,"question_text":"A technician needs to allow a device to maintain the same IP address lease based on the physical address of a network card.

MAC address reservation\n\nTo allow a device to maintain the same IP address lease based on the physical address (MAC address) of a network card, a technician should use MAC address reservation. MAC address reservation ensures that a specific IP address is assigned to a device based on its unique MAC address, preventing the DHCP server from assigning a different IP address to that device.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. MAC address reservation.","timestamp":"1733506740.0","poster":"salah112"},{"comment_id":"1074316","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1731968400.0","poster":"IckyNicky","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTo enable a device to maintain the same IP address lease based on the physical address of a network card, the technician should use option A: MAC address reservation.\n\nMAC address reservation, also known as DHCP reservation, is a feature in DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) servers. It allows the DHCP server to assign a specific IP address to a device based on its MAC (Media Access Control) address. This ensures that a particular device always receives the same IP address when it requests an address from the DHCP server."}],"isMC":true},{"id":"UAlIAOXXanetknANfHWz","exam_id":357,"question_text":"A network technician is investigating why a core switch is logging excessive amounts of data to the syslog server.
