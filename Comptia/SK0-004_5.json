They provide faster data transfer speeds and are designed to handle higher workloads, making them ideal for database servers.\n\nThe 15,000 rpm speed of these SAS drives provides faster rotational speeds, leading to faster read and write times. The higher the rotational speed, the lower the seek time, which translates to faster data access and higher IOPS.","timestamp":"1737923760.0","comment_id":"1347111","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Annahubanna"}],"timestamp":"2025-01-26 21:36:00","choices":{"D":"1 TB 7200 rpm SATA drives","B":"600 GB 15000 rpm SAS drives","C":"800 GB 10000 rpm SAS drives","A":"500 GB SATA SSD drives"},"question_images":[]},{"id":"W950uL5Y08E9F4TVMC8G","discussion":[{"content":"USERS should only have READ permissions only nothing else","comment_id":"329638","poster":"Nvidia","timestamp":"1617714180.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1614171060.0","content":"But A,B and D will prevent users from changing permissions?","poster":"Dirkster","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"298197"}],"question_text":"An IT manager noticed that specific directories' permissions are being changed by users.
