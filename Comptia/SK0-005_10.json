Disclose the incident.\nE. Identify the exploited vulnerability.\n\nWhen a data breach occurs, two important measures that should be taken are to disclose the incident and identify the exploited vulnerability. Disclosing the incident is important for transparency and to allow affected individuals to take steps to protect themselves. Identifying the exploited vulnerability can help to prevent future breaches and strengthen security measures.\n\nRestoring the data from backup may be necessary if the data was lost or corrupted during the breach, but it is not a measure that should be taken in all cases. Disabling unnecessary ports, running an antivirus scan, and moving the data to a different location may be necessary steps to prevent further damage or to secure the environment, but they are not measures that should be taken immediately following a data breach."},{"comment_id":"710219","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nAnswer should be B and E.\nRegarding CompTIA Server+ SK0-005 Objective.

It might surprise you to know that in many cases organizations don't even know that a breach has occurred for weeks or months! Identifying breaches involves deep inspection of log files by experienced technicians to identify that data loss has occurred.\n\nDISCLOSURE\nIn many highly regulated industries, organizations are required by regulation or law to notify any users whose data has been disclosed. For example, in the healthcare field, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, 45 CFR §§ 164.400-414, requires HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI). As another example, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted legislation requiring private or governmental entities to notify individuals of security breaches of information involving personally identifiable information (PII).","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1683077820.0","poster":"Pongsathorn"},{"comment_id":"694335","timestamp":"1681426560.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"nixonbii","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nThe Department of Justice takes a very dim view towards those who lose customers' personal information and then wait to tell the authorities.

The question states WHEN a data breach occurs.\nMove the data to another location ... same issue. What data.

So disable unnecessary ports is the only other option that makes any sense. Although this should have been done before this point. What should happen is that you remove the affected systems from the network but do NOT shut them off.\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/data-breach-response-guide-business","poster":"Timock","timestamp":"1679152020.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"672370"}],"exam_id":365,"timestamp":"2022-09-18 15:07:00","unix_timestamp":1663506420,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"BE","choices":{"E":"Identify the exploited vulnerability.","D":"Run an antivirus scan.","A":"Restore the data from backup.","F":"Move the data to a different location.","C":"Disable unnecessary ports.","B":"Disclose the incident."}},{"id":"wwbnRbjr93l9aCb6VSnt","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nJBOD doesn't provide much redundancy and protection.","poster":"shanebrown","timestamp":"1726510080.0","comment_id":"1284902","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Software RAID\n\nSoftware RAID is the most cost-effective method of deploying storage redundancy techniques in a lab environment. Software RAID uses the server's CPU and memory to manage the disk redundancy, and can be implemented without additional hardware or specialized equipment. Most operating systems have built-in support for software RAID, making it easy to set up and configure.\n\nHardware RAID is a more expensive option, as it requires specialized RAID controllers and storage devices that support RAID. FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) is a high-performance network protocol used to connect storage devices to servers, but it requires specialized network hardware and is not a cost-effective option for a lab environment.
