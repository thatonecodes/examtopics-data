The write performance will be impacted.\n\nRAID controllers often use a battery-backed cache (also known as write-back cache) to enhance performance. This cache temporarily stores write operations before they are written to the disk. The battery ensures that data in the cache can be retained and eventually written to the disk in the event of a power loss. If the battery on the RAID controller fails, the system may switch to write-through caching as a safety measure to prevent data loss. Write-through caching writes data directly to the disk without using the cache, which can significantly reduce write performance because it bypasses the performance benefits of the cache. Read performance is typically not directly affected by the status of the battery because data being read is not stored in the cache in the same way that write data is.","poster":"surfuganda","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726192020.0","comment_id":"1172217"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1710301620,"isMC":true,"question_text":"A storage engineer responds to an alarm on a storage array and finds the battery on the RAID controller needs to be replaced.
