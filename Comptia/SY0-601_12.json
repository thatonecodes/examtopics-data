The data-link layer is where switches operates on to move traffic. Switches will use MAC addresses to find the physical address of the device. This is because the Layer 2 address(MAC Address) will be unique on the local network.\n\nMAC flooding is a cyber attack that overflows the MAC Table (Layer 2 Table) of switches by sending out invalid MAC addresses.\n\nWhen a MAC Address table is full, the switch is no longer able to save new addresses, so it will enter into fail-open mode and begin broadcasting data (like a hub) to all ports. This will allow an attacker to get data packets intended for another computer and be able to steal sensitive information."},{"content":"Took the exam today and passed with a 775.

The hashing algorithm performs a one-way function, meaning it is not possible to reverse the process and retrieve the original password from the hash value alone. The resulting hash value is unique to the input, meaning different passwords will result in different hash values.\n\nBy storing only the hash values of passwords instead of the passwords themselves, the administrator ensures that even if the database is compromised, the actual passwords are not exposed to attackers.
