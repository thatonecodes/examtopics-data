The data is stored in a secured cloud environment architected to provide high availability. The service is available on-demand, which enables organizations of different sizes to tailor DR solutions to their needs. \nAs opposed to traditional solutions, cloud-based disaster recovery is easy to set up and manage.

Disaster recovery in cloud computing entails storing critical data and applications in cloud storage and failing over to a secondary site in case of a disaster.
