Replace the system RAM.\n\nIf the system is consistently running out of memory and displaying a \"low memory\" warning message, it suggests that the available RAM may be insufficient to handle the demands of the software being used. By replacing the system RAM with a higher capacity or better-performing RAM module, the technician can address the memory-related issues and potentially resolve the intermittent crashes of the proprietary software. Reimaging the computer (option A) or reinstalling and updating the failing software (option C) may not address the underlying hardware issue causing the memory shortage. Decreasing the page file size (option D) may alleviate some memory pressure but is unlikely to fully resolve the issue if the system's RAM is inadequate for the software's requirements.
