The majority of the application load takes place on the application server under normal conditions. For this reason, the company decides to deploy additional application servers into a commercial cloud provider using the on-premises orchestration engine that installs and configures common software and network configurations. The remote computing environment is connected to the on-premises datacenter via a site-to-site IPSec tunnel. The external DNS provider has been configured to use weighted round-robin routing to load balance connections from the Internet.\nDuring testing, the company discovers that only 20% of connections completed successfully.\nReview the network architecture and supporting documents and fulfill these requirements:\nPart 1:\n1. Analyze the configuration of the following components: DNS, Firewall1, Firewall2, Router1, Rouler2, VPN and Orchestrator Server.\n2. Identify the problematic device(s).\nPart 2:\n3. Identify the correct options to provide adequate configuration for hybrid cloud architecture.\nInstructions:\nIf at any time you would like to bring back the initial state of the simulation, please select the Reset button.
