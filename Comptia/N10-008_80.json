Use SNMP with an existing collector server.\n\nSNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol used for managing and monitoring network devices. It can be used to monitor and collect data from sensors in a network, including temperature sensors. By using an existing SNMP collector server, the company can automate the process of checking temperature readings from multiple sensors in different locations. This can help the company to identify the rooms that are too warm quickly and efficiently, without the need for manual checks.","comment_id":"849989","upvote_count":"16"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/103836-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-455-discussion/","topic":"1","exam_id":357,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A company has multiple offices around the world.

If MDIX is enabled on the new switch.\n\nWhen replacing a switch, it is important to ensure that the new switch has the same configuration as the old one. One common issue that can arise when replacing a switch is that the new switch may not have MDIX (Media Dependent Interface Crossover) enabled by default. MDIX is a technology that allows switches to automatically detect the type of cable being used and adjust the transmission accordingly.
