Install an updated printer driver on the print server.\n\nThe issue of information being garbled and looking like code could be related to a compatibility issue with the new firmware and the existing printer driver. The printer driver is responsible for converting the print job data into a format that the printer can understand and print. If the new firmware is not compatible with the existing driver, it could cause the printed output to be incorrect.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the technician should install an updated printer driver on the print server that is compatible with the new firmware. This will ensure that the driver is able to correctly translate the print job data into a format that the printer can understand and produce accurate printed output.","comment_id":"808754"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"793917","poster":"deverser","timestamp":"1690789140.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis was on my exam.
