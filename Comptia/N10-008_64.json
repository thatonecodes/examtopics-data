Multipathing. Multipathing allows multiple physical network connections to a server to share a single IP address, providing both increased performance and fault tolerance in the event of a NIC failure.

The streams may be emanating from a single application or multiple applications. A stream is assigned a separate path, as uniquely possible given the number of paths available. If there are more streams than available paths, some streams will share paths. CMR provides better utilization of bandwidth by creating multiple transmission queues. It provides a degree of fault tolerance in that should a path fail, only the traffic assigned to that path is affected. There is also, ideally, an alternative path immediately available upon which to continue or restart the interrupted stream.","comments":[{"poster":"Mehsotopes","comment_id":"1086364","timestamp":"1733164500.0","content":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_routing","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1086363"},{"poster":"famco","timestamp":"1713613320.0","comment_id":"875534","upvote_count":"1","content":"Multipathing is about SAN and also WiFi but is the right answer here \nFHRP could use single IP address for multiple routers, a different thing, but could confuse during exams"},{"timestamp":"1709375400.0","poster":"Danie001","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"826739","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMULTIPATHING (Used in Storage Area Networks) creates more than one physical path between the server and it's sorage devices for better fault tolerance and performance."}],"choices":{"C":"First Hop Redundancy Protocol","D":"Elasticity","A":"Multipathing","B":"Spanning Tree Protocol"}},{"id":"3Ws8ZR0GNV6mQ85Uvic4","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"BigDazza_111","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732527840.0","comment_id":"1218097","content":"I was expecting this to be a port security answer..."},{"poster":"kinny4000","content":"This technician sucks lol","timestamp":"1730890080.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1207258"},{"comment_id":"1106963","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1719495900.0","content":"Selected Answer: E\nThe fact that the issue is affecting different users on different days suggests that it’s not a problem with individual user settings or hardware, but rather with the network configuration itself.

The CAM table is used to map MAC addresses to switch ports, allowing the switch to forward frames to the correct destination. If the table becomes full, new MAC addresses cannot be learned, and frames may be dropped, resulting in connectivity issues.\n\nIncorrect firewall settings, inappropriate VLAN assignment, hardware failure, and DHCP scope exhaustion are also possible causes of network connectivity issues, but they are less likely to be the cause of the described symptoms in this particular scenario.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"818640"}],"answer":"E","choices":{"D":"Overloaded CAM table in switch","B":"Inappropriate VLAN assignment","C":"Hardware failure","A":"Incorrect firewall settings","E":"DHCP scope exhaustion"},"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/100446-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-385-discussion/","question_text":"A network administrator has received calls every day for the past few weeks from three users who cannot access the network.

A switch loop can occur when there is a redundant connection between switches, causing a loop in the network. This can result in high levels of broadcast/multicast traffic, which can cause network congestion and potentially bring down the network.\n\nThe port statistics show a very high rate of broadcast/multicast packets being received, which supports the possibility of a switch loop. Additionally, the low utilization of the Tx (outgoing) port and the inability to connect via SSH suggests that the switch may be overwhelmed with incoming traffic, causing it to be unresponsive to new requests.\n\nDuplicate IP addresses or asynchronous routes can also cause network issues, but they are less likely to result in a complete network outage. High collisions can also be a sign of network congestion, but the provided information does not indicate that collisions are occurring.","comment_id":"850685","comments":[{"poster":"Gustitute","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"862678","content":"D is what you mean I think.
