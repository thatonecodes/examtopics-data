Toner probe.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA toner probe (Option C) is a tool used to trace and identify cables in a network or wiring system. The toner is connected to one end of the cable, and the technician uses the probe to trace the corresponding cable in the wiring closet. This helps in identifying and labeling cables.","comment_id":"1130180","poster":"edwinv","timestamp":"1721785080.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715110080.0","comment_id":"1065180","comments":[{"comment_id":"1102591","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1718971740.0","content":"Can't be A.
