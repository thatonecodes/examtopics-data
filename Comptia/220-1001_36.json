In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.","comment_id":"483295","poster":"cybervds"}],"answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1637502360,"exam_id":337,"choices":{"D":"VT-x","C":"Hyperthreading","B":"VNC","A":"Trusted Platform Module"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/66448-exam-220-1001-topic-1-question-266-discussion/","question_text":"A network administrator is deploying virtualization software to several desktop computers.
