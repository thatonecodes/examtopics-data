Many software vendors base their licensing on the total number of instances (or virtual machines) where the software will be installed or used. \nHowever, some specific software products, particularly those related to server or enterprise applications, may charge based on CPU sockets or cores. It’s important to check the specific licensing terms of the software in question, as different vendors may have different criteria for their volume-based licensing.","comment_id":"1301732"},{"poster":"54a6b25","upvote_count":"3","content":"C.

The number of sockets\n\nIn volume-based licensing for cloud solutions, licensing costs are typically based on the number of CPU sockets allocated to virtual machines. Sockets refer to physical or virtual CPU sockets assigned to a virtual machine instance. The more sockets you use, the higher the licensing costs are likely to be. Therefore, the number of sockets is the most important factor to consider when estimating and managing licensing costs in a cloud environment with volume-based licensing.","poster":"Therealjosh"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/137274-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-328-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":246,"unix_timestamp":1711464480,"question_images":[],"question_text":"A systems administrator is planning to migrate to a cloud solution with volume-based licensing.
