A break in the cable\n\nGiven the scenario where moving the connection to a different switch port did not resolve the issue and no tone is heard at the far end when using a tone generator on the infrastructure cable, the engineer is most likely trying to find a break in the cable. The absence of a tone signal at the far end indicates a discontinuity or complete break in the cable, which prevents the signal from traveling the entire length of the cable.

A switch operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is used to connect devices within a LAN, facilitating communication by forwarding data based on MAC addresses.

The initial capital expenses are lower.\n\nUsing the cloud as a redundant data center has the advantage of lower initial capital expenses compared to setting up and maintaining a physical data center. Cloud services typically operate on a pay-as-you-go or subscription model, which means companies can scale up their infrastructure as needed without the upfront costs associated with purchasing hardware, software, and real estate or investing in long-term maintenance and staffing.
