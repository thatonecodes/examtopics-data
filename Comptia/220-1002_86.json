Only issue was when I tried to click on Close Ticket at then end it told me to Select a ticket, but there was no way to do so. \nI could never confirm get confirmation that I had closed out the tickets and submitted my answers. I alerted the proctor who didn't know what to do about it, so I just moved on and did the rest of the test. I still had some time left after finishing the multiple choice questions, so I came back to it and tried to close out the tickets again, but still got the same message about needing to select a ticket. \n\nI ended up passing the exam and according to my results It didn't show me getting this question wrong; so don't stress like I did for 10 minutes if you get this PBQ and it doesn't let you close the ticket out.

So, the first best thing to do is to check the application permissions. For example, in Android a typical navigational path would be General > Apps & Notifications > App permissions. From there you will see the Camera app; tap it to find out which applications are using it. Then, you can deselect whichever apps you need to.
