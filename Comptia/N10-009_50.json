Fire suppression system\nC. Humidity control\n\nExplanation:\nA. Fire suppression system:\nEnsuring the presence of an appropriate fire suppression system is crucial for protecting equipment in case of fire. Modern data centers and server rooms typically use non-water-based fire suppression systems (e.g., FM200 or CO2 systems) to avoid damaging sensitive electronics.\n\nC. Humidity control:\nMaintaining proper humidity levels is essential for preventing condensation (too high humidity) or static electricity (too low humidity), both of which can damage sensitive equipment. Humidity control is a critical environmental factor in equipment installations.","timestamp":"1732934460.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1730744340.0","comment_id":"1307054","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nDefinitely A, and C.

But the console can connect directly to individual modules, which implies they're working. So D is unlikely.\n\nSo the most likely answer is A. The switch failed. Even though they rebooted it, maybe the reboot didn't resolve the hardware issue, or there's a configuration problem. The solid lights on unused ports might indicate a malfunctioning switch. Since the telephone system didn't come back after reboot, and direct connections work, the problem is likely the switch handling the telephone system's traffic. The support team can access the admin console via another interface connected to a different switch, so that's why they can still connect remotely.","poster":"ec_","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741295760.0","comment_id":"1366031"},{"timestamp":"1739821260.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI would still go with D.\nIt's an astute observation. While solid link and activity lights on unused ports might seem unusual and could be interpreted as a potential switch failure, the fact that the support team can still connect remotely to the administration console suggests that the switch is likely still functioning correctly to some extent.\n\nThe presence of activity lights on unused ports could indicate a misconfiguration or another network issue, but given the symptoms described, a module failure within the telephone system still seems more plausible. The console's ability to connect directly to individual modules but not to bring the entire system online points towards an internal issue within the telephone system, potentially with one of the modules.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"085d557","comment_id":"1357954"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1739362560.0","comment_id":"1355591","poster":"Big_Wes","content":"True, however \"Rebooting the telephone system does not restore service\" meaning it is an issue with the module if the switch is back online. \n\nD.
