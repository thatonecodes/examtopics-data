As a result, these systems can be vulnerable to known and unknown exploits that can be easily exploited by attackers.\n\nOption E, Unauthenticated commands, is also a critical weakness because SCADA systems often use proprietary protocols and commands that are not authenticated or encrypted, making it easy for attackers to inject unauthorized commands and manipulate the system.\n\nWhy Not D?\n\nD could also be a critical weakness for SCADA systems. However, it is not as commonly exploited as the other vulnerabilities listed in the answer choices. The lack of OS kernel mandatory access controls means that the SCADA system may not have sufficient security controls in place to prevent unauthorized access or changes to the system.

In many cases, firewalls employed as a defense measure for the industrial networks fail to detect/block malicious activity launched by external attackers, allowing them to access the OT systems. \n\nIn some cases, SCADA systems are connected to unaudited dial-up lines, or operators of the industrial environment have wrongly configured remote-access servers that could give attackers a path to access to the OT network as well as the corporate LAN.","comment_id":"904213","timestamp":"1684773420.0","poster":"adrian1188"},{"timestamp":"1681942620.0","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nGPT-4: In the context of a cybersecurity exam, the most critical weaknesses associated with common SCADA systems that organizations should address architecturally within their networks are:\n\nB.
