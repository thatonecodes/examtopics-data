It will cause more issues:\n\nIn a situation where one team member is disrupting the work of others by listening to loud music, it may be appropriate for the team to try to find a solution through negotiation. This could involve discussing the issue with the team member who is causing the disruption, explaining how their behavior is affecting the team, and working together to find a mutually acceptable solution. This approach allows the team to address the issue in a collaborative and respectful way, and may be more likely to lead to a lasting resolution than more confrontational or authoritarian approaches.\n\nConfronting the team member who is causing the disruption could potentially escalate the situation and create animosity within the team. Smoothing involves minimizing or downplaying the importance of the issue, which may not be an effective way to address the problem. Forcing the team member to stop listening to loud music may not be a sustainable solution, and could lead to resentment or conflict within the team.","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"3","poster":"kmanb"}],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1663810980,"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":359},{"id":"1ZfN7IwpBA6SxjPRWWgo","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/83154-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-855-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-09-22 03:57:00","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1669135380.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA, both inputs were taken in account","poster":"brvndvnwolf","comment_id":"724488"},{"poster":"all4one","content":"Smoothing because the scenario didn't indicate they lost or compromised anything.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1666557120.0","comment_id":"702462","comments":[{"timestamp":"1667461080.0","comment_id":"710333","poster":"all4one","content":"Mistake.
