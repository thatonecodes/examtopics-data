Here's how it works:\n\nCompromised Device: A device on the internal network becomes infected with malware or compromised by an attacker.\nCommunication Channel: The malware establishes a connection, typically HTTPS for encryption, to a known malicious IP address (the C&C server) located anywhere in the world.\nHidden Communication: The communication might use seemingly normal protocols (HTTPS) but often includes additional characters in the header that act as a signal to the C&C server. These extra characters might be difficult to detect without proper inspection.\nC&C Server Purpose: The C&C server can then send instructions to the compromised device, download additional malware, or exfiltrate stolen data.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA) Beaconing\n\nCompTIA Certmaster Topic 11A: Exploring Network Attack Indicators\n\nA bot may beacon its C&C server by sending simple transmissions at regular intervals to unrecognized or malicious domains. Likewise, irregular peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic in the network could indicate that a bot is communicating with a centralized C&C server. Hosts in the C&C network are difficult to pin down because they frequently change DNS names and IP addresses, using techniques such as domain generation algorithms (DGAs) and fast flux DNS.
