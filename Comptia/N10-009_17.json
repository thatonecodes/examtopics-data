SAN (Storage Area Network).\n\nExplanation:\nSAN (Storage Area Network) is most likely to work with an FC (Fibre Channel) connection, which is a high-speed network technology commonly used in storage environments. SANs are designed to provide centralized, high-performance storage that can be accessed by multiple servers over a network. SANs offer excellent scalability because new storage devices or servers can be easily added to the network without disrupting the existing setup.","comment_id":"1337354","poster":"HeatSquad77","timestamp":"1736195220.0"}],"choices":{"D":"NAS","B":"SAN","C":"SSE","A":"DAS"},"unix_timestamp":1736195220},{"id":"7wJ3emW3IvEum6KlsFYE","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153682-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-173-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"C","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1735589820,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"A company is moving to a hybrid cloud model.
