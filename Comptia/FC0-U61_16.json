RAID storage – RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) provides redundancy and protects data from drive failures, ensuring fault tolerance in business operations.\nB. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) – A UPS helps maintain power during outages, preventing data loss and hardware damage, making it a critical component of fault tolerance.\n\nExplanation of Incorrect Options:\nC. Off-site backups – Important for disaster recovery, but it doesn’t provide real-time fault tolerance.\nD. Private cloud servers – Can improve accessibility and scalability, but they do not directly provide fault tolerance.\nE. Virtual-hosted desktops – Useful for remote work and security but not a core fault tolerance practice.\nF.

WHILE: A WHILE loop is used for repeating a block of code while a condition is true, not for decision-making.\nC.

People\nExplanation:\nPeople are often considered the weakest link in an organization's security posture because human errors, lack of awareness, and susceptibility to social engineering attacks (such as phishing) can lead to security breaches. Even with strong technology, infrastructure, and regulations in place, a single mistake by an employee—such as using weak passwords, clicking malicious links, or falling for scams—can compromise an entire system.\n\nWhy the other options are less weak:\nA. Technology – While vulnerabilities exist, security updates and best practices can mitigate risks.\nB. Infrastructure – Secure infrastructure design can reduce attack vectors.\nD. Regulations – Compliance with security policies strengthens an organization, but enforcement depends on people.\nThus, human factors pose the greatest risk, making security awareness training critical for improving overall cybersecurity resilience."}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157524-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-195-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-03-04 18:10:00"},{"id":"JGIKrLVUPnRZY9MhcNJp","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Enhance the granularity of user permissions.","D":"Adopt a procedure for adding accounts.","C":"Implement smart card login.","B":"Enable an audit log."},"answer":"B","topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-02-17 00:45:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1739749500,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156624-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-197-discussion/","question_id":80,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1365047","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Enable an audit log.\nExplanation:\nIn security, accounting (part of the AAA framework: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) refers to tracking and logging user activities to ensure accountability and detect suspicious actions. Enabling an audit log allows security administrators to monitor and record user interactions, login attempts, transactions, and changes within the web application.\n\nWhy the other options are less relevant:\nA.
