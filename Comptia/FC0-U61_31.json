CSV files are simple and easy to create and read, and many applications support importing data from CSV files. Therefore, using CSV files for data importing is a common practice in database management.\n\nData querying, data reports, and data persistence are database concepts that typically use a database management system (DBMS) to store and manage data in a structured and efficient manner. While CSV files can be used to export data from a database for data reporting purposes, they are not typically used for data querying or data persistence in a database management system.","comment_id":"867912"},{"poster":"fdesouza","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDefinitely C - Data importing","timestamp":"1678976220.0","comment_id":"841038","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1672397580.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMaybe importing, as the only csv example in the book is used for importing:\n\nImporting data from an existing source can save a lot of time compared to manually entering it.

Network-level encryption.\n\nNetwork-level encryption is the best method to protect data in transit. This type of encryption ensures that the data being transferred over a network (e.g., over the internet or between systems) is encrypted, protecting it from being intercepted or read by unauthorized parties during transmission. Examples of network-level encryption include SSL/TLS for secure web communications (HTTPS) or VPN (Virtual Private Network) for secure connections between devices.","poster":"lexxone","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1365173"}],"answer_images":[],"question_id":155,"question_images":[],"isMC":true}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":311,"provider":"Comptia","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"FC0-U61","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"id":352},"currentPage":31},"__N_SSP":true}
