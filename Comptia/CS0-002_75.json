Sinkhole the domains.\n\nIn this scenario, sinkholing the domains would be the most appropriate configuration change for intelligence gathering. Sinkholing involves redirecting traffic from malicious domains to a controlled infrastructure, allowing security professionals to monitor and analyze the malicious activity without exposing the targeted individuals to actual threats. This helps in gathering intelligence on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the potential threat actors.\n\nThe other options, such as updating the whitelist, developing a malware signature, or updating the blacklist, are more focused on reactive measures and may not be as effective in gathering intelligence on the threat actors and their activities.
