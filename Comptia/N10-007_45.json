It is known as a black hole\nfrom the view that data is being sent, but is essentially being lost.\nThis condition occurs when the packet the router receives is larger than the\nconfigured size of the maximum transmission unit (MTU) and the Don’t\nFragment flag is configured on that packet. When this occurs, the router is\nsupposed to send a “Destination Unreachable” message back to the host. If the\npacket is not received, the host does not know that the packet did not go through.\nAlthough there are several solutions to this problem, the best is to verify whether\na mismatch has occurred between the maximum size packet clients can send and\nthat the router can handle. You can use ping to check that packets of a particular\nsize can move through the router by using the −l parameter to set a packet size\nand the −f parameter to set the Do Not Fragment bit.","timestamp":"1636473960.0","comment_id":"474896","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"471020","timestamp":"1635737340.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Callas","content":"Isn't damaged cables and bent pins the same thing"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1644114240.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"541438","poster":"mxh778872","content":"no -- Damaged cable\"s\""}],"content":"The answer is wrong.
