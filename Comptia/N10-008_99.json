However, the actual speed of data transfer will be limited by the capabilities of the devices involved. The reason we still choose 1GB speed in the configuration is to ensure that we are not artificially limiting the potential throughput. If the Fast Ethernet switch is ever upgraded to a switch that supports higher speeds, we won’t need to reconfigure the link aggregation. while the Fast Ethernet switch can’t fully utilize the 1GB speed setting, the full duplex setting and the readiness for higher speed devices make this configuration the best choice for maximizing throughput.","timestamp":"1719676500.0","comment_id":"1108967","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Timfdklfajlksdjlakf","timestamp":"1719568140.0","content":"Faster Ethernet = 100, GBit Ethernet = 1000 .. weakest link = 100.

Option D (Full duplex and 100MB speed) would work for link aggregation as well, but it might not provide as much bandwidth as the 1GB speed option (Option B).\n\nThe choice between 100MB and 1GB depends on the capabilities of the devices and the desired level of throughput. If the devices support Gigabit Ethernet (1GB) and you want to maximize throughput, Option B (Full duplex and 1GB speed) would be the better choice.\n\nIf, for some reason, the devices involved only support Fast Ethernet (100MB), then Option D would be a valid choice, but keep in mind that the overall throughput would be limited to 100MB. In modern networks, Gigabit Ethernet is more common, so Option B is often the preferred choice for link aggregation to achieve higher throughput.","timestamp":"1715515080.0"},{"poster":"Zain012","content":"Its gigabit so take full advantage of 1GB duplex \nGpt: D","timestamp":"1714337340.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1056450"},{"timestamp":"1706292240.0","comment_id":"963942","content":"Full duplex and 100MB speed? going from 1gig to 100mbps so duplex mismatch","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1710451020.0","comment_id":"1007877","content":"that's a speed mismatch, not a duplex mismatch.
