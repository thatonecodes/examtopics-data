Statistical.\n\nHere's why:\n\nCategorization into salary bands often involves dividing the data into groups based on statistical measures like percentiles or standard deviations.\n\nStatistical functions like percentile() or quantile() can be used to determine the salary boundaries for each band.\n\nWhile aggregate functions might be used to calculate summary statistics for each band after they are created, they are not the primary tools for creating the bands themselves.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Swift_and_Quick","timestamp":"1729109820.0","content":"C. Logical functions are the most appropriate to use for categorizing data into bands, because they allow the data analyst to apply conditional statements and criteria to the data values. For example, the IF function can be used to assign a band name based on whether a value meets a certain condition or not. Other logical functions that can be useful for categorizing data are AND, OR, NOT, and IFERROR12.","comment_id":"1196808","upvote_count":"2"}],"choices":{"A":"Statistical","C":"Logical","D":"Mathematical","B":"Aggregate"},"exam_id":351,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138881-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-108-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_id":11,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-04-16 22:17:00","answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image35.png"],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"cKGTs5CrxZqZg4ckklVE","question_id":12,"question_text":"Five dogs have the following heights in millimeters:\n\n300, 430, 170, 470, 600\n\nWhich of the following is the standard deviation for the five dogs?","timestamp":"2024-04-16 22:28:00","unix_timestamp":1713299280,"choices":{"B":"154mm","C":"394mm","A":"147mm","D":"21,704mm"},"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"A","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138882-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-109-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"exam_id":351,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1196809","timestamp":"1729110480.0","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","upvote_count":"1","content":"A. 147. \n(300 + 430 + 170 + 470 + 600) / 5 = 394.

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into smaller groups based on common characteristics such as demographics, buying behaviors, or psychographic traits. In this case, the analyst is looking at three characteristics: how recently a customer bought a product, how frequently they bought, and the value of their purchases. By grouping customers based on these characteristics, the company can tailor its promotional campaign to different segments, ensuring that the right message and offer is being communicated to the right people.\n\nCustomer segmentation is considered a descriptive analysis, as it involves looking at the data and grouping it into meaningful categories. This type of analysis is often used in marketing and sales to better understand customer behavior and develop targeted strategies for customer engagement and retention. By using customer segmentation, companies can more effectively allocate their marketing resources and create more personalized experiences for their customers.","timestamp":"1722525960.0","poster":"ronniehaang"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics, such as purchase history, frequency of purchases, and value of purchases. This type of analysis is often referred to as cluster analysis or clustering. Cluster analysis is a method of dividing a data set into groups (i.e., clusters) such that the data points within a cluster are more similar to each other than they are to data points in other clusters. The marketing department's request to look at how recently a customer bought a product, at what frequency, and at what value would be considered cluster analysis because it involves dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics. The other options (prescriptive, trend, and gap) are not related to cluster analysis.","comment_id":"763540","poster":"CineFeX","timestamp":"1719893820.0"}],"question_text":"A company’s marketing department wants to do a promotional campaign next month.

Spearman’s rank correlation.\n\nSpearman’s rank correlation coefficient is a non-parametric measure of statistical dependence between two variables. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function. Unlike the one-sample t-test, two-way ANOVA, and correlation coefficient, Spearman’s rank correlation does not assume a specific distribution for the data and does not require the variables to be normally distributed. Therefore, it is considered a non-parametric test.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729217220.0"}],"choices":{"A":"One-sample t-test","D":"Spearman’s rank correlation","B":"Two-way ANOVA","C":"Correlation coefficient"},"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138886-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-110-discussion/","answers_community":[],"question_id":14,"answer_ET":"D","topic":"1"},{"id":"ucpeppG8S2HLctpRjnL0","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"question_text":"Which of the following best describes a 95% confidence interval?","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":351,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1713301440,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-04-16 23:04:00","discussion":[{"poster":"Swift_and_Quick","timestamp":"1729112640.0","content":"A.
