Check if temporary files are being monitored.\n\nThis step involves investigating whether the file-integrity monitoring tool is configured to monitor temporary files generated by the newly deployed application. Sometimes, legitimate changes, such as those related to temporary files, can trigger false positives in file-integrity monitoring. By checking the configuration and monitoring settings, the analyst can determine if the alerts are indeed related to expected and harmless changes. If temporary files are being monitored, the configuration can be adjusted to exclude them from triggering alerts."},{"timestamp":"1701638700.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe analyst should check if temporary files are being monitored first to respond to the issue. Temporary files are files that are created and used by applications for various purposes, such as storing data temporarily or caching data for faster access. However, temporary files are not meant to be permanent and are usually deleted when they are no longer needed or when the application is closed. Therefore, monitoring temporary files can generate many alerts from the file-integrity monitoring tool that are not relevant or useful for security purposes. The analyst should check if temporary files are being monitored and exclude them from the monitoring scope to reduce the number of alerts and focus on the files that should not change.","poster":"skibby16","comment_id":"1087130"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Check if temporary files are being monitored.\n\nThe first step the security analyst should take is to investigate the cause of the alerts. Checking if temporary files are being monitored is a crucial step in understanding whether the alerts are legitimate or if there is a misconfiguration in the file-integrity monitoring tool. Temporary files can often change and trigger alerts, so it's important to determine whether these files are expected to change as part of normal application behavior.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"32d799a","comment_id":"1086228","timestamp":"1701525060.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nChatGPT:\nWhen a security analyst discovers that the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system is generating an excessive number of alerts from a file-integrity monitoring tool regarding files from a newly deployed application that should not change, the first step to respond to this issue is typically to \"investigate the cause of these alerts\". Here's what the analyst should do as the FIRST step:\n\nIdentify the Alerts: Determine which specific files or directories are generating the alerts. This may involve reviewing the alert logs, SIEM dashboards, or the output from the file-integrity monitoring tool.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kumax","timestamp":"1696724520.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698771120.0","poster":"581777a","comment_id":"1059020","content":"just said C for me... can't be trusted."}],"comment_id":"1027658"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nTemporary files should not be included in monitoring.","timestamp":"1693600980.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"996400"},{"timestamp":"1691299440.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Check if temporary files are being monitored.\n\nBy checking if temporary files are being monitored, the analyst can verify whether the file integrity monitoring tool is generating legitimate alerts or if the alerts are triggered by temporary files that can change as part of the application's normal behavior. Temporary files are often created and modified during the operation of applications, and monitoring them might not be necessary for detecting security incidents.\n\nAfter confirming whether temporary files are indeed being monitored and assessing the significance of the alerts, the analyst can take appropriate action, such as notifying the incident response team or informing the development team if there is a genuine security concern or if the alerts are false positives. Dismissing the alert without proper investigation should not be the first course of action.","comment_id":"973549","poster":"salmonIsDecent"},{"comment_id":"970311","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis question is a weird one.
