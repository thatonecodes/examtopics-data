Load balancing\n\nLoad balancing distributes network traffic across multiple paths, which can include different ISPs, to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, and minimize response time. It can also provide redundancy in case one of the paths fails.\n\nA. Fault tolerance is primarily concerned with ensuring system availability and reliability in the event of failures, but it does not specifically address distributing traffic for performance improvement.\nB. Quality of service (QoS) involves prioritizing certain types of traffic to ensure the performance of critical applications, but it does not inherently involve using multiple ISPs to increase performance.\nD. Port aggregation (or link aggregation) combines multiple network connections into a single logical link to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy, but it typically involves multiple connections to the same network rather than different ISPs.","poster":"freeman016","comment_id":"1235153","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":356,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":690,"unix_timestamp":1643122200,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/70557-exam-n10-007-topic-1-question-919-discussion/","answer":"C","question_text":"Which of the following technologies allows traffic to be sent through two different ISPs to increase performance?","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"B":"Quality of service","C":"Load balancing","A":"Fault tolerance","D":"Port aggregation"},"timestamp":"2022-01-25 15:50:00"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":701,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Comptia","name":"N10-007","id":356},"currentPage":138},"__N_SSP":true}
