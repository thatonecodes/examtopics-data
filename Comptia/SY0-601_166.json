Cross-site request forgery\n\nCross-site request forgery (CSRF) is the most likely cause in this scenario. CSRF occurs when a user is tricked into performing actions on a website without their knowledge or consent.

The user's session was exploited to perform unauthorized actions, such as changing the password, without their explicit consent.

The use of a framework allows an organization to make an objective statement of its current cybersecurity capabilities, identify a target level of capability, and prioritize investments to achieve that target.
