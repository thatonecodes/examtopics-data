While it’s true that SPF isn’t perfect, when you combine it with DKIM and DMARC, it can drastically improve your email security posture. Let’s look at what strong SPF email policies can do.\n\n-Improve deliverability: When you secure your email server with SPF, attackers cannot use your domain to send spam. This helps keep your domain off global blacklists, thereby improving your mail servers overall deliverability.\n-Combat email spoofing: An SPF record helps prevent spoofing and phishing by verifying the IP address of the sender compared to the domain owner.\n-Improves domain reputation: Having SPF email policies in places gives your domain elevated reputation and shows other servers and blacklist sites that you’re committed to email security. This drastically decreases the odds that your outbound emails get falsely flagged as spam, and helps improve your standing inside firewalls and other cybersecurity databases.\n\nhttps://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/what-is-spf/"},{"timestamp":"1634143860.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"romeoserban","content":"An SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record is a DNS TXT record containing a list of the IP addresses that are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain.\nSource: Google","comment_id":"461651"}],"exam_id":356,"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which of the following DNS record types can help limit spam?","unix_timestamp":1628081640,"question_id":616,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/59234-exam-n10-007-topic-1-question-806-discussion/","answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2021-08-04 14:54:00"},{"id":"CVGUwjdxGHf5IWaNsTqt","answer":"B","answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"A user reports a laptop wireless connection is working at the user's desk but not in a recent building addition.
