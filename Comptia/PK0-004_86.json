It is also used when the conflicting party “stands their ground” and refuses to budge on their viewpoint. In these cases, it is simply better for the project manager to accommodate this person since continuing the conflicting conversation would cause more harm than good to the project or other project team members.\n\nC makes no F sense.If this was something like Joe and Ann talked and Ann gave him the place, then yes, but there is no \" negotiating\" on this, so the correct answer is D","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1673112540.0","poster":"kmanb","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis is an example of negotiating. Negotiating is a conflict resolution strategy that involves reaching a mutually acceptable agreement through discussion and compromise. In this case, Ann is aware of the impact that Joe's resentment is having on the project environment, and she decides to give him her office and relocate to a shared work space in order to address the issue. By doing so, she is engaging in negotiation in order to reach a mutually acceptable agreement that resolves the conflict and helps to improve the project environment. Other conflict resolution strategies, such as avoiding, confronting, or smoothing, may also be relevant in certain situations, but negotiating is the most appropriate strategy in this case, as it involves working with Joe to find a solution that addresses his concerns and meets the needs of both parties.","comment_id":"768775","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"avoiding","C":"negotiating","B":"confronting","D":"smoothing"},"question_text":"Joe, a project team member, was hired after a project was already underway, and he is the only team member who does not have an office.

An intranet is a private network that is only accessible to an organization's employees and is used to share information and resources within the organization. An intranet site can be an effective way to provide detailed policy guidance because it allows employees to access the information at their own pace and review it as needed. An intranet site can also be easily updated to reflect changes in policy or to provide additional guidance as needed. Other options, such as a text message, video conference, or email, may be useful for providing quick updates or alerts, but they are not as effective as an intranet site for providing detailed policy guidance.","poster":"kmanb","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1673111040.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"all4one","timestamp":"1666525680.0","comment_id":"702129","comments":[{"content":"Mistake.
