It can support both identity federation (where users from one organization can authenticate and access resources in another organization) and cross-organization authentication. And ABAC controls access based on attributes such as department, role, location (IP address), and other contextual factors. It’s ideal for managing more granular access control policies during the transition period. And NOT Establishing one-way trust from Company B to Company A. A one-way trust allows users from Company B to access Company A’s resources, but not the other way around. Since the requirement is for users from both companies to access each other’s resources, a bi-directional trust would be needed, not just a one-way trust.
