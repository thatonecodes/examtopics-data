Focusing on improving RTO through faster recovery processes is essential for minimizing downtime. Additionally, implementing more frequent backups (updating RPO) can significantly reduce potential data loss in future incidents. The ideal solution involves striking a balance between RTO and RPO that meets the bank's specific requirements for acceptable downtime and data loss tolerance.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CXSSP","comment_id":"1221903","timestamp":"1732940820.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe component that needs to be updated in the Disaster Recovery (DR) plan is:\n\nA. Recovery point objective (RPO).\n\nThe Recovery Point Objective (RPO) defines the maximum amount of data loss that an organization can tolerate in the event of a disaster or system failure. In this scenario, the RPO was set at 7 hours because that was the amount of data lost during the database restore process. To make the DR plan more robust and aligned with business requirements, the RPO should be updated to a lower value, indicating that the organization cannot accept such a significant data loss.","timestamp":"1711097580.0","comment_id":"1013712","upvote_count":"3","poster":"nmap_king_22"}],"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":349,"answer_description":""},{"id":"VZQQOoD98fuzrN3BeEsg","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","exam_id":349,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/121136-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-184-discussion/","answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1695365640,"question_text":"A systems administrator needs to migrate email services to the cloud model that requires the least amount of administrative effort.

With SaaS, the cloud provider takes care of all the infrastructure, maintenance, updates, security, and administrative tasks related to the email service.
