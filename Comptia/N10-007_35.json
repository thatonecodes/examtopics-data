DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bit streams of up to 24 telephone calls simultaneously. The T1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 Mbps. DOCSIS is the standard for a cable modem. DSL is a Digital Subscriber Line which has variable speeds from 256 Kbps and up. POTS is the Plain Old Telephone System, and provides only a single phone connection at a time. Out of these options, the T1 is the BEST to ensure you can reliably provide 23 simultaneous phone connections.","timestamp":"1620138180.0","upvote_count":"7"},{"comment_id":"720344","upvote_count":"1","poster":"emmanuelodenyire","timestamp":"1668675600.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nLet us go with T1, so far, the best transmission"},{"content":"I suggest reading the question a number of times.

A T1 circuit has limitation of 1.5Mbps. 23 concurrent VOIP channels need minimum of 23 x 100Kbps bandwidth which is 2.3Mbps > 1.5! DSL has different upload and download bandwidth and recent DOCSIS Cable Modems are capable of higher upload/download bandwidth.
