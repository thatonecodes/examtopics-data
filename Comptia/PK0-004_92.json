In this case, the network coordinator, who is the functional manager for the network security department, has denied the request to allocate the experienced resource to the project.

The estimated task durations in the WBS are an important input into the project schedule and help the project manager to track progress against the baseline plan. If the estimated task durations in the WBS are incorrect, the project manager may not have an accurate view of the project's progress, which can lead to a failure to predict a decline in metrics.","poster":"MJVIS","comment_id":"821866"}],"question_id":460,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1677363540,"answer_ET":"C"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"name":"PK0-004","id":359,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":588,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":92},"__N_SSP":true}
