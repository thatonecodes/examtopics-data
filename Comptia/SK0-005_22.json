This reduces the amount of storage capacity needed and can improve backup and restore times. In this scenario, since the file server has many of the same files in different directories, deduplication can identify those duplicate files and store only one copy, freeing up space on the server.\n\nOption A, provisioning, refers to the process of allocating and managing storage resources for a particular application or service.\n\nOption B, encryption, is a technique used to protect data by encoding it in such a way that only authorized users can read it.\n\nOption D, partitioning, is the process of dividing a physical storage device into multiple logical units, each of which can be used independently. This can be useful for organizing data or separating operating system files from user files, but it does not address the issue of duplicate files taking up storage space."}],"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An administrator notices that a file server is filling up quickly but has many of the same files in different directories.
