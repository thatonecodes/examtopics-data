It allows security teams to see, monitor, and control all their security systems and services in one place. By combining all security services into a \"single pane of glass,\" security teams are better able to identify and respond to threats quickly and effectively. With this approach, security teams can automate workflows, allowing them to focus on responding to threats instead of managing multiple interfaces. It also provides real-time visibility into security incidents and events, simplifying the process of responding to and resolving them. Single Pane of Glass Orchestration is an invaluable tool for improving the efficiency of an organization's security operations.","comment_id":"1081120","timestamp":"1716767520.0","poster":"[Removed]"}],"comment_id":"1081119","upvote_count":"9"},{"timestamp":"1730820720.0","comment_id":"1206907","upvote_count":"2","poster":"cartman_sc","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIntegrar controles de segurança em um SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) significa consolidar várias ferramentas e funcionalidades de segurança em uma única plataforma centralizada.

Single pane glass\n\nIn this scenario, the security program integrated security controls into a security information and event management (SIEM) system, which allowed the analyst to no longer switch between different tools. This integration created a single, unified interface or “pane of glass” through which the analyst could manage and monitor security events and controls, resulting in a 30% improvement in Mean Time to Response (MTTR). This approach simplifies analyst workflow and provides a centralized view of security data and controls, reducing the time required to respond to security incidents.","timestamp":"1712344620.0","poster":"Jhonys"},{"poster":"fgiroux83","comment_id":"1011565","timestamp":"1710875820.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSingle pane of glass is a mean to achieve a goal which is threat feed combination.","comments":[{"content":"The primary focus of the scenario is on improving the Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR) by integrating security controls into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

Timeline analysis.\n\nExplanation:\nIn digital forensics, timeline analysis is a critical activity that involves reconstructing the sequence of events based on data from various sources, such as system logs, timestamps, file metadata, and other artifacts. The purpose of timeline analysis is to establish when specific actions occurred, often to understand the sequence of events leading up to or following an incident. This process often includes a graphical representation (e.g., a timeline or event chart) that visually displays the chronological order of system events and activities, making it easier to correlate and analyze data"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/151598-exam-cs0-003-topic-1-question-291-discussion/","answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-11-19 04:26:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Timeline analysis","B":"Network mapping","A":"Registry editing","D":"Write blocking"}},{"id":"NDGq42FN4SZ3ugGzzOb6","question_id":215,"exam_id":347,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/151600-exam-cs0-003-topic-1-question-292-discussion/","choices":{"C":"To reveal what the team needs to prioritize","B":"To describe how incidents were resolved","A":"To identify the personal performance of each analyst","D":"To expose which tools should be used"},"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1731986820,"timestamp":"2024-11-19 04:27:00","answer_ET":"C","question_text":"Which of the following best describes the importance of KPIs in an incident response exercise?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is C.
