MOUs are usually intended to be relatively informal and not to act as binding contracts. MOUs almost always have clauses stating that the parties shall respect confidentiality, however.\n\nMemorandum of agreement (MOA)—A formal agreement (or contract) that contains specific obligations rather than a broad understanding. If one party fails to fulfill its obligations, the other party will be able to seek redress under the terms of the agreement through the courts.\n\nNote: Contract law is complex. It is possible for a document described as an \"MOU\" in a heading to create legally enforceable terms if the wording of the document establishes some sort of obligation to act, especially if it is in return for payment. The name of the agreement is not relevant—the terms are.\n\nReference: COM501B","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1622116560.0","comment_id":"367881"}],"answer":"C","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/53649-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-1039-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following agreement types is a non-contractual agreement between two or more parties and outlines each party's requirements and responsibilities?","answer_images":[],"exam_id":366,"unix_timestamp":1622116560,"question_id":41,"timestamp":"2021-05-27 13:56:00","question_images":[]},{"id":"2G4gD5UE7F96t1wp6t03","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2019-10-25 20:27:00","discussion":[{"content":"This one is easy.
