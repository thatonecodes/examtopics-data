This attack can affect a large number of users if the DNS server is compromised or if a cache poisoning attack is successful. Since the user has used the shortcut many times before, and it suddenly started showing discrepancies, it's likely that the DNS cache was recently poisoned, redirecting the user to a different, malicious website.","timestamp":"1742493180.0","comment_id":"1401243","poster":"fc040c7","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","question_id":107,"exam_id":358,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer":"C"},{"id":"NMtzvZwH1D9FRDVHMcME","exam_id":358,"isMC":true,"question_id":108,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1738600980,"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"A":"Access, distribution, and core","D":"Access, core, and root","C":"Core, spine, and leaf","B":"Core, root, and distribution"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155885-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-196-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2025-02-03 17:43:00","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is the correct order of components in a bottom-up approach for the three-tier hierarchical model?","answer":"A","discussion":[{"poster":"notOSI","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA bottom-up approach starts from the most basic level and builds upwards.
