As a sample size grows, its mean gets closer to the average of the whole population.\n\nThe law of large numbers states that as the size of a sample increases, the sample mean (average) will tend to get closer to the population mean. This means that larger samples are more likely to provide a more accurate estimate of the population parameter, such as the mean. Therefore, option B best describes the law of large numbers."}],"unix_timestamp":1713307980,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138915-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-136-discussion/","exam_id":351,"timestamp":"2024-04-17 00:53:00","answers_community":[]},{"id":"GKTOfB2FjM8hWWwZAZea","answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-04-17 00:55:00","choices":{"B":"To use descriptive statistics to determine observations","A":"To analyze a connection of data points or pathways","D":"To track measurements against defined goals","C":"To provide a comparison of data over time"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1196868","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","timestamp":"1729119300.0","content":"D.
