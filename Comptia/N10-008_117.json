Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)\n\nTo protect against power spikes and ensure continuity of operations during power outages, a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) is the best solution. A UPS provides a temporary power source during electrical failures, allowing systems to shut down gracefully or continue operating for a short duration until power is restored or a generator takes over.\n\nWhile a generator (option A) is a solution for longer-term power outages, a UPS is typically used for short-term disruptions and provides immediate protection against power spikes and brief outages.\n\nTherefore, the best recommendation for the network administrator is D. Uninterruptible power supply (UPS).","timestamp":"1701904320.0","poster":"salah112","comment_id":"1089833","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1698951600.0","poster":"surfuganda","comment_id":"1060817","content":"Selected Answer: D\nUninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) typically have \"line conditioning\" capabilities that can alleviate troublesome surges (spikes) and drops in voltage.","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"aM6PurUFASW0pGHRE26p","exam_id":357,"answers_community":["CD (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-12-07 00:13:00","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1701904380,"question_text":"Which of the following OSI model layers are responsible for handling packets from the sources to the destination and checking for errors?

RFID badge readers\n\nAn Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) in a secure facility typically houses networking equipment and connections. In this context, security measures are likely to involve access control to the networking infrastructure. RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) badge readers are commonly used for secure access control in facilities. These readers can authenticate individuals based on RFID badges or cards, providing a secure means of access to network equipment.\n\nWhile options A (Full-size body scanners) and B (Iris scanner) are more associated with physical security measures for access to the facility, option D (Smart deadbolt) is related to securing physical doors and may not be directly tied to securing the network infrastructure in the IDF.\n\nTherefore, the most relevant security measure for an IDF installation in a secure facility is likely to be C.
