Bandwidth refers to the maximum data transfer rate of a network, which determines how much data can be transferred per unit of time. If the bandwidth is insufficient to handle the amount of data required for the video stream, it can cause buffering, delays, or even dropped frames. \nHowever, pixelated images are specifically caused by jitter, which is the variation in the delay of data packets. This variation can disrupt the smooth playback of the video, causing the image to appear pixelated or jerky.\nJitter occurs when there is a time delay during data packet transmission over a network connection.
