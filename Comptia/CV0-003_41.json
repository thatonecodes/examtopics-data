The instance is likely starting, attempting to initialize, encountering a problem (hence BUSY), and then stopping. This cycle repeats. The most likely cause is a misconfiguration within the application itself, either in the installation package or a configuration file.\n\nService healing is a feature that automatically restarts failed services. While it might mask the symptom temporarily, it doesn't fix the cause of the repeated crashes. The application is already restarting (the STARTED part of the loop), so service healing is already happening.

However, one common approach to address this issue and improve stability is to configure \"service healing.\"\n\nService healing is a feature in cloud environments that automatically detects and recovers from failures or issues with instances. It can involve actions like restarting the instance or replacing it with a new one when a failure is detected. By configuring service healing, you enable the cloud infrastructure to take corrective actions when it detects these kinds of issues, such as the repeated cycling of a VM instance.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nC. Configure service healing.\n\nBy configuring service healing, you allow the cloud environment to automatically handle the instance's state and attempt to recover it when it enters an undesirable state, improving overall system stability.","poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1694668140.0","comment_id":"1007204"},{"comment_id":"992427","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhis behavior suggests that there might be an issue with the application itself, its configuration, or its deployment package.

Invalid API token.\n\nIf a developer was able to access a public cloud API and suddenly loses access, one common reason for this is an invalid API token. API tokens often have a limited duration of validity, and if the token expires or becomes invalid for some reason, the developer won't be able to access the API anymore.\n\nWhile the other options (rate limiting, depleted network bandwidth, and invalid API requests) are also potential causes of API access issues, the sudden loss of access in this scenario is more likely related to an authentication issue, such as an expired or invalid API token.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1009494","timestamp":"1694915040.0","poster":"Pongsathorn"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB all the way","comment_id":"798123","timestamp":"1675525680.0","poster":"AustinKelleyNet","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"797205","timestamp":"1675441920.0","poster":"ramrod1738","upvote_count":"1","content":"B. Invalid API token.\n\nAn API token is typically used to authenticate the client making API requests to the cloud API. If the token becomes invalid, either because it has expired or because it has been revoked, the client will no longer be able to access the API. This can result in the developer being unable to access the API deployment, even if it was working previously.\n\nAPI provider rate limiting, depleted network bandwidth, and invalid API request can also cause issues with accessing an API deployment, but are less likely to be the cause if the API was working previously and suddenly stopped.
