The qualitative approach seeks out people's opinions of which risk factors are significant. Assets and risks may be placed in simple categories. For example, assets could be categorized as Irreplaceable, High Value, Medium Value, and Low Value; risks could be categorized as one-off or recurring and as Critical, High, Medium, and Low probability.\n\nAnother simple approach is the \"Traffic Light\" impact grid.
