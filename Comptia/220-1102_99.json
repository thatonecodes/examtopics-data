Test the computer's memory.\n\nIf File Explorer continues to crash after running Windows Update, CHKDSK, SFC /scannow, and clearing File Explorer history, the technician should consider testing the computer's memory next. Memory issues can sometimes lead to application crashes, including File Explorer. Running memory diagnostics can help identify if there are any issues with the RAM modules, which could be contributing to the problem. If memory tests reveal no issues, further troubleshooting may be needed, but this step is a logical next step in diagnosing the problem.","poster":"Duke_CT"}],"exam_id":340,"question_id":491,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-05-13 04:14:00","choices":{"D":"Repartition the boot drive.","C":"Test the computer's memory.","B":"Reimage the computer and ask the user to test.","A":"Roll back the most recent set of Windows updates."},"question_text":"A user's File Explorer keeps crashing.

The 802.11n specification offers higher data rates and improved reliability compared to older standards like 802.11g. By upgrading to 802.11n, the network can handle more simultaneous connections and provide better performance, which would alleviate the degraded network service caused by the higher-than-anticipated traffic.
