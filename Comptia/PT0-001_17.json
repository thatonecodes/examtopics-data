A salt is a set of random data such as two additional characters. Password salting adds these additional characters to a password before hashing it. These additional characters add complexity to the password, and also result in a different hash than the system would create using the original password. This causes password attacks that compare hashes to fail."},{"content":"Agree with C, going back to Sec+ this should be familiar.","poster":"hellobob","timestamp":"1622404080.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"370428"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":84,"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1620005340,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/rainbow-table","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/51626-exam-pt0-001-topic-1-question-174-discussion/","exam_id":361,"question_text":"Which of the following BEST protects against a rainbow table attack?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2021-05-03 03:29:00","choices":{"D":"Hardened OS configurations","B":"Symmetric encryption","A":"Increased password complexity","C":"Cryptographic salting"}},{"id":"VedmJgWxoVhzYlsdsCxD","exam_id":361,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/52724-exam-pt0-001-topic-1-question-175-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_text":"At the information gathering stage, a penetration tester is trying to passively identify the technology running on a client's website.
