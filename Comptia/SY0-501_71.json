There are several methods that can be used to accomplish PSK.\nWi-Fi Protected Access Pre-Shared Key (WPA-PSK) is a security mechanism used to authenticate and validate users on a wireless LAN (WLAN) or Wi-Fi connection. It is a variation of the WPA security protocol. WPA-PSK is also known as WPA2-PSK or WPA Personal.\nWPA-PSK works by configuring a WLAN passphrase or password of eight to 63 characters. Based on the password, access point (router) and connecting node credentials, a 256-character key is generated, shared and used by both devices for network traffic encryption and decryption. A connected user that provides correct credentials receives WLAN access. If implemented with Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), WPA-PSK dynamically generates a 128-bit encryption key for each packet. Additionally, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) may be used instead of TKIP. WPA-PSK does not require an authentication server and manual user configuration. Thus, it is considered simpler and leaner than WPA Enterprise, a WPA variant."},{"poster":"Jenkins3mol","content":"what does PSK stand for...","comment_id":"9909","timestamp":"1567774320.0","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"comment_id":"11412","upvote_count":"6","poster":"Asmin","content":"Pre-shared key","timestamp":"1568714220.0"},{"comment_id":"257899","poster":"who__cares123456789___","upvote_count":"1","content":"NO IT ISNT! CAPTIVE PORTAL WILL STOP YOU FROM RECONNECTING IN THE BACKGROUND WOULD IT NOT? would you not have to go back to the LOGIN page and check a box or enter a PSK? Also, PEAP is similar in design to EAP-TTLS, requiring only a server-side PKI certificate to create a secure TLS tunnel to protect user authentication, and uses server-side public key certificates to authenticate the server. It then creates an encrypted TLS tunnel between the client and the authentication server. In most configurations, the keys for this encryption are transported using the server's public key. The ensuing exchange of authentication information inside the tunnel to authenticate the client is then encrypted and user credentials are safe from eavesdropping.
