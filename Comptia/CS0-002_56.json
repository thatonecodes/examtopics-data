Dynamic analysis\nDynamic analysis involves assessing an application while it's running or in a runtime environment. It typically includes various testing techniques like penetration testing, automated scanning, and real-time monitoring of the application to identify vulnerabilities and security issues. This approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of the application's security posture, simulating real-world attack scenarios and finding issues that might not be apparent in static analysis alone.","poster":"kumax","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"JakeH","content":"On exam","timestamp":"1697169540.0","comment_id":"1042253","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1687859460.0","comment_id":"935200","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nRegression testing is a software testing practice that ensures an application still functions as expected after any code changes, updates, or improvements.
