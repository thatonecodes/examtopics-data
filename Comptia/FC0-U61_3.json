Assembly language\nExplanation:\nAssembly language is the closest to machine code because it is a low-level programming language that directly corresponds to a computer's instruction set architecture (ISA). It uses mnemonics (e.g., MOV, ADD, SUB) to represent machine instructions, making it more readable than binary code while still being very close to hardware operations.\n\nWhy Not the Other Options?\nA. Query language – Used for managing databases (e.g., SQL), not for interacting with hardware at a low level.\nB. Scripting language – High-level and interpreted (e.g., Python, Bash); far from machine code.\nC. Markup language – Used for structuring documents (e.g., HTML, XML); not a programming language.\nConclusion:\nAssembly language is the closest to machine code because it provides a direct way to control the CPU with minimal abstraction.","timestamp":"1739377320.0","comment_id":"1355670","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"473490","poster":"Dion79","timestamp":"1730901960.0","content":"Assembly language - represents machine code in human-readable text. An assembly language is typically specific to a particular hardware architecture. \n\nCode written in a query language, such as Structured Query Language (SQL), is designed to retrieve specific records from a dataset. The code does not need to be compiled.\n\nmarkup language is not a programming language but a means of making data in a document accessible to a program. A markup language, such as the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or eXtensible Markup Language (XML), defines a series of nested tags that describe the structure and/or meaning of the tag contents."}],"unix_timestamp":1636207560},{"id":"biFlUYFE3GY8cmQggW4W","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1739377620,"answer":"A","topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-02-12 17:27:00","question_text":"Employee information is stored in a database.
