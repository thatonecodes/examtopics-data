Its default action is to terminate the process immediately and unconditionally, without giving the process an opportunity to perform any cleanup. Because of its extreme nature, it should be used with caution, and should only be used as a last resort when other signals or methods have failed to terminate a process.\n\nIn Unix-like operating systems, SIGTERM (signal termination) is a signal that is typically sent to a process in order to request that it terminate gracefully.
