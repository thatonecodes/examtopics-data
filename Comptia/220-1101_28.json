Application virtualization\n\nIn this scenario, where the technician wants to deploy an .msi package to a corporate network without affecting other legacy applications on end users' computers, the most appropriate option is \"Application virtualization.\"\n\nApplication virtualization allows you to run applications in isolated environments, ensuring that they do not interfere with other applications or the underlying operating system. It separates the application from the local system, so it doesn't leave behind files or registry changes that can impact other software. This approach is often used in enterprise environments to maintain compatibility and minimize conflicts between different applications.\n\nThe other options, such as virtual network, cross-platform virtualization, virtual sandbox, and virtual desktop, are not directly related to isolating and deploying individual applications while ensuring they do not affect other applications on users' computers."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nApplication virtualization is the process of encapsulating an application from the underlying operating system. This allows the application to run on a machine without directly modifying the system or interfering with other software. By virtualizing the application, you can ensure that it behaves in an isolated environment, minimizing the risk of conflicts with legacy applications on the end user's computer.","poster":"4cb90d5","timestamp":"1743296040.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1411907"},{"comment_id":"1363244","poster":"JonHin","content":"B\nApplication virtualization is a technique that allows an application to run on a computer without being installed or affecting other applications on the system.
