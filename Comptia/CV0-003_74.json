Serverless computing allows developers to focus on writing code and organizations to focus on business.**\n\nThis definition best explains how serverless computing differs from using virtual machines (VMs). In serverless computing, developers don't need to manage or provision servers or VMs. Instead, they can focus solely on writing the application code, and the cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure, including server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance. This allows organizations to concentrate on their core business logic rather than infrastructure management, which is typically required when using VMs. Serverless computing abstracts away the concept of servers or VMs, making it a more abstract and code-centric approach to cloud computing.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1694942340.0"},{"timestamp":"1690899360.0","comment_id":"969134","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCompute may refer to one of two things: IaaS virtual machines, or so-called\nserverless computing.\nIaaS Compute may refer to an IaaS service that lets you provision virtual machines,\nstorage, and networking resources in the cloud.\nServerless/FaaS Compute can also refer to what the marketers call serverless computing\nand what the technophiles call function-as-a-service (FaaS).
