For instance they make a point to show HTTP server is disabled on some devices. Just because traffic on port 80 is occurring, doesn't mean it's running any cleartext services itself. That's why I have no disable unneeded services for anything.\n\nI enabled port security for Switch A because it had unused ports that were not disabled.
