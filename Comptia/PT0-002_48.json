This technique involves pretending to be a high-ranking executive (e.g., CEO, CFO) to manipulate employees into performing actions such as installing remote access software or providing sensitive information. This is highly likely to lead to a remote session if employees are convinced of the impersonation.\n\n • A. SMS: This technique involves sending text messages to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. While effective, it does not directly indicate the creation of a remote session.\n • B. Dumpster: This involves searching through physical trash to find sensitive information. Although it can provide useful information, it does not directly lead to establishing a remote session.\n • D. BeEF: This involves exploiting browser vulnerabilities to gain remote access. While this can be part of a social engineering attack, it is more technical and typically involves exploiting a browser rather than relying on social manipulation alone.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1720204140.0","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000"},{"comment_id":"1179497","timestamp":"1711045680.0","poster":"deeden","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThere's a lot of assumptions in this question, not much context.
