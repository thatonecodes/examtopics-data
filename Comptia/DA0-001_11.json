Discrete values are obtained by counting.\n\nDiscrete values are distinct and separate, typically obtained by counting individual items or occurrences. For example, the number of students in a classroom or the number of cars in a parking lot are discrete values.\n\nContinuous values, on the other hand, are not restricted by separation and can take on any value within a given range. They are often associated with measurements and can have an infinite number of possible values within a range.
