SNMP v3 replaces the simple password sharing (as clear text) in SNMP v2 with a much more secure encoded security parameters.\n\nHTTPS is HTTP with encryption and verification. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses, and to digitally sign those requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP.\n\nTelnet transfers the data in simple plain text. On other hand SSH uses Encrypted format to send data and also uses a secure channel. As SSH is more secure so it uses public key encryption for authentication.","comment_id":"716817"},{"poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","comment_id":"961868","upvote_count":"7","comments":[{"poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","content":"I would also put G in there","comments":[{"poster":"sarah2023","comment_id":"989502","timestamp":"1692912000.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"TLS is not insecure, it is in fact an upgraded version of SSL.
