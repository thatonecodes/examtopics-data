Tell the learners to give other learners a chance.\n\nIf a few aggressive learners are dominating the question and answer sessions during a training class, the first course of action for the instructor should be to address the issue directly with the learners. The instructor should politely ask the dominant learners to give others a chance to speak and participate in the discussion. This can help to ensure that all learners have an opportunity to ask questions and contribute to the discussion. Talking to the learners on break and reprimanding them, not making eye contact with these learners, or ignoring the learners are not effective solutions to the problem and may create a negative learning environment.","poster":"JimGrayham","timestamp":"1725913320.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"unix_timestamp":1678400520},{"id":"Xk8UtYV93sJKJWgWeqXv","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"4","answer_ET":"B","choices":{"D":"Contact the book author requesting changes to the book","B":"Search the publishers’ website for current errata","C":"Postpone the session","A":"Request the client to use a known book"},"unix_timestamp":1678403760,"exam_id":369,"discussion":[{"poster":"JimGrayham","timestamp":"1725916560.0","comment_id":"834507","content":"B. Search the publishers’ website for current errata.\n\nPrior to a training session that will utilize a book that the trainer has not used in the past, the trainer should search the publisher's website for any current errata (corrections or updates) to the book. This is important to ensure that the trainer is using the most up-to-date and accurate information when conducting the training session. It is also important to ensure that the trainer is providing accurate information to the learners.\n\nRequesting the client to use a known book or contacting the book author requesting changes to the book are not practical solutions, as the client may have already purchased the book and may not be able to change it, and the book author may not be able to make changes to the book in time for the training session.\n\nPostponing the session is also not an ideal solution, as it may inconvenience the learners and delay the training process.

Analogies are used when someone needs an elaboration of an idea that they're unfamiliar with, and you need to find a way for them to be able to visualize the topic, i.e. when explaining things like explaining \"sharding\" in data engineering. People don't understand how resharding works, but if you explain it's like having a 10 lane highway that can't accommodate rush hour traffic, so the city opens up additional HOV lanes to accommodate for more traffic. Sharding is similar- when you want to increase the flow of data in streams, you use what's called sharding to add more streams... very much like how the city opens HOV traffic lanes in the direction of rush hour traffic to keep the traffic moving.
