The device name for the USB drive is /dev/sdb, and since it has only one partition, the partition number is 1. Therefore, we need to mount /dev/sdb1 to the desired mount point, which is /media/usb. The correct command for this would be \"mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\". Option B is incorrect because the partition number is 1, not 0. Option C is incorrect because we need to specify the partition (/dev/sdb1) and not just the device (/dev/sdb).
