The sticky bit restricts deletion or renaming of files within the directory to the file owners, the directory owner, or the root user. This means even if a user has write permission to the directory, they cannot delete or rename files owned by others.\n\nSetgid and Permissions: Option C sets the setgid bit and gives the group read, write, and execute permissions. The setgid bit causes new files and directories created in the directory to inherit the group ownership of the directory, but it does not prevent file deletion or modification by non-owners. The permissions 770 give the owner and the group full permissions (read, write, execute), but they do not prevent file deletion or modification by non-owners who are in the group.\n\nTherefore, to specifically prevent deletion or modification of files from non-owners, option A is the better choice."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708118820.0","poster":"Alizadeh","comment_id":"982938","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is C. chmod 2770 /project/access2all."},{"timestamp":"1691880540.0","comment_id":"806957","poster":"linux_admin","comments":[{"comment_id":"904889","timestamp":"1700749560.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I meant to say, the sticky bit denies to other users the right to delete or RENAME a file. the question states \"MODIFY and delete\" for non-ownerS.

First, the question does not ask for files with \"log\" in the name (it doesn't even ask for log files - it says \"related files\"). Second, some of the files in /var/log do not have log or .log anywhere in the filename (e.g. messages, secure, spooler, etc.) and would be missed using your syntax. Third, \".log[1-6]$\", with a leading dot (.), is not even an option to select.
