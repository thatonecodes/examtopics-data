Configure the devices to use an always-on IPSec VPN, this requires devices to connect back to corporate network in order to connect anywhere else, establishing a private tunnel in.\nE. Restrict application permissions to establish only HTTPS connections outside of the enterprise boundary , forcing HTTPS-only connections out allows you to place a listener proxy in the middle of the connection. Allow other ports in or out of the enterprise would make monitoring more difficult. Requiring HTTPS will allow you to inspect and log all traffic from mobile devices.","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"296141","content":"I thought the reason for E is: if somebody wants to use his/her own phone to contact an outside website that uses HTTPS, that's fine.

The question (super poorly phrased) is asking for the next step in the cloud migration plan. The next logical step in the given plan to migrate from on-prem to cloud is to implement a CASB. This will prevent certain types of DOS attacks, prevent certain types of file transfers, and add a layer of credential security to prevent a malicious outsider from hacking into your cloud and disabling your company critical applications.

They just moved their services to the cloud, it wouldn’t make sense to move the, back. Adding another cloud vendor means likelihood of an outage is very low.

Multicloud\nIn true CompTIA fashion, this is an unbelievably poorly phrased question and none of the answers are like... great. For an HA cloud solution you don't need multicloud OR hybrid you just set up redundancies across regions (all cloud providers now offer this) which can give you a sub-second RTO/RPO.\nI think that using a hybrid cloud will make your services less available, not more. You've just gone to all the effort to get out of the data center because your reliability was bad, so the solution is to pull part of your services back into the data center you just moved out of? No way.
