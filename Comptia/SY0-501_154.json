Preventative access controls keep a user from performing some activity or function. Preventative controls differ from deterrent controls in that the control is not optional and cannot (easily) be bypassed. Deterrent controls work on the theory that it is easier to obey the control\n\nrather than to risk the consequences of bypassing the control. In other words, the power for action resides with the user (or the attacker). Preventative controls place the power of action with the system, obeying the control is not optional. The only way to bypass the control is to find a flaw in the control-s implementation.\nSource: https://www.briefmenow.org/isaca/cisa-part-which-of-the-following-is-not-an-example-of-preventive-control/","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"297473","timestamp":"1614093120.0","content":"Provided answer is correct.
