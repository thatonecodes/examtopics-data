Nonrepudiation is specifically talking about the proof that someone has done something on the system. Taking a hash of the original disk is proof that it represents the state of the data when the investigation began. It’s not a signature in the sense of an encryption cert or something like that, but it is definitely a method of ensuring that the data on the drive represents the user’s changes, vice those of the investigator or someone else after the fact.

While a hash function like C. would grant integrity, it only partially grants non-repudiation.

They cannot deny that they sent the data because their digital signature was on the transmission.)

In a forensics investigation, it is crucial to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the evidence collected, ensuring that it cannot be tampered with or altered.\n\nWhen a SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) signature is generated for a drive image, it produces a unique and fixed-size alphanumeric hash value that represents the content of the entire drive image.

Hashing speaks to integrity not non-repudiation. Non-repudiation means someone cannot say they didn't do something. Think of this situation. A harddrive was collected as part of evidence and a hash was taken at collection. The drive was then accessed and altered. The hash of the altered drive is compared against the initial hash and obviously they would be different. In this case the integrity of the evidence has been compromised but anyone can say they did not do it. However, if you accessed the drive and signed for it, it will be pretty difficult to say you didn't access it. With that it must be clearer to see that keeping a log of who comes in contact with the evidence speaks more to non-repudiation than hashing does.
