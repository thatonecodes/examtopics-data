The only people who don’t agree with this are the spammers themselves. One of the tricks that spammers use is to spoof (or fake) the domain name they are sending emails from. DNS, through the use of TXT records, can help email servers determine if incoming messages are from a trusted source rather than a spoofed one.\nThree standards used to battle email spam are Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain\nKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,\nand Conformance (DMARC). Each one can be used in a DNS TXT record to help thwart\nmalicious users from using a company’s domain name to send unauthorized emails.","timestamp":"1667315040.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"PythonWolf","timestamp":"1665920280.0","content":"it says 'REMOVE and prevent any further emails'.

Email filtering is any technique used to prevent a user from being overwhelmed with spam or junk email. Spam can be blocked from reaching an organization using a mail gateway to filter messages. Anti-spam filtering needs to balance blocking illegitimate traffic with permitting legitimate messages. Anti-spam techniques can also use lists of known spam servers by establishing a blocklist. If an allow list is used, only a small number of senders could send emails to the user. The technician should not create a domain-based email filter since the spammers are using Yahoo, Gmail, and Hotmail accounts to send the spam. If a domain-based email filter is created, it will block emails from all users on those email providers and prevent legitimate emails from being received.","comment_id":"624941","comments":[{"comment_id":"647382","poster":"Elicious","timestamp":"1660604460.0","content":"It's not the same question.
