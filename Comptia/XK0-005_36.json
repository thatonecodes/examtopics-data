Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes is an open-source platform designed for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. It provides:\n\n Portability: Kubernetes can run on various environments, including on-premises, public cloud, and hybrid cloud.\n High Availability: Kubernetes supports self-healing capabilities, automatic restarts, and load balancing.\n Scalability: Kubernetes can scale applications automatically based on demand.\n\nWhile Docker provides containerization, Kubernetes is specifically designed to manage containerized applications at scale and across multiple hosts, making it the best choice for the specified requirements.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Kubernetes.","poster":"Aj26a","comment_id":"1228483","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"1172983","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nKubernetes is a container orchestration platform that provides features such as automatic scaling, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities. It allows for the management of containerized applications across multiple hosts, making it suitable for environments requiring high availability and scalability.\nDocker is a containerization platform that allows you to package and distribute applications and their dependencies in containers. While Docker is commonly used for containerization, it lacks built-in orchestration features like those provided by Kubernetes.\nOn-premises systems and cloud-based systems refer to infrastructure deployment models rather than containerization technologies. They can be used in conjunction with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.","timestamp":"1710374940.0","poster":"Monty97"},{"timestamp":"1709820420.0","poster":"imnewtothis","content":"Selected Answer: D\nKubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that provides features such as portability, high availability, and scalability in production environments. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, allowing for efficient resource utilization and seamless scaling. Kubernetes can run on both on-premises systems and cloud-based systems, providing flexibility in deployment options. While Docker is a popular containerization platform, Kubernetes extends its capabilities by providing advanced orchestration features suitable for production environments. On-premises and cloud-based systems are infrastructure choices, whereas Kubernetes is a platform for managing containerized applications regardless of the underlying infrastructure.","comment_id":"1168066","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1701982440.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"DRVision","comment_id":"1090599","content":"kubernetes can be used to enhance docker or cloud based services but cannot be used as a stand alone deployment, and cloud based services are not as portable as containers, i.e.docker"}],"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\n\"creating this type of deployment\" , kubernetes is used for container orchestration","comment_id":"1090597","timestamp":"1701982260.0","poster":"DRVision"},{"poster":"nixonbii","comment_id":"819755","content":"Do not understand the context of this question. Both MS Azure and AWS offer Kubernetes based container services.
