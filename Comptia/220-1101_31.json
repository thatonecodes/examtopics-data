A cable tester can be used to check the continuity and quality of a cable, and a crimper can be used to attach RJ45 connectors to the ends of a cable. An optical fiber tester is a tool that can be used to test\n \nfiber optic cables, which are not RJ45 cables. Scissors are not a tool for replacing cables, but for cutting them.
