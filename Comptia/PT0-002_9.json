You can use WMIC.exe to perform tasks such as listing processes, services, users, drives, network settings, and more. You can also use WMIC.exe to execute methods, create or delete instances, and modify properties of WMI classes. WMIC.exe is compatible with existing shells and utility commands and can be used by local system administrators.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic","comment_id":"1099906","timestamp":"1702920180.0","poster":"PhillyCheese","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1099900","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) allows scripting languages (such as VBScript or Windows PowerShell) to manage Microsoft Windows personal computers and servers, both locally and remotely.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation","timestamp":"1702919760.0","poster":"PhillyCheese","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1090432","poster":"Caoilfhion","timestamp":"1701965280.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Don't overthink the question: it's not asking about how to smuggle the binary on the system, how to hide it, or even how to create a shell with it.

Doesn't matter (essentially) what is smuggled on there, it's asking how run it. In this case, Powershell is the only thing listed that will start anything... I can only stretch for ProcMon if there's a way to get ProcMon to call wmic.exe that I'm not familiar with (which is possible, I'm not sure).
