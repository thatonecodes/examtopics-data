The security company Mandiant's APT1 report into Chinese cyber espionage units (https://fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf) was hugely influential in shaping the language and understanding of modern cyber-attack lifecycles. The term Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) was coined to understand the behavior underpinning modern types of cyber adversaries. Rather than think in terms of systems being infected with a virus or rootkit, an APT refers to the ongoing ability of an adversary to compromise network security (to obtain and maintain access) using a variety of tools and techniques.\n\nReference: COM501B\nSecurity+ Review Guide Fourth Edition.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1622511480.0","comment_id":"371481"},{"comment_id":"359156","timestamp":"1621210080.0","poster":"Pepsi","content":"Also the fact that the threat actor has been active for \"several years\" suggests persistent.","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"why is it not c?","timestamp":"1620334620.0","poster":"Kdhubb","comments":[{"timestamp":"1620789540.0","poster":"Heymannicerouter","comment_id":"355210","content":"\"high levels of funding, motivation, and sophistication\" = APT","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1621406400.0","comment_id":"361093","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Texrax","content":"Think about if \"high levels of funding, motivation, and sophistication\" is a better description of a national cyber intelligence agency or of organized credit card criminals."}],"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"351408"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/52022-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-1002-discussion/","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-05-06 22:57:00","question_id":6,"choices":{"C":"Organized crime","A":"Advanced persistent threat","B":"Hacktivist","D":"Insider"},"answer":"A","answer_description":""},{"id":"TqqYTF5rP1ZqxBkzStAz","exam_id":366,"timestamp":"2021-05-12 05:22:00","question_id":7,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/52484-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-1003-discussion/","question_text":"Given the following output:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich of the following BEST describes the scanned environment?","answer_ET":"B","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03794/0052600001.png"],"answer":"B","choices":{"A":"A host was identified as a web server that is hosting multiple domains","B":"A host was scanned, and web-based vulnerabilities were found","D":"A web shell was planted in company.com's content management system","C":"A connection was established to a domain, and several redirect connections were identified"},"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1620789720,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","content":"This is a security exam so you have to think in terms of security and having multiple domains using port 80 is not secure and is considered a vulnerability.
