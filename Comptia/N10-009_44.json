Integrity\n\nA hash provides integrity by generating a fixed-length unique representation (hash value) of data. If the data is altered, even slightly, the hash value will change, allowing verification that the data has not been tampered with. Hashes do not provide confidentiality, non-repudiation, or availability.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1734560520.0","comment_id":"1328746"},{"comment_id":"1327374","timestamp":"1734354360.0","poster":"02fd592","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
