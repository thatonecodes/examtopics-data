We have to assume a few things that are not clear. First it says the user returned from vacation, but does not say they took their laptop with them. Only based on answers in C and D can we assume the user had their laptop with them to which I say, was it really a vacation? Captive portal is possible but so is Airplane mode. User could have been using the laptop and connected to the wifi provided on the plane and went through a captive portal. But the last thing the user may have done was placed the laptop in airplane mode before they landed. Then again, you do have to stow away laptops during landing so I am not sure that Airplane mode may have been necessary.

The user connected to a captive portal while traveling is the most likely cause of this issue. A captive portal is a webpage that is presented to the user before they can access the internet. It is often used by hotels, airports, and other public Wi-Fi networks to authenticate users and accept terms and conditions. Connecting to a captive portal can cause the user's network settings to change, making it difficult to connect to the corporate network when they return. This would explain why the user is able to log in to Windows but is unable to access any internal or external websites.","comment_id":"777939","timestamp":"1673887080.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"exam_id":340,"timestamp":"2023-01-16 17:38:00","answer":"D"},{"id":"e0eaw3FUdTTmDb1UFD9j","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-09-13 21:49:00","answer_ET":"BDG","question_text":"Which of the following file extensions are commonly used to install applications on a macOS machine?
