It would be impossible to access a mail server as a client if the IP is kicking back to a private address.","poster":"CTK246"},{"content":"This supports the answer being 'D'.\n\nWhy would you have more than one MX record? A common worry with using SMTP for email delivery is what happens in the event the SMTP server is offline and therefor unavailable to receive email. The typical response to this is to set up a backup path and to use a secondary server to accept and queue the messages, delivering them when the primary server returns.\n\nThis is configured by creating a secondary MX record pointing to the backup SMTP server and assigning it a lower priority. The idea is that the primary server should receive the email if available and only if this server is off line should the secondary one be used.\nWhy is it not a good idea to use secondary MX records?\n\nUnfortunately spamming servers make use of this configuration and target the secondary MX record even when the primary is available, turning them into what we refer to as spam “honeypots”. They do this as secondary records usually point to email servers that deploy little or no security checks such as those you’d find at some ISP’s for example. This encourages the spamming servers to keep sending even more as they can see it’s being accepted and so the vicious circle continues.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Not_My_Name","comment_id":"193806","comments":[{"comment_id":"193807","poster":"Not_My_Name","upvote_count":"3","content":"Found at:\n\nhttps://blog.zensoftware.co.uk/2012/07/02/why-we-tend-to-recommend-not-having-a-secondary-mx-these-days/","timestamp":"1601938440.0"},{"timestamp":"1666066260.0","poster":"gonation","upvote_count":"1","content":"You forget the MX record for the secondary is resolving to a private unroutable IP address, instead of a public address.
