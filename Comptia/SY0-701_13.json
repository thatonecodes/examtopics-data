Salting\n\nExplanation:\nSalting involves adding a random string (called a salt) to a password before it is hashed to prevent attackers from using precomputed hash databases (like rainbow tables) to crack the password. The random string (in this case, 36 characters) is unique and makes the password significantly harder to guess because it ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1314313","poster":"chalaka","timestamp":"1731977040.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nKey stretching techniques are used to make a possibly weak key, typically a password or passphrase, more secure against a brute-force attack by increasing the resources it takes to test each possible key.\nSalting does not add to the length of the password and does not stop attackers from brute-forcing the key as the salt is added after the password is submitted.\nTokenization and Data masking will not prevent brute-force attacks for the same reason.
