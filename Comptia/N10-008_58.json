If I'm trying to troubleshoot the internet is down issue for this end user, I could figure out what the halfway point is between their computer and the internet, which would probably be our default gateway. I could then try to send a ping from the end-user's computer to the default gateway. If it works, that means my internal network is functioning fully, and the problem exists between my default gateway and the internet connection or the distant web server. Now, this is my halfway point and with a single ping, I already verified the entire internal network is working from the end user, all the way up to the gateway.
