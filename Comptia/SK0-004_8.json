The NICs should be placed into a team with two MAC addresses.\n\nTo achieve fault protection and load balancing, the two integrated NICs in the new web server should be placed into a team (also known as NIC teaming or bonding). NIC teaming combines multiple network interfaces into a single logical interface, providing fault tolerance and increased bandwidth.\n\nWhen NIC teaming is enabled, both NICs work together as a single virtual NIC with two physical connections. This configuration ensures redundancy and fault protection. If one NIC fails or encounters an issue, the other NIC will continue to handle the network traffic, preventing downtime.\n\nAdditionally, placing the NICs into a team with two MAC addresses allows the team to be recognized as a distinct entity on the network, which is essential for proper load balancing and fault tolerance. The teaming software typically handles load distribution and failover to ensure optimal performance and reliability.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"970253"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/117134-exam-sk0-004-topic-1-question-5-discussion/","question_text":"A server technician is replacing a web server in an organization.
