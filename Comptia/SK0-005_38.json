It's risky to assume this capability exists without specific knowledge of the system. By scheduling an immediate outage, the administrator is taking a proactive stance to prevent potential data loss or system instability."},{"poster":"Dlam","timestamp":"1734637860.0","comment_id":"1329136","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nScheduling an outage immediately mitigates the possibility of a catastrophic failure, thus eliminating the inevitable unannounced disruption of services."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Hot swap the failed module immediately.\n\nDIMM modules are normally designed to be hot-swappable.\nIf a DIMM module is expected to fail, it is important to replace the failed module as soon as possible. Hot-swapping (in-service replacement) will minimize service interruptions.","timestamp":"1727188920.0","comment_id":"1288657","poster":"kx7tg4xu","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nUnless the scheduled downtime is way far, as in they work 24/7, no admin would schedule an immediate outage, disrupt work, for just a predictive failure.","timestamp":"1723476600.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1264706"},{"comment_id":"1237145","comments":[{"comment_id":"1264704","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"I upvoted you, but now that I think about it, it's probably not the answer, unless the scheduled downtime is way far as in they work 24/7, otherwise, no admin would schedule an immediate outage, disrupt work, for just a predictive failure.","timestamp":"1723476540.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nHere's why:\n\nIt addresses the urgency of the predictive failure alert, reducing the risk of an actual failure occurring.\nScheduling an outage allows for proper planning and notification to affected users or systems.\nIt ensures the replacement can be done safely, with the system powered down, which is typically necessary for memory replacement.\nThis approach balances the need for prompt action with the need for controlled, safe maintenance on a critical system.\nIt allows for proper testing after replacement to ensure system stability.\n\nWhile scheduling an immediate outage may cause some short-term disruption, it's the safest and most responsible course of action given the critical nature of a virtualization host and the potential consequences of an actual memory failure. This approach minimizes the risk of unplanned downtime or data loss that could result from an actual failure of the DIMM module.","timestamp":"1719363540.0","poster":"tame_rabbit","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1010725","upvote_count":"2","poster":"hasquaati","timestamp":"1695052920.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDIMM's can not be hot swappable"},{"poster":"Nasiiim","comment_id":"987025","timestamp":"1692674220.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"B or A?","comments":[]}]},{"id":"ekcjDG2ixv60GzcwkiwJ","question_text":"A technician is troubleshooting a server issue.
