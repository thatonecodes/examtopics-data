Biba is a setup where a user with lower clearance can read higher-level information (called “read up”) and a user with high-level clearance can write for lower levels of clearance (called “write down”). The Biba model is typically utilized in businesses where employees at lower levels can read higher-level information and executives can write to inform the lower-level employees.\n\nBell-LaPadula, on the other hand, is a setup where a user at a higher level (e.g., Top Secret) can only write at that level and no lower (called “write up”), but can also read at lower levels (called “read down”).
