The normal thought process after the first few sentences about the ticking noise and the PC failing to boot would be that the HDD is failing, so you want to extract the data asap before it's gone. The annoying part is that they're asking what to do FIRST.\n\nRealistically, options like inspecting the fan can be checked/done quickly, so they could generally be first steps since you don't know what the problem is until you inspect something. Also, trying to extract data would generally take longer so it's generally not a first step. In this case, they gave enough information for you to assume the hard drive is failing without you having to really inspect anything.\n\nSo yeah try to extract the data, and thanks comptia.","comments":[{"content":"Yeah but I want to ask why extract the data when it is failing.

The amount of time it would take to realistically check this is minutes, while extracting the data could potentially be much longer.
