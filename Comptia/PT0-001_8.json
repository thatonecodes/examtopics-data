An authenticated scan requires you to provide the scanner with a set of credentials that have root-level access to the system. The reason for this is that the scanner actually logs in to the target via SSH or some other mechanism. It then runs commands like netstat to gather information from inside the host. Many of the commands that the scanner runs require root-level access to be able to gather the correct information from the system.\n\nFigure 3-41 shows the netstat command run by a non-privileged user and then run again by a root user. You can see that the output is different for the different user-level permissions. Specifically, notice that when running as the user ron, the PID/Program name is not available, and when running as the user root, that information is displayed.","poster":"who__cares123456789___","timestamp":"1611799740.0"}],"poster":"someguy1393","timestamp":"1607279700.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"I agree, B makes the most sense to me.","comment_id":"236709"}],"upvote_count":"15"},{"timestamp":"1677171900.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kloug","comment_id":"819448","content":"bbbbbbbbb"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nlooks good to me","comment_id":"629627","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1657469160.0","poster":"miabe"},{"timestamp":"1649643840.0","comment_id":"583986","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B","upvote_count":"1","poster":"cuernov"},{"comment_id":"576268","timestamp":"1648393260.0","poster":"baybay","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe authenticated scans provide more details so I'd say B"},{"timestamp":"1624632480.0","content":"Answer B\n\nPentest just exploit not vulnerability scanner","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Joker20","comment_id":"390560"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1619111460.0","comment_id":"341199","poster":"ade2901296","content":"Answer A.
