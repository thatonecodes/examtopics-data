{"pageProps":{"questions":[{"id":"hZxMhIIbWzddYRnO5XNh","exam_id":355,"answer_description":"We can limit the amount of broadcast traffic on a switched network by dividing the computers into logical network segments called VLANs.\nA virtual local area network (VLAN) is a logical group of computers that appear to be on the same LAN even if they are on separate IP subnets. These logical subnets are configured in the network switches. Each VLAN is a broadcast domain meaning that only computers within the same VLAN will receive broadcast traffic.\nTo allow different segments (VLAN) to communicate with each other, a router is required to establish a connection between the systems. We can use a network router to route between the VLANs or we can use a Layer 3 switch. Unlike layer 2 switches that can only read the contents of the data-link layer protocol header in the packets they process, layer 3 switches can read the (IP) addresses in the network layer protocol header as well.","question_text":"A technician needs to limit the amount of broadcast traffic on a network and allow different segments to communicate with each other.\nWhich of the following options would satisfy these requirements?","unix_timestamp":1593305520,"timestamp":"2020-06-28 02:52:00","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"214186","content":"A L3 switch will do the routing process needed for VLANs and most other features depending on the OS you get for it.

Token Ring networks use the ring topology. Despite being called a Ring topology, the ring is logical and the physical network structure often forms a star topology with all computers on the network connecting to a central multistation access unit (MAU). The MAU implements the logical ring by transmitting signals to each node in turn and waiting for the node to send them back before it transmits to the next node. Therefore, although the cables are physically connected in a star, the data path takes the form of a ring. If any computer or network cable fails in a token ring network, the remainder of the network remains functional. The MAU has the intelligence to isolate the failed segment.\nTo ensure that the computers need to wait to talk on the network to avoid congestions, a Token Ring network uses a token. The token continually passes around the network until a computer needs to send data. The computer then takes the token and transmits the data before releasing the token. Only a computer in possession of the token can transmit data onto the network.","answers_community":[],"choices":{"A":"Star","D":"Mesh","B":"Bus","C":"Ring"},"question_text":"A network engineer needs to set up a topology that will not fail if there is an outage on a single piece of the topology.

In this question, each datacenter will be an autonomous system.\nThe routers within an AS use an interior gateway protocol, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) or the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol, to exchange routing information among themselves. At the edges of an AS are routers that communicate with the other ASs on the Internet, using an exterior gateway protocol such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).\nIf a WAN link goes down, BGP will route data through another WAN link if redundant WAN links are available.","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"But data center is belonging to one company, why each site is an AS?","comment_id":"323626","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kirkoloft","timestamp":"1617035460.0"}],"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"C":"OSPF","A":"Load balancer","B":"VRRP","D":"BGP"},"exam_id":355,"unix_timestamp":1617035460,"timestamp":"2021-03-29 18:31:00"},{"id":"0NCT1TqyQZ9KGZu7Qi7k","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/1751-exam-n10-006-topic-1-question-38-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"With SOHO setup, limitations of every kind should be considered first.
