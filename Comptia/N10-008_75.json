This is a security feature that can be used to prevent someone from unplugging their office computer and connecting their own laptop to the network jack without permission since the switch port connected to that network jack would only allow the computer with the original MAC address to gain connectivity.\nPrevents unauthorized access to a switchport by identifying & limiting the MAC addresses of the hosts that are allowed. Port security refers to blocking unauthorized access to the physical switchport that's being used to allow the host to communicate on the LAN & mitigate MAC flooding by allowing only specific MAC addresses to communicate over a given switchport.

Just putting this here not to confuse but to give idea, this is still open for correct answer\n\nConfiguring guest network isolation would be the best option in this scenario. Guest network isolation ensures that devices connected to the guest network cannot communicate with other devices on the network, including those on the corporate network. This would limit the potential damage that could be caused by a compromised device on the guest network.\n\nSetting the WLAN security to use EAP-TLS or deploying a captive portal for user authentication could also improve wireless security, but they may not be feasible options given the requirement to keep the phone number as the wireless passphrase.
