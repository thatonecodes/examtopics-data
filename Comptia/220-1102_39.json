Linux\n\nLinux is an open-source operating system that allows users access to the source code. It is highly versatile and can host various server applications, making it a popular choice for server environments. Linux also provides command-line interfaces, and there are many distributions (such as CentOS, Ubuntu Server, and Debian) that can be configured to be command-line only if desired. This flexibility and open-source nature of Linux make it a common choice for server configurations.\n\nWindows, macOS, and Chrome OS are not typically open-source operating systems, and while they can host server applications, they are not as commonly used for server purposes as Linux. Additionally, they often have graphical user interfaces as their primary user interface, although some server versions of Windows can be configured for command-line use."}]},{"id":"Ze0WyOB8RoxB63FAZE49","question_id":192,"choices":{"B":"AES","C":"EAP-EKE","D":"MFA","A":"RADIUS"},"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (65%)","C (35%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A technician is investigating options to secure a small office wireless network.
