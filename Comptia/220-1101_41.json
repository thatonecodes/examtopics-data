Private clouds offer the advantage of maintaining access even when a local internet outage occurs, since the cloud infrastructure is not dependent on a public network connection.\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud model in which software applications are hosted by a third-party provider and made available to customers over the internet. SaaS is not designed to maintain access in the event of a local internet outage.\n\nA community cloud is a shared infrastructure that is used by multiple organizations, typically from the same industry or with similar requirements.

The driver is a software component that communicates between the operating system and the printer, and converts data into a format that the printer can understand. If the driver is outdated or corrupted, it may send incorrect or garbled data to the printer, resulting in poor print quality or errors. The technician should update the driver to the latest version from the manufacturer’s website, or uninstall and reinstall it if necessary.

Update the driver.\n\nOutdated or corrupted printer drivers can lead to various print quality issues, including incorrect character printing. By updating the driver, the technician can ensure that the printer is communicating correctly with the computer and using the latest software to process print jobs.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Replace the fuser: Fuser issues typically result in problems like toner smears, streaks, or paper jams. They are not directly related to incorrect character printing.\nB. Adjust the rollers: Roller issues can cause paper jams or poor image quality, but they are not the primary cause of random and incorrect characters.\nD. Shake the toner: Shaking the toner cartridge can help distribute the toner evenly, but it's unlikely to resolve issues caused by a faulty driver.\nTherefore, updating the printer driver is the most effective solution to address the incorrect character printing issue.\n\nGG","poster":"Nate_A","timestamp":"1732066140.0","comment_id":"1314994"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"have random and incorrect characters \"\nSoftware issue.","timestamp":"1701814980.0","comment_id":"1088838","poster":"sirpetey","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"938716","content":"C is correct","poster":"Dadadagreat","timestamp":"1688089740.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_id":203},{"id":"lI6dPouwWKOtc7RrUGbG","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"7,200rpm HDD","D":"NVMe SDD","B":"5,400rpm HDD","A":"Hybrid HHD/SSD"},"unix_timestamp":1688089800,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer":"D","question_text":"An end user needs to upgrade the hard drive on a laptop and wants one that is fast and shock resistant.
