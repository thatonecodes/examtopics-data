Enabling BitLocker To Go with a password that meets corporate requirements would be the best way to secure the current workflow. BitLocker To Go is a built-in encryption feature in Windows that can be used to encrypt removable storage devices such as USB drives. By enabling BitLocker To Go with a password, the data on the USB drive will be encrypted and can only be accessed with the correct password, which meets the compliance officer's requirement for media at rest to be encrypted. Deploying a secondary hard drive with encryption or requiring files to be individually password protected may not be as secure or practical for the company's workflow. Configuring a hardened SFTP portal for file transfers may be a good solution for future transfers, but may not be the best solution for the company's current use of USB drives.","poster":"IconGT"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nEnable BitLocker To Go with a password that meets corporate requirements.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1082909","poster":"Chavozamiri","timestamp":"1732824540.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"mohdAj","comment_id":"1070793","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBitLocker To Go is a Microsoft Windows feature that allows encryption of removable storage devices such as USB drives.
