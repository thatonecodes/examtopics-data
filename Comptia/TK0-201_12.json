Report the behavior to the learner's manager.\"\n\nRemoving the learner immediately from the class or avoiding eye contact may not address the issue or resolve the distraction caused by the behavior. Moving the learner to a more distant location may not address the behavior either and could be perceived as punitive or ostracizing.\n\nTherefore, the instructor should take the opportunity during a break to speak with the learner privately and respectfully to explain how the behavior is affecting the class and to ask the learner to stop the behavior. The instructor should then report the behavior to the learner's manager, who can work with the learner to ensure the behavior stops and that the learner understands the consequences of continued inappropriate behavior.","poster":"JimGrayham","timestamp":"1709937120.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"2","question_text":"An instructor perceives that a learner is continually flirting with the instructor during class.\nWhich of the following should the instructor do to reduce the distraction level caused by the learner?"},{"id":"OcKj91eNMOAJI4MLCyAc","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721909520.0","content":"D.

Have learners sign the roster as they enter the class.\n\nHaving learners sign a roster as they enter the class is the most reliable method of recording attendance. It ensures that every learner is accounted for and provides a clear record of who was present. Passing a roster around during introductions or calling out a roster for confirmation may lead to errors or omissions, and compiling a roster from end-of-class surveys may not accurately reflect attendance throughout the entire class session. Having learners sign a roster as they enter the class is a simple and effective way to ensure accurate attendance records.","comment_id":"825394","poster":"JimGrayham"}],"exam_id":369,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-03-01 00:48:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"choices":{"D":"Have learners sign the roster as they enter the class.","A":"Compile a roster from end of class surveys.","C":"Call out a roster for confirmation.","B":"Pass a roster around during introductions."},"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1677628080,"question_text":"The BEST method of recording attendance is to:","question_id":57,"topic":"2","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/101194-exam-tk0-201-topic-2-question-99-discussion/"},{"id":"iHDkiYLtetl0Qy1CWumc","answer":"C","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"topic":"3","exam_id":369,"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1677667320,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Skill transfer","D":"Active listening","B":"Learning","A":"Authentic assessment"},"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/101235-exam-tk0-201-topic-3-question-1-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-03-01 11:42:00","question_id":58,"discussion":[{"content":"B. Learning\n\nCompleting a task successfully demonstrates that the learners have acquired new knowledge or skills, which is the essence of learning. Authentic assessment refers to an evaluation process that assesses a learner's ability to apply knowledge and skills to real-world situations. Skill transfer involves applying knowledge and skills learned in one context to another context. Active listening is a communication skill that involves paying close attention to what is being said and responding appropriately. While active listening can be important in completing a task, it is not the same as demonstrating successful completion of the task.","comment_id":"825721","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1725180120.0","poster":"JimGrayham"}],"question_text":"An instructor has asked the learners to perform a task.

Open-ended questions.\n\nOpen-ended questions in surveys can provide the trainer with the most meaningful assessment on how successful a course was to a particular audience. Open-ended questions allow learners to provide detailed feedback on what they found most helpful or least helpful about the course, what they would change, and what they would like to see in future courses. This type of feedback can provide valuable insight into the learners' experience and help the trainer make improvements to future courses. True/false questions and the Likert scale may provide some quantitative data, but they do not allow learners to provide detailed feedback. The comment section may provide some qualitative feedback, but open-ended questions can provide even more detailed and useful feedback.","timestamp":"1725914820.0"},{"timestamp":"1671343800.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Shouldn't this be \"B\"?","poster":"kadezalei","comment_id":"384564"}],"answer":"D"},{"id":"JPE7dWAlkp2tniF3XihB","timestamp":"2023-03-01 12:27:00","question_text":"An instructor is conducting a highly technical subject with a large media presentation.
