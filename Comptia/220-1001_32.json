The user wants to check a document but finds the \"built-in peripherals no longer work\". Since the user wants to check a document but now doesn't have their USB mouse connected to move the cursor - the next best thing is the \"built-in peripherals\" which would be the touch-pad (they stated the user uses a laptop) used to control the cursor.\n\nThe function key being stuck has nothing to do with trying to get to the document - which requires a cursor and clicking and maybe the windows button and E as a shortcut to get to the File explorer. besides that, it's cursor movement and clicking.\n\nHope this makes helps and makes sense to you as this is what led me to the answer B.","upvote_count":"2"}],"poster":"9r33nb3ani3","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"B","timestamp":"2022-02-09 21:56:00"},{"id":"2F8P5q0Gr5kIvzLOWY2H","unix_timestamp":1621729500,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A technician is building a workstation with 8GB of RAM that will host a VM.
