No performance gain.\n\nB - weighted - will distribute connections depending on what services are running on the box and resources available. For example, if we have a pool of two servers which load balance for app A:\n- server 1 is running app A and SQL server.\n- server 2 is only running app A and happens to have a faster processor. On each connection distribution cycle we would then distribute 2 connections to server 2 and 1 connection to server 1 (its working harder than server 2 as it runs sql server and has less memory). Minimal performance gain.\n\nC -least connections - the servers with the lowest amount of connections will get the next incoming connection until it roughly balances out.
