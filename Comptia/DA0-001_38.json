ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a process that is used during data integration to collect, blend, and load data. ETL involves three main steps:\n\nExtract: In this step, data is gathered from a variety of sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, and APIs, and is then extracted and stored in a temporary data repository.\n\nTransform: In this step, the data is cleaned, transformed, and transformed into a format that can be loaded into the target system. This step involves tasks such as data cleansing, data enrichment, data matching, and data mapping.\n\nLoad: In this step, the transformed data is loaded into the target system, such as a data warehouse or data mart, where it can be analyzed and used for reporting and business intelligence purposes."},{"timestamp":"1719892980.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"B. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a process that is used during data integration to collect, blend, and load data.
