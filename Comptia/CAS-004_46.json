The company's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is concerned with the risks related to sensitive data exposure and wants to implement tokenization of sensitive information at the record level.

This ensures that even if tokens are intercepted or exposed, they cannot be reused to retrieve the original sensitive information. This approach enhances security by ensuring that tokens are unique and not predictable","timestamp":"1721054460.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nKey word is \"unique.\" When you tokenize the data, you need to conceal what the real numbers are, but the tokens need to be unique. If you and I both have our credit cards in the database and are assigned the same token, how is the vendor to know which one to process when I buy something? \n\nA. Data field watermarking - A Watermark for data synchronization describes an object of a predefined format which provides a point of reference value for two systems/datasets attempting to establish delta/incremental synchronization; any object in the queried data source which was created, modified, or deleted after the watermark's value will be qualified as \"above watermark\" and should be returned to the client requesting data.\n\nB.

Single-use translation - Credit card tokenization is a security protocol that protects sensitive data during online transactions. It works by replacing a cardholder's Primary Account Number (PAN) with a unique, randomly generated identifier, referred to as a token. Hence, cardholder data is never exposed during the payment process.\n\nD. Salted hashing - A cryptographic salt is made up of random bits added to each password instance before its hashing.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708174920.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708174920.0"},{"content":"\"Single-use translation\" appears to be an answer without a clear definition.
