The question is asking about the safety risk as it relates to Pentesting, not as it relates to the devices. This is extremely poor wording, but essentially...the wrong answers all answer how the device poses a safety risk, but answer C is why a pentest/scan itself is a safety risk. There's an article linked when you click \"Reveal Solution\" that goes more in depth with it, but the gist is: these older protocols can cause system malfunctions if scanned with modern tools.

Wiberg states that active tools such as Nmap can use unusual TCP segment data to try and find available ports. Furthermore, they can open a massive amount of connections with a specific SCADA device but then fail to close them gracefully.\" \nAnd since SCADA and ICS devices are designed and implemented with little attention having been paid to the operational security of these devices and their ability to handle errors or unexpected events, the presence idle open connections may result into errors that cannot be handled by the devices.\n\nThis will result into failure of the normal operation of the SCADA causing the physical world effects.
