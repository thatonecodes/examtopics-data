Calibration is essential for ensuring that the toner, drum, and laser are correctly aligned to produce optimal image quality. Performing calibration after servicing is a standard procedure to restore print quality.\n\nOptions like checking the toner, fuser, or drum are valid troubleshooting steps for other specific issues, but calibration directly addresses alignment and quality concerns caused by maintenance.","poster":"Isuckatexams","comment_id":"1413531","timestamp":"1743352980.0"},{"content":"A,C,D are wrong answers\nB is the correct answer\nIf a color laser printer's image quality decreases after being serviced for dust removal, it's likely that the servicing process affected the printer's calibration. Calibration ensures that color reproduction is accurate, and if disturbed, can lead to a decrease in image quality. It's important to check and recalibrate the printer to restore its ability to accurately reproduce colors and maintain high image quality.","poster":"JonHin","comment_id":"1363751","comments":[{"content":"References:\nCompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) Exam Objectives, particularly the sections dealing with printer maintenance, troubleshooting, and the importance of calibration in maintaining image quality in laser printers.\nKnowledge of printer maintenance procedures and their impact on printer performance, with a focus on how calibration affects color accuracy and overall image quality.","comment_id":"1363752","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JonHin","timestamp":"1740884400.0"}],"timestamp":"1740884400.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732058640.0","poster":"CloudChef","comment_id":"1314973","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe drum is a critical component in a color laser printer that is responsible for transferring the toner onto the paper. If excessive dust was removed from the printer, it's possible that the drum was affected by improper cleaning or contamination. This could lead to a decrease in image quality, such as smudging, streaks, or faded prints."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is D Drum","comment_id":"1300433","poster":"2ba1468","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729425900.0"},{"poster":"032e128","timestamp":"1729209660.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1299489","content":"Selected Answer: D\nReasoning for the Answer: Drum (D)\n\nReasoning:\n\n Dust Accumulation: The drum is a critical component in a laser printer, responsible for transferring toner onto the paper. When a printer is heavily used, dust can accumulate on the drum's surface. This dust can interfere with the toner transfer process, leading to uneven or faded prints.\n Service and Dust Removal: After a service to remove excessive dust, it's highly likely that some dust particles may have remained on the drum, even after the cleaning process. These residual particles can still impact the printer's performance.\n Drum Sensitivity: Drums are sensitive components and can be easily damaged or contaminated. Even small amounts of dust or debris can affect their functionality."},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1287491","content":"Calibration is important for ensuring print quality, but the immediate issue following maintenance is more likely related to the drum.\nAfter servicing the printer and removing dust, a decrease in image quality could be related to the printer's drum. The drum is critical in transferring toner to the paper, and if it has been affected by dust or if it was not properly cleaned or reinstalled, it can lead to poor print quality, such as streaks, smudges, or faded images.","poster":"Meshaa","timestamp":"1726959960.0"},{"timestamp":"1723997460.0","content":"The correct answer is B. Calibration.\n\nAfter servicing a color laser printer to remove dust, it is common for the printer to require recalibration to ensure the colors and alignment are correct. Calibration adjusts the printer's settings to match the print output with the expected quality and colors. If the image quality decreases after servicing, calibration is the most likely issue that needs to be addressed.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1268153","poster":"850bc48"},{"content":"D.
