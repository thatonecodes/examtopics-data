The load average numbers represent the system load time over a period of 1, 5, and 15 minutes. In this case, all three numbers are higher than the number of vCPUs available (4), which suggests that the CPU is a bottleneck. Therefore, the correct answer is A. The system is under CPU pressure and will require additional vCPUs.\n\nHere’s a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nB. The system has been running for over a year and requires a reboot. While it’s true that the system has been running for over a year, this doesn’t necessarily mean it requires a reboot. Linux systems are capable of running for many years without needing a reboot.\nC. Too many users are currently logged in to the system. The number of users currently logged in (5) should not be a problem unless they are all running processes that are heavily consuming resources.\nD. The system requires more memory. There’s no information given that suggests the system is low on memory. The performance issue seems to be related to the CPU, not memory."},{"poster":"MiraGod","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe devices has more load on CPU than CPU Cores, only with that information we know there is an issue.\nWith the system being up more than a year sure it does not sound nice but only with that information there is no evidence that is the problem","comment_id":"1014567","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1695426780.0"},{"timestamp":"1684928220.0","poster":"tutita","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"905807","content":"Selected Answer: A\noption A is the right one, the system is overloaded, doing a reboot wont solve it."},{"timestamp":"1679258940.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"POGActual","content":"Definitely A.

The system is under CPU pressure and will require additional vCPUs.\n\nThe load average (4.22 6.63 5.58) indicates that the system is under CPU pressure. The load average is the average number of tasks waiting for CPU time over a given time interval. If the load average is consistently high, it can mean that the system is struggling to keep up with demand and that more CPU resources are needed. In this case, the administrator may need to consider adding additional vCPUs to alleviate the CPU pressure."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nreal world, anyone would first reboot, and if it happened again frequently then upgrade.

Uptime is simply a measure of the time the system has been running without any downtime. It is possible for a system to run for much longer without requiring a reboot. Reboots are typically required to install updates or address specific performance or stability issues, but simply having a long uptime does not automatically imply a need for a reboot.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"KnifeClown1","timestamp":"1676043240.0"}],"poster":"Nvoid","comment_id":"726381"}]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"id":371,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Comptia","name":"XK0-005","numberOfQuestions":266,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":11},"__N_SSP":true}
