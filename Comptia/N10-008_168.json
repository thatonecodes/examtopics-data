Plenum-rated cables are designed to be used in spaces where air circulation is needed, and they have fire-resistant insulation that prevents the spread of flames and toxic smoke in the event of a fire.\n\nA. Shielded: While shielded cables offer protection against electromagnetic interference (EMI), they do not address fire safety requirements for use in plenum spaces.\n\nC. Unshielded: Unshielded cables lack both the fire-resistant insulation and protection against EMI, making them unsuitable for use in raised ceilings or other spaces where fire safety and interference are concerns.\n\nD. Riser: Riser cables are designed for vertical spaces between floors and have fire-resistant properties to prevent the spread of flames. They are not suitable for plenum spaces as they do not have the necessary fire-resistant insulation for air circulation areas.","poster":"a87d6a4","timestamp":"1725898020.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"B.

This method separates the web server from the internal network and provides an additional layer of security.\n\nB. Connect the web server to the WAN is incorrect because this exposes the server directly to the internet without any protection, leaving it vulnerable to attacks.\n\nC. Connect the server directly to a second port on the cable modem is incorrect because it also exposes the server to external traffic without any security controls or isolation from internal resources.\n\nD.
