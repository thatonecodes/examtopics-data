Encrypt all data and files at rest, in transit, and in use. Encryption is the fundamental measure to ensure data confidentiality. By encrypting data both at rest (when stored on a disk), in transit (while being transferred over networks), and in use (when actively being processed or accessed), the company ensures that even if an unauthorized party gains access to the data, they will not be able to read or use it without the appropriate decryption keys. This is especially important for sensitive data, as it protects it across all stages of its lifecycle.\nF. Implement file integrity monitoring. File integrity monitoring (FIM) ensures that files are not tampered with, deleted, or altered in unauthorized ways. This helps maintain confidentiality by detecting any unauthorized changes to files containing sensitive data. If someone attempts to modify, replace, or exfiltrate sensitive data, FIM will alert the administrators, allowing them to respond quickly to protect data integrity and confidentiality."},{"poster":"a18733c","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nFile Integrity Monitoring doesn't address the confidentiality requirement.

Configure SOAR to monitor and intercept files and data leaving the network:\nSOAR platforms can be configured to monitor network traffic and intercept unauthorized data transfers. By doing so, the company can detect and prevent potential data exfiltration attempts, ensuring that sensitive data does not leave the network without proper authorization. \nWHy not F: FIM tracks changes to files to ensure they have not been altered maliciously, which addresses data integrity rather than confidentiality.

Review risks and assign remediation activities to stakeholders. Once the risks have been identified and their potential impacts assessed, the next step is to actively manage those risks. This involves reviewing the risks, prioritizing them based on their potential impact and likelihood, and then assigning specific remediation activities or actions to relevant stakeholders. These actions might include implementing controls to mitigate, transfer, or accept the risks, and ensuring the organization is on track to address them effectively. Assigning responsibility ensures accountability and ensures the risks are addressed in a timely manner. NOT C. Perform a gap analysis against application regulatory requirements.\nA gap analysis against regulatory requirements might be important, but it's more focused on ensuring compliance with specific laws or standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), rather than directly addressing the identified risks.
