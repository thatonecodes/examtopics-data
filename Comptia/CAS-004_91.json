This setup could lead to a single point of failure, which impacts the system's ability to remain operational if that server goes down.\n\nOption C: Availability is the most pertinent concern that needs to be addressed.\n\nEnsuring availability typically involves having multiple servers or instances behind a load balancer to provide redundancy and failover capabilities. This approach enhances the system's resilience, ensuring that services remain available even if one server experiences issues. Therefore, to improve availability, the architecture should include additional servers or instances to handle the traffic, thus preventing downtime in case of failure.","timestamp":"1722460440.0","upvote_count":"7","poster":"tony_wang99","comment_id":"1259104"},{"timestamp":"1742951460.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1410218","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAfter thorough research about the question, I changed my answer to C Availability: This is the primary issue. A single server means the system is not highly available (no failover). The single server behind the load balancer is a critical availability risk. Best practice is to have multiple servers to ensure redundancy and failover. A single server behind the load balancer represents a single point of failure. If that server goes down, the entire application becomes unavailable. This directly impacts availability. A load balancer is typically used to distribute traffic across multiple servers to ensure the system can handle high traffic and remain available even if one server fails."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe fact that the load balancer has only a single server assigned indicates a potential bottleneck in handling increased traffic or load.

Scalability. Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increased load or traffic by expanding its resources. The observation that \"the load balancer has only a single server assigned\" indicates a potential bottleneck, as the system is not set up to scale properly if the demand on the application increases \nThe fact that memory and CPU usage are low suggests that the current resources are underutilized, which means the system may be able to handle more load, but it lacks the ability to scale (as indicated by the single server on the load balancer).\nExternal inbound access being blocked does not directly relate to scalability but might affect access control or public availability. It doesn't address the underlying ability of the system to grow.\nThe large amount of storage available also suggests that storage capacity is not a limiting factor, but the system's ability to scale in response to traffic or usage demands is more critical.","poster":"Bright07"},{"comment_id":"1258401","poster":"PluDou_111","timestamp":"1722372120.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nScalability.
