Schedule\n\nIt appears that the project is behind schedule, and increasing the schedule may help to resolve this issue. The project manager may need to consider adding additional resources or adjusting the scope of the project in order to get back on track. It is also important to address the quality issues that have been identified, as these can impact the overall success of the project. However, increasing the focus on quality may not necessarily help to get the project back on schedule, so it is important to address the root cause of the schedule delay in order to resolve the issue effectively.","comment_id":"769793","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kmanb","timestamp":"1673208360.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","question_images":[],"exam_id":359,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Schedule","D":"Scope","B":"Quality","A":"Resources"},"question_text":"A project manager is reviewing a project's status and finds that while it is 25% under budget, there are significant quality defects, and the project is behind by six weeks.\nWhich of the following should the project manager increase to BEST resolve this issue?","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-01-08 21:06:00","unix_timestamp":1673208360,"answer":"C"},{"id":"6EAxpGNcgcC2MkZF14cl","answer_description":"Reference: Kim Heldman, CompTIA Project+ Study Guide, 2nd Edition, Sybex, Indianapolis, 2017, p. 56","timestamp":"2021-06-18 17:09:00","question_id":360,"question_text":"Which of the following is a characteristics of a matrix organization?","choices":{"B":"Authority is directed by the project architect.","A":"Authority lies solely with the project manager.","C":"Authority is shared between the project manager and project coordinator.","D":"Authority is shared between functional and project managers."},"isMC":true,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/55575-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-6-discussion/","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1675161540.0","poster":"cepojo","comment_id":"794007","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect\n\nA matrix organization shares authority between functional managers and project managers.
