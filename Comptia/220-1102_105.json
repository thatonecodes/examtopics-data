You can also run a disk cleanup to scan your drive for files you can delete.\nUpgrade hardware\nUpgrading your RAM can help if your computer struggles to multitask. Upgrading your hard drive to an SSD can also noticeably speed up your computer. \nReduce background programs\nToo many background programs can slow down your computer, even if they aren't in use.
