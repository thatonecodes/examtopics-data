The wget package, as well as all its files, can be verified using this command. If any files have been altered since the package was installed, rpm -V will report the differences. This can help the administrator determine whether any unauthorized changes have been made to the package, or if the files have been damaged in some way.","comment_id":"806927","poster":"linux_admin"}]},{"id":"iULQEdTvtIYhie4GO9T8","topic":"1","question_text":"A Linux engineer set up two local DNS servers (10.10.10.10 and 10.10.10.20) and was testing email connectivity to the local mail server using the mail command on a local machine when the following error appeared:\n//IMG//\n\nThe local machine DNS settings are:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich of the following commands could the engineer use to query the DNS server to get mail server information?","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/xk0-005/image30.png","https://img.examtopics.com/xk0-005/image31.png"],"unix_timestamp":1676246460,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"858072","upvote_count":"3","content":"Answer B:\nSyntax to specify DNS query to mail domain server: dig @10.10.10.20 example.com mx\n\"mx\" is mail exchange - directs to mail server","timestamp":"1727797800.0","poster":"angellorv"},{"poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1723500060.0","comment_id":"806930","upvote_count":"4","content":"B. dig @10.10.10.20 example.com mx\n\nThe dig command is a useful tool for querying DNS servers to retrieve information about domain names."}],"exam_id":371,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-02-13 01:01:00","answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/99013-exam-xk0-005-topic-1-question-54-discussion/","answers_community":[],"question_id":217,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"dig @10.10.10.20 example.com mx","D":"dig @10.10.10.20 example.com ns","A":"dig @example.com 10.10.10.20 a","C":"dig @example.com 10.10.10.20 ptr"},"answer":"B","isMC":true},{"id":"Dqhx2jv1bp1aFRYSWTkA","timestamp":"2023-02-06 22:36:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"A Linux engineer has been notified about the possible deletion of logs from the file /opt/app/logs.

This attribute ensures that once a file has been created, it cannot be deleted or modified. Any attempts to do so will result in a \"permission denied\" error.\n\nIn this case, the command sets the \"append only\" attribute for the /opt/app/logs directory, which will prevent any changes to existing files or the deletion of files in that directory. New files can still be added to the directory, but their contents cannot be modified.\n\nThis is useful in cases where the logs stored in the /opt/app/logs directory are critical for debugging or auditing purposes, and need to be kept for an extended period of time. The \"append only\" attribute helps to ensure the integrity of the logs, by preventing any accidental or malicious changes to the log files."},{"timestamp":"1722972960.0","poster":"Huckleberry","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"800315","content":"should be 'lsattr' not 'lsattz'"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"O6CBGVBfG206rGumfpnW","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"A systems administrator needs to check if the service systemd-resolved.service is running without any errors.
