It effectively mitigates the risk posed by the vulnerable and deprecated runtime engine while allowing the banking application to remain operational until the transition to a modern development environment is completed. This approach ensures that customer service is maintained without compromising security during the transitional phase.\n\nWhile IPS and WAF are valuable security measures, they are not specifically tailored to address the risks associated with a deprecated runtime engine. Configuring IPS and WAF with signatures is more effective for protecting against specific types of attacks but may not comprehensively mitigate the vulnerabilities in the runtime engine itself. Selectively blocking traffic on the affected port directly addresses the immediate risk posed by the deprecated component without introducing potential operational disruptions or incomplete protection scenarios that could arise from relying solely on IPS and WAF.","comment_id":"1243494","poster":"isaphiltrick","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1720291260.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-07-06 20:41:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/143453-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-469-discussion/","question_text":"A security analyst identified a vulnerable and deprecated runtime engine that is supporting a public-facing banking application.
