The number of CPUs in the server is the MOST important consideration when attempting to calculate licensing costs for software that applies fees on a socket-based model.\n\nIn a socket-based licensing model, licensing fees are typically determined by the number of CPU sockets or processor sockets in the server where the software is deployed. Each CPU socket represents a unit of licensing, and the more CPU sockets a server has, the more licenses are required. Memory, cloud type, and the number of customers may be factors in other licensing models, but in a socket-based model, it's primarily the number of CPU sockets that drives the licensing costs.","poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1726124100.0","comment_id":"1005479"}]},{"id":"MOOkLGlt7S38oRjBnzXr","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\n\nTo view the entire simulation, click the X in the upper-right corner of this window.\n\nA highly regulated business is required to work remotely and the risk tolerance is very low.

Add an inbound rule to use the IP address for the company's main office as a source.\n\nWhy this works:\nBy adding an inbound rule that allows SSH access from the company's main office IP address, both the administrator (working remotely) and the internal developer (likely working from the office) can securely access the server.
