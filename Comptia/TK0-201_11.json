Have the instructor explain the colloquialisms to the learner and go on\n\nIt is important for the instructor to explain any colloquialisms or jargon that may be unfamiliar to the learners in order to ensure that they fully understand the material being presented. This approach will also help to create a more inclusive learning environment for all learners, regardless of their background or regional dialect. Simply letting the instructor continue without addressing the issue may result in confusion or misunderstandings among the learners, which can ultimately hinder their ability to learn and retain the information being presented.","timestamp":"1725139500.0","poster":"JimGrayham","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"825386"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"2","answer_description":"","question_id":52},{"id":"DAgIYpYvKTBxGNkZ2ruS","exam_id":369,"question_images":[],"question_id":53,"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"An instructor is previewing the class materials for a course.

Develop appropriate questions to be included during the course to monitor the progress of all learners.\n\nIf the method to monitor learner progress is not included in the course materials, the instructor should create a plan to monitor learner progress during the course. Developing appropriate questions to be included during the course is the best option to monitor learner progress in real-time. This will allow the instructor to adjust the course delivery based on the level of understanding demonstrated by the learners, ensuring that all the learners can follow the course material. Administering a survey following the course or encouraging learners to enroll in a subsequent class may be helpful in some contexts, but it will not provide the instructor with the immediate feedback needed to make adjustments during the course.
