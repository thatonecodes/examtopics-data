RPO\n\nRPO stands for Recovery Point Objective. It refers to the maximum tolerable amount of data loss measured in time. In this scenario, the server administrator is gathering business requirements to determine how frequently backups need to be performed on an application server. This directly relates to establishing the RPO, as it helps determine the frequency of backups necessary to meet the organization's data recovery objectives.\n\nThe RPO helps define the acceptable amount of data that may be lost during a disaster or failure scenario.
