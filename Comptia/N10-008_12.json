This usually happens when a collision occurs, or a device sends a frame that is shorter than the minimum frame size allowed. If the network administrator has already tried multiple ports on both switches, the issue is most likely not caused by a faulty port or cable. Therefore, the network administrator should try to increase the MTU size on both switches.
