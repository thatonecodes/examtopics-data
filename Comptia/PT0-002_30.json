One of the methods for setting up WPS is the PIN method, which often relies on an 8-digit PIN. Unfortunately, this PIN can be relatively easy to brute-force, especially since the PIN is often checked in two separate 4-digit parts, reducing the total number of possible combinations.\n\nWPA2-EAP, WPA-TKIP, and WPA2-PSK are all more robust security mechanisms for WiFi, and they would generally be considered more resistant to brute-force attacks than WPS.\n\nSo the correct answer to this question is:\n\nA.

This attack works on the basis that true or false queries can be answered by the amount of time a request takes to complete.
