SOAR collects data and alerts security teams using a centralized platform similar to SIEM, but SIEM only sends alerts to security analysts. SOAR security, on the other hand, takes it a step further by automating the responses. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn pattern behaviors, which enable it to predict similar threats before they happen.

SOAR platforms can automate repetitive tasks, analyze event data, and execute predefined actions in response to security incidents, all without requiring manual intervention from analysts.\n\nBy leveraging AI and automation, SOAR solutions can help security teams handle a large volume of security alerts, streamline incident response workflows, and respond to threats more quickly and accurately. This enables organizations to better manage and mitigate security incidents, reducing the overall impact of cyber threats on their systems and data.","comment_id":"959001","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1689981360.0"},{"poster":"NetworkTester1235","timestamp":"1709763660.0","content":"A SOAR is a SIEM that takes action","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1167533"},{"comment_id":"1119089","timestamp":"1704924480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"shaneo007","content":"Answer c.
