Create a GPO to disable the Windows Remote Management service\n\nExplanation:\nGroup Policy Objects (GPOs) are the preferred method for centrally managing and enforcing configurations across multiple Windows-based servers within a domain environment. By creating a GPO to disable the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service, the administrator can ensure that all Windows-based servers within the data center have RDP disabled.\n\nGPOs provide centralized and scalable management, allowing administrators to enforce policies, such as disabling specific services, across thousands of servers efficiently and consistently.
