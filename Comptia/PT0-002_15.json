Add a dependency checker into the tool chain.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Dependency Checker: A dependency checker is a tool that scans the third-party libraries and modules used in a software project to identify known vulnerabilities. By integrating a dependency checker into the build or CI/CD pipeline, the company can ensure that vulnerable third-party modules are identified and addressed before they are included in the final product.

Double-tagging attack\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Double-Tagging Attack: This attack is a type of VLAN hopping attack where an attacker sends frames with two VLAN tags. The purpose is to exploit the way some network switches handle VLAN tags. The outer VLAN tag (100) is stripped by the first switch, leaving the inner VLAN tag (50) intact. This can cause the packet to be sent to a different VLAN (VLAN 50) than the attacker is actually on (VLAN 100), potentially reaching a different network segment.\n\nAnalysis of the Command:\n\n • Ether(): Constructs an Ethernet frame.\n • Dot1Q(vlan=100): Adds the first VLAN tag (100).\n • Dot1Q(vlan=50): Adds the second VLAN tag (50), which is the tag that will remain after the outer tag is stripped.\n • IP(dst=\"172.16.50.10\"): Adds an IP layer with the destination IP address 172.16.50.10.\n • ICMP(): Adds an ICMP layer, typically used for ping operations.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"PhillyCheese","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnother type of VLAN attack is a double-tagging (or double-encapsulated) VLAN hopping attack. This type of attack takes advantage of the way that hardware on most switches operates. Most switches perform only one level of 802.1Q de-encapsulation, which allows an attacker to embed a hidden 802.1Q tag inside the frame. This tag allows the frame to be forwarded to a VLAN that the original 802.1Q tag did not specify. An important characteristic of the double-encapsulated VLAN hopping attack is that it works even if trunk ports are disabled because a host typically sends a frame on a segment that is not a trunk link.\n\nhttps://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2181837","comment_id":"1100940","timestamp":"1703014320.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1092486","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis very much looks like double tagging attack. \nCheck this source with packet/wireshark capture\nhttps://packetlife.net/blog/2010/feb/22/experimenting-vlan-hopping/","timestamp":"1702211760.0","poster":"mehewas855"},{"comment_id":"877350","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe command being run is creating an Ethernet frame with two VLAN tags (VLAN 100 and VLAN 50) and an IP packet with a destination IP address of 172.16.50.10 and an ICMP payload.

DNS forward and reverse lookups over F. Shodan results because, in the initial information-gathering phase, the tester needs to have a broad understanding of the company's web presence, and DNS lookups can provide that. DNS lookups can give the tester a list of domain names associated with the company and the IP addresses of servers hosting those domain names. This information can be used to identify potential targets for further testing and to gain a better understanding of a company's web presence.\nOn the other hand, Shodan is a search engine that allows users to find specific types of devices (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the Internet using a variety of filters. It could be used by a tester as a reconnaissance tool to find open ports, services and vulnerabilities, but it's limited to specific type of devices."}],"exam_id":362,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-09-29 23:14:00","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer":"DF","answers_community":["DF (54%)","CD (46%)"],"question_id":75,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/84067-exam-pt0-002-topic-1-question-166-discussion/","answer_ET":"DF","unix_timestamp":1664486040}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"name":"PT0-002","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":445,"isMCOnly":false,"id":362,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia"},"currentPage":15},"__N_SSP":true}
