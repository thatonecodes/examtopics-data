Now who is providing the service? that abc is the service provider you implement it but where is the service provided from? from the abc company .\nNow look at the option A \"the cloud company is the identity provider\" NO, THAT NOT RIGHT, we are using the federation to get into the cloud application, we do not have any username or password to get into the cloud application.
