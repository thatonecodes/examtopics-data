What happens when a user insert a wrong password in the login form of the application? Sure we don't want the application terminates abruptly; so we must handle the error; how? Showing a short message, something like \"wrong password, please try again\"; the user doesn't need to know more than that, so we SHOULD NOT give him any additional info: that's the best practice for error handling; instead here the application is informing the user (or a possible hacker) that not only the inserted password is wrong, but it ALSO doesn't match the minimum required length of 12 characters; there's NO reason to tell those details about password length (it's a login form not a registration form)."}],"upvote_count":"2","content":"Error handling generally pertains more to logins, and input validation pertains more to app and program inputs.","comment_id":"44928","poster":"MelvinJohn"}],"content":"Input validation prevents improperly formed data from entering an information system.
