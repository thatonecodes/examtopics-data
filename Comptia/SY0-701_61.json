The presence of a <script> tag in the logs strongly suggests the possibility of XSS. If the script content includes malicious code, it could be executed in the context of the victim's browser.\n\nSQLi (SQL Injection): This pertains to injecting malicious SQL queries into database queries, which does not involve <script> tags or JavaScript.\n\nDDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): This involves overwhelming a service with traffic, which does not directly involve JavaScript or <script> tags in logs.\n\nCSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): This exploits trust in authenticated users to perform unwanted actions on their behalf, but it does not involve <script> tags or JavaScript injection.\n\nCorrect Answer: a) XSS","comment_id":"1335083","upvote_count":"1","poster":"45043df"},{"comment_id":"1333626","upvote_count":"1","poster":"jbmac","timestamp":"1735492020.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)\n\nExplanation:\nThe code <script>function (send_info)</script> is a basic example of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). In an XSS attack, an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into web pages that can be executed in the context of another user's browser. This allows the attacker to steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, or perform other malicious actions, such as redirecting users or altering the content of the page."},{"poster":"ProudFather","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe code snippet demonstrates a classic example of SQL injection (SQLi).

It's an incomplete piece of JavaScript code. However, its presence in logs, especially in contexts like URLs or web server logs, strongly suggests an attempted Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.","comment_id":"1325741"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nExplanation according to ChatGPT:\nThe code in the log likely contains evidence of an SQL Injection (SQLi) attack. Hereâ€™s why:\n\nSQL Injection (SQLi) is an attack technique where an attacker exploits a vulnerability in an application's software by injecting malicious SQL code into an input field (such as a form field, URL parameter, or API input). This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, or even data modification.\nIn the logs, if the attacker is attempting to inject SQL keywords such as UNION, SELECT, OR, AND, or similar, it is a strong indicator of an SQLi attack. These are typical components of SQL injection queries used to manipulate the database query.","comment_id":"1323571","timestamp":"1733667660.0","poster":"4617f0b","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"A","question_text":"While reviewing logs, a security administrator identifies the following code:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich of the following best describes the vulnerability being exploited?","choices":{"A":"XSS","D":"CSRF","C":"DDoS","B":"SQLi"},"topic":"1"},{"id":"e7TQEKuJaViWo15vyegj","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/151693-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-372-discussion/","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1738319160.0","poster":"9149f41","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1349470","content":"Selected Answer: A\ne.g., NinjaOne RMM is agent-based; download the agent and install it on each device.
