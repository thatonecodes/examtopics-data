Consolidation\n\nConsolidation involves combining or merging similar data across multiple fields into a single field. In this scenario, where a dataset with 40 fields needs to be pared down to 20 fields and contains similar data across multiple fields, consolidation would be the appropriate concept to apply. By consolidating redundant or similar data into fewer fields, the dataset becomes more streamlined and efficient, making it easier to manage and analyze."}],"choices":{"A":"Duplication","D":"Standardization","B":"Consolidation","C":"Compliance"},"question_id":87,"exam_id":351,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following concepts should be applied if a data set with 40 fields needs to be pared down to 20 fields and contains similar data across multiple fields?"},{"id":"TsNXl1M76vqT5pQj9FUo","discussion":[{"poster":"vesen22","comment_id":"1067731","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPython","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1731316920.0"},{"poster":"CineFeX","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"763550","timestamp":"1704177180.0","content":"D. Python is a common data analytics tool that is also used as an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python is popular among data analysts and data scientists because of its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful data processing and visualization libraries.
