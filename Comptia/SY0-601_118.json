Dual power supply\nB. Off-site backups\n\nHere's why:\n\nA. Dual power supply: Dual power supplies provide redundancy in case one power source fails, ensuring continuous power supply to critical infrastructure components such as servers, switches, and storage devices. This redundancy helps minimize downtime and ensures high availability of services in the event of a power outage.\n\nB. Off-site backups: Off-site backups involve storing backup copies of data in a separate location from the primary datacenter. This provides protection against data loss due to disasters such as fires, floods, or other incidents that could affect the primary datacenter. Off-site backups ensure that data can be restored even if the primary datacenter is compromised, contributing to overall resiliency and uptime.\n\nTogether, dual power supply and off-site backups help enhance the resiliency and uptime of the new datacenter by addressing potential points of failure and providing safeguards against data loss.","comment_id":"1202872","poster":"Geronemo"},{"poster":"russian","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nNIC teaming is resilience","comment_id":"1201383","timestamp":"1713963900.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nAD makes more sense","poster":"c946f3e","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1195795","timestamp":"1713154980.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1164529","timestamp":"1709446680.0","poster":"kna83","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nIn terms of Comptia, one of the ways to have a 'resilient' data Centre is to have a cluster of Servers working as one and that is achievable through 'NIC teaming' technique,\nFor Uptime, the only option we have is 'Dual power supply'."},{"comment_id":"1157465","upvote_count":"2","poster":"pinkdog","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nA dual power supply ensures redundancy in case one power source fails, contributing to resiliency and uptime.

Dual Power Supply & B. Off-site Backup\nThe key words are resiliency and uptime.\nI believe that NIC teaming is associated with redundancy. There are indeed differences between resiliency and redundancy. I found this explanation from www.oreilly.com and it really helped me to understand the differences.\n“Redundancy is something that is done to prevent failure, implying that it happens before an issue happens. Resiliency, from the word resolve, relates to how to find solutions after a problem has occurred. Redundancy is before the issue. Resiliency is after. For example, redundant databases with replication can be utilized. Multiple components and copies of data create a redundant design. If the primary side of the database pair fails, the secondary side will promote to primary and begin to pick up the load while the failed side self-repairs. The failover and self-healing functions are resiliency. Both are related, but not ...“\nThis explains NIC’s redundancy put in place to prevent failures.

Data resiliency refers to the ability of an organization to protect, recover, and maintain its data in the face of unexpected events or disruptions. These events can include hardware failures, software glitches, cyberattacks, natural disasters, or human errors.
