But below should be known\n\nChargeback\nIT chargeback is an accounting strategy that attempts to decentralize the costs of IT services and apply them directly to the teams or divisions that utilize those services. This system enables organizations to make better decisions about how their IT dollars are spent, as it can help determine the true cost of a particular service. Without a chargeback system, all IT \ncosts are consolidated under the IT department umbrella, and the ability to determine the true profitability of the individual business services the IT department supports is limited or impossible. Most private clouds and internal IT departments use the term “showback” instead of chargeback to describe the amount of resources being consumed by a department.","comment_id":"983878","timestamp":"1708199100.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nTo correct the billing issue where certain resources are not being billed to any particular department, the MOST appropriate action would be to \"Modify the tags for all the unmapped resources\" (D).\n\nTags are a way to categorize resources in the cloud environment. When a resource is created, the cloud administrator can add tags to it to help identify the resource's purpose, owner, environment, or any other metadata. By modifying the tags for all the unmapped resources, the administrator can assign appropriate metadata to the resources and then use that information to correctly attribute the resource usage and cost to the appropriate department.","comment_id":"871197","timestamp":"1697393340.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"BeauChateau"},{"timestamp":"1690378020.0","poster":"Alizadeh","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn order to correct the billing issue where certain resources are not being billed to any particular department, the cloud administrator should ensure that all the resources are properly tagged with the correct department or cost center information.

This process can help organizations meet sudden spikes in demand without requiring additional investment in hardware. When usage returns to normal levels, the cloud infrastructure can automatically scale back down, releasing the additional resources and minimizing costs.","poster":"BeauChateau","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA should be the answer.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Trebor28","comment_id":"814372","timestamp":"1692462240.0"},{"timestamp":"1689693660.0","poster":"CapJackSparrow","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCan, or should a DR be used for additional resources when needed?
