Configure certificate pinning inside the application.\n\nCertificate pinning is a security technique that allows an application to verify the identity of a server by comparing the server's certificate to a known and trusted certificate. If the certificates do not match, the application will reject the connection.\nCertificate pinning is particularly effective against man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between a client and a server and impersonates the server. By pinning the certificate, the client can be sure that it is communicating with the intended server and not an attacker.","poster":"weaponxcel","timestamp":"1729633200.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1051136"},{"poster":"32d799a","comment_id":"1044320","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1729011900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Configure certificate pinning inside the application.\n\nCertificate pinning is the most effective option for protecting against on-path attacks, especially in potentially hostile regions. Here's why:\n\nCertificate Pinning: This technique involves hardcoding the server's SSL certificate or public key within the mobile application. When a connection is established, the application will verify that the server's certificate matches the pinned certificate. This prevents attackers from using fake or compromised certificates, providing a strong defense against man-in-the-middle attacks.","poster":"CXSSP"}],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Deploy client certificates to all devices in the network.","C":"Configure certificate pinning inside the application.","D":"Enable HSTS on the application's server side for all communication.","A":"Utilize the SAN certificate to enable a single certificate for all regions."},"exam_id":343},{"id":"mO1C48JqPfBGj5VvTtsi","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/119435-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-325-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":343,"timestamp":"2023-08-30 15:48:00","isMC":true,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Here's why:\n\nCloud-Scrubbing Services: Cloud-scrubbing services are designed to mitigate DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks by redirecting traffic through a cloud-based filtering system.
