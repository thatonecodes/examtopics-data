Based on a few assumptions like if company provided devices prior that means they have to handle work related data in their devices. If data is stored MOST of the companies uses MDP and requires the user to give up rights of the device to IT and Security. If this is the case then remote wipe is the correct answer. There is always option two where only use of the device is to access company emails, time card, and other simple apps this normally does not required MDM but they will will lean to MFA as a way to prevent access of the app but the data is not stored in the device is access through the web. The question leans me more to ANSWER C but D is also correct in some cases.
