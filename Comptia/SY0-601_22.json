They are part of the broader category of security controls known as \"security operations\" or \"incident response\" controls. Detective controls are designed to discover and raise an alert when unauthorized or malicious activities occur, allowing the organization to respond promptly to mitigate the impact of security incidents.\n\nExamples of detective controls include security monitoring systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), log analysis tools, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and network traffic analysis solutions. These tools continuously monitor the network, systems, and applications for signs of suspicious or anomalous behavior, such as unusual access patterns, potential breaches, or data exfiltration attempts.","comment_id":"961592","timestamp":"1690201800.0","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1682222820.0","comment_id":"877850","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think it is preventative.

A SIEM, or security information and event management, system aggregates and analyzes log data from various sources in real-time. The correlation engine is the component of the SIEM that processes the log data and identifies potential security incidents. By adjusting the sensitivity levels of the correlation engine, the security analyst can control the number and types of alerts that are generated. This can help reduce the number of false positives and create a baseline of normal operations, allowing the security analyst to focus on investigating only the most relevant alerts.
