DLP solutions are designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized transmission of sensitive data outside of the network. It can monitor email messages, file transfers, and other communications, and can be configured to block or quarantine any outbound traffic that contains sensitive information. HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System), HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System), and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) are security solutions that are primarily focused on detecting and responding to various forms of malicious activity on a system or network.

EDR is a software agent that collects system data and logs for analysis by a monitoring system to provide early detection of threats. It´s not so much on preventing bad things. The Problem is there a dozent of different solutions out there with different acronyms. I guess a EPP (Enpoint Protection Platform) could be mistaken with EDR here.

Having a packaged solution makes updating easier, and frequently these products are designed to integrate into an enterprise-level solution with a centralized management platform. Some of the common EDR components include antivirus, anti-malware, software patching, firewall, and DLP solutions.

The CISO's concern is clearly the use of personal emails. So, what if employees send sensitive info via corporate email it's okay? Or maybe, the corporate email security is hardened and has DLP already and that they can't implement DLP on personal emails e.g. yahoo mail?
