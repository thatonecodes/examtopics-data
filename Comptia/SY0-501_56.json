A federation server on one side (the Accounts side) authenticates the user through the standard means in Active Directory Domain Services and then issues a token containing a series of claims about the user, including its identity. On the other side, the Resources side, another federation server validates the token and issues another token for the local servers to accept the claimed identity. This allows a system to provide controlled access to its resources or services to a user that belongs to another security realm without requiring the user to authenticate directly to the system and without the two systems sharing a database of user identities or passwords.\nADFS uses a claims-based access-control authorization model. This process involves authenticating users via cookies and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). That means ADFS is a type of Security Token Service, or STS.

This can lead to a variety of issues when investigating security incidents or when depending on MAC addresses as part of a security control, as the presented address of the device may not be reliable. Because it operates at the Data Link layer, MAC address spoofing is limited to the local broadcast domain.
