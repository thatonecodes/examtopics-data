Already have sec+, cysa, and pentest. Seems to me that whenever CompTIA gives \"change default password\" as an option, that is the answer. That is always the first thing you do. \nAside from that, there are a lot of good ideas in this option.

The user recently purchased a connected home assistant and multiple IoT devices in an effort to automate the home. Some of the IoT devices are wearables, and other are installed in the user's automobiles. The current home network is configured as a single flat network behind an ISP-supplied router. The router has a single IP address, and the router performs NAT on incoming traffic to route it to individual devices.\nWhich of the following security controls would address the user's privacy concerns and provide the BEST level of security for the home network?","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"Change all default passwords on the IoT devices, disable Internet access for the IoT devices and the home assistant, obtain routable IP addresses for all devices, and implement IPv6 and IPSec protections on all network traffic.","B":"Install a firewall capable of cryptographically separating network traffic, require strong authentication to access all IoT devices, and restrict network access for the home assistant based on time-of-day restrictions.","C":"Segment the home network to separate network traffic from users and the IoT devices, ensure security settings on the home assistant support no or limited recording capability, and install firewall rules on the router to restrict traffic to the home assistant as much as possible.","A":"Ensure all IoT devices are configured in a geofencing mode so the devices do not work when removed from the home network.

The bad actors are specifically attacking the cryptography (i.e. they're factoring the key to break the cryptography). There is no way to factor large elliptical curve cryptography.
