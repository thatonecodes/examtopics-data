Phishing typically involves sending mass emails to a large number of recipients, aiming to trick them into clicking on malicious links or providing sensitive information. The email in this scenario seems to fit this pattern, as it contains suspicious links that do not correspond to the company's legitimate links. Business Email Compromise (BEC), on the other hand, is more targeted. It often involves attackers gaining access to a legitimate business email account and using it to send fraudulent emails to specific individuals within the organization. These emails usually request actions like transferring funds or sharing confidential information.
