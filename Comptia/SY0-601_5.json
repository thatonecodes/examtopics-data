Replacing the traditional key with an RFID key would be the BEST option in this scenario. The use of an RFID key system provides more secure access control than traditional keys, as the keys cannot be duplicated easily, and the access logs are easier to maintain. Additionally, an RFID key system allows the security team to more effectively monitor access to the facility and to limit access to specific areas as necessary. Installing a camera or setting motion-sensing lights would be helpful for monitoring, but they would not necessarily prevent unauthorized access.

This option introduces an electronic access control mechanism that can provide enhanced security compared to traditional keys.\n\nBy replacing the traditional key with an RFID key, the security engineer can leverage technology to improve access control. RFID keys typically contain a unique identifier that can be scanned by a reader to grant or deny access. This system allows for more granular control over who can enter the facility, as access can be restricted based on the specific RFID key credentials.\n\nRFID keys can also offer additional features such as logging access events, enabling centralized access management, and facilitating quick revocation of access in case of lost or stolen keys.

Increased security: RFID keys are more difficult to duplicate compared to physical keys, reducing the risk of unauthorized key copying.\n\n2. Access control management: RFID keys can be easily activated or deactivated from the access control system, allowing the security team to grant or revoke access quickly.\n\n3.

Surrounding the property with fencing and gates\n\nTo implement a stronger preventative access control in this scenario, surrounding the property with fencing and gates would be the most effective option. This physical security measure creates a physical barrier that prevents unauthorized individuals from even reaching the door, making it much more difficult for someone to attempt to pick the lock or gain access to the secure facility in the first place.\n\nWhile options like replacing the traditional key with an RFID key, installing a camera, and setting motion-sensing lights can enhance security, they primarily address issues after an unauthorized access attempt has been made or are focused on surveillance and identification rather than preventing physical access to the facility. Fencing and gates, on the other hand, provide a proactive and physical deterrent to unauthorized access."},{"content":"Replacing a traditional key with an RFID key (Option A) is indeed a strong security measure, especially for preventing unauthorized physical access. RFID keys offer enhanced security because they are often more difficult to duplicate or pick compared to traditional keys. This option is a valid choice for improving access control and preventing unauthorized entry.\n\nHowever, the choice between Option A (RFID key) and Option D (fencing and gates) may depend on various factors, including the specific security needs, budget, and the facility's location. If the primary concern is unauthorized physical access at the door, then Option A (RFID key) would be an effective choice. On the other hand, if there are broader security concerns, such as unauthorized access from multiple points or the need to secure the entire perimeter, Option D (fencing and gates) may be the more comprehensive solution.\n\nUltimately, both options (A and D) can enhance security, but the choice may vary depending on the specific security requirements of the facility.\n\nI hate it here","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1726972080.0","comment_id":"1059010","poster":"TheFivePips"},{"poster":"manyoo77","comment_id":"1241333","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct one!","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720002960.0"},{"poster":"russian","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nNothing else prevents anyone from continuing to pick the lock until they succeed.","comment_id":"1197314","timestamp":"1713367920.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705175940.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nLet's focus on some of the keywords which are pick, lock, several attempts, and preventive.
