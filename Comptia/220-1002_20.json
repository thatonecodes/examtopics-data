Moreover the answer is I made some updates.\n\nAnyway \"let's have a look to your settings makes sense\" as they are the main thing I would check. However I will stick with comptia method and ask about changes. \n\nRegarding the port, 143 and 993 are both IMAP ports, but 993 is hw safe one and would never suggest a customer to set an unsafe or less safe port.\n\nAnd in the end I would educate the user.

It doesn't have to be full IT course - just a quick summary of what was done and why so the user is aware that it is not some voodoo magic.

If there was an optional answer of \"follow up with the user to confirm their email was working,\" that would probably be the correct answer, but since it wasn't the next should be to close the ticket in my opinion. Explaining could possibly be seen as jargon going off about port numbers and email standards. On the flip side of that in favour of educating the user, on the 4.7 video Messer says \"by spending a little bit of extra time with someone, they'll be more knowledgeable of the entire process and the technologies behind it.\" So there's that too. But simply because it's not written by Comptia I will go with closing the ticket rather than educating the user. Just my opinion."}],"content":"IMHO it should be\nHas anything changed recently?\nPlease change your port number to 993\nClose the ticket out\n\nPer Prowse in 4.7 under dealing with difficult customers/situations, \"Ask\ncomputer-oriented, open-ended questions when eliciting answers from\nthe customers (for example, ask “What is wrong with the computer?”\nor “What can you tell me about this computer?”). Stick with the senses;\nquestions such as “What type of strange behavior did you see from the\ncomputer?” keeps customers more relaxed and can help you to narrow\ndown the cause of the problem.\" Also, the answer in return where the user states they have recently updated their phone goes more smoothly with this question, rather than the statement of \"Let's take a look at your phone settings\" which can be interpreted as you already know the answer to the problem without doing further questioning to determine the cause. \nAs others mentioned already, IMAPS (SSL IMAP) uses port 993 so that is correct.","timestamp":"1656459960.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"624319"},{"comment_id":"596937","content":"Is a normal procedure for a help desk technician to educate the user after this type of computer issue?
