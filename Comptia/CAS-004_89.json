So, A TLS version mismatch between the client and server is a common cause of such errors. OpenVPN can support multiple versions of TLS (e.g., TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3), and if the client is trying to use a version that the server does not support (or vice versa), the handshake will fail, leading to errors like those shown in the log.

Obtain the device ID using dmesg and update the portable storage inventory. In this scenario, the security analyst is investigating a potential insider threat involving the use of an unauthorized USB device to exfiltrate proprietary data. The primary focus should be on identifying the USB device used for the exfiltration and taking steps to track it. \ndmesg: On Linux systems, dmesg is a command used to view the kernel's log messages, which can provide information about newly connected hardware devices, including USB devices. By using dmesg, the analyst can check the logs for entries related to the connection of the unauthorized USB device, including the device ID, which is critical for identifying and tracking the device.\nUpdating the portable storage inventory: Once the device is identified, it’s important to update the inventory to keep track of all connected and authorized USB devices.
