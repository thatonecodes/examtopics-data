{"pageProps":{"questions":[{"id":"DUgxqwHVEKt9qDeNTOl0","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1676045100.0","content":"An IPv6 address consists of 128 bits. IPv6 was designed to replace the original IPv4 protocol, which used 32-bit addresses. The growing popularity of the Internet and the increasing number of connected devices led to a shortage of available IPv4 addresses, so the longer, 128-bit addresses of IPv6 were developed to address this problem.\n\nIPv6 addresses are represented in hexadecimal format, and are typically written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. For example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. This format provides a much larger address space than IPv4, enabling the Internet to continue to grow and expand well into the future.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"804543"}],"question_id":51,"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98736-exam-lx0-104-topic-5-question-1-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-02-10 17:05:00","answer_description":"","answer":"D","question_text":"How many bits make up an IPv6 address?","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1676045100,"choices":{"B":"48","C":"64","D":"128","A":"32","E":"256"},"answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"5","exam_id":354},{"id":"tKG3dLL64RpB4FdvnK2n","question_text":"SIMULATION -\nWhat is the name of the file that defines the sources (like DNS or local configuration files) and the order in which they are consulted when resolving hostnames?\n(Specify the full name of the file, including path.)","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1675987680,"topic":"5","discussion":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1676046300.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"804565","content":"/etc/nsswitch.conf is a configuration file that specifies the order in which various Name Service Switch (NSS) libraries are used to resolve different types of information. This file determines how the system should look up information such as hosts, services, and networks. It specifies the sources the system should use to look up this information, such as the local /etc/hosts file, a DNS server, or a NIS server, and the order in which the sources should be consulted.\n\nFor example, the line \"hosts: files dns\" in /etc/nsswitch.conf indicates that the system should first look in the local /etc/hosts file for a hostname and IP address mapping, and then, if the information is not found there, it should query a DNS server. This allows administrators to customize the information resolution process to meet their specific needs.","poster":"linux_admin"}],"poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"803817","upvote_count":"1","content":"The file that defines the sources and the order in which they are consulted when resolving hostnames is typically called /etc/nsswitch.conf.","timestamp":"1675987680.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-02-10 01:08:00","exam_id":354,"answer":"/etc/nsswitch.conf","answer_description":"","question_id":52,"answer_ET":"/etc/nsswitch.conf","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98650-exam-lx0-104-topic-5-question-10-discussion/","question_images":[],"isMC":false},{"id":"APB77gY4T1tPaFt07kEz","answer_ET":"14","question_id":53,"unix_timestamp":1675987980,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98652-exam-lx0-104-topic-5-question-15-discussion/","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-10 01:13:00","answer":"14","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1675987980.0","content":"The number of IP addresses that can be used for unique hosts inside the IPv4 subnet 192.168.2.128/28 is 14.\n\nThe CIDR notation \"/28\" means that 28 bits are used for the network portion of the address and 4 bits are used for the host portion. In this case, the network address is 192.168.2.128 and the network mask is 255.255.255.240.\n\nTo calculate the number of host addresses in a subnet, subtract the network address (192.168.2.128) and the broadcast address (192.168.2.143) from the number of possible addresses (2^4=16).
