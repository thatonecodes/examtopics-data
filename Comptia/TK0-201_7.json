Unlikely, because adding supplemental material will disrupt the flow of the class.\n\nExplanation:\nThe action is unlikely to accomplish the goal because it is not directly related to managing the time available for the course. Handing out several supplemental labs for homework at the beginning of the course is likely to disrupt the flow of the class, which may lead to learners feeling overwhelmed and unable to complete the course within the allocated time. Additionally, learners may spend more time on the supplemental labs and neglect the core course material. This is not an effective way to manage time available for the course. Therefore, option D is the best statement that explains why the action is unlikely to accomplish the goal."}],"answer":"A"},{"id":"DohjoUq7UHglQZIeWuKx","timestamp":"2023-03-30 22:50:00","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"An instructor arrives at a remote classroom site about an hour before class begins only to find the wrong student material (e.g. books) has been shipped.

Use past material from another course for the first day and catch up during subsequent days.\n\nThis option allows the instructor to still conduct the class on the scheduled day while ensuring that the learners receive relevant information. Using past material can provide an introduction to the topic, while subsequent days can be used to catch up on the missed material. It is also important for the instructor to work with the publisher/vendor to rectify the situation and ensure that the correct material is received for future classes.","comment_id":"856257","timestamp":"1727729400.0","poster":"JimGrayham"}]},{"id":"B8cXEZ5MU8vR1BCl0UED","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1725748860.0","poster":"JimGrayham","content":"A. Offer more assistance to Group B and give Group A an extended break.\n\nExplanation:\nThe instructor should offer more assistance to Group B and give Group A an extended break. The instructor can provide extra attention and support to the learners in Group B to help them catch up with Group A. This can include additional examples, exercises, and explanations to help Group B understand the material better. Giving Group A an extended break can help maintain their motivation and give them an opportunity to recharge. Combining both groups together may not be practical, as it can lead to a larger class size and could be disruptive for the learners. Offering incentives to Group B may create an unhealthy competition between the groups and may not be effective in motivating learners to learn. Switching some individuals from Group A to Group B may not be a good idea as it can be disruptive to the learning process and may create resentment among the learners. Therefore, offering more assistance to Group B and giving Group A an extended break is the best option for the instructor to continue the class.","comment_id":"832395"}],"exam_id":369,"answers_community":[],"answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1678236060,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/101819-exam-tk0-201-topic-2-question-29-discussion/","question_id":33,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","topic":"2","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-03-08 01:41:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Offer Group B incentives if they can keep up with Group A's work","A":"Offer more assistance to Group Band give Group A an extended break","C":"Combine both groups together and let them work on the material.","D":"Switch some of the individuals from Group A to Group B"},"question_text":"After the first week of a two week training class, the instructor notices that there are four learners in Group A that are motivated and doing a great job in with the material.

Guide the learner to answering their own question would be the BEST action for the instructor to take. This approach encourages the learner to think critically about the material and apply their understanding to the question at hand. It also helps to build the learner's confidence and reinforces their knowledge of the topic. Additionally, guiding the learner to answer their own question is a more interactive approach that encourages active engagement and participation, which can be beneficial for both the learner and the instructor.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1671152700.0","poster":"kadezalei","comment_id":"382950","content":"I believe this should be D - Diagram the steps needed to answer the question.","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"2","answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2021-06-16 01:05:00","question_images":[],"exam_id":369,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/55401-exam-tk0-201-topic-2-question-31-discussion/","question_id":34,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Request another learner answers the question.","D":"Diagram the steps needed to answer the question","A":"Guide the learner to answering their own question.","B":"Employ active listening and respond with a complete answer."},"unix_timestamp":1623798300,"question_text":"A learner asks a question about material that has been thoroughly covered.

This approach allows the instructor to identify which part of the topic the learner is struggling with and provide further clarification.\n\nUsing a whiteboard or flip chart (Option A) can be helpful in visualizing a concept, but it may not necessarily address the learner's specific confusion. Redirecting the question to the class using active listening (Option B) may not be effective in this situation because it does not directly address the learner's question. Asking the learner to remain after class to discuss the concept further (Option C) may be necessary in some cases, but it should not be the first step taken by the instructor. It is important to provide support and clarification during class time to ensure that all learners are able to understand the topic being discussed.","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1680491400,"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2023-04-03 05:10:00","question_id":35,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/104927-exam-tk0-201-topic-2-question-33-discussion/"}],"exam":{"provider":"Comptia","isBeta":false,"id":369,"numberOfQuestions":90,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"TK0-201"},"currentPage":7},"__N_SSP":true}
