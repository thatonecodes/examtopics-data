It allows them to maintain a single account across all participating websites. A user registers with an OpenID system on a given domain as they would with any other account, and a website under that OpenID domain gives the user the option to log in using that system. The website then contacts its external OpenID provider to verify that the login credentials provided by the user are correct. Large companies such as Google and Amazon use their own OpenID systems.
