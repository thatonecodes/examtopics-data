SAN (Storage Area Network).\n\nA SAN is a dedicated high-speed network for storage devices. It provides block-level access to storage devices, allowing multiple servers to access shared storage. By adding more storage to the SAN, the technician can increase the available space for the virtual machines.\n\nHere's why the other options are less relevant:\n\nA. SCSI (Small Computer System Interface): SCSI is a type of storage interface, not a network type.\nB. NAC (Network Access Control): NAC is a security solution that controls access to network resources. It's not directly related to storage expansion.\nD. WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider): A WISP provides wireless internet access. It's not relevant to storage expansion in a data center environment.\nTherefore, a SAN is the most appropriate solution for increasing storage capacity in a virtualized environment.\n\nGG","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732067100.0","comment_id":"1315003","poster":"Nate_A"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nA Storage Area Network (SAN) is the only option when we talk about adding more storage capacity.","timestamp":"1705363620.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1123779"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1705363620,"timestamp":"2024-01-16 01:07:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/131281-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-293-discussion/","choices":{"D":"WISP","A":"SCSI","C":"SAN","B":"NAC"},"answer_images":[]},{"id":"cWaqZ4tpKGJPoFvJW98B","answer_ET":"AB","question_text":"A cloud engineer, who is designing a cloud architecture, needs to ensure the solution is able to immediately fail over to another region in case of an outage and also scale up in the event of high utilization.

High availability - High availability architecture is designed to minimize downtime by providing redundant systems and components. It ensures that if one region or data center experiences an outage, the workload can failover to another region with minimal interruption.\n\nB. Elasticity - Elasticity is the ability to automatically scale resources up or down in response to changing demand. It allows the infrastructure to expand during periods of high utilization and contract when the demand decreases, which helps maintain performance and cost efficiency.","timestamp":"1714238520.0","poster":"Nater6969","comment_id":"1055760","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1698427320,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-10-27 19:22:00"},{"id":"v7nrcXgpoA9od1CO0M8V","choices":{"C":"5","A":"0","D":"10","B":"1"},"discussion":[{"content":"A is the right answer\nRAID 0 is a configuration that stripes data across multiple disks without parity or redundancy.
