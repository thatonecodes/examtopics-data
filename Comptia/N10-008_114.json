To improve mobility, there needs to be a balance between determining what constitutes a \"good\" signal and the frequency with which a client tries to associate with different APs. Many adapters support a roaming \"aggressiveness\" setting that can be configured to prevent a Wi-Fi adapter \"flapping\" between two APs or (conversely) to prevent a client remaining associated with a more distant AP when it could achieve better bandwidth through one closer to it.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"548180"}],"poster":"Tyrial","comment_id":"546806"}],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect answer is A","upvote_count":"2","poster":"some_specialist","timestamp":"1644434940.0","comment_id":"544046"},{"comment_id":"533892","timestamp":"1643297700.0","content":"The answer being B doesn't add up to me.

Port security\n\nPort security is a feature that can be implemented on network switches to control which devices are allowed to connect to the network through a specific port. It allows network administrators to specify the number of allowed MAC addresses on a port, and it can shut down the port or take other actions if it detects unauthorized devices.\n\nIn this scenario, port security could have prevented the unauthorized personal laptop from connecting to the corporate LAN, as the port would have been configured to only allow the authorized MAC addresses associated with the company's devices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.
