Since only one user is experiencing the issue and other users are not, it's likely that the problem is localized to the specific user's connection. Replacing the user's network cable is a good first step because a faulty or damaged cable can easily cause CRC errors.\n\nA. Replace the uplink cable for the access switch: This is less likely to be the cause because the problem is isolated to one user's switchport, not affecting other users.\n\nC. Replace the NIC for the user's PC: This could be a potential cause but is a more drastic step. It's better to start with simpler solutions, like checking or replacing the network cable, before replacing hardware components.\n\nD. Replace the access switch: This is not likely the cause since multiple users are not experiencing issues.

When packets arrive out of order or with significant delays between them, it can lead to jumbled and distorted audio in VoIP calls.

Bandwidth: While insufficient bandwidth can cause issues with VoIP, it typically results in dropped calls or reduced audio quality rather than packets being out of order.\n\nC. Latency: High latency can cause delays in audio but does not typically result in packets being received out of order.\n\nD.

Jitter\n\nJitter refers to the variation in packet arrival times. In VoIP, when packets arrive at different times or out of order due to varying delays in the network, it can cause issues such as jumbled or distorted audio. Managing jitter is crucial for maintaining the quality of real-time communication like VoIP.\n\nBandwidth refers to the capacity of the network but is not directly responsible for out-of-order packets.\n\nLatency is the overall time it takes for a packet to travel from source to destination but does not explain the out-of-order delivery.\n\nDelay is similar to latency, referring to the time taken for data to travel across the network, but it's the variation in delay (jitter) that leads to the described VoIP issues.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1265050","poster":"dadba8c","timestamp":"1723535040.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nout of order/sequence = jitter","poster":"igorclapa","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1238773","timestamp":"1719586200.0"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/143025-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-844-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Bandwidth","C":"Latency","A":"Jitter","D":"Delay"},"answer_images":[]},{"id":"lLI99ntC76F2WOQMok2L","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/142482-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-845-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following should be used to associate an IPv6 address with a domain name?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe AAAA record is used in DNS to associate an IPv6 address with a domain name.
