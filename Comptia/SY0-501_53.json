Choose Your Own Device (CYOD). With this approach, the company creates a\nlist of approved devices that meet the company’s minimum security standards.

This approach does help in mitigating security risks associated with BYOD, since all employees will be using devices\nthat have a minimum level of security.\nThe second approach is Company-Owned and -Provided Equipment (COPE). Using\nCOPE, the company has complete control of the devices, and thus it can ensure a higher\nlevel of security. However, this approach has its own issues. The first is the issue of cost.\nIt is expensive to provide portable devices to your entire staff, or even a significant portion\nof the staff.

COPE will allow the company to standardize devices because they know exactly what devices are being purchased and replaced, and when.

Since the company also considers reimbursement a \"problem\" (I'm guessing because they don't want to reimburse their employees for a bunch of overpriced flagship phones), they can also manage their expenses better by controlling the purchase of more budget-friendly models for their employees.
