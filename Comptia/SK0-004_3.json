I do it at work when testing outlook365 connection to check if it's blocked by firewall or not: telnet smtp.office365.com 587\n\nals, from chatgpt:\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. telnet\nExplanation:\nTelnet is a client used to connect to a specific port on a remote system. In this case, it can be used to test whether the firewall is blocking traffic on the relevant port (such as port 25 for SMTP, if the notification is being sent via email). By attempting to connect to the server on the specific port, the technician can determine whether the firewall is blocking the connection.\n\nHere’s how telnet can be useful:\n\nThe technician can use telnet to connect to the server’s SMTP port (usually port 25, 587, or 465) and see if the server responds. If telnet cannot establish a connection, it may indicate that a firewall or other network configuration is blocking that specific port.","timestamp":"1737914160.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1347048"}],"question_id":12,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"answer":"D"},{"id":"40uni695NOAENXLiFRSL","unix_timestamp":1608623460,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/40532-exam-sk0-004-topic-1-question-259-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"A server has two power supplies.
