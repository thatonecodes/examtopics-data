Cloud bursting\n\nExplanation:\nPrivate cloud resources can only meet 75% of the demand, meaning the company needs an additional 25% of capacity.\nCloud bursting allows an application to run primarily in a private cloud while automatically \"bursting\" into a public cloud when demand exceeds private cloud capacity.\nThis technique ensures that 100% of the application's resource needs are met while still prioritizing private cloud usage to minimize costs.","comment_id":"1363007","upvote_count":"1","poster":"BigM","timestamp":"1740746640.0"},{"timestamp":"1729580520.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFolks, cloud bursting is the right response in this scenario.\nTo accommodate 100% of the application's resource requirements, the cloud administrator can implement cloud bursting. This technique allows the application to primarily run on the private cloud 75% while leveraging public cloud resources to handle the additional 25% during peak demand.

A would work but since this is an application, I would think B scales better.

Vertical scaling is using different, more powerful hardware already existing within the cloud provider. But in this case it's a private cloud and it maxes out all resources with only 75% of the job done. \nC is the correct answer becasue you need to tap into the public cloud to finish the job.

This allows the application to use more resources from the same machine, making it suitable for scenarios where additional capacity is needed but doesn't require provisioning entirely new instances.","poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1694503140.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"In contrast, the other options don't directly address this specific requirement:\n\n- **Horizontal Scaling (Adding More Instances)**: Horizontal scaling involves adding more virtual machines or instances to handle increased demand, not increasing the resources of existing instances. It's typically used for distributing the workload across multiple machines, which can be beneficial for redundancy and load balancing but may not address resource constraints on a single instance.\n\n- **Cloud Bursting (Using External Cloud Resources)**: Cloud bursting involves dynamically provisioning resources from an external cloud provider to handle peaks in demand.
