Data completeness\n\nThe greatest issue presented by the missing rows of data is related to data completeness. Data completeness refers to the extent to which all required data is present in the dataset. In this scenario, the missing rows indicate that the dataset is not complete, which can lead to biased analyses and inaccurate conclusions if not addressed.\n\nWhile data integrity, consistency, and accuracy are also important data qualities, the missing rows directly impact data completeness by reducing the overall amount of data available for analysis. Ensuring data completeness is essential for reliable and meaningful analysis and decision-making.","timestamp":"1729195920.0","comment_id":"1197453","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1713384720,"timestamp":"2024-04-17 22:12:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/139013-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-163-discussion/","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Data integrity","D":"Data accuracy","A":"Data completeness","C":"Data consistency"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An analyst is summarizing the results from a recently completed survey.

SQL\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is specifically designed for retrieving, manipulating, and managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is the standard language for accessing and querying data stored in databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and others. SQL provides powerful capabilities for selecting specific data, filtering results, joining tables, aggregating data, and performing various other operations necessary for data analysis. While R and Python can also be used for data analysis and manipulation, SQL is the most appropriate tool for retrieving data from a relational database management system.","comment_id":"1197454","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","timestamp":"1729195980.0"}],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following data analytics tools would be BEST to retrieve data from a relational database management system?","topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_id":73,"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","exam_id":351,"choices":{"D":"SAS","C":"SQL","B":"Python","A":"R"},"unix_timestamp":1713384780,"answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/139014-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-164-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-04-17 22:13:00"},{"id":"pVQST3si88YfJft9gryZ","timestamp":"2024-04-17 22:18:00","discussion":[{"poster":"Swift_and_Quick","content":"B. Data accuracy\nF. Data consistency\n\nBy standardizing the term used for \"average\" responses to just \"average,\" the analyst is likely aiming to improve both data accuracy and data consistency.\n\nData accuracy is crucial in ensuring that the information collected reflects the true values or opinions of the respondents. By consolidating variations of the term \"average\" into a single standard term, the analyst reduces potential confusion or misinterpretation of the data.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining data consistency enhances the overall quality and usability of the dataset. Consistent formatting and terminology make it easier to analyze and compare data across different responses and sections of the survey.","timestamp":"1729196280.0","comment_id":"1197456","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1713385080,"question_id":74,"choices":{"C":"Data completeness","B":"Data accuracy","F":"Data consistency","A":"Data attribute limitations","D":"Data manipulation","E":"Data blending"},"answers_community":[],"exam_id":351,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/139015-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-165-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"BF","question_images":[],"answer":"BF","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A data analyst is reviewing the results of a survey.
