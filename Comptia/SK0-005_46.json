ReFS (Resilient File System)\n\nReFS is designed by Microsoft to maximize data availability, scale efficiently to large data sets across diverse workloads, and provide data integrity with resiliency to corruption. It's particularly well-suited for large volumes, making it an ideal choice for a 4TB LUN. ReFS is compatible with Windows Server operating systems and is designed to work with data storage solutions such as SANs.","poster":"surfuganda","timestamp":"1726200300.0"}],"choices":{"B":"FAT","A":"ZFS","D":"ReFS","C":"VMFS"},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-03-13 07:05:00","question_id":226,"unix_timestamp":1710309900,"question_text":"A technician is provisioning a 4TB LUN on a SAN for a Windows server.

Relay agent.\n\nWhen setting up a second VLAN for end users, if you want the DHCP server to receive client requests from a different subnet, you need to use a DHCP relay agent. DHCP relay agents are used to forward DHCP requests from clients in one subnet or VLAN to DHCP servers in another subnet or VLAN. This allows DHCP servers to serve clients that are not on the same subnet or VLAN as the server itself.","comment_id":"1196857","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138907-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-335-discussion/","exam_id":365,"answer":"D","question_text":"A systems administrator is setting up a second VLAN for end users.

Power supply.\n\nIf only two out of four drives are consistently found and another drive is connecting and disconnecting randomly, it suggests an intermittent power issue. This could be due to a failing power supply unit (PSU) not providing enough power consistently to all the drives, resulting in some drives not being detected or being intermittently detected. Rebooting the server might temporarily resolve the issue as the power supply resets, but the problem persists due to the underlying issue with power delivery. Therefore, the power supply is the most likely culprit in this scenario."}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":365,"choices":{"D":"CPU","B":"Power supply","A":"RAM","C":"Cooling failure"},"topic":"1"},{"id":"Xm2SAK2GVVez0zjR974S","discussion":[{"poster":"Stache","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735786020.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nGoing with (C)\n* Only reason it isn't A is because question asked for \"the most available space\" which C delivers.","comment_id":"1335340"},{"poster":"fluke92","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1316373","timestamp":"1732288320.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\nB.

Personal feelings aside (and mentioned later) it's the most capacity and provides OS redundancy.\n\nI absolutely abhor this answer, because the big thing with RAID 5 is hot swappable redundant disks, and not having any spare disks is borderline painful, but having all 8 disks active means you have more storage than having 6 of the disks active and 2 spares. In an ideal world, C would be 7 active and 1 spare drive, but that's not what it is. Given RAID 5 loses the equivalent of 1 complete disk to parity information, the difference is 7TB with 2.4 sitting on the shelf, or 9.4TB with nothing sitting on the shelf for when a drive fails. It goes against every best practice I have ever run up against, but C is technically the most correct answer, even if it's not \"best practice.\"","timestamp":"1728924480.0"}],"topic":"1","answer":"C","exam_id":365,"question_id":229,"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"OS-Two SSD RAID 1 -\n\nDB logs - Two SSD RAID 1 -\n\nData - Six 1.2TB 15K SAS RAID 5 -\nTWO hot-spare disks 1.2TB 15K SAS","D":"OS - Two SSD RAID 0 -\n\nDB Logs - Two SSD RAID 1 -\nData - Eight 1.2TB 15K SAS RAID 5\nNo hot-spare disks","C":"OS - Two SSD RAID 1 -\n\nDB logs - Two SSD RAID 1 -\nData - Eight 1.2TB 15K SAS RAID 5\nNo hot-spare disks","B":"OS - One SSD RAID 0 -\n\nDB logs - One SSD RAID 0 -\nData - Eight 1.2TB 15K SAS RAID 6\nTwo hot-spare disks SSD Disks"},"question_text":"An engineer is configuring the RAID on a new server that will support a large database handling real-time data processing.
