By isolating sensitive systems (e.g., placing them in separate network segments or on different machines), you reduce the number of potential entry points that attackers can exploit.","comment_id":"1368542","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1735998120.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is:\nB. Isolation\n\nExplanation:\nIsolation is the best method to decrease a company's hardware attack surface. By isolating systems and devices, the company reduces the number of potential entry points for attackers. Isolation techniques include:\n\nNetwork isolation: Segregating critical systems into separate network segments to prevent unauthorized access.\nPhysical isolation: Keeping sensitive hardware (e.g., servers or devices handling confidential data) in secure, access-controlled locations.\nLogical isolation: Using software-based controls, such as virtual LANs (VLANs) or containerization, to separate workloads or processes.\nBy isolating hardware and systems, the attack surface is minimized because attackers are restricted from accessing unnecessary or unrelated systems.","comment_id":"1336395","poster":"musaabokisec","comments":[{"comment_id":"1340351","timestamp":"1736858820.0","poster":"Eracle","upvote_count":"1","content":"The question key is \"hardware\", and Virtualization is the best solution to decresce company's hardware attack surface, because it reduces the number of hardware."}],"upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"1335378","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nVirtualization is the best answer here","timestamp":"1735799700.0","poster":"Fhaddad81"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nVirtualization is the most effective method for decreasing the company's hardware attack surface.","comment_id":"1332127","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ProudFather","timestamp":"1735251300.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following should a systems administrator use to decrease the company's hardware attack surface?","exam_id":368,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1735062120},{"id":"Q3DFy4mmSX4D92qczu0S","topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"A company wants to add an MFA solution for all employees who access the corporate network remotely.
