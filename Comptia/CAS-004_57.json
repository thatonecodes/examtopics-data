DMARC and C. SPF.\n\nDMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is an email authentication protocol that allows domain owners to specify how their domains should be authenticated and what to do if an email fails authentication. DMARC can be used to detect forged sender claims by checking the SPF and DKIM records for the sending domain.\n\nSPF (Sender Policy Framework) is an email authentication protocol that allows domain owners to specify which IP addresses are authorized to send email on their behalf. SPF can be used to detect forged sender claims by checking the IP address of the sending server against the SPF record for the sending domain.","timestamp":"1729629480.0","comment_id":"1051079"},{"timestamp":"1726007520.0","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB. DMARC\nC. SPF\n\nDMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) and SPF (Sender Policy Framework) are both email authentication mechanisms that help prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks. They validate the sender's domain to ensure it matches the domain from which the email claims to originate. This helps detect and prevent forged sender claims in email envelopes.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1004348","poster":"CXSSP"},{"timestamp":"1725495240.0","poster":"gpt_test","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nCorrect Answers:\nB. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)\nExplanation: DMARC builds on the features of both SPF and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail). It allows the sender's domain to specify that they use SPF, DKIM, or both, and what action to take (report, quarantine, or reject) if neither of those authentication methods pass. DMARC also provides a way for recipients to report back to senders about messages that pass and/or fail DMARC evaluation.\n\nC. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)\nExplanation: SPF is an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses during the delivery of the email. By creating an SPF record in the domain's DNS records, the domain administrator can specify which mail servers are allowed to send mail on behalf of the domain. The receiving mail server then checks this record to ensure the mail is coming from an authorized server.","comment_id":"998902","upvote_count":"2"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/119864-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-352-discussion/","answer":"BC","answer_images":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"T4ASGnl1e7OIyBz6ZYDp","topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"weaponxcel","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Implementing OCSP stapling on the server\nExplanation: OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) is a protocol used to check the revocation status of a digital certificate. When a client connects to a server, it may need to check the status of the server's certificate by sending a request to the Certificate Authority (CA). This can introduce a delay, especially if the CA's server is slow or unreachable. OCSP stapling is a solution where the server periodically retrieves its certificate status from the CA and then \"staples\" this status to the TLS handshake. This means the client doesn't need to make a separate connection to the CA, thus reducing the connection time.","comment_id":"998898","timestamp":"1693872480.0"}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"name":"CAS-004","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":642,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":343,"provider":"Comptia"},"currentPage":57},"__N_SSP":true}
