Any data sent on a\nnetwork can be spoofed. Here are a few quick examples of commonly\nspoofed data:\n• Source MAC address and IP address, to make you think a packet came\nfrom somewhere else\n• E-mail address, to make you think an e-mail came from somewhere\nelse\n• Web address, to make you think you are on a Web page you are not on\n• User name, to make you think a certain user is contacting you when in\nreality it’s someone completely different\nGenerally, spoofing isn’t so much a threat as it is a tool to make threats. If\nyou spoof my e-mail address, for example, that by itself isn’t a threat. If you\nuse my e-mail address to pretend to be me, however, and to ask my\nemployees to send in their user names and passwords for network login?\nThat’s clearly a threat. \nMesser\n2.5 - Spoofing\nSpoofing\n• Pretend to be something you aren’t\n• Fake web server, fake DNS server, etc.\n• Email address spoofing\n• The sending address of an email isn’t really the sender","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Z_186","timestamp":"1654821060.0","comment_id":"614274"},{"comment_id":"595827","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis is email spoofing.","poster":"iLikeBeagButt","timestamp":"1651457940.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSpoofing is the right answer\n\nbest way to remember spoofing is to remember that the S stands for spy(from team fortress 2)...","comment_id":"558502","timestamp":"1646100840.0","poster":"kavukkii"},{"content":"The correct answer is Spoofing.

You would need to restore the user’s files from a backup taken prior to the virus. And from my personal experience in IT support, restoring a system from an image (usually via PXE over the network) can take up to an hour or more. If roaming profiles are not being used then all of the user’s profile settings (desktop, favorites, downloads, etc) will be lost – so these things together are not a MINIMAL impact to the user.]","comment_id":"200444","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1598127720.0","comment_id":"163903","upvote_count":"20","poster":"asparagoose","content":"Lol backup during a malware infection"},{"content":"We are dealing with a malware here not a hard disk issues.\nYou are clearly living in the core1 world still haha :D","poster":"Farinaz","comment_id":"570204","timestamp":"1647576780.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1658341380.0","poster":"Aerials","content":"You want to back-up infected files?

I answered C. My thinking as to why C is correct is that the user can still send/receive emails (so no problem with user account permissions) but not being able to see a shared folder can result from that folder having having its permissions manually changed and the users account was missed from the update (in case of a SOHO setup, with only a few users) OR the user was added to a Group that does not have allow permissions for the shared folder so is denied access (because conflicting policies default to implicit deny). In these cases changing the folder share permissions would correct the problem such as “allow” the user directly or create an exception/workaround to the implicit deny for their account.
