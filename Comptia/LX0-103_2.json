Boot device order - The BIOS stores the order in which the system should attempt to boot from available boot devices, such as hard drives, optical drives, and USB devices.\n\nD. Hardware configuration - The BIOS stores information about the system's hardware configuration, such as the type and configuration of storage devices, memory, and other hardware components.","comment_id":"805805","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1676163000.0"}],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-02-12 01:50:00","question_text":"Which of the following information is stored within the BIOS?

The following commands are used to reboot the system when using SysV init:\n\nA. shutdown -r now - The shutdown command is used to bring the system down, either for maintenance or for a reboot. The -r option indicates that the system should be rebooted, and the now argument specifies that the reboot should occur immediately.\n\nC. telinit 6 - The telinit command is used to change the runlevel of the system. The runlevel 6 is used to reboot the system, so the command telinit 6 will cause the system to reboot.","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"805807","timestamp":"1676163060.0"}],"choices":{"E":"shutdown -k now \"rebooting\"","C":"telinit 6","D":"telinit 0","A":"shutdown -r now","B":"shutdown -r \"rebooting\""},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer":"AC"},{"id":"CJHJ8HcFcgtpjEDquzx5","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"BCE","answer":"BCE","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/27150-exam-lx0-103-topic-1-question-16-discussion/","answer_description":"","exam_id":353,"question_id":8,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1596368640,"timestamp":"2020-08-02 13:44:00","choices":{"A":"startd","C":"Upstart","B":"systemd","D":"SysInit","E":"SysV init"},"question_text":"Which of the following are init systems used within Linux systems?

SysV init\n\nAn init system is the first process that is started by the Linux kernel when the system boots, and it is responsible for starting and managing other system processes. There are several init systems used within Linux systems, including:\n\nB. systemd - systemd is a modern init system that is widely used in many Linux distributions, including Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Ubuntu. It is designed to be fast, flexible, and scalable, and it provides many advanced features, such as parallel startup of system services and dynamic management of system resources.\n\nC. Upstart - Upstart is an event-based init system that was developed for the Ubuntu operating system. It provides a powerful and flexible way to manage system services, and it supports parallel startup of system services, which can result in faster boot times.\n\nE. SysV init - SysV init is a traditional init system that is widely used in many Linux distributions. It is a simple and straightforward init system that has been in use for many years and is well-understood and widely supported.","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1676163180.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"https://www.tecmint.com/best-linux-init-systems/","timestamp":"1596368640.0","comment_id":"149080","poster":"adana_kebab"}]},{"id":"yBuodG1GGsltVUkPwRA1","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1631705880,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1676161380.0","comment_id":"805778","content":"The lspci command can display the following information about the system hardware:\n\nA.

Runlevel 1 is single-user mode, which is a minimal environment that provides access to the system for maintenance and repair tasks. In this mode, only the root user is allowed to log in, and only essential system services are running.\n\nThe shutdown command is used to bring the system down to a halt or reboot, and the -R option is used to reboot the system.
