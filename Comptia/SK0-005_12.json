Check the DNS server: Since the server can be accessed by IP address, but not by name, it suggests a problem with name resolution. Checking the DNS server settings and ensuring that the correct records are in place is a good next step.\n\nC. Check the hosts file: The hosts file is a local file on the server that can contain static IP to name mappings. Checking the hosts file is a good next step to ensure that the correct name resolution is taking place.\n\nThe other options may also be helpful in troubleshooting the issue, but they are less likely to be the root cause of the problem. The ping command (E) and tracert command (F) can be used to test network connectivity and identify any routing issues. Checking the default gateway (A) and route tables (B) can help identify any routing issues that may be preventing access to the server.","timestamp":"1729172040.0","poster":"gingasaurusrex","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"715799","timestamp":"1715402400.0","poster":"Pongsathorn","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nObviously, the best answers are C and D."},{"poster":"nixonbii","timestamp":"1713049860.0","comment_id":"694338","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nAgree.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Timock","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"672460","timestamp":"1710779700.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nThese are some steps for resolving issues with DNS.
