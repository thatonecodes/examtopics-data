Tune monitoring in order to reduce false positive rates.\n\nImproving the speed of the identification phase in incident response process involves reducing the amount of data that has to be analyzed to find the incident. Tuning monitoring to reduce false positive rates helps to achieve this goal by reducing the amount of noise in the logs and alerts that have to be analyzed. This means that only the most relevant data is being evaluated, which can significantly reduce the time it takes to identify an incident and move to the next phase of the incident response process. By tuning the monitoring to reduce false positive rates, the systems administrator can focus on only the most important data, which can help to speed up the identification phase and improve overall incident response time."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nReducing false positive rates in monitoring and alerting systems helps to minimize the noise and focus on relevant alerts. By fine-tuning the monitoring rules and thresholds, the security team can filter out non-critical or irrelevant alerts, allowing them to quickly identify genuine security incidents that require immediate attention. This optimization ensures that the incident response team can focus on real threats and avoid wasting time on false alarms, ultimately improving the speed and effectiveness of the identification phase.","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","comment_id":"959889","timestamp":"1690066920.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"poster":"Yawannawanka","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTuning monitoring in order to reduce false positive rates is the BEST approach to improve the speed of the identification phase in the incident response process. By reducing false positives, security analysts can focus on investigating and responding to actual security incidents, rather than spending time on false alarms. This can help speed up the identification phase by allowing analysts to quickly identify and respond to real security incidents. Activating verbose logging in all critical assets, redirecting all events to multiple syslog servers, and increasing the number of sensors present on the environment can also be helpful, but may not have as much of an impact on the speed of the identification phase as tuning monitoring to reduce false positives.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1682119260.0","comment_id":"876911"},{"timestamp":"1675048260.0","content":"I believe some of you guys have dedicated your lives to input wrong answers to throw everyone off.

Weak or default passwords are a common security issue with IoT devices, including cameras. Many users fail to change the default passwords provided by the manufacturer or set weak passwords, making it easy for hackers to gain unauthorized access to the devices.\n\nOnce the hackers have access to these cameras, they can view and potentially record the camera feeds, violating users' privacy and potentially using the feeds for malicious purposes. To prevent such incidents, it is crucial for users to change default passwords to strong, unique passwords and enable additional security measures like two-factor authentication whenever possible.","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","timestamp":"1690126740.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"958957","timestamp":"1689974160.0","content":"All of the above are correct , not sure which one is more likely","poster":"LiteralGod"},{"comment_id":"942484","timestamp":"1688456340.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nevery options in this question are acceptable, but I will Choose B, IOT usually use default account & password,which is weak credential.","poster":"ganganman"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"I think from the fact that they said \"access\" then it must be due to weak credentials.","comment_id":"874908","timestamp":"1681922160.0","poster":"RobbieT"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"ramesh2022","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
