STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)\n\nSTP is a protocol used to prevent loops in Ethernet networks by dynamically disabling redundant links. When multiple links exist between switches for redundancy, STP identifies and blocks redundant paths, ensuring that only one path is active at a time. This prevents loops from forming and causing broadcast storms or other network stability issues. Therefore, enabling STP is essential for ensuring network stability in redundant network link configurations.","comment_id":"1195750","poster":"stanislaus450"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"InjunJim","content":"STP should be enabled by default on the routers, also “prevent stability” sounds like the engineer is purposely trying to cluster#### the whole network.","timestamp":"1703073660.0","comment_id":"1101501"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a logical loop-free topology for Ethernet networks. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. If you have redundant links set up, it is important to utilize STP to prevent loops within the network. If a loop occurs, the performance of the entire network can be degraded due to broadcast storms. Port mirroring is used on a network switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one switch port to a network monitoring connection on another switch port. Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is a security feature that validates Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets in a network. DAI allows a network administrator to intercept, log, and discard ARP packets with invalid MAC address to IP address bindings. A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). Port mirroring, ARP inspection, and VLANs do not add any redundancy to the network.","poster":"Mehsotopes","timestamp":"1699406040.0","comment_id":"1065267"},{"poster":"TheFivePips","comment_id":"983873","content":"Just adding this here for people like me who forgot what 802.1Q was:\n\nIEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q, is the networking standard that supports virtual local area networking (VLANs) on an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network.
