Watering-hole attack.\n\nA watering-hole attack involves compromising a website that the target group frequently visits and trusts, such as the public Internet forum in this scenario. By infecting the forum with malware or malicious scripts, the attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in the visitors' browsers or plugins to gain unauthorized access to their systems or steal sensitive information.\n\nIn this context, targeting the public Internet forum frequented by company engineers provides the attacker with an opportunity to infect the engineers' systems when they visit the compromised website, potentially leading to the compromise of sensitive company information or the engineers' credentials. Therefore, a watering-hole attack is the tactic an attacker would most likely use in this scenario.","poster":"Geronemo"},{"poster":"Jackwasblk","comment_id":"1078648","upvote_count":"6","content":"A watering hole attack is a form of cyberattack that targets groups of users by infecting websites that they commonly visit.","timestamp":"1700764200.0"},{"poster":"Jackwasblk","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe attackers would attack the forum… aka watering hole attack… no one is sharing credentials on a public forum or else you should be fired immediately","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1700764140.0","comment_id":"1078647"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nwatering hole attack","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1700623320.0","comment_id":"1076887","poster":"[Removed]"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAlthough watering hole is attack is possible, I think the most prevalent attack that can be seen on a public forum would be credential harvesting...","poster":"Rumchata556","comment_id":"1071126","timestamp":"1700028420.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1722433500.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JasonMunoz","comment_id":"1258911","content":"Thats relevant for sure, but they want the MOST likely.

Credential Harvesting \n\nCredential harvesting is a technique used by attackers to obtain sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from unsuspecting users. In this case, the attacker may target the engineers participating in the forum to gain access to their login credentials for various purposes, including unauthorized access to company systems or personal accounts.\n\nBy tricking the engineers into revealing their credentials, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, compromise systems, or carry out further malicious activities. This tactic is particularly effective in scenarios where users may reuse passwords across multiple platforms or have weak password practices.","timestamp":"1699567980.0","comment_id":"1066776","poster":"Ajax22"}],"exam_id":367,"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (84%)","B (16%)"],"question_text":"Company engineers regularly participate in a public Internet forum with other engineers throughout the industry.

By doing so, the PC's operating system and applications are encapsulated in a virtual environment, allowing it to run on different hardware or even multiple servers simultaneously.\n\nBy using a virtual machine, the critical PC can benefit from the following advantages:\n\n1. Hardware Independence: The VM is decoupled from the physical hardware, so it can be migrated easily to different host servers without being affected by the underlying hardware.\n2. Snapshot and Backup Capabilities: VMs can be snapshot for backup purposes, allowing easy restoration in case of hardware failures.\n3.

WPA-EAP (Wi-Fi Protected Access - Extensible Authentication Protocol).\n\nWPA-EAP provides a stronger form of authentication compared to a simple Pre-Shared Key (PSK). It uses an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework, which allows for more advanced authentication methods such as username and password, digital certificates, or token-based authentication. By requiring users to authenticate using stronger credentials, WPA-EAP makes it significantly more difficult for unauthorized devices to gain access to the wireless network through brute force attacks on the PSK.\n\nWhile options like BPDU guard (A), IP filtering (C), and a WIDS (Wireless Intrusion Detection System) (D) may provide additional security measures, implementing WPA-EAP is specifically targeted at strengthening authentication for wireless access, making it the most effective solution for preventing unauthorized access via brute force attacks on the PSK.","comment_id":"1202906"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWIDS isn't on the exam objectives.","poster":"memodrums","timestamp":"1708459680.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1154984","upvote_count":"4","content":"I take that back, it is.

WPA-EAP\n\nIt's not WIDS (Wireless Intrusion Detection System). A WIDS monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized, rogue access points and the use of wireless attack tools. The system monitors the radio spectrum used by wireless LANs, and immediately alerts a systems administrator whenever a rogue access point is detected. Conventionally it is achieved by comparing the MAC address of the participating wireless devices.\n\nRogue devices can spoof MAC address of an authorized network device as their own. New research uses fingerprinting approach to weed out devices with spoofed MAC addresses. The idea is to compare the unique signatures exhibited by the signals emitted by each wireless device against the known signatures of pre-authorized, known wireless devices.\n\nI don't see anywhere in my research that a WIDS would detect a brute force password attack.","timestamp":"1703782800.0"},{"comment_id":"1074907","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBy using WPA-EAP if would allow the use for an authenticator like RADIUS.
