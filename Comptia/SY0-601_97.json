It sets strict standards for the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data, and applies to organizations that handle the data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located.\n\nAs a CISO creating a policy set that meets international standards for data privacy and sharing, understanding GDPR is essential, especially if the organization handles data of EU residents or has a global presence. GDPR's requirements and principles should inform the policies to ensure compliance with data protection laws and best practices related to data privacy and security.","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1690495980.0","comment_id":"965101"},{"poster":"cannon","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1709404020.0","comment_id":"1164317","content":"Selected Answer: B\nHeres the problem.

Configure SNMPv3.\n\nIn this scenario, the security analyst discovered a network device with cleartext authentication and a default credential. To secure the device, the best recommendation is to configure SNMPv3.\n\nSNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is commonly used for network monitoring and management. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c use cleartext authentication, which means that the credentials are transmitted without encryption, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping and potential credential theft.\n\nSNMPv3 is the most secure version of SNMP and provides several security features, including data encryption, message integrity, and authentication. It uses technologies such as HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) and encryption algorithms to protect sensitive information, making it the preferred choice when securing network devices and preventing unauthorized access or misuse.","upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1690496220.0","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122"},{"poster":"LeonardSnart","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSimilar question from Darril Gibson's book Chapter 3 practice questions, but the answer there is SSH.
