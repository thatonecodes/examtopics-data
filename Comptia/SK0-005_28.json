IP address\n\nboth the database server and the application server are configured with IP addresses in the same subnet (10.0.10.0/25) and the same subnet mask (255.255.255.128), and they have the same default gateway (10.0.10.1), which indicates they are on the same network segment.\n\nThe issue is most likely related to the IP address configuration, as the database server has the IP address 10.0.10.240, while the application server has the IP address 10.0.10.25. Since the subnet mask is 255.255.255.128 (which corresponds to a subnet with addresses ranging from 10.0.10.0 to 10.0.10.127), the database server's IP address (10.0.10.240) is outside the valid range for the subnet. This suggests that there may have been a mistake in configuring the IP address of the database server.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the database server's IP address should be corrected to a valid address within the subnet range, such as 10.0.10.2 to 10.0.10.126, considering the subnet mask of 255.255.255.128.","timestamp":"1710286320.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"975304","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe database has\nIP: 10.0.10.240 - Mask: 255.255.255.128 - Gateway: 10.0.10.1 -\nThis mask gives two subnets 10.0.10.0/25 and 10.0.10.128/25 so the ip address and the gateway are on different subnets.\n\nThe Application Server is on \nIP: 10.0.10.25 - Mask: 255.255.255.128 - Gateway: 10.0.10.1 - \nThe IP address and gateway are on the same subnet.\nSo the answer is an incorrect IP address on the database server","poster":"mark9999","timestamp":"1691480340.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/117586-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-239-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-08-08 09:39:00","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Gateway","D":"Subnet mask","B":"DHCP","A":"IP address"},"answer":"A","topic":"1","question_text":"An application server cannot communicate with a newly installed database server.
