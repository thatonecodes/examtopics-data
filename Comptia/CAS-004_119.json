Create and proliferate framework code.\nFramework code provides a standardized structure and set of guidelines that all developers can follow when writing code. By creating and promoting a common framework, the architect ensures that the team adheres to the same conventions, patterns, and structures, which improves consistency across the entire team.\nThis approach provides a clear, reusable template that can be followed, reducing variability in how code is written.","poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1365143"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":343,"question_id":591,"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Establish a chain of custody to govern code quality.","C":"Require two-person integrity for code commits.","D":"Enhance the monitoring of code coverage for unit testing.","B":"Create and proliferate framework code."}},{"id":"uHUklSZWcoBp0g0imp6I","question_id":592,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1741131660,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157547-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-634-discussion/","question_text":"A security architect needs to enable a container orchestrator for DevSecOps and SOAR initiatives.

Microsegmentation. Microsegmentation is a security technique that divides a network into smaller, isolated segments to enforce granular security policies. This design is ideal for achieving the following:\nContainerization of workloads with different data classification levels: Microsegmentation allows for isolating different workloads based on their security needs. Containers with different data classification levels.\nStreamlined policy management: Microsegmentation enables granular, policy-based controls, where security policies can be enforced at a much more specific level (e.g., at the workload, container, or even application level). \nDefense against APTs and other malware threats: By segmenting the network into smaller isolated segments, microsegmentation minimizes the lateral movement of threats like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and malware. Even if one part of the network is compromised, microsegmentation helps contain the damage to that specific segment.","comment_id":"1365145","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741132080.0"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1741132080,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157548-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-635-discussion/","question_id":593,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2025-03-05 00:48:00","question_images":[],"exam_id":343,"question_text":"A cloud security architect is designing the infrastructure for a new, virtualized application.

Disabling account JDoe to prevent further lateral movement.\nThe logs show a suspicious sequence of events that suggest lateral movement and possible compromise. Specifically, JDoe logs into multiple machines (laptop314, server112, and server113), launches potentially malicious processes (e.g., cmd.exe and rdp.exe), and accesses critical systems. The combination of actions, such as launching command-line interfaces and remote desktop tools, is indicative of potential malicious activity, like post-compromise behavior or an attacker moving through the network, and this will immediately stop the attacker (if JDoe's account has been compromised) from further moving laterally or interacting with other systems. While option B isolating the laptop could be part of the containment strategy, it addresses only one of the systems involved. The logs show that JDoe is also interacting with multiple servers. Disabling the account provides a broader solution that halts further activity on all systems, not just isolating one device.","comment_id":"1365150","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/cas-004/image75.png"],"question_text":"ASOC analyst received an alert about a potential compromise and is reviewing the following SIEM logs:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate action for the SOC analyst to recommend?","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-03-05 00:58:00","choices":{"D":"Creating HIPS and NIPS rules to prevent logins","B":"Isolating laptop314 from the network","A":"Disabling account JDoe to prevent further lateral movement","C":"Alerting JDoe about the potential account compromise"},"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_description":"","exam_id":343,"unix_timestamp":1741132680,"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"BIEuMVonYRMpBctRFaUw","choices":{"D":"Escape character blocking","C":"Data normalization","A":"Client-side processing","E":"URL encoding","B":"Query parameterization"},"question_id":595,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1741132920,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"exam_id":343,"question_text":"A security architect discovers the following while reviewing code for a company's website:\n\nselection = \"SELECT Item FROM Catalog WHERE ItemID = \" & Request(\"ItemID\")\n\nWhich of the following should the security architect recommend?","timestamp":"2025-03-05 01:02:00","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe most appropriate recommendation for the security architect is:\nB. Query parameterization. The code shown is vulnerable to SQL Injection because user input (Request(\"ItemID\")) is being directly concatenated into the SQL query. This creates a potential security risk where an attacker could manipulate the ItemID input to inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.\nQuery parameterization (also known as prepared statements) is a secure way to handle user input in SQL queries. It ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code, preventing SQL injection attacks. Instead of concatenating input into the query, parameterized queries bind user input to predefined placeholders, making it impossible for attackers to alter the query structure.","poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1365153","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1741132920.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157550-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-637-discussion/"}],"exam":{"id":343,"provider":"Comptia","isImplemented":true,"name":"CAS-004","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":642},"currentPage":119},"__N_SSP":true}
