RAID 0 provides the best I/O performance because it allows parallel read and write operations on multiple disks. RAID 0 also provides the most storage capacity possible because it does not use any disk space for redundancy.

For example, RAID 0 provides the most storage capacity because it uses all the disk space for data storage without reserving any for redundancy.\n\nRedundancy: This refers to the ability to withstand disk failures without data loss. Redundant RAID configurations, like RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, and RAID 10, use part of the disk space to store duplicate or parity data, which can be used to recover data in case of a disk failure. This reduces the total usable storage capacity but increases data protection.\n\nIn this context, the question specifically asks for \"the most storage capacity,\" which aligns with RAID 0's characteristic of using all available disk space for data storage.
