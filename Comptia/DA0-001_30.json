Filter on any of the responses that do not say “January” and update them to “January”.\n\nTo ensure data consistency, it is important to standardize the responses. In this case, the analyst should filter on any responses that do not say “January” and update them to “January” to make sure all responses for the month of January are consistent. This will make it easier to analyze the data and avoid confusion or misinterpretation of the results.\n\nThe other options (A, B, and D) may not be the best approach as deleting responses, replacing responses with a different value, or sorting and updating the responses may lead to a loss of information or a misinterpretation of the results.

Surveys sent to 100 randomly selected homes that are reflective of the population is the most likely method to result in a representative sample. This is because it ensures that the sample is taken from a broad range of the population, and not just limited to a specific area or time. It also ensures that the sample is a random selection, which minimizes the risk of selection bias. This is considered a better method than the other options, which may result in a biased sample due to the specific methods used (such as only surveying homes within a specific area or at a specific time).","poster":"ronniehaang"},{"poster":"CineFeX","content":"D. Random sampling is a method of selecting a representative sample from a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.

In this case, the county is 427sq mi (2.65q km) and the sample is being drawn from 100 randomly selected homes, so it is likely that the sample will be representative of the entire population.\n\nOption A is not a representative sample because it is a phone survey conducted during a specific time period.

Chi-squared test requires two or more categorical variables.\n\nA chi-squared test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables. It is used to determine if the observed frequencies of a variable are different from what would be expected based on a theoretical probability distribution. For example, a chi-squared test could be used to determine if there is a significant difference in the number of people who smoke and the number of people who have lung cancer. To perform a chi-squared test, the data must be in the form of a contingency table, with each cell representing the count of observations for each combination of categories for the two variables being tested. The test statistic is calculated based on the observed and expected frequencies, and the results are compared to a critical value from a chi-squared distribution to determine if the relationship between the two variables is significant.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ronniehaang","timestamp":"1723123500.0","comment_id":"802181"},{"timestamp":"1719897960.0","comment_id":"763574","content":"B.

D. IF\n\nThe IF function is a logical function that allows you to perform a certain action based on a condition being met or not met. For example, you might use the IF function to determine whether a certain value is greater than or equal to a certain threshold. If the value is greater than or equal to the threshold, the function will return one result; if the value is less than the threshold, the function will return another result.\n\nWHERE, AGGREGATE, and BOOLEAN are not examples of logical functions. WHERE is a clause in SQL that is used to filter records based on specific conditions. AGGREGATE is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value.
