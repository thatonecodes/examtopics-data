Zero-day\n\nExplanation:\nZero-day vulnerabilities are the most difficult to remediate because they are unknown to the software vendor or the open-source community at the time of exploitation. Since the company relies on open-source libraries, it may not have control over the discovery or patching of such vulnerabilities. Remediation often depends on the open-source community or third-party maintainers to identify and fix the issue, which can take time.\n\nBuffer overflow (A), SQL injection (B), and Cross-site scripting (C) are well-known vulnerability types with established remediation practices. These can typically be addressed through code reviews, secure coding practices, and applying patches or updates provided by the open-source community.\n\nThus, zero-day vulnerabilities pose the greatest challenge due to their unpredictable nature and reliance on external parties for fixes."},{"poster":"1eccfc0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is D. Zero-day.\n\nA zero-day vulnerability refers to a security flaw that is unknown to the software's creators or the public and has no available patch. Since the company relies on open-source software libraries, a zero-day in one of those libraries would be especially difficult to remediate because the company may need to wait for the open-source community or maintainers to discover and fix the vulnerability.","timestamp":"1737663960.0","comment_id":"1345662","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2025-01-23 21:26:00","topic":"1","question_id":468,"answer":"D","choices":{"C":"Cross-site scripting","B":"SQL injection","D":"Zero-day","A":"Buffer overflow"},"unix_timestamp":1737663960,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"A company relies on open-source software libraries to build the software used by its customers.

To ensure that errors are not passed to other systems\nExplanation:\n✔ Corrective controls are designed to identify and fix issues after they occur, ensuring that errors do not propagate to other systems.\n✔ In a financial system, errors can lead to incorrect transactions, misstatements, or compliance violations.\n✔ Regulatory requirements often mandate corrective controls to detect, log, and rectify mistakes before they cause widespread issues.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. To defend against insider threats altering banking details – This relates more to preventive and detective controls rather than corrective controls.\nC.

To prevent unauthorized changes to financial data – Preventing changes is a preventive control, whereas corrective controls focus on identifying and fixing errors post-occurrence."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrective controls in this context are designed to rectify errors or unauthorized modifications after they have occurred, ensuring the integrity and reliability of financial data.

Acquisition\n\nExplanation:\nAcquisition is the stage in a forensic investigation where forensic images of digital evidence (e.g., hard drives, memory, or other storage devices) are obtained. This process involves creating a bit-by-bit copy of the data to ensure its integrity and to allow for analysis without altering the original evidence.\n\nPreservation (B) involves ensuring that the evidence is protected from tampering or alteration, often occurring before or during acquisition.\n\nReporting (C) is the final stage where findings are documented and presented.\n\nE-discovery (D) refers to the process of identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) in response to legal requests, which is not specific to the creation of forensic images.\n\nThus, Acquisition is the stage where forensic images are obtained.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1347937","timestamp":"1738072980.0","poster":"Anyio"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155558-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-522-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-01-28 15:03:00","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1738072980,"exam_id":368}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":368,"isImplemented":true,"name":"SY0-701","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":581},"currentPage":94},"__N_SSP":true}
