It allows the virtual machine to communicate only with the host machine and other virtual machines on the same host. NAT mode allows the virtual machine to share the hostâ€™s IP address and access the network through it. Bridge mode allows the virtual machine to have its own IP address and connect directly to the network. Direct mode is not a valid network option for virtual machines."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731994080.0","content":"The best option to isolate the virtual machine from the rest of the network is D. Host-only mode.\n\nIn host-only mode, the virtual machine can only communicate with the host machine itself. It is completely isolated from the physical network, preventing any unauthorized access or data transfer.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. NAT (Network Address Translation) mode: This mode allows the virtual machine to access the internet and other devices on the network, but it's not completely isolated.\nB. Bridge mode: In bridge mode, the virtual machine acts as a separate physical device on the network, allowing it to communicate with other devices. This is not suitable for isolation.\nC. Direct mode: This mode provides direct network access to the virtual machine, bypassing the host machine's network configuration. This is also not suitable for isolation.\nTherefore, host-only mode is the most secure and effective way to isolate a virtual machine from the rest of the network.\n\nGG","comment_id":"1314436","poster":"Nate_A"},{"poster":"rah555","content":"Selected Answer: D\nHost-only mode is a networking mode for virtual machines that allows them to communicate with the host computer, but not with any other computers on the network.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"954596","timestamp":"1689625860.0"},{"timestamp":"1688087940.0","comment_id":"938687","content":"D is correct","poster":"Dadadagreat","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":339,"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/113713-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-261-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Bridge mode","C":"Direct mode","D":"Host-only mode","A":"NAT mode"},"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_id":181,"question_text":"Which of the following network options would work BEST to ensure a client-side virtual machine cannot access the rest of the network?","unix_timestamp":1688087940,"answer":"D","topic":"1"},{"id":"7wQdf9RGhKvVGlYLKPYn","timestamp":"2023-08-31 22:28:00","question_images":[],"exam_id":339,"isMC":true,"answer":"B","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1693513680,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730464920.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Swollen battery: \nA swollen battery is a common issue in laptops that can cause physical damage or pressure on internal components. If the battery is swollen, it can push against the trackpad and/or the keyboard, causing malfunctions such as the inability to click the trackpad buttons or use certain keys. The fact that no external physical damage is observed on the laptop points to an internal issue, which is often the case with a swollen battery.\n\nC. Distended capacitors:\nDistended capacitors could cause electrical problems, but they would typically affect the functionality of the laptop in more severe ways, such as preventing it from powering on or causing intermittent failures in the system.
