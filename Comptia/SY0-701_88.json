These tokens are surrogate values that have no meaningful relationship with the original sensitive data, but can still be used in a system without exposing the actual sensitive information. The original data is stored securely in a separate, protected location (often a token vault), and the tokens are used in its place in the production systems.\n\nFor example, instead of storing a real credit card number, a system might store a token like \"12345678\", and the real credit card number would only be accessible in the secure token vault.","poster":"JThomas11068","comment_id":"1339243"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/154408-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-493-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-01-11 18:40:00","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Encrypting databases containing sensitive data","B":"Replacing sensitive data with surrogate values","D":"Hashing sensitive data in critical systems","C":"Removing sensitive data from production systems"},"answer_images":[],"answer":"B"},{"id":"iHplLGy3M4yA8BMCX3bx","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155412-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-494-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is a type of vulnerability that refers to the unauthorized installation of applications on a device through means other than the official application store?","choices":{"C":"Jailbreaking","B":"Buffer overflow","A":"Cross-site scripting","D":"Side loading"},"answer":"D","topic":"1","question_id":438,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-01-26 03:35:00","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1737858900,"exam_id":368,"discussion":[{"poster":"c97417d","comment_id":"1346770","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSide loading is the process of installing apps from another source rather than the official App Store.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1737858900.0"}]},{"id":"dUoqSSqmYG7F7ArrWK4J","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153162-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-495-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-12-18 13:23:00","exam_id":368,"question_text":"Which of the following types of identification methods can be performed on a deployed application during runtime?","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nDynamic analysis is a method of evaluating a system by observing its behavior as it runs.
