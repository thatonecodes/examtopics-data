This ensures that all communication is encrypted and secured, even when the user is accessing the internet from public or untrusted networks. While this level of security is ideal for protecting sensitive data, it can result in higher bandwidth usage due to routing all traffic through the VPN.\n\nBenefits of Full-tunnel VPN for the scenario described:\nHighest Security: All traffic is encrypted and protected, making it the most secure option for users who frequently travel and connect to various networks, including public Wi-Fi.","timestamp":"1707775920.0","comment_id":"979560","upvote_count":"7","poster":"actingnurse1"},{"comment_id":"1366047","content":"Selected Answer: D\nfull tunnel has exceptionally lower throughput than split tunnel because the data goes through a next gen firewall.
