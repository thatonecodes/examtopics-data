This method allows for firsthand assessment of product quality, identifying any defects, issues, or areas for improvement. Observation can provide valuable insights into the actual performance and characteristics of the product, making it a powerful tool for evaluating quality.\n\nWhile surveys can also provide valuable feedback on product quality, they may rely on participants' perceptions and interpretations, which can be subjective and influenced by various factors. Additionally, surveys may not capture the full range of user experiences and may be limited to the specific questions asked.
