It may take some time to find and onboard a new resource with the necessary skills and availability, which could further jeopardize the commitment date for the project. It would be more efficient to try to reallocate some of the existing resource's time from the secondary project before seeking out additional resources.\n\nOption C (Remove 20% of allocation of the resource from the secondary project) is the most immediate and practical solution, as it addresses the resource allocation issue directly and allows the resource to focus more of their time and attention on the primary project. This can help to mitigate the risk of insufficient resources and improve the chances of meeting the commitment date.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kmanb","comment_id":"768999","timestamp":"1673139420.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe project manager should work with the functional manager.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MJVIS","timestamp":"1670608680.0","comment_id":"740321"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. since it is a functional organization","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1669154760.0","comment_id":"724718","poster":"brvndvnwolf"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"all4one","content":"B.
