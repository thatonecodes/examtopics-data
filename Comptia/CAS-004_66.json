It helps the CISO: \nEvaluate the current security posture – This includes understanding where the organization stands in terms of application security, phishing awareness, vulnerability management, and other key areas.\nPrioritize objectives – A risk assessment can help identify the most critical vulnerabilities and areas of concern, allowing the CISO to align the goals with the current risk landscape.\nSet realistic targets – By assessing the risks, the CISO can better determine whether the goal percentages (e.g., reducing phishing click rate from 73% to 8%) are achievable, based on the organization’s current risk and resource levels. AND Measure success and progress – A comprehensive risk assessment can be used to track progress over time and help adjust strategies accordingly.","timestamp":"1734124500.0","comment_id":"1326252"},{"poster":"EAlonso","timestamp":"1721093460.0","comment_id":"1248625","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe KRI are identified, in a 5-year period many changes can occur in the assets and their exposition to the risk."},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1720234560.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1243138","poster":"armid","content":"So he knows very specifically (73, 89 - those dont look to me like rough estimations) how many %'s of assets have vulnerabilities (hence he knows what assets he has and which ones are vulnerable) meaning he already have A and he already did C (or B).

It can provide valuable insights into whether the goals are realistic given the organization’s current situation and resources.\n\nWhile the other options (An asset inventory, A third-party audit, An organizational CMMI) can provide useful information and contribute to the overall security strategy, they do not directly address the question of whether the specific goals outlined by the CISO are obtainable","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1140589"},{"comments":[],"timestamp":"1701113160.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1081901","poster":"OdinAtlasSteel","content":"Selected Answer: C\nImplementing an Organizational Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) could indeed aid the CISO in understanding the organization's process maturity and efficiency. However, when considering the specific goals outlined by the CISO for the five-year plan, a risk assessment (option C) would likely be the more directly relevant and effective approach to determine the feasibility of achieving those goals.\n\nThe Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) generally focuses on assessing and improving an organization's processes and practices. While it can provide valuable insights into process maturity and efficiency, it may not directly address the specific security objectives outlined in the plan, such as reducing phishing click rates, deploying EDR, ensuring log collection for SIEM, or reducing system vulnerabilities."},{"comment_id":"1076228","timestamp":"1700565960.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption D. An organizational Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) would best aid the CISO in determining whether these goals are obtainable. The CMMI is a process and behavioral model that helps organizations streamline process improvement and encourage behaviors that lead to improved performance.\n\nBy assessing the maturity of the organization’s processes and practices, the CMMI can help determine the feasibility of the CISO’s goals. It can identify strengths and weaknesses in the current approach, and suggest areas for improvement that would increase the likelihood of achieving the outlined goals.\n\nWhile the other options (asset inventory, third-party audit, risk assessment) can provide valuable information and may be part of the overall strategy, they do not provide the comprehensive view of organizational capabilities offered by the CMMI.","poster":"wizwiz","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1700435400,"choices":{"D":"An organizational CMMI","C":"A risk assessment","A":"An asset inventory","B":"A third-party audit"},"topic":"1","question_id":326,"timestamp":"2023-11-20 00:10:00","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","question_text":"The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has outlined a five-year plan for the company that includes the following:\n\n• Implement an application security program.\n• Reduce the click rate on phishing simulations from 73% to 8%.\n• Deploy EDR to all workstations and servers.\n• Ensure all systems are sending logs to the SIEM.\n• Reduce the percentage of systems with vulnerabilities from 89% to 5%.\n\nWhich of the following would BEST aid the CISO in determining whether these goals are obtainable?","isMC":true,"exam_id":343,"answers_community":["C (72%)","D (22%)","6%"]},{"id":"ip8zwk5if26kIkTMKvEv","question_text":"The Chief Security Officer (CSO) requested the security team implement technical controls that meet the following requirements:\n\n• Monitors traffic to and from both local NAS and cloud-based file repositories\n• Prevents on-site staff who are accessing sensitive customer PII documents on file repositories from accidentally or deliberately sharing sensitive documents on personal SaaS solutions\n• Uses document attributes to reduce false positives\n• Is agentless and not installed on staff desktops or laptops\n\nWhich of the following when installed and configured would BEST meet the CSO’s requirements?
