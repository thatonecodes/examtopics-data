Speed is the most important consideration.\n\nExplanation:\n\nStriping without parity (RAID 0) provides improved speed and performance as data is divided across multiple drives. It enhances read and write operations by allowing multiple disks to work in parallel.\n\nStriping with parity (RAID 5), on the other hand, offers both speed and redundancy through parity information. However, the parity calculation can introduce additional overhead, impacting write performance to some extent.\n\nIn the scenario where speed is the most critical consideration, and the customer prioritizes performance over redundancy, choosing striping without parity (RAID 0) is appropriate. This is particularly relevant when optimizing for data access speed and the highest possible throughput.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice in this context."},{"poster":"JonHin","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSpeed is the most important consideration. Striping without parity, also known as RAID 0, is a RAID configuration that splits data across multiple disks without any redundancy. This improves the performance of read and write operations, as multiple disks can work in parallel. However, this also increases the risk of data loss, as any disk failure will result in losing all data on the array. Therefore, striping without parity is suitable for situations where speed is prioritized over reliability. According to the CompTIA Core1 objectives, one of the advantages of RAID 0 is increased speed. A research paper on RAID performance also confirms that RAID 0 has the highest throughput among all RAID levels.","comment_id":"1361508","timestamp":"1740503280.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1726114020.0","comment_id":"1282426","content":"Selected Answer: B\nStriping = Speed\nParity = Redundancy","upvote_count":"2","poster":"dickchappy"},{"comment_id":"1179633","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct. Like edwinv said, stripping without parity improves speed as data is divided across more than one drive. It is not \"copied\" identically to each drive, this is different parts of the data separated into each drive. The data in the drives is not identical. You would not choose stripping without parity if you cared about redundancy so C cannot be right.","timestamp":"1711053960.0","poster":"17c0e08"},{"comments":[{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1287126","content":"You can't.
