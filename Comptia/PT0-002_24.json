Situational awareness:\n\n • Situational awareness involves understanding the current state of the environment, including network traffic and potential threats. While contacting the penetration tester may contribute to situational awareness, the primary goal in this context is to resolve potential conflicts between testing and operational stability.\n\nB. Rescheduling:\n\n • Rescheduling refers to changing the timing of the penetration test. The network engineer is seeking to understand whether the GET requests are part of the test, not necessarily looking to reschedule the test.\n\nC. DDoS defense:\n\n • While the network engineer might be concerned about a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, the primary action is to determine whether the observed traffic is legitimate (part of the test) or malicious.

Penetration testers are responsible for verifying the scope of their testing and ensuring that they have permission to test all systems in the specified range.
