Project sponsor\n\nWhen a project manager is experiencing resistance from a group of stakeholders, it is important to identify the root cause of the resistance and develop a plan to address it. One way to do this is to consult with the project sponsor, who has the authority and influence to help resolve conflicts and overcome resistance. The project sponsor can work with the project manager to understand the stakeholders' concerns and interests, and develop a strategy to address them. In contrast, the project scheduler and project coordinator are typically responsible for specific aspects of the project's execution, and may not have the authority or perspective to address stakeholder resistance. The project management office (PMO) is responsible for ensuring that project management processes, methodologies, and tools are followed consistently across the organization, but may not have direct involvement in the day-to-day management of individual projects.","comment_id":"829425"}],"timestamp":"1664991960.0","comment_id":"687100","upvote_count":"1","content":"Sponsors have the vision and controls the purse, but isn't it the PMO's responsibility to lay ground rules and enforcement policies?"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_id":148,"unix_timestamp":1664991960,"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/84433-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-260-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2022-10-05 19:46:00"},{"id":"GT59bqHqnTazl7LL560o","choices":{"A":"Smoothing","B":"Collaborating","D":"Avoiding","C":"Compromising"},"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following conflict resolution techniques relies on establishing areas of agreement rather than disagreement?","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2020-02-23 20:04:00","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1582484640,"exam_id":359,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/14753-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-262-discussion/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"Steele08","comment_id":"54235","content":"Agreed.
