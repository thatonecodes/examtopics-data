The purpose of a logic bomb is often to cause damage or disruption to a system or organization at a specific time or under certain circumstances.\n\nFileless viruses, on the other hand, are malware that reside in a system's memory and do not leave traditional traces on disk, making them more difficult to detect.

The main goal of continuous integration is to detect and address integration issues early in the development process. This is achieved by automatically building and testing the codebase as soon as new code changes are added, ensuring that the integrated code functions correctly and doesn't introduce conflicts or errors.\n\nContinuous monitoring is a practice that involves ongoing observation and analysis of a system's performance and security to identify potential issues or vulnerabilities. Continuous deployment is the practice of automatically releasing software changes into production environments.

Stored procedures... is the correct answer\n\nStored procedures are database programs that are typically written in SQL and stored in the database itself. They encapsulate and execute specific functions or operations on the data within the database. One of the advantages of using stored procedures is that they can reduce vulnerabilities related to code reuse because they limit direct access to the database and its data. Instead of writing the same SQL code multiple times in different parts of the application, developers can encapsulate it within a stored procedure. This reduces the likelihood of SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities associated with code duplication and reuse.
