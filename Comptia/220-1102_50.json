Recovery key\n\nIn the context of Windows 10 OS repair, a recovery key is typically associated with BitLocker, a disk encryption program integrated with the operating system. If the technician encounters a prompt asking for a key during the repair process, it likely indicates that the device's hard drive is encrypted with BitLocker.\n\nTo continue the repair, the technician would need to provide the BitLocker recovery key. This recovery key is generated and saved when BitLocker is first set up on the system. It serves as a means to unlock the encrypted drive in situations where the usual methods, such as the user password, are not working or accessible.\n\nOptions A, B, and C (SSL key, Preshared key, WPA2 key) are not typically associated with the BitLocker encryption used in Windows 10 OS repair scenarios.","comment_id":"1086979","poster":"kekejon"}],"exam_id":340,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Recovery key","B":"Preshared key","A":"SSL key","C":"WPA2 key"},"timestamp":"2023-12-03 18:35:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":250,"answer":"D","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/127704-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-323-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1701624900,"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"name":"220-1102","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":668,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":340},"currentPage":50},"__N_SSP":true}
