WPA2 is not a protocol. The authentication protocols under WPA2 are PSK (Pre-Shared Keys) for personal or small implementations and 802.1X or EAP for enterprise implementations. So PSK or 802.1X (EAP) should be the correct answers. But PSK is not an available answer.

Network log files\" could be a plausible answer, A seems to make the most sense (in CompTIA's perspective) as checking the change management documentation would state what recent equipment or configuration changes were recently made that might've affected the network.
