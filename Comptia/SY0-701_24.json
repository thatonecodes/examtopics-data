Encrypted Connection\nWhy?\nWhen using a cloud-based platform for IoT management, data is transmitted over the internet, making encryption critical to protect sensitive information.\nEncrypted connections (e.g., TLS/SSL, VPN, or IPSec) ensure that data remains secure in transit and prevent eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.\nMany IoT devices are vulnerable due to weak security implementations, making encryption a fundamental security measure.\nWhy Not the Others?\nB. Federated Identity – Useful for authentication across multiple systems but not specifically required for IoT cloud management.\nC.
