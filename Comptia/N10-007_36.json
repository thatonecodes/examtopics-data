That rules out answer E.\nThe number values for each bit of the third octet would run as follows:\n128 192 224 240 248 252 254 255\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \na subnet mask of 255.255.248.0 leaves us with three bits for hosts (2046). \na subnet mask of 255.255.240.0 leaves us with 4 bits for possible host calculation (4094) and is the answer."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"457357","poster":"djoddom","content":"aren't the IPs (10.35.x.x) Class A addresses?
