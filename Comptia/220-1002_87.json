Jason Dion has a practice question just like this one:OBJ-2.10: Since Dion Training wants to keep the wireless network open, the BEST option is to reduce the signal strength of the network's power level. This will ensure the wireless network can only be accessed from within its classrooms and not from the coffee shop next door. Changing the SSID won't prevent the coffee shop's customers from accessing the network. While MAC filtering could be used to create an approved whitelist of MAC addresses for all Dion Training's students, this would also require it to be continuously updated with each class of students that is very time-intensive and inefficient.
