For example, running a vulnerability scan is an active method, while reading social media posts and viewing corporate tax filings are passive methods.\n\nIn this scenario you might use the app theHarvester which scours search engines and other resources to find email addresses, employee names, and infrastructure details about an organization.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the CompTIA exam is based on the actual correct answers or the answers from books like Sybex - Practice Exams?","poster":"mr_robot"}],"upvote_count":"20","comment_id":"80325"},{"timestamp":"1657187400.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"miabe","content":"Selected Answer: D\nlooks good to me","comment_id":"628307"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"568684","timestamp":"1647384900.0","poster":"baybay","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
