Filesystem metadata is data that is associated with a file and stored within the filesystem itself. This can include information such as the file's name, size, creation date, and other details. By adding identifying metadata to the audio files, the business can make it easier to track and identify copies of the files that may have been stolen or illicitly shared. This can be an effective and low-cost approach to theft detection, as it does not require any specialized tools or software. Implementing steganography would not be an effective approach to theft detection, as it involves hiding information within other data and is typically used for covert communication rather than theft detection. Purchasing and installing a DRM (Digital Rights Management) suite would not be a low-cost approach to theft detection, as DRM suites can be expensive and may not be necessary for the business's needs.","comment_id":"757948","poster":"Mr_BuCk3th34D"},{"poster":"Bright07","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAns is B.
