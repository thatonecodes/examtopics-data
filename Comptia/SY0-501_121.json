You absolutely would disconnect any w/s from the network per company policy, esp in light of resent ransomware events. There would be a proper severity incident, likely with very high severity and a tag \"VIP\" of some sort, which would require immediate action AND contacting the user. In this case, an analyst or the person who has the IM would contact his manager who would contact AVP or VP who then will contact the CEO.
