Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) would be the best option to aid in decreasing the workload without increasing staff. SOAR platforms are designed to streamline and automate various security operations tasks, allowing security teams to respond to incidents more efficiently. By implementing a SOAR solution, the managed security service provider can significantly reduce the manual workload on their security team, allowing them to handle a larger number of devices and incidents without having to hire additional staff."},{"timestamp":"1718878440.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn this scenario, implementing XDR would likely be the best solution.

We need to image it and hash the image. \nThe answer cant be legal hold as there is not regulatory or legal invoked. It says he misused the laptop, no detail was given to how it was misused.

Legal hold authority can be complicated by jurisdiction, but these details are managed by legal teams.
