It was the previous question that was marked wrong!\nDispute Procedure: If you need to disuute this vulnerability, follow these guidelines.Verify that the FQDN properly resolves to the host using an outside source such as www.sslshopper.com or www.digicert.com/help/. These could also identify potential certificate problems as well. Example: host1.foo.com resolves to 192.168.38.4 In the case of a load balancer, provide all expected IP resolutions of the FQDN. An attestation that hosts behind the load balance are in sync is also required. For a DR host, a statement should be provided that indicates the host is part of a backup or failover environment where the IP is needed to be used due to DNS not actively pointing to the host. A service provider may scan by IP if the web applications are out of scope and an attestation of such is provided in the dispute comments.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1612111920.0"}],"content":"At some point, these people need to come through here and at least try to change some of the answers to the correct ones.
