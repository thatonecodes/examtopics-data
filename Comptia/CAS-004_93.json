Which of the following would be the most appropriate recommendation?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nUEBA focuses on analyzing the behaviors of users and entities within the network to identify anomalies that may indicate security threats. Unlike signature-based detection, which relies on known patterns of malicious activity, UEBA uses machine learning and advanced analytics to detect deviations from normal behavior. This approach can identify new and unknown threats that do not match existing signatures, thus addressing the limitation of missing IoCs that signature-based systems might overlook","comment_id":"1250606","upvote_count":"5","poster":"23169fd","timestamp":"1721325240.0"},{"timestamp":"1741524720.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\no UEBA uses machine learning and behavioral analysis to detect anomalous activity, which can catch previously unknown threats not covered by traditional signature-based rules, making it a more effective solution for identifying advanced attacks that might bypass signature-based systems.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Steel16","comment_id":"1370884"},{"poster":"HereToStudy","timestamp":"1727263080.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFor reason I put below","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1288962"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_id":461,"choices":{"D":"CSPM","E":"EAP","A":"FIM","C":"UEBA","B":"SASE"},"exam_id":343,"question_images":[],"answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"0UQx3hiTVlhUivEP5KPi","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-09-12 23:35:00","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Modbus","C":"Zigbee","A":"Profinet","D":"Z-Wave"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/147463-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-513-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":462,"answer_description":"","exam_id":343,"question_text":"A common industrial protocol has the following characteristics:\n\n• Provides for no authentication/security\n• Is often implemented in a client/server relationship\n• Is implemented as either RTU or TCP/IP\n\nWhich of the following is being described?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1282853","poster":"snowmaggedon","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. Modbus\n\nExplanation:\nModbus is a common industrial protocol with the following characteristics:\n\nNo Authentication/Security: Modbus does not provide native authentication or encryption mechanisms, making it inherently insecure by design.\nClient/Server Relationship: Modbus typically follows a client/server (or master/slave) model, where the client (master) sends requests to the server (slave), and the server responds.\nImplemented as RTU or TCP/IP: Modbus can be implemented in two primary formats: Modbus RTU (Remote Terminal Unit), which uses serial communication, or Modbus TCP/IP, which is used over IP networks.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1726176900.0"}],"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1726176900},{"id":"OXMPwsgUgscEEqIm0Nvm","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer":"C","choices":{"A":"Root cause analysis","B":"Communication plan","D":"Lessons learned","C":"Runbook"},"exam_id":343,"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/147236-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-514-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"Steel16","content":"Selected Answer: C\no Runbook: a step-by-step guide outlining procedures for handling common IT issues.

In this case, hardening the engineering workstations with a common strategy means applying consistent security measures across all workstations to address the identified weaknesses, such as: Unsupported, end-of-life operating systems: These systems are no longer updated or patched, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.
