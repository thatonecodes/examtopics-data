Static analysis tools are designed to analyze source code or binaries for vulnerabilities without executing the program. By integrating a static analysis tool into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, the team can automatically detect issues early in the development process, before they become larger problems. This helps identify security flaws, code quality issues, or areas that need rewriting, enabling the team to address them during development rather than after the fact.\nKey benefits of implementing static analysis in the CI/CD pipeline:\nEarly detection of vulnerabilities or issues during the development process, allowing for immediate remediation.\nAutomation that ensures that security checks are part of the regular development cycle, preventing security and process issues from going undetected.\nConsistency in security practices, as static analysis can be run automatically on every code commit, providing ongoing feedback to developers.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Bright07"},{"timestamp":"1730830560.0","comment_id":"1307499","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe need to rewrite major components suggests fundamental issues in the design or architecture of the application.

D. To best prevent major process issues from reoccurring in the future, the consultant should recommend utilizing a risk-based threat modeling approach on new projects. Risk-based threat modeling helps identify potential security vulnerabilities early in the development process by assessing risks associated with the design and architecture of the application. This proactive approach allows teams to address security concerns before they manifest as major issues.

Taking a system snapshot involves creating a forensic image of the system, capturing the current state of all data, including log files, system configurations, and potentially volatile data. This action ensures that the evidence is collected in a manner that is admissible in court, maintaining the integrity and chain of custody of the data. By taking a snapshot, the security manager minimizes the risk of data being altered, overwritten, or lost due to ongoing system processes.
