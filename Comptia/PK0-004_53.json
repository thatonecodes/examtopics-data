More tricky worded answers. \n\nB & C should both be correct though.\n\nLanguage barriers are likely to influence a Project Manager to take the following actions:\n\n--Hire bilingual or multilingual team members: To overcome language barriers, a Project Manager may decide to hire team members who are fluent in the languages spoken by project stakeholders. This can help ensure effective communication between team members and stakeholders and minimize the risk of misunderstandings or miscommunications.\n\n--Use translation services: If hiring multilingual team members is not feasible, a Project Manager may choose to use translation services to bridge the language gap. This can include hiring professional translators or using automated translation software."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Hire an interpreter to ensure verbal and written communications are accurate is the MOST likely influence of language barriers on a PM.\n\nWhen there are language barriers in a project, hiring an interpreter to ensure accurate verbal and written communication is the most effective way to address the issue. This ensures that all parties involved can understand the information being communicated and that there are no misunderstandings. While learning the unknown language could be beneficial, it is unlikely that a PM would have the time or resources to do so in the context of a project. Similarly, hiring a bilingual project team may not be feasible or practical, and relying solely on print media may not provide sufficient clarity or context for important communications. Therefore, hiring an interpreter is the best solution to ensure effective communication and avoid misunderstandings or conflicts due to language barriers.","poster":"MJVIS","comment_id":"812490","timestamp":"1676676360.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1669252680.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis is C","comment_id":"725488","upvote_count":"1","poster":"brvndvnwolf"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1668890280.0","poster":"ExamTopics274","comment_id":"722233","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C"},{"poster":"Manzer","timestamp":"1663863360.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMost likely.\nWhen language is a potential barrier, you might choose to use written or printed material that can be translated rather than spoken words that can be misinterpreted or misunderstood.\"","comment_id":"676353","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1616976000,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"question_id":261,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"learn the unknown language to be able to communicate effectively with stakeholders.","A":"use more print media to communicate with the stakeholders.","B":"hire a bilingual project team that is fluent in the language to reduce conflict.","C":"hire an interpreter to ensure verbal and written communications are accurate."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/48393-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-440-discussion/","exam_id":359,"answers_community":["C (75%)","A (25%)"]},{"id":"Ibub82cLZoXJfSSBzAix","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (67%)","A (33%)"],"answer":"D","question_id":262,"unix_timestamp":1616976360,"answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/48394-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-441-discussion/","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Geodude","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1670277180.0","comment_id":"736348","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis is D, update the communications plan to the stakeholder's expectation."},{"poster":"evanssk29","comment_id":"731603","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is Analyze the RASI chart. \nThe RACI chart is a type of RAM that helps depict the level of responsibility for each project team member.
