This is another stellar example of a hopelessly ambiguous - and therefore unfair - CompTIA question. \nI am going to guess risk mitigation.\nThe reason the risk is lessened is because the policies and procedures have been changed. Not because a third party is doing the background check. If the company gave the task to the third party with the old policies and procedures the risk would be that same. Arguably, the risk is not being transferred to the third party, because the third party can claim \"we just followed *your* policies and procedures.\" In this case, the third party is not an insurer, just somebody else to implement the policies and procedures. \nSo that is what I am going with.
