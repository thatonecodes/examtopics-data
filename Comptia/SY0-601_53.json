With EAP-TTLS, the certificate is an EAP method that supports the detection of rogue access points. EAP-TTLS provides a secure encrypted tunnel between the client and the authentication server, which allows the authentication server to verify the identity of the client and detect rogue access points. EAP-TTLS is often used in enterprise environments where the security of the wireless network is a concern, and the detection of rogue access points is important for maintaining network security.\n\nPEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol), EAP-FAST (Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling) and EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security) do not provide the ability to detect rogue access points. They are focused on providing secure authentication between the client and the server, but do not specifically address the detection of rogue access points.","comment_id":"798302","poster":"OnA_Mule"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Should the answer be C?
