Load Balancing is wrong because the question ask for what should be implemented at the SERVER and not SWITCH. Load balancing at Switch (i.e. having multiple switches) makes sense to increase redundancy at the switch level, and this has already been stated in the question. Load Balancing at the server level requires more than one server (which is not the case here) to distribute processing load and to improve performance, and to provide server redundancy. \n\nNIC teaming is the right answer for this scenario as the question is asking what can be implemented on the single server. NIC teaming allows multiple network interface cards to be \"Teamed\" and each interface card is connected to different switches. This allows for switch redundancy which is what the question is asking for.","timestamp":"1692099960.0"},{"comment_id":"934908","poster":"LeonardSnart","timestamp":"1687825680.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIf a server has multiple network interface cards (NICs) connecting it to a switch or router, it will have multiple addresses, one for each NIC. NIC teaming is an alternative means of connecting used by servers that have multiple network interface cards and wish to enjoy the benefits of load balancing, fault tolerance, and failover without requiring added infrastructure to do it. When NIC teaming is used, the OS combines the NICs into a virtual NIC from the OS perspective. If one or more of the connections have traffic issues or connectivity issues, the other NICs can carry the load.
