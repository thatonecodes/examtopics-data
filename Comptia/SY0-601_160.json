An air gap would remove the server from the network completely, and would certainly be employed in an incident response where isolation-based containment is needed. If they are still needing to use the application server, however, and simply employ compensating controls, a screened subnet is better.\n\nCompTIA Section 9A: \"A screened subnet uses two firewalls placed on either side of the DMZ. The edge firewall restricts traffic on the external/public interface and allows permitted traffic to the hosts in the DMZ. The edge firewall can be referred to as the screening firewall or router. The internal firewall filters communications between hosts in the DMZ and hosts on the LAN. This firewall is often described as the choke firewall. A choke point is a purposefully narrow gateway that facilitates better access control and easier monitoring.\"","poster":"slapster","comment_id":"1158152"},{"timestamp":"1708532580.0","comment_id":"1155691","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Air gap\n\nExplanation:\n\nAir gap (Option A): An air gap involves physically isolating a system or network from external networks, ensuring that there is no direct connection. This isolation significantly reduces the risk of network threats, as there are no pathways for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities remotely. It is particularly effective for systems running unsupported software because it provides a strong barrier against external attacks.","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"poster":"johnabayot","upvote_count":"5","content":"Airgap is an extreme form of isolation, where a network has no physical or wireless connection to any other network.\nNotice the question mentioned \"an application server running aoftware\" based on this you want to balance your option with security and functionality and this what makes Screened Subnet suffice.","timestamp":"1707007020.0","comment_id":"1139689"}],"poster":"Payu1994","timestamp":"1706939880.0","comment_id":"1139013"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"caseymd85","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. air gap \nA screened subnet is still accessible.","timestamp":"1706715720.0","comment_id":"1136926"},{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"johnabayot","content":"Airgap is an extreme form of isolation, where a network has no physical or wireless connection to any other network. \nNotice the question mentioned \"an application server running aoftware\" based on this you want to balance your option with security and functionality and this what makes Screened Subnet suffice.","timestamp":"1707006960.0","comment_id":"1139688"}],"timestamp":"1706492160.0","poster":"dfc6822","content":"A.
