CDN (Content Delivery Network)\n\nExplanation:\nA Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to stage copies of a website or its content closer to geographically dispersed users. It works by caching website resources (e.g., images, videos, scripts, and HTML pages) on servers located in various geographical locations. This reduces latency, improves load times, and enhances the user experience by delivering content from a server that is physically closer to the user.","poster":"SuntzuLegacy"},{"poster":"HeatSquad77","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. CDN (Content Delivery Network).\n\nExplanation:\nA Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content, such as HTML pages, images, videos, and other resources, to users based on their geographic location. CDNs cache copies of the websiteâ€™s content at multiple locations around the world (called edge servers). When a user accesses the website, the content is served from the closest server to reduce latency and improve load times.","timestamp":"1735667520.0","comment_id":"1334949"}],"answer_description":"","exam_id":358,"question_id":241,"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"j4h8AHhx8e1VlElVC7XY","choices":{"B":"Switch","D":"Firewall","A":"Router","C":"Access point"},"unix_timestamp":1732934220,"exam_id":358,"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-11-30 03:37:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/152358-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-72-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following appliances provides users with an extended footprint that allows connections from multiple devices within a designated WLAN?","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"question_id":242,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1334951","timestamp":"1735667580.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"HeatSquad77","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Access point.\n\nExplanation:\nAn access point (AP) is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network via Wi-Fi, extending the footprint of a wireless local area network (WLAN). The AP serves as the bridge between the wired network and the wireless devices, and by placing multiple access points in different locations, you can extend the coverage area, allowing users to connect from various devices within that extended footprint"},{"poster":"SuntzuLegacy","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Access point\n\nExplanation:\nAn access point (AP) is a networking device that allows multiple devices to connect to a wireless local area network (WLAN). It extends the network footprint by broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal, enabling devices like laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices to connect wirelessly within its coverage area.","timestamp":"1732934220.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1319996"}]},{"id":"puS0hMyxdA5DRoATN8df","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/152359-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-73-discussion/","question_text":"An administrator is configuring a switch that will be placed in an area of the office that is accessible to customers.
