Sandbox environments are typically used for development, testing, and quality assurance (QA). They are also useful for stress testing, as they allow you to simulate high levels of traffic and usage without impacting the production system.","poster":"lamborghini","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1074412","timestamp":"1731984360.0"}],"question_id":332,"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true},{"id":"ShMbS8QPybK7IH33Rpp9","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732042560.0","poster":"CloudChef","comment_id":"1314857","content":"The most likely use case for client-side virtualization for a software developer is to test software on different operating systems to ensure compatibility and functionality.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1077348","poster":"Raffaelloo","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1700654640.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA system VM is a fully virtualized environment hosted on a physical server that runs its own OS.
