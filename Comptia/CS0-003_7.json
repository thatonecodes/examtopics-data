This provides a centralized view of the events occurring throughout the corporate environment, allowing analysts to more easily detect and respond to security incidents. Deploying a database to aggregate logging could be part of a logging solution but does not provide the same level of centralized visibility as a SIEM. Sharing log directories or automating the emailing of logs would require manual effort and would not provide the same level of centralized visibility and analysis capabilities as a SIEM."}],"unix_timestamp":1693564980,"timestamp":"2023-09-01 12:43:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":347,"question_images":[]},{"id":"Ggn6nBURMmlozOWQxKug","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe analyst is witnessing the following step in the attack framework:\n\nB.
