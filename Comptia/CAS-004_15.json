PAM: Privileged access management (PAM) can help to control and monitor access to privileged accounts, such as those used by system administrators and IT staff. By implementing PAM, the healthcare system can restrict access to sensitive systems and limit the damage that an attacker can do if they gain access to privileged accounts.\n\nD.
