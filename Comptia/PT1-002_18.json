OpenVAS\n\nOpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is a free and open-source vulnerability scanner that can be used to identify vulnerabilities on a network or system. It can scan for known vulnerabilities on open ports and services, and can also check for specific vulnerabilities based on the version of the software running on the target system. Once vulnerabilities are identified, OpenVAS can also provide information about potential exploits that could be used to exploit those vulnerabilities.\n\nAfter identifying the open ports and services with Nmap, the next step is to check if there are any known vulnerabilities on those open ports, OpenVAS is a suitable tool to do that. Other tools such as Drozer and Burp Suite, can be used for testing the security of Android and web applications respectively, but they are not suitable for vulnerability scanning. OWASP ZAP is also a web application security scanner, it can be used to find vulnerabilities on web applications, but it's not suitable for vulnerability scanning on ports.","timestamp":"1679504220.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"question_text":"An Nmap network scan has found five open ports with identified services.

Wireshark is a widely used network packet analyzer that allows the capturing and analysis of network traffic in real-time. By capturing the traffic, the penetration tester can analyze it to extract FTP credentials, including usernames and passwords, being transmitted in clear text.","poster":"bieecop","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1689235740.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer: B.
