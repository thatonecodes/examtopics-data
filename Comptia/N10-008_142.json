This can lead to inconsistent or degraded network performance. By ensuring that the speed settings on the endpoint NICs match the configured speed of the network (in this case, gigabit speeds), technicians can address potential speed mismatches and improve overall network performance.

Devices’ duplex settings.\" Duplex settings, whether half-duplex or full-duplex, determine how data transmission occurs between devices. Mismatches in duplex settings can lead to performance issues, such as collisions in half-duplex mode or underutilization of the network’s capacity. Ensuring that both the NICs and switches are configured for full-duplex mode is critical for achieving the expected gigabit speeds, as it allows for simultaneous two-way communication, which is essential for maximizing the throughput of a gigabit network.","poster":"subaie503"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1246464","poster":"Heyling","timestamp":"1720756080.0","content":"C. Devices' duplex settings.\n\nWhen upgrading a network to gigabit speeds, it's essential to ensure that all devices, including endpoint NICs (Network Interface Cards), are configured to operate at the same speed and duplex mode. If the duplex settings are inconsistent, it can cause performance issues, such as slow speeds, packet loss, and network congestion.\n\nDuplex settings refer to whether a NIC operates in half-duplex or full-duplex mode. Half-duplex mode allows a device to either transmit or receive data at a time, while full-duplex mode allows simultaneous transmission and reception of data. If some devices are set to half-duplex and others are set to full-duplex, it can cause communication issues and slow down the network."},{"comment_id":"1206167","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA.

There's simply not enough data. They said the \"upgrade the network and PC\" this statement has no meaning. if they updated them to new hardware (Nic) then I'd assume that there set to auto negotiate and both items already be set to full duplex and speed of at least 1Gb/s. Now if the cabling is under 25 years old its prob CAT5E or better so it can handle 1Gb/s (assuming its wired never says one way or another.) It could be that the that now that we all moving at 10x the speed the system can't handle it and needs a load balancer but they didn't say the magic phrase busy when a lot of people are on (or hint at it.)\nAlso says \"speeds at endpoint NICs are inconsistent\". Now this could mean that some nics are fast and some are slow but I'm gonna guess its a single nic that sometimes fast and sometimes slow meaning the speed is inconsistent.
