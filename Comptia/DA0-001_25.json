A pie chart would be the best chart to use to identify the composition between the categories of the survey response data set. A pie chart is a circular chart that shows the proportions or percentages of a whole. Each slice of the pie represents a category, and the size of the slice represents the proportion or percentage of the total that belongs to that category. Pie charts are useful for showing the relative sizes of categories or for comparing the proportions of different categories. The other chart types (histogram, line, scatter plot, and waterfall) are not appropriate for showing the composition between categories."}],"answer_images":[],"question_id":122,"timestamp":"2023-01-02 07:51:00","isMC":true,"question_text":"An analyst needs to provide a chart to identify the composition between the categories of the survey response data set:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich of the following charts would be BEST to use?","answer_ET":"B","exam_id":351,"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"xdqz1Dm8bdNl1LgAq37M","answer_description":"","question_id":123,"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":351,"unix_timestamp":1730647560,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/150674-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-225-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-11-03 16:26:00","choices":{"D":"13","A":"9","B":"10","C":"12"},"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A data analyst reviews the following data set:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich of the following is the range value?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730647560.0","poster":"Adonisy","comment_id":"1306558","content":"Selected Answer: D\nRange value is max value - min value , 14-1 = 13","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image66.png"],"isMC":true,"topic":"1"},{"id":"uNqUXpVIktu8Oj1EqtSV","topic":"1","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1738979880,"exam_id":351,"question_id":124,"choices":{"D":"PHI","A":"PII","B":"PCI","C":"PBI"},"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-02-08 02:58:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156135-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-227-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"An analyst collected data that includes primary account numbers, expiration dates, and service codes.
