AES256 can be used for data in transition but as it is use oy one key, receiver should know it to be able to open (we can say that this can be sometimes tricky)... In other hand RSA use paired keys which require PKI infrastructure but it is no transfering of secrets... Also you can use AES and RSA together, RSA for exchanging of AES key... As it is third party, maybe they do not have digital certificates in place for secure data exchange so in that case we will need to go with AES... It is 50%-50% answer, and from my pov it is easier to use aes (litlle less secure because prerequisite of secret exchange) and rsa is more secure but complexity is higher as require PKI, so it could be more unconvenient ...
