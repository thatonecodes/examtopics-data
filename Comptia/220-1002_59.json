When installing an application over a network, the system needs to communicate with a specific IP address to download and install the software. This method is commonly used for remote installations or when deploying software across multiple devices within a network. Other installation methods, such as USB, script-based, or CD-ROM installations, do not necessarily rely on IP addresses for their execution.","comment_id":"1175109","timestamp":"1710607020.0","poster":"Tp2008","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"aka PXE","timestamp":"1652061600.0","poster":"iLikeBeagButt","comment_id":"598803","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Script-based","A":"USB","D":"CD-ROM","B":"Network-based"},"exam_id":338,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"answer":"B","question_id":291,"question_text":"Which of the following application installation methods requires the use of a valid IP address?","topic":"1"},{"id":"n48jx0NEDSrf6qWDZ8hG","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":338,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/54315-exam-220-1002-topic-1-question-388-discussion/","question_id":292,"answer":"B","choices":{"C":"Reinstall the operating system.","A":"Disable application startup.","D":"Disable Update Services.","B":"Rebuild the user profile."},"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1622667480,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"18","timestamp":"1623982320.0","comment_id":"384528","content":"It's definitely B.","poster":"JE39"},{"timestamp":"1710611160.0","content":"B-Rebuild the user profile\n\nThe technician should rebuild the user profile.
