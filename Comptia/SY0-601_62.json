To provide data to quantify risk based on the organization's systems.\n\nMaintaining a functional and effective asset management policy is essential for ensuring the security of an organization. This policy enables the organization to identify all assets, such as hardware, software, and data, that exist within its environment. Once all assets are identified, the organization can determine their value, the risks associated with each asset, and the controls needed to protect those assets from threats.\n\nBy having a clear picture of the organization's systems and assets, it becomes possible to identify vulnerabilities and prioritize efforts to address them. A well-executed asset management policy can provide the data necessary to quantify risk based on the organization's systems, which is crucial for effective risk management.\n\nWhile keeping software and hardware patched, only allowing approved devices onto the network, and standardizing hardware may all be important components of an asset management policy, they are not the primary reason for maintaining such a policy.","poster":"Ahmed_aldouky"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA, because while you can keep patches and the like up to date, a more general view is better in this case.
