Each object has a security attribute that identifies its access control list. The list has an entry for each system user with access privileges. The most common privileges include the ability to read a file (or all the files in a directory), to write to the file or files, and to execute the file (if it is an executable file, or program). Microsoft Windows NT/2000, Novell's NetWare, Digital's OpenVMS, and UNIX-based systems are among the operating systems that use access control lists. The list is implemented differently by each operating system\nWhat us DLP?Data loss prevention (DLP) makes sure that users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network.
