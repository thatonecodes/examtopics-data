It allows users to deploy and manage virtualized servers and other infrastructure components, giving them control over the hardware environment on which they can develop, deploy, and run their solutions.\n\nWhile PaaS (Platform as a Service) provides a platform with development tools and runtime environments, it does not typically offer access to the underlying hardware components in the same way that IaaS does. PaaS abstracts away the hardware layer, allowing developers to focus on building and deploying applications without managing the infrastructure.","timestamp":"1729976580.0","poster":"b64ee20","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1202820"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhen considering cloud models, the one that provides hardware environment equivalent components for developing a solution is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)","comment_id":"1199829","poster":"NewpMej","timestamp":"1729544280.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1713733080},{"id":"EFfN2auVqKWBoCdXpbap","choices":{"B":"An accountant pays an annual fee for the tools the company needs to work.","A":"A company leases electric vehicles for all of its employees.","C":"A car breaks down, and the driver presses a button to call for help.","D":"A consultant hires a web developer to create a website."},"question_id":467,"exam_id":339,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140450-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-519-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","answer":"B","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-05-13 03:22:00","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1715563320,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is the best example of SaaS?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729295460.0","comment_id":"1299835","poster":"2ba1468","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is B"},{"timestamp":"1716375720.0","content":"wouldn't Option B considered Paas?","poster":"Jayysaystgis","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1215680"},{"poster":"Duke_CT","comment_id":"1210547","content":"The best example of Software as a Service (SaaS) among the given options is:\n\nB.

RAID failure: If the message states that one or more disks are in a degraded state, it is likely that there has been a failure in the RAID array, which is a group of drives that work together to provide data redundancy or improved performance.\n\nC. Bootable device not found: If the message states that the OS is missing, it is likely that the server cannot find the bootable device that contains the operating system, which is necessary to start the server. This can be caused by a variety of issues, including disk failure, incorrect boot order, or missing boot files.\n\nOther causes listed, such as missing drives in the OS, data loss, controller failure, CMOS corruption, and TPM malfunction, can also contribute to the errors, but are less likely to be the root cause based on the information provided.","comment_id":"800832"},{"timestamp":"1674570720.0","poster":"takomaki","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"786603","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nIts BC, not data loss and heres why. Lets say you have a RAID 0. If one of the devices fails, you lost all the data. In that case it would be data loss. However, lets say its a RAID 1. In that case, you havent lost any data, in the professional sense. Its like saying you have a backup of the drive and the drive fails. Yeah, but the backup still has the data so you havent lost anything. However, the drive can still prevent the OS from loading in certain cases. If the failed drive was the active drive, the BIOS will fail to locate the OS until you mark the partition on the backup drive as active. For both RAIDs the OS isnt found, but only one case had data loss. As for RAID 5, I believe if the drive had the OS partition and it failed, you would need to use a USB to temporarily boot to the OS and recover the data. I suppose in that case it can be seen as data loss, since its not immediately accessible, and only accessible in a compressed, slow format, but even so, RAID 1 being degraded wouldn't be data loss."},{"content":"\"OS missing\" indicates that the Operating System is not found, it can be caused by missing drives in the OS or bootable device not found \n\nAnswers are A& B","upvote_count":"1","poster":"wepaid","timestamp":"1673570820.0","comment_id":"773967"},{"timestamp":"1669753920.0","comment_id":"730836","poster":"bconiglio","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nI'd go with BC but this is classic CompTIA 'gotcha' question.
