Thus, the very next sub-step of step 1 is to, you guessed it, identify symptoms. This can come in the form of more questions to the user or by investigating other avenues, but you're already gathering information by questioning the user in any capacity, no matter how little.\n\nAlso, small rant, and this is a pretty good place to do it. What the hell even is a step like \"gathering information\" anyway? If you proceed to step 3 and test your working theory of a problem, the entire purpose of the step is to gather information on whether you have the right grasp of the problem or not. So when you do that are you in step 3? Step 1? Both?\n\nRealistically speaking you're ALWAYS gathering information throughout the entire troubleshooting process, so the idea of having a blanket generic step such as \"gather information\" is about as useful as saying that step 1 is to exist, because you can't solve problems if you don't exist!
