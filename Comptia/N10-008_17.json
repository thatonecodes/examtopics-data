This is typically done using the \"ip helper-address\" command.\n\nFor example, if the IP address of the DHCP server is 10.0.0.1, you would configure the switch as follows:\n\nip helper-address 10.0.0.1\nThis will cause the switch to forward any DHCP requests it receives from clients to the DHCP server at 10.0.0.1. The DHCP server will then respond to the request and provide the client with an IP address and other necessary configuration information.\n\nIt's worth noting that this configuration will only work if the switch is connected to both the client and the DHCP server via separate network segments. If the switch is connected to both the client and the DHCP server on the same network segment, the DHCP request will not be forwarded."},{"poster":"Serghey927","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nEven Prof Messer in his videos demonstrates that a Router is configured to transmit the DORA processed OUTSIDE the local communication (LAN/WLAN) as relay (intermediary device, MITM, you get the ideea).","comment_id":"1250256","timestamp":"1721292600.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nL2 Switch has no routing table to route to DHCP server","comment_id":"1210700","timestamp":"1715574780.0","poster":"BigDazza_111"},{"timestamp":"1705228920.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"I think it must be router","poster":"Nettie_20","comment_id":"1122458"},{"timestamp":"1700917800.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"loma33","comment_id":"1080009","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe BEST device to configure as a DHCP relay is a:\n\nB.
