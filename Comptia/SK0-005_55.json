Failover refers to the failure of the active service provider node and passive node's taking over of its responsibilities. At that point, the server that was the passive node becomes the active node. It services clients and handles the cluster’s duties. Once the original active node returns to service, you may set it to act as the new passive node, or you may shift the services back to it, causing it to take back its active node role and relegating the formerly passive server to its original role. The term failback refers to the service returning to the original active node.","timestamp":"1724270220.0"}],"question_text":"Ann, an administrator, is configuring a two-node cluster that will be deployed.
