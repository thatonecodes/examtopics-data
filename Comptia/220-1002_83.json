The Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) protocol is used to centralize authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting (AAA). A RADIUS server can provide a way to authenticate wired and wireless users as well as devices before they are allowed to communicate on the network. Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS) also supports\nAAA, and it also makes it possible to separate the pieces of AAA so you don’t have to do all three on the same server. You could do authentication on a different server but still support authorization and accounting on a TACACS server, for example.\"","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Z_186"}],"answer":"C","choices":{"A":"MFA","B":"RADIUS","D":"LDAP","C":"TACACS+"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/76968-exam-220-1002-topic-1-question-535-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.networkworld.com/article/2838882/radius-versus-tacacs.html"},{"id":"PfK9ZwYDwOGKxHVSzdwl","answer_description":"","question_text":"When opening a browser, a user receives pop-ups and is redirected to a certain website.
