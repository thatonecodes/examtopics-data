These factors are used to measure the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment in a business or company. Corporate values compliance falls under the \"Governance\" category of ESG, as it directly relates to the ethical conduct and compliance of the business or company.

The answer would be C.RAM. At first I thought it was A.TOR since I saw the \"In an agenda for a kickoff meeting\" because RAM are usually done later during planning. Then there is the part \"some time is set aside to complete a document\". While it's less common to create a RAM during the kickoff meeting itself, it's not impossible. If the project manager and team decide to allocate time during the kickoff meeting to start outlining roles and responsibilities, milestones, and key decisions in a RAM as part of the initial project planning, it can be a proactive step.
