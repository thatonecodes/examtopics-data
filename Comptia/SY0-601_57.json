CYOD allows employees to use their personal computers to access the company's cloud computing environment, and the company manages the operating system, but the employees have the ability to choose the device they use to access the environment. This deployment model balances the benefits of a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) approach, where employees can use their preferred device, with the security and management needs of the company, as the company still retains some control over the device through operating system management."}],"exam_id":367,"question_id":284,"answers_community":["D (95%)","5%"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/97767-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-355-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"A":"CYOD","C":"COPE","B":"MDM","D":"VDI"},"timestamp":"2023-02-03 16:30:00","answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer":"D"},{"id":"VccCRzRBcSpEjPgAwemM","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1675944420,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2023-02-09 13:07:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98551-exam-sy0-601-topic-1-question-356-discussion/","question_id":285,"exam_id":367,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"847220","upvote_count":"27","content":"ust passed my exam today 22 March 2023 with 799 score.\nThis platform has helped.
