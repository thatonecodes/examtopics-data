Leverage a staging environment that is tightly controlled for showcasing.\n\nA staging environment is a near-exact replica of a production environment for testing purposes. This includes the same configurations, hardware, and software specifications. By adopting a staging environment, the consultancy group can ensure that the final product shown to customers closely matches what will be deployed in production. It serves as the last phase of testing to catch any remaining issues and allows clients to review and approve the work before it goes live. This approach should help address the discrepancy between the showcased product and the final deployed site, mitigating unexpected performance issues.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1169659","poster":"Joshuac1392"},{"timestamp":"1725708120.0","poster":"FrancisDrake","upvote_count":"1","content":"And I'm also not sure the entire solution is here.

Automated storage tiering\n\nAutomated storage tiering is a technique used to optimize storage performance by automatically moving data between different tiers of storage based on its access frequency and importance. In this scenario, since the company has limited SSD storage and a lot of spinning disks due to budget constraints, implementing automated storage tiering would allow frequently accessed and critical data to be stored on the faster SSD storage, while less frequently accessed data can be stored on the slower spinning disks. This would maximize speed for critical operations while efficiently utilizing the available resources.","poster":"Therealjosh","comment_id":"1183402"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","exam_id":349,"question_text":"A small marketing company recently moved all of its storage to a cloud provider.
