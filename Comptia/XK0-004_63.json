These tools can be used to determine specific latencies. While ping can be used to determine if a particular IP is reachable, the traceroute command can track the path that packets take to reach the host. It shows you how many hops it takes to reach the host and how long it takes between each hop. This allows you to diagnose possible bottlenecks in the network. MTR (also known as My Traceroute) is essentially a combination of Ping and Traceroute and is the most detailed.","poster":"DiaaEmara","comment_id":"725747","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1669286640.0"},{"comment_id":"563563","poster":"MeisAdriano","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA: valid because \"my trace route\" shows statistics of latency\nB: not valid because is for DNS queries\nC: not valid because uses services/ports\nD: not valid because is just for the routing table in private networks.","timestamp":"1646777160.0","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"id":"ZsluXM5fuKk4p7dXYRko","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1646777220,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/72495-exam-xk0-004-topic-1-question-89-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-03-08 23:07:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the valid answer.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"MeisAdriano","timestamp":"1646777220.0","comment_id":"563564"}],"exam_id":370,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"#/bin/bash find /etc ג€\"name services | sort > /var/tmp/foundservices","C":"#/bin/bash find ג€\"name services ג€\"sort </var/tmp/foundservices","B":"#/bin/bash locate /etc ג€\"sort ג€\"name services > /var/tmp/foundservices","D":"#/bin/bash find /etc ג€\"name services ג€\"sort > /var/tmp/foundservices"},"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"A Linux administrator wants to obtain a list of files and subdirectories in the /etc directory that contain the word `services`.
