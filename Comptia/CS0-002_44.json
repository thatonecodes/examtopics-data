This would prevent the developers from browsing the internet on the development servers and limit the attack surface on these servers. By using a security rule to block internet access, the security analyst can ensure that only the necessary traffic is allowed into the development VPC. Additionally, this approach would not impact the developers' ability to access the necessary resources and tools they need to perform their work. Placing a jumpbox or removing the administrator's profile from the developer user group in identity and access management may be useful in other contexts, but they are not the most appropriate solutions to address the security risks associated with browsing the internet on development servers.

A jumpbox, also known as a bastion host, is a secure, isolated machine that is used to access other systems in a secure manner. By using a jumpbox, the security analyst can ensure that only authorized users have access to the development servers, and all incoming connections are monitored and logged.
