This information can be combined with a mapping app to get directions or even to use search terms to find the goods and services you are looking for based on their proximity. So with the understanding of this behavior, it would be within reason that upon installation an advertising-based app would request access to the browser for advertising or business locations and certainly, the map app would be allowed to get the geolocation information. On installation conforming, apps will request the required features or data sets for your approval. If you deny this access the installation will usually terminate.
