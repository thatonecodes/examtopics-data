When the administrator makes changes to the feature branch, the changes are only available in the local repository. If the changes are ready to be merged into the main branch of the remote repository, the administrator can use the \"push\" command to upload the changes to the remote repository. This will make the changes available to others who are also working on the same repository.\n\nBefore pushing the changes to the remote repository, the administrator should first ensure that the changes are committed to the local repository using the \"commit\" command. The administrator should also ensure that the local repository is up-to-date with the remote repository by using the \"pull\" command to download any changes made by others before attempting to push the changes.
