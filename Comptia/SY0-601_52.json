Firstly, the URLs in the log entries appear to contain encoded characters that are commonly used in XSS attacks, such as <script> and %27.

In XSS, threat actors can execute a code, receive a response, and forward it to the desired destination whereas CSRF allows attackers only to raise a corrupted HTTP request.\nXSS is JavaScript-based while CSRF is HTTP-based.\nThe success of an XSS attack isn’t based on the session activation. Corrupted payloads are delivered whenever the user accesses the website. CSRF demands an active session be completed.\nThe scope of CSRF attacks is limited. At max, it leads to accessing corrupted websites or clicking on malicious links. The reach of XSS is far-flung and permits attackers to do anything they want.\nAbout XSS vs CSRF attacks, one key point is the way they both store the trouble-causing code.
