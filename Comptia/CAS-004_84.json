If the help desk claims that the certificate is valid, but remote users are claiming they're now getting warnings about an expired certificate, then it strongly suggests a timing issue or more specifically, the incorrect date/time on their systems.

NTP is crucial for ensuring that the system clocks across network devices are synchronized with accurate time. Certificates have a validity period defined by start and end dates, and they rely on the system clock to determine whether they are valid or expired. If the system clock on the VPN concentrator is incorrect due to misconfigured NTP settings, the VPN concentrator may mistakenly believe that the certificate has expired when it actually hasn't. This would result in VPN clients displaying warnings about expired certificates and refusing to connect. Therefore, ensuring correct NTP configuration on the VPN concentrator is essential to resolve this issue."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/143456-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-472-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_text":"A help desk analyst suddenly begins receiving numerous calls from remote employees who state they are unable to connect to the VPN.

Specifically, it looks for the presence of the string \"MS_T120\" in TCP traffic on port 3389, which is commonly used for RDP.\n\nTo mitigate vulnerabilities associated with RDP, including those detected by this Snort rule, one of the most effective measures is OS patching. Many CVEs affecting RDP are addressed through security updates and patches provided by operating system vendors (e.g., Microsoft for Windows systems). By ensuring that systems are regularly updated with the latest patches, organizations can mitigate the risk of exploitation via RDP vulnerabilities.","comment_id":"1243500","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1720291800.0","poster":"isaphiltrick"}],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/143457-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-473-discussion/","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-07-06 20:50:00","exam_id":343,"answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"7RUsCXklONx40mbbVpte","question_id":418,"unix_timestamp":1720291920,"answer":"B","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-07-06 20:52:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/143458-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-474-discussion/","exam_id":343,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"The information security manager at a 24-hour manufacturing facility is reviewing a contract for potential risks to the organization.
