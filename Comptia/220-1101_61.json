A router operates at the Network layer (OSI Layer 3) and acts as a boundary between different networks. It uses routing tables to determine the best path for data to travel from one network to another. Routers also use network address translation (NAT) to translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses, allowing multiple devices on a private network to access the internet using a single public IP address. Additionally, routers are used to separate broadcast domains, which means that broadcasts sent by one device on the network are not forwarded to other devices on the same network, effectively limiting the size of the broadcast domain and reducing network congestion.","upvote_count":"5"}],"question_id":301,"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"b5ufowX22pqhJQlHH3vk","timestamp":"2023-11-09 04:44:00","unix_timestamp":1699501440,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"A user tripped on an Ethernet cable and disconnected it from the wall jack.

Touch pens typically require power to function, and if the batteries are depleted, the pen may cease to work. Therefore, the user should try recharging the pen batteries to see if that resolves the issue.
