VXLAN provides the required isolation for tenants while allowing for the efficient use of available network resources"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nExplanation:\nVXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is the best solution when a company is running out of VLANs because:\n\n✔ Expands VLAN capacity: VLANs are limited to 4,096 IDs, while VXLAN supports 16 million segments.\n✔ Maintains tenant isolation: Each customer can have dedicated, segmented network tiers while still being isolated.\n✔ Works over existing infrastructure: VXLAN uses MAC-in-UDP encapsulation, allowing Layer 2 traffic to be transported over Layer 3 networks.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1363626","poster":"BigM","timestamp":"1740844860.0"},{"comment_id":"1248623","upvote_count":"1","content":"C. VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN): VXLAN is a network virtualization technology that extends the VLAN ID space to 24 bits, allowing for 16 million unique network segments, compared to the 4,096 VLAN limit. This is an ideal solution for addressing VLAN exhaustion and maintaining network isolation for tenants in a cloud environment.","poster":"54a6b25","timestamp":"1721093160.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135174-exam-cv0-003-topic-1-question-319-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1709566140,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-03-04 16:29:00","answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"IPsec","B":"SR-IOV","A":"GRE","C":"VXLAN"},"exam_id":349,"isMC":true},{"id":"cjAv8MdpJa8Z03dGkk4h","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A systems administrator is creating a VM and wants to ensure disk space is not allocated to the VM until it is needed.
