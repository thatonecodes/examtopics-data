The question mentions that the project involves inherent dangers related to the autonomous control of heavy machinery, which implies that the project requires skilled and experienced resources with the expertise to design and build such a system. Therefore, it is more likely that resource shortages, such as a lack of skilled and experienced resources, may have affected the project, causing delays and ultimately leading to the failure of the gate reviews. Additionally, low-quality resources are typically identified early in the project and can be replaced with better resources or provided with additional training, whereas resource shortages can be a more significant and long-lasting issue that can affect the project's success.","timestamp":"1677363960.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI bet kmanb soul that is D.

Inter-project dependencies occur when one project relies on the completion of another project or on resources from another project. If the other project experiences delays or issues, it can impact the progress of the dependent project. In this case, if the gate reviews, which are used to assess the progress and readiness of the project at various stages, were scheduled at regular intervals but failed, it is likely that the project was affected by inter-project dependencies. Other resource management issues, such as shared resources, resource shortages, and low-quality resources, may also have contributed to the project's difficulties, but inter-project dependencies are the most likely cause of the gate review failures","comment_id":"768732"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/94313-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-759-discussion/","exam_id":359,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.apm.org.uk/blog/the-project-risks-associated-with-putting-a-satellite-into-space/","timestamp":"2023-01-07 17:42:00","topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"question_id":461,"answers_community":["D (67%)","B (33%)"],"answer":"D","question_text":"A project manager has been overseeing an effort to build and design a new satellite-based navigation system for autonomous agriculture machines.
