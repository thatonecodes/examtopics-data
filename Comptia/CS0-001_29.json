The best practice is to avoid doing any last minute renewal, how can it be done, by renewing the certificate beforehand prior to the expired date.\n\nSecondly, we also do know that requesting to renew the certificate will take up some time such as the Certificate Authority will have to approve your renew application and etc. before reissuing you your new certificate.\n\nThirdly, the question also did state \"BEST addresses these finding\", if you choose option A by revoking and reissuing to match the hostname, that will resolved your issue temporarily but you'll eventually have to go back to option D because you did not fix the problem of the expiring certificate.\n\nLogically, you want to fix the root cause of the problem rather than the symptoms shown.\n\nhttps://docs.digicert.com/manage-certificates/renew-ssltls-certificate/","comment_id":"316125","upvote_count":"1","poster":"B1GHead","timestamp":"1616311380.0"}],"content":"Indeed option A is correct.\n\nD is a possible, but from a security perspective it is less safe than issuing individual SSL certificates for each backend web server. \n\nOption A: If certificate is compromised it will be only compromised for one web server.\nOption D: If a wildcard certificate is compromised, all your webservers are compromised.\nhttps://www.packetlabs.net/wildcard-certificates/","upvote_count":"3","poster":"0xff"}],"timestamp":"1601484540.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"rodya2020"}],"question_text":"A security analyst is running a routine vulnerability scan against a web farm.
