Password compromise would allow access to all of the systems.\nExplanation:\nIf a user reuses the same password across multiple systems, a compromise of that password on one system would give an attacker access to all systems where the same password is used. This is known as credential stuffing, where attackers use leaked passwords to gain unauthorized access to other accounts.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. The password might be easier for an attacker to guess.\nUsing the same password does not make it easier to guess; however, it increases the risk if leaked.\nC. Single sign-on would be unable to function correctly.\nSingle sign-on (SSO) is designed to use one set of credentials securely across multiple systems, but this is different from manually reusing the same password across independent systems.\nD. Systems might reject the password based on different requirements.\nWhile some systems have different complexity rules, this is not the biggest security risk compared to full account compromise.","poster":"lexxone"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1739747220.0","poster":"Torrente","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe primary risk of using the same password across multiple systems is that if the password for one system is compromised, an attacker can use it to gain access to all of the systems where the same password is used.","comment_id":"1357452"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":66,"topic":"1","exam_id":352,"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156621-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-178-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1739747220,"choices":{"D":"Systems might reject the password based on different requirements.","C":"Single sign-on would be unable to function correctly.","A":"The password might be easier for an attacker to guess.","B":"Password compromise would allow access to all of the systems."},"timestamp":"2025-02-17 00:07:00","question_images":[]},{"id":"fdRw15FglTbRigu0flt7","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
