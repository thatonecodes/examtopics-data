Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nCVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a framework that provides a way to evaluate the severity of a vulnerability. CVSS uses a set of metrics to measure the potential impact of a vulnerability and assign it a score.\n\nThe \"Local\" metric in CVSS measures the degree of access required to exploit the vulnerability. A \"Local\" vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker who has physical access to the system or who has already compromised the system through a separate attack.\n\nIn this scenario, modifying the Tomcat configuration file requires local access to the system and cannot be exploited remotely.

A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical grouping of network devices, which allows the analyst to create a secure environment for the malware analysis lab by separating it from other networks. By using a managed switch, the analyst can control which devices are connected to the VLAN and monitor network traffic between devices. This allows the analyst to isolate the lab and prevent malicious applications from escaping the virtual machines and pivoting to other networks. A wireless bridge, an unmanaged switch, or a firewall alone would not provide the same level of security and control as a managed switch with VLANs.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"808228"},{"poster":"gnnggnnggnng","timestamp":"1675515120.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA firewall is the best option to isolate the lab network from all other networks because it acts as a barrier that separates different networks and ensures that traffic only flows between the networks according to specified rules. By using a firewall, the analyst can ensure that malicious applications are not capable of escaping the virtual machines and pivoting to other networks, as the firewall would block any such attempts. This provides a high degree of security for the lab environment and ensures that any malicious activity is contained within the lab.","comment_id":"797949"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1675515120,"choices":{"D":"an unmanaged switch to segment the environments from one another.","A":"an 802.11 ac wireless bridge to create an air gap.","B":"a managed switch to segment the lab into a separate VLAN.","C":"a firewall to isolate the lab network from all other networks."},"exam_id":346,"answer":"C","question_id":225,"timestamp":"2023-02-04 13:52:00","answers_community":["C (60%)","B (40%)"],"question_images":[],"isMC":true}],"exam":{"id":346,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"name":"CS0-002","provider":"Comptia","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":422},"currentPage":45},"__N_SSP":true}
