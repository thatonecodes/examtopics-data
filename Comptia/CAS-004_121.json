Identity and access management. The policy described revolves around auditing user access, tracking login activity, and ensuring accounts remain active based on usage. This is a core practice within Identity and Access Management (IAM), which focuses on managing the identities of users, controlling access to resources, and enforcing policies around those identities and their access rights. The practice of auditing access and enforcing rules about account inactivity fits directly into IAM processes.","comment_id":"1365169","poster":"Bright07","timestamp":"1741135020.0"}],"choices":{"E":"Identity and access management","C":"Just-in-time access","B":"Least privilege","D":"Job rotation","A":"Risk appetite"},"answers_community":["E (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157554-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-642-discussion/"},{"id":"Ty1OkIAzDIyx0SY3ur6M","discussion":[{"poster":"Bright07","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe most likely cause of the issue is D. The external recipient's email address and the email address associated with the external recipient's public key are mismatched. When sending encrypted emails, especially using protocols like S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), the recipient’s public key is used to encrypt the message. This public key is typically associated with the recipient's email address. If the email address in the recipient’s public key does not match the actual email address of the recipient (for example, if the email address is outdated or incorrect in the public key directory), the internal user's email client may not be able to encrypt the email correctly, leading to an error. Since the internal user can send unencrypted emails successfully, this indicates that basic email delivery is not an issue. The problem specifically arises when encryption is involved, suggesting that it is tied to the public key or email address mismatch rather than a server or broader system configuration problem.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1365172","timestamp":"1741135380.0"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"An internal user can send encrypted emails successfully to all recipients, except one, at an external organization.

UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)\nUser and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is a security process that uses machine learning and advanced analytics to detect unusual patterns of behavior by users and entities (devices, applications, etc.) within an organization’s network. UEBA can help automatically detect suspicious activity, such as abnormal logins or access patterns, which could indicate a security breach. By implementing UEBA, the security team can streamline the process of analyzing logs and detecting anomalies, as it uses algorithms to identify patterns and flag suspicious behavior more efficiently than manual log review.\nThis will enable the team to focus on higher-level tasks and respond more quickly to potential threats in the future, as the system can automatically flag unusual activities and correlate them with specific employees or entities.","comment_id":"1365176","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[],"question_id":603,"question_images":[],"question_text":"After a lengthy exercise manually analyzing various types of logs related to a security breach, a security team was able to tie the activity to specific employees.

AES-GCM. AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that provides strong confidentiality and integrity protections for data at rest. It is both secure and efficient for encrypting sensitive data such as PII and is a standard in modern cryptographic systems.\nAES-GCM combines the AES encryption algorithm with the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), which provides built-in authenticated encryption, ensuring that the data not only remains confidential but also that the integrity of the data is guaranteed (i.e., it detects tampering). This makes it ideal for protecting sensitive information stored on a filesystem in a cloud environment. So to ensure confidentiality of information at rest (such as PII) on the filesystem in a cloud environment, AES-GCM (Option B) is the best choice.

Active-active clustering allows both servers to share the load and respond to requests, providing redundancy and preventing a single point of failure.
