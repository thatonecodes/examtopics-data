If the correct order of execution is required for the proper functioning of the program, this is a bug. If an attacker can take advantage of the situation to insert malicious code, change a filename, or otherwise interfere with the normal operation of the program, the race condition is a security vulnerability. Attackers can sometimes take advantage of small time gaps in the processing of code to interfere with the sequence of operations, which they then exploit.(https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/Articles/RaceConditions.html).

Although race condition attacks don’t happen frequently — because they’re relatively difficult to engineer and attackers must exploit a very brief window of opportunity — when they do happen, they can lead to serious repercussions, including a system granting unauthorized privileges.
