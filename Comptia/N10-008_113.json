Jitter\n\nJitter refers to the variation in packet arrival time at the receiving end. It can result in the loss of data packets or poor voice quality in VoIP systems due to the irregular delivery of data. Jitter is a significant concern for real-time applications such as VoIP, video conferencing, and online gaming, as it can cause delays and disruptions in communication.\n\nBandwidth (option A) refers to the capacity of a network to transmit data. Latency (option B) is the time delay between the sending of a data packet and the receiving of a response.
