In the power industry, where critical infrastructure is controlled by Industrial Control Systems (ICS), an air gap helps isolate sensitive equipment from potentially compromised networks. If a system connected to the internet is attacked, the malware cannot reach the air-gapped ICS network and compromise power generation equipment.","timestamp":"1741612080.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Steel16","comment_id":"1381466"},{"comment_id":"1331238","timestamp":"1735076280.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Bright07","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe main reason for using air-gapped and offline methods in the power industry is to prevent malicious code from gaining control over critical power generation equipment and triggering damaging failures. This approach isolates the systems from network-based threats, ensuring they remain secure even in the event of a cyberattack. Air-gapping is a security measure that physically isolates critical systems (like industrial control systems or SCADA systems) from the internet and any external networks. This is done to prevent cyberattacks from spreading to or manipulating critical equipment, especially in industries like power generation where security breaches could have catastrophic consequences. Therefore, the correct answer is A."}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1735076280,"question_text":"Which of the following is the reason security engineers in the power industry include mechanisms to control power generation equipment via air-gapped and other offline methods?","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"The brittleness of electrical relays subject to repeated power cycles over a short period of time","A":"The ability of some malicious code to maneuver and trigger repeated damaging failures","D":"The requirements to maintain administrative systems in the event of a power outage","B":"The capability of ICS control to be centrally managed and logged"},"exam_id":343,"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_id":511,"timestamp":"2024-12-24 22:38:00","answer_description":""},{"id":"qf8GItS0VSRkMuWP56Ly","timestamp":"2024-12-24 22:43:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153402-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-559-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1735076580.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRegular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and can be used to identify sensitive data within documents. DLP systems often use regex to detect specific patterns that match sensitive information formats, such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or other personally identifiable information (PII). By configuring the DLP system with regular expressions, you can help it identify and label documents containing cardholder information or other sensitive data automatically. For example, a regex pattern could be designed to match the format of a credit card number (e.g., a sequence of 16 digits, grouped in blocks of 4). Once the system detects this pattern, it can classify or label the document as containing cardholder information.","poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1331241"}],"question_id":512,"question_text":"Several unlabeled documents in a cloud document repository contain cardholder information.
