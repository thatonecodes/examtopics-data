Query the file's metadata is the correct answer because metadata provides direct information about the file's creation date and possibly the creator. This method is the most efficient and effective way to gather the required details about a potentially malicious video file. By querying the file's metadata, the security analyst can access information about when the file was created and potentially who created it, assuming the creator's details were embedded or tagged during the file's creation."}],"exam_id":368,"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":36,"unix_timestamp":1717141500},{"id":"TOZgM2J9J6qf3nOixJke","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","question_id":37,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"exam_id":368,"unix_timestamp":1716454680,"question_text":"Which of the following teams combines both offensive and defensive testing techniques to protect an organization's critical systems?","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/141098-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-131-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-05-23 10:58:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1216408","poster":"123456789User","upvote_count":"26","timestamp":"1716454680.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRed = offensive\nBlue = defensive\nYellow = builders\nPurple = mix of offensive and defensive.
