In this situation, port 22 is closed and port 23 is open to SSH which means that some application is running on that port. Telnet is a protocol that runs as a client-server application and typically used the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to establish a connection, it by default used port 23. Although the client has indicated that they've disabled Telnel but, the open port, 23 indicated that the Tenel services are running and the organization has not disabled Telnet.\n\nOther options cannot be true as:\n\n→ Although the SSH service can run on other non-standard ports but, this range would be from port 1024 to 32767, hence port 23 cannot be in this range.\n\n→ The NMap has stated that port 22 is closed, therefore port 22 cannot be filtered as if NMap is not able to get any response from a port it states it as filtered, and if a port is closed that means it is actually closed.

Meaning that port 23 showing Telnet to be enabled is in fact a false positive?\n\nHowever, if Telnet is actually still enabled it could lead me to believe D to be the right answer, as it doesn't seem like it's currently running on port 23 (the question indicates SSH is using that port) which would mean the only logical conclusion must be Telnet running on some other non-standard port?\n\nThen there's also answer A which could by all means also be the answer CompTIA are looking for?
