To provide context to the relevancy of risk: Risk scenarios are a way to contextualize potential risks, making them more tangible and relatable to the organization’s specific situation. By using real-world or hypothetical examples, risk scenarios help stakeholders understand the potential impacts of threats and vulnerabilities on the organization. This provides context, making it easier to prioritize risks based on their relevance to business operations, assets, and goals. Contextualizing potential risks means making abstract or technical risks easier to understand by tying them to real-world situations that people can relate to. It helps show why a certain risk matters, what could happen if it occurs, and why it’s important to address it.","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":343,"answer":"D","question_id":567,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155456-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-609-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1737937080,"timestamp":"2025-01-27 01:18:00","topic":"1","choices":{"C":"To present a comprehensive view of risk","D":"To provide context to the relevancy of risk","B":"To ensure a consistent approach to risk","A":"To connect risks to business objectives"}},{"id":"d5mSLC9az457MqOmmYCq","answer_description":"","exam_id":343,"answers_community":["C (76%)","A (16%)","8%"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"770207","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNo further security meassures have been implemented, so an incident response plan must be addressed.

Web content filter: A web content filter can prevent users from accessing unauthorized sites or transferring data to malicious or risky websites. By monitoring and filtering web traffic, the security team can ensure that employees can only access approved and safe sites.

Agents can identify vulnerabilities specific to the host, rather than treating each network interface as a separate entity. This method also provides better asset tracking and vulnerability association with specific systems.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1347171","timestamp":"1737937920.0"}]}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":642,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Comptia","name":"CAS-004","isMCOnly":false,"id":343,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":114},"__N_SSP":true}
