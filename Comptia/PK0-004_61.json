Publish an agenda prior to the meeting would be the BEST action for the project manager to take to improve the level of attendance.\n\nWhen team members are aware of what the meeting will cover, they can better prepare and understand the importance of their presence. By publishing an agenda prior to the meeting, the project manager can ensure that everyone is aware of the purpose of the meeting and what is expected of them.
