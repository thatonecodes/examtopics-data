Halt the penetration test.\n\nThis is not the best response because halting the test without further investigation might not be necessary and could delay the security assessment process.\nB. Conduct an incident response.\n\nThis is not the best response because it might be premature to initiate an incident response without first verifying if the alarm was caused by the penetration test.\nC. Deconflict with the penetration tester.\n\nThis is the correct response. Deconflicting means communicating with the penetration tester to verify if the alarm was caused by their activities.

Deconflict with the penetration tester.\n\nThis step allows the company to verify whether the alarms were triggered by the authorized penetration test or if there may be a real security incident.

Assume the alert is from the penetration test.\n\nHere's why this is the appropriate action:\n\nAssume the alert is from the penetration test: During a penetration test, it's common for security measures such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or other monitoring tools to detect the activities of the penetration tester. These systems are designed to flag suspicious or anomalous behavior, which includes the actions taken by the penetration tester to identify vulnerabilities. Therefore, the company should initially assume that the triggered alarms are a result of the ongoing penetration test.","comments":[{"content":"I think it's C, the client needs to speak with the pentest team.

Once they identify (and dont wait around if pentester may not be quickly reachable) they can deconflict whether what they found is what the pentester is testing or if it is outside the scope (where then they dont even need to deconflict with the pentester). Incident response first makes the most sense, you never know when a hacker is aware of a pentest going on at a company (because he already compromised them) and decides to use the event as cover for actual damage."},{"timestamp":"1720039560.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000","comment_id":"1241648","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Deconflict with the penetration tester: Before taking any further action, it is crucial to confirm whether the triggered security alarms are part of the authorized penetration testing activities. This ensures that there is no misunderstanding and that legitimate testing activities are not mistaken for actual security incidents.\n\nAnalysis of Other Options:\n\nA. Halt the penetration test: Halting the test immediately may be unnecessary and could disrupt the planned activities. It should only be considered if deconfliction confirms that the alerts are not part of the test or if there is an immediate threat.\nB. Conduct an incident response: Conducting a full incident response may be premature if the alarms are indeed part of the penetration test. Deconfliction should occur first.\nD.
