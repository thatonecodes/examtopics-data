Ensure all database queries are encrypted -> you can encrypt databases, not \"queries\" because you need data in clear. Only password should be encrypted via hashing(it is a one way solution, just for integrity!), but any other type of data just need physical encryption\nX) B. Create an IPSec tunnel between the database server and its clients -> ipsec it is for site-to-site, you can't use it with \"clients\"\nX) C. Enable protocol encryption between the storage and the hypervisor -> \"hypervisor encryption\" is different from \"VM encryption\". But doesn't exist an encryption protocol between \"storage\" and \"hypervisor\"\nV) D. Enable volume encryption on the storage\nX) E. Enable OS encryption -> can be a solution, but maybe data are saved on different storage, so if you encrypt \"OS\" you didn't match the solution.
