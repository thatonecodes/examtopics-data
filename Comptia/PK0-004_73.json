Add the uncompleted work to the product backlog.\n\nIn Scrum, the product backlog is a prioritized list of work that needs to be completed. If the team is unable to complete their tasks before the end of the sprint due to unforeseen circumstances, the Scrum master should work with the team to add the uncompleted work to the product backlog. This allows the team to prioritize the remaining work and determine how to best allocate their resources to complete it.\n\nAdding the uncompleted work to the product backlog also allows the team to reassess the scope of the sprint and determine if it is still realistic given the unexpected downtime. The Scrum master may also need to work with the team to adjust the sprint plan to account for the lost time and ensure that the team is able to deliver a potentially shippable increment of work at the end of the sprint.","comment_id":"769797","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"791350","timestamp":"1674961620.0","poster":"BreathHaier","content":"!!!!! how the Scrum master should assist the team to finish on time? !!!!!\n\nOnly A makes this possible.
