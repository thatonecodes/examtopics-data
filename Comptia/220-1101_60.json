Reseat the webcam.\nReseating the webcam means unplugging and plugging back the webcam into the laptop’s USB port. This can help to ensure that the webcam is properly connected and recognized by the laptop. Reseating the webcam is a simple and quick troubleshooting technique that can solve many common issues, such as loose or faulty connections, power or bandwidth problems, or driver or software conflicts.\nReseating the webcam is the first step that a technician should do, because it follows the principle of starting with the easiest and most obvious solution before moving on to more complex and time-consuming ones.\nReseating the webcam can also help to isolate the problem and eliminate other possible causes.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1735786260.0","poster":"Adrx","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1335342","content":"Selected Answer: B\nHow can you reset a web cam when almost everyone are usb? plug it out and plug it in?"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1714160400.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt's asking \"What should the technician do FIRST\" and reseating the webcam would be the simplest thing to do initially.

DHCP scope.\n\nA DHCP scope defines a range of IP addresses that a DHCP server can assign to network clients. This allows clients to automatically obtain IP addresses when they connect to the network, eliminating the need for manual configuration.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. Static IP list: A static IP list is a predefined set of IP addresses that are assigned to specific devices. It doesn't provide dynamic IP address assignment.\nC. DNS A records: DNS A records map domain names to IP addresses. They are used for name resolution, not for IP address assignment.\nD. Automatic private IP addressing: This is a feature of some networking devices that allows them to automatically assign IP addresses from a private IP address range.
