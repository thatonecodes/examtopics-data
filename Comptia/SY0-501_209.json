To be clear, I am not saying I memorized answers, but rather I genuinely read the discussions and lived on Google while reading these Q&As. Now onto the test. Out of the 1000+ questions across both of these sites, maybe 10 were on the test. Almost every single question on the test was the first time I has seen it. Be aware if you are just trying to memorize answers without knowing why you are answering. I scored an 813. So yay! Thank you to all those who contributed to the discussions. It provides those of us who do not specialize in one area with a sliver of understanding on how to navigate the various areas of the IT world. Good luck everyone who tests after me! And take care."},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"323455","timestamp":"1617022680.0","content":"1 of 2 Hey all, just wanted to provide an update as I tested on 3/26/21. As background, I have ONLY ever been on the leadership/PM side of the house (2007-present)--so, I have a mile-wide understanding of a great many areas, but only an inch deep of any given area. Thus, when studying, I had a basic understanding of ~60% of the terms (e.g. GPO) and their uses (e.g. block USB devices). This is one example. I ended up going through this site, as well as, certification-questions.com. I'd say 80% of the questions were on both sites, but the latter site did have questions that weren't here. As others have said, the discussion areas are invaluable for all those like me just don't have a specialization. I would also say it is important to understand that security-minded folks made this test--not operators/engineers. There are many questions where the broader community is convinced the rendered answer is incorrect. Stated otherwise, in some cases with this test, there is a test answer and a real life answer.
