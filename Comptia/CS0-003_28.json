Locking the account due to many failed attemps can cause A LOT of problems. What is stopping the attacker from doing it again? \n\nBlocking them IP address here, would make the most real world practical sense as it does not affect production. But they can easily switch IP addresses, so that's why I think setting up whitelisting would be a better option, or even setting up rate limiting or requiring MFA are better options too.
