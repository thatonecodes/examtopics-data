Deliver an updated threat signature throughout the EDR system.\n\nWhen an organization uses a sandbox environment to execute zero-day software and collect indicators of compromise, it is essential to have an updated threat signature throughout the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) system. EDR systems help identify and remediate suspicious activities in the network environment. By delivering updated threat signatures, EDR systems can detect zero-day exploits that evade signature-based security solutions, such as antivirus, firewalls, and intrusion detection/prevention systems. Therefore, updating the threat signature throughout the EDR system is the best way to leverage the sandbox environment's benefits and prevent zero-day threats.","timestamp":"1731237180.0","upvote_count":"8"}],"question_id":151,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/108857-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-234-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Include the signature in the vulnerability scanning tool.","A":"Develop an Nmap plug-in to detect the indicator of compromise.","D":"Deliver an updated threat signature throughout the EDR system.","B":"Update the organization's group policy."},"exam_id":343,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-05-10 11:13:00","unix_timestamp":1683709980,"answer":"D","question_text":"A security solution uses a sandbox environment to execute zero-day software and collect indicators of compromise.

The anomalous external files on the server suggest that the attacker gained access to the system. Therefore, the attacker must have had privileged credentials or access that allowed them to upload the files. By looking for privileged credential reuse on the network, the administrator can identify any credentials that have been compromised and potentially used by the attacker to gain access to the system.

The anomalous files on the critical server indicate an insider threat or an attacker having physical access to the system.
