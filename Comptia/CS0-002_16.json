Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is designed to allow vehicle microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other’s applications without a host computer. Sounds great, huh?\n\nIt turns out CAN is a low-level protocol and does not support any security features intrinsically. There is also no encryption in standard CAN implementations, which leaves these networks open to data interception.\n\nFailure by vendors to implement their own security measures may result in attacks if attackers manage to insert messages on the bus. While passwords exist for some safety-critical functions, such as modifying firmware, programming keys, or controlling antilock brake actuators, these systems are not implemented universally and have a limited number of seed/key pairs (meaning a brute-force attack is more likely to succeed). Hopefully, an industry security standard for the CAN bus will be developed at some point."},{"timestamp":"1662805440.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"665312","content":"it's B. if it doesn't have any networ capacity, it wont be an IoT device","poster":"Felix010"},{"poster":"Belijmag","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"662518","timestamp":"1662556500.0","content":"Also agree with D"},{"timestamp":"1662480240.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree with D","poster":"Belijmag","comment_id":"661426"},{"comment_id":"661030","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1662454920.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n\"Some of the most critical IoT deployments are those found on vehicles and drones.
