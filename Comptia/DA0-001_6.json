Snowflake\n\nIn a snowflake schema, dimension tables are typically normalized, meaning that they are broken down into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This normalization helps to organize the data efficiently and reduce storage space by avoiding unnecessary duplication of information. Therefore, among the options provided, the snowflake schema is the one that features normalized dimension tables.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729114920.0","comment_id":"1196833"}],"question_id":26,"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"peWs52jfu0JBGynN0Cw8","timestamp":"2024-04-16 23:45:00","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1713303900,"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138899-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-122-discussion/","question_id":27,"answers_community":[],"choices":{"C":"A daily printout of a report","A":"An emailed report","D":"A cloud-hosted spreadsheet","B":"A password-protected dashboard"},"exam_id":351,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"A military commander would like to see the health scorecards of the troops daily and filter them based on gender and rank.\n\nConsidering this data is PHI, which of the following would be the best way for the commander to view the information?","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729115100.0","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","comment_id":"1196834","content":"B. A password-protected dashboard\n\nA password-protected dashboard would provide secure access to the health scorecards while allowing the commander to filter the information based on gender and rank. This method ensures that only authorized individuals can access the data while still providing the necessary functionality for viewing and filtering the information. It also reduces the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches compared to emailing reports, printing reports, or using cloud-hosted spreadsheets, which may not provide the same level of security and access control.","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"Vx15jZuVglMVisZVxgtS","choices":{"C":"Data is defined with key-value pairs.","B":"Data is stored in defined rows.","D":"Data is housed in a markup language.","A":"Data is separated by a delimiter."},"unix_timestamp":1713304020,"isMC":true,"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-04-16 23:47:00","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":351,"discussion":[{"content":"A. Data is separated by a delimiter.\n\nFlat text files are characterized by having data that is typically stored as plain text and separated by delimiters such as commas, tabs, or spaces. Each record in a flat text file is typically represented as a single line, and the fields within each record are separated by the chosen delimiter. This distinguishes them from other data types where data might be stored in defined rows (like in databases), defined with key-value pairs (like in JSON or YAML files), or housed in a markup language (like HTML or XML).","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729115220.0","comment_id":"1196835"}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following differentiates a flat text file from other data types?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138900-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-123-discussion/","question_id":28,"answers_community":[]},{"id":"fni1K9cLIgzlZtn5LYF3","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138901-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-124-discussion/","answers_community":[],"question_id":29,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"C":"Recurring report","A":"Static report","D":"Ad hoc report","B":"Tactical report"},"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1713304080,"timestamp":"2024-04-16 23:48:00","question_images":[],"answer":"C","exam_id":351,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1196837","timestamp":"1729115280.0","content":"C.
