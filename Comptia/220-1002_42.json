The Processes tab more than anything else, because it lets you quickly see how system resources are utilized, which can be very helpful when trying to troubleshoot applications or find out why the computer is suddenly performing slowly.

The Processes tab offers a closer look at what might be contributing to the problem and provides a rundown of which processes are taking up the most power and RAM, which is key for figuring out how to lower CPU usage. From there, you can then either stop the processes that are using up disproportionate resources, or, if the process in question isn’t normally such a drain on CPU and memory, work to fix the underlying issues.","poster":"ronah","comment_id":"531944","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1643096040.0"},{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"456493","timestamp":"1633254120.0","poster":"adeshtall","content":"Guys we need to read the question carefull, remmber the technitian stops some running application but the issues come back again after the the window was started again, itmeans he just stopped but it come back , the only was to stop it complitely its through msconfig that sonly option it want start again on start up.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"564118","timestamp":"1646838900.0","content":"We can stop applications that start with the startup of Windows, through the Task manager's Startup tab, we can also see the impact of an application upon starting there\n.","poster":"Jets_95"},{"comment_id":"573377","content":"It says next day, maybe the startup apps you can disable the startups in the task manager and also there is a services tab you can disable the services too.","poster":"chan_chahal","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1648007520.0"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"nasinec","timestamp":"1665277320.0","content":"also, while you can use Task manager to disable startup of applications, this would not apply to Windows 7.
