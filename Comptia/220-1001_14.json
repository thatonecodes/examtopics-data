It's an easy tool for seeing tons of issues. Make sure to keep good records of events in your setup as well.

It'll go a long way in helping you on the job.","timestamp":"1574694060.0","poster":"MrCompTIA","comment_id":"24340"},{"content":"RAID arrays use a battery backed cache, so they can process data faster than they can write it. Without the battery, they couldn't do caching without risk of data loss during a power failure. If your raid controllers battery (BBU) is dead, then write caching will be disabled. \nOn a dell server running windows server 2012r2 with a PERC raid controller, an error pops up telling me that the battery has failed and that write caching has been disabled. I truly hope that this appears in the event log as well, but it is hard to say. That raid controller in my Dell server can be accessed using the \"Openmanage Server Administrator\" tool, which is a web server running at localhost:1311 (https) - but on another server of mine that has (I think) an LSI Megaraid controller, it doesnt let me manage it from within windows at all. I have to manage it all during a bootup of the server. - needless to say, I don't beleive that one shows me any errors in the windows event log. I have to observe the blinking lights, or hang around the office late at night to do a scheduled reboot to check on it.\n\nRegardless, the first thing you do is check the log. Then you probably need to replace that damned battery....","timestamp":"1612560720.0","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Some_Random_Nerd","comment_id":"284412"},{"content":"It's an easy tool for seeing tons of issues","comment_id":"611691","upvote_count":"1","poster":"zahidchaudhary","timestamp":"1654408620.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB, Agreed.
