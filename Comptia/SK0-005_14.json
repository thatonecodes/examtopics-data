Crash cart.\n\nA crash cart is the most cost-effective option for administering and troubleshooting network problems locally on the servers in a server room. It is a mobile cart equipped with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse that can be wheeled up to a server for on-site support. It allows the server administrator to interact with the server as if they were physically present, without having to be physically stationed in the server room.\n\nA management port, IP KVM, and KVM are other options for remote server administration, but they are generally more expensive than a crash cart. Management port provides remote access to server management interfaces, but does not allow for physical interaction with the server.

This environment includes computers, raised flooring, full utilities, electrical and communications wiring, networking equipment, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs). The only resource that must be restored at a hot site is the organization's data, usually only partially. It should only take a few minutes to bring a hot site to full operation.\n Although a hot site provides the quickest recovery, it is the most expensive to maintain.
