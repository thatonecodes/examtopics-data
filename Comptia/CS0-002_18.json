Application stress testing can be conducted once you implement the application in a staging environment.\n\nBusiness impact analysis (BIA) is the process of assessing what losses might occur for each threat scenario. For instance, if a roadway bridge crossing a local river is washed out by a flood and employees are unable to reach a business facility for five days, estimated costs to the organization need to be assessed for lost manpower and production.

Replacing `strcpy` with a function like `fgets` or `fread` would be more appropriate for reading data from a file.","timestamp":"1696543200.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1025998","poster":"AbdallaAM"},{"timestamp":"1678046760.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe code snippet provided shows that the program is reading data from the \"access.log\" file and then copying it into a buffer using the \"strcpy\" function. However, the size of the buffer is fixed at 100 bytes, which could cause a buffer overflow if the data in the file is larger than 100 bytes. This can lead to a crash or other security vulnerabilities.\n\nTo fix this issue, the security analyst should recommend replacing the \"strcpy\" function with a safer alternative, such as \"strncpy\" or \"memcpy,\" which take a size parameter to ensure that only a certain number of bytes are copied to the buffer. Additionally, the size of the buffer should be increased to accommodate larger files if necessary.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"830278","poster":"kiduuu"},{"content":"I think Option B is correct.\nIncreasing the size of the buffer may temporarily fix the symptom of the issue, but it does not address the underlying problem of a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Qongo","comment_id":"816299","timestamp":"1676961900.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nI taked from book;\n\nC and C++ contain built-in functions suchas strcpy that do not provide a default mechanism for checking if data will overwritethe boundaries of a buffer. \n\nSo i going with B.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676122680.0","poster":"absabs","comment_id":"805250"},{"poster":"encxorblood","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"790587","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe strncpy() function is insecure because if the NULL character is not available in the first n characters in the source string then the destination string will not be NULL terminated.","timestamp":"1674908760.0"},{"poster":"smudder","comment_id":"789521","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Perform input sanitization.\n\nThe issue with the code excerpt is that it is not properly handling user input, which can lead to a program crash if the access.log file contains unexpected or malicious data. Input sanitization is the process of ensuring that user input is valid and safe to use. This can involve checking for and removing invalid characters, validating the input against a known set of acceptable values, or implementing other techniques to ensure that the input is safe to use. By performing input sanitization, the security analyst can help to prevent the program from crashing due to unexpected or malicious input.","timestamp":"1674816840.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1674157500.0","poster":"jleonard_ddc","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"781548","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB for sure. But that's not just because every study guide says strcopy is bad. More importantly, it's about why.\n\nstrcopy is bad because it's susceptible to buffer overflow. The hint that the program is crashing is implying it's because of \"buffer overflow\".\n\nA and D bot had me going at first, but are eliminated after further review for this reason:\nstrcopy parameters are (dest, src) [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strcpy.htm]\n\nSo for this question\nsrc = fp (the access.log file)\ndest = the filedata array\n\nThis means the file buffer is irrelevant, as are the permissions.
