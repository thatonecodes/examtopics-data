Attackers can easily change IP addresses, so blocking a range is more effective in limiting their access.\n\nGeoblocking (Option A) can be effective in some cases, but it might inadvertently block legitimate traffic or lead to false positives if the IP range includes legitimate users or services.

' MEANING FROM THE MOMENT THE BREACH IS IDENTIFIED TO WHEN ITS RESOLVED , EXCLIDING THE HOURS THAT CAN BE SPENT TO DETECT. MTTD is essentially the time it takes to detect an issue, while MTTR tells us how long it takes to repair it.. Therefore Option C is the correct answer.","timestamp":"1715769900.0"}],"comment_id":"1084419","timestamp":"1701352560.0","upvote_count":"6"}],"timestamp":"1701055980.0","comment_id":"1081175","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: C\nGoing with C only because Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) isn't listed on the Exam Objectives (4.2 Explain the importance of incident response reporting and communication).
