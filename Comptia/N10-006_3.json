The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include spare (redundant) links to provide automatic backup paths if an active link fails, without the danger of bridge loops, or the need for manual enabling/disabling of these backup links.","unix_timestamp":1688506080,"answers_community":[],"question_id":11,"choices":{"B":"Spanning tree","D":"VLAN B","C":"ARP inspection","A":"Port mirroring"},"topic":"2","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"Explanation","answer":"Explanation","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/114115-exam-n10-006-topic-2-question-20-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-07-04 23:28:00","question_text":"A technician is setting up a new network and wants to create redundant paths through the network.\nWhich of the following should be implemented to prevent performance degradation?"},{"id":"3dLvLVQChljThqUY6SuA","unix_timestamp":1594474260,"exam_id":355,"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1594474260.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1601385060.0","comment_id":"189682","poster":"AALLII","content":"the question was telling us that the APIPA of the device can not the vlan on the other side of the network because of .1q is not confiqured which is true .","upvote_count":"2"}],"upvote_count":"2","poster":"KLT316","content":"802.1q should NOT be configured on the switch port to which the computer is connected! So answer \"A\" is absolutely opposite of the correct answer and is absolutely incorrect. The problem is that the computer is NOT communicating with the network, that is why it is getting an APIPA address instead of a proper IP address. Answer \"B\" doesn't make sense, Answer \"C\" could be correct, but typically if a NIC is bad it won't even yield an APIPA address, and Answer \"D\" is not relevent to the question. If answer \"A\" stated the opposite, say \"802.1q IS configured on the switch port\" that would be a CORRECT answer, because THAT WOULD be a problem! But that is not what \"A\" says in this case. Probably this is a typo. Correct the typo removing the word \"NOT\", then A is correct. It is being recirculated to all Network+ Q and A's across the internet this wrong way... Don't memorize answers, especially the ones that are wrong!
