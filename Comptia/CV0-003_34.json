Convert the virtual appliance to a template and deploy a new VM using the template.\n\nThe best way to deploy a security virtual appliance in a private cloud environment without making it part of the standard catalog for other users is to import the virtual appliance, configure it according to your needs, and then convert it into a template. Once it's a template, you can easily deploy new instances of the appliance from that template when needed. This method allows for consistency and efficient management of the security appliance.","poster":"Pongsathorn","timestamp":"1694658600.0"},{"poster":"Tomtom11","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"986619","content":"Selected Answer: D\nVM templates are disk images that have at a minimum a preinstalled OS.
