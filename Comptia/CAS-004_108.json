Requiring certificate pinning in the mobile application: Certificate pinning is a security technique used to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) or on-path attacks, which are often the focus in these types of scenarios. When certificate pinning is implemented, the mobile application only trusts specific, predefined certificates for HTTPS communication. This helps prevent an attacker from using a fraudulent or compromised certificate to intercept the communication between the mobile device and the server. It's an effective solution to defend against on-path attacks, such as those where attackers intercept traffic to manipulate or steal data."}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_text":"A mobile gaming company wants to secure the newest version of a game against an on-path attack.

NAC (Network Access Control): NAC is designed to enforce security policies on devices before granting them network access. It can perform posture assessments, ensuring that devices meet specific security criteria (e.g., antivirus installed, OS up to date) before they are allowed onto the network. This aligns with the CIO’s requirement that visitors’ devices undergo a posture assessment before accessing the Wi-Fi.\n\nC.
