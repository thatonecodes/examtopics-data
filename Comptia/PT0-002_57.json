The answer is B. Also from the cert master. Yes client acceptance is them agreeing with you. Attestation is the process of providing evidence that the findings detailed in the PenTest report are true. In other words, by signing off on the report given to the client, you are attesting that you believe the information and conclusions in the report are authentic.\n\nAttestation is perhaps the most significant component of gaining client acceptance, as the client must believe that what you have said about their people, processes, and technology is accurate. Many organizations will not simply trust your word that a particular vulnerability exists, even if you've built yourself a good reputation over the years. You must be prepared to prove what you claim.\nProof can come in many forms, and those forms usually depend on the nature of what is being proven.
