For this reason, the company decides to deploy additional application servers into a commercial cloud provider using the on-premises orchestration engine that installs and configures common software and network configurations.\nThe remote computing environment is connected to the on-premises datacenter via a site-to-site IPSec tunnel. The external DNS provider has been configured to use weighted round-robin routing to load balance connections from the Internet.\nDuring testing, the company discovers that only 20% of connections completed successfully.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS -\nReview the network architecture and supporting documents and fulfill these requirements:\nPart 1:\n✑ Analyze the configuration of the following components: DNS, Firewall 1, Firewall 2, Router 1, Router 2, VPN and Orchestrator Server.\n✑ Identify the problematic device(s).\nPart 2:\n✑ Identify the correct options to provide adequate configuration for hybrid cloud architecture.\nIf at any time you would like to bring back the initial state of the simulation, please click the Reset All button.\nPart 1:\n\nCloud Hybrid Network Diagram -\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\nPart 2:\nOnly select a maximum of TWO options from the multiple choice question\n//IMG//","topic":"1","timestamp":"2021-08-09 21:31:00","isMC":false,"answer":"See explanation below.","exam_id":350,"answer_description":"1.
