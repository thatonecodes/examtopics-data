IoT (Internet of Things). Many IoT devices, especially low-cost or low-power ones, often transmit data without encryption, which can make them vulnerable to interception. This is a common security concern in the IoT ecosystem.\n\nA. SDN (Software-Defined Networking): Typically uses encrypted communication protocols, especially for control planes.\nC. VPN (Virtual Private Network): VPNs are designed to encrypt traffic to protect data transmission.\nD. SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition): While SCADA systems are critical and often operate on specialized protocols, modern implementations are increasingly using encryption to secure communications, although older systems may still have vulnerabilities.\nSo, IoT stands out as the most likely for unencrypted traffic.","poster":"test_arrow","timestamp":"1739244480.0"}],"timestamp":"2025-02-11 04:28:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":368,"question_images":[],"question_text":"In which of the following will unencrypted network traffic most likely be found?","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156344-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-556-discussion/","question_id":506,"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"Ky1z1sN8DVrK1wNDJhRP","answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156329-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-557-discussion/","exam_id":368,"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following is the best reason to perform a tabletop exercise?","unix_timestamp":1739238840,"question_id":507,"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-02-11 02:54:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1739238840.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. To update the IRP (Incident Response Plan)\n\nExplanation:\nA tabletop exercise is a simulation-based activity where team members discuss their roles, responses, and strategies in a hypothetical scenario, often related to security incidents. The main goal is to assess and improve the Incident Response Plan (IRP), ensuring that all stakeholders know their roles and that the plan is up-to-date and effective in handling real-world incidents.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. To address audit findings: While a tabletop exercise may reveal gaps that could be addressed in audits, it is not specifically designed for this purpose.\nB. To collect remediation response times: Tabletop exercises are about discussing and refining processes, not directly measuring remediation times.\nD. To calculate the ROI (Return on Investment): ROI is not a focus of tabletop exercises, which are more concerned with improving preparedness and refining response strategies.","poster":"test_arrow","comment_id":"1354781","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"To address audit findings","B":"To collect remediation response times","C":"To update the IRP","D":"To calculate the ROI"}},{"id":"npsh0YiYDPZMJ0velBRH","timestamp":"2025-02-11 02:54:00","question_images":[],"answer":"D","question_id":508,"unix_timestamp":1739238840,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"To prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities","B":"To identify unused ports and services that should be closed","A":"To determine the cost associated with patching systems","C":"To analyze code for defects that could be exploited"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1739238840.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"test_arrow","comment_id":"1354782","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. To prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities\n\nExplanation:\nCVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) provides a standardized way to assess the severity of vulnerabilities. It assigns a numerical score to vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability, impact, and the potential damage. This score helps organizations prioritize remediation efforts, ensuring that the most critical vulnerabilities are addressed first.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. To determine the cost associated with patching systems: CVSS does not calculate the cost of patching systems, but rather the severity of vulnerabilities.\nB. To identify unused ports and services that should be closed: CVSS is not used for network inventory or identifying unused services. It focuses on scoring vulnerabilities.\nC. To analyze code for defects that could be exploited: CVSS does not analyze code but rather scores the impact of known vulnerabilities in existing software or systems."}],"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following is a use of CVSS?","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/156330-exam-sy0-701-topic-1-question-558-discussion/","exam_id":368},{"id":"nPyJ6N9OuIxMrr2PL58k","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"A":"Independent assessments","D":"Conflict of interest policy","B":"Supply chain analysis","C":"Right-to-audit clause"},"timestamp":"2025-02-11 02:55:00","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","isMC":true,"question_id":509,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1739238900,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Conflict of interest policy\n\nExplanation:\nA conflict of interest policy is in place to ensure that business decisions are made without undue influence from personal relationships or interests. In this case, the company's decision to hire a marketing agency owned by a close relative of the CEO creates a conflict of interest, as it may compromise the impartiality of the decision-making process and raise concerns about favoritism or bias.\n\nBreakdown of the other options:\nA. Independent assessments: This is about ensuring unbiased evaluations, but the issue here is more about the personal relationship rather than an independent assessment of the product.\nB. Supply chain analysis: This relates to evaluating risks and dependencies within the supply chain, which doesn't apply to the situation of hiring the marketing agency.\nC.
