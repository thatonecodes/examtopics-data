Give a written exam on the topic.\n\nOf the options listed, giving a written exam on the topic would be the most effective method for quickly evaluating learner knowledge after an exercise. Written exams allow for a more structured and objective evaluation of learner understanding, as the questions can be carefully crafted to assess specific learning objectives. Additionally, written exams can be graded quickly and efficiently, allowing the instructor to provide prompt feedback to the learners.\n\nOption B of having the learners perform an additional exercise on the topic may not be as effective, as it could potentially take more time and resources to set up and evaluate than a written exam.\n\nOption C of asking the learners random questions about the topic may be useful for assessing the learners' ability to recall specific information, but it may not provide as comprehensive an evaluation of their overall understanding of the topic.\n\nOption D of having the learners engage in a group discussion of the topic may be helpful for encouraging critical thinking and deeper understanding, but it may not provide an objective evaluation of each learner's individual knowledge and understanding.","comment_id":"831360","timestamp":"1725656340.0"}],"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Ask the learners random questions about the topic.","A":"Give a written exam on the topic.","B":"Have the learners perform an additional exercise on the topic","D":"Have the learners engage in a group discussion of the topic."},"unix_timestamp":1678143540,"timestamp":"2023-03-06 23:59:00","question_text":"An instructor wants to quickly evaluate learner knowledge after an exercise.
