This feature can be used to store additional information or metadata associated with a file.

By doing this, the malicious files can evade detection from traditional security tools that only examine the file's main data stream.\n\nIn the scenario described, the intelligence reports suggest that the threat actor is known for using ADS to hide malicious artifacts, so it is likely that the Windows machine compromised by this threat actor may have evidence of the attack hidden in the ADS.
