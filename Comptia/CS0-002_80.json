(plain and simple) you can see whats segmented, is there a firewall in between servers, is there a VPN server and much more.\n\nI know the question also say \"based on an initial assessment\" but this initial assessment may have involved a cursory review, observation, or examination of the company's security practices, systems, or controls and not the network topology","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"983762","poster":"Aliyan","timestamp":"1692284640.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nEven though the network drawings, diagrams, and documentation are not accurate.
