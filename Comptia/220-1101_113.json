When it's not functioning correctly, it can lead to uneven heating and toner distribution, resulting in shadowy areas.\nThe line down the page could also be attributed to a fuser issue, particularly if it's a repeated defect at regular intervals.\nFaded text is another symptom that can be caused by a failing fuser, as it may not be applying enough heat to properly melt and bond the toner to the paper.","timestamp":"1725495240.0"}],"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":339},{"id":"HVd9IaH1dz2aeZejtPpG","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1728955620,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":339,"discussion":[{"poster":"Nate_A","comment_id":"1316878","timestamp":"1732413540.0","content":"C.
