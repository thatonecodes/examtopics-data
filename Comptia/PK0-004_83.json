Crash schedule. A crash schedule involves compressing the schedule for a project as much as possible in order to complete it as quickly as possible. This typically involves adding additional resources or working overtime in order to speed up the project's progress. However, when funding is released under a waved approach, the project may not have access to the necessary resources or funding to implement a crash schedule. This is because the project only receives funding after passing each milestone, so it may not have the resources or funding available to add additional resources or work overtime to speed up the project's progress. Instead, the project may need to proceed at a slower pace, using the resources and funding that are available. This can hinder the project's ability to implement a crash schedule and may impact the project's overall timeline.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1667508600.0","comment_id":"710788","upvote_count":"1","poster":"all4one","content":"A resource sharing is right"}],"poster":"all4one","timestamp":"1666522080.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"C burn rate.","comment_id":"702090"}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Burn rate","D":"Team outsourcing","A":"Resource sharing","B":"Crash schedule"},"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","exam_id":359,"unix_timestamp":1666522080,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/86251-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-685-discussion/"},{"id":"taNhBwyWuJeqcYjw8pP3","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1677113580,"question_text":"Ann, a project manager, witnesses Joe, a team member raise his voice to another team member.

The cost of the changes would be more than planned. If the needs of the future end users are different than the features that are currently being developed, it may be necessary to make significant changes to the project to meet the end users' needs. If the cost of these changes is more than the project's budget, it may not be feasible to continue with the project.
