MOST DNS queries are routed through a local proxy or simply through the gateway (It's not uncommon--and I've set up may times--DNS forwarding through the local gateway. i.e. to your device, it's gateway is its DNS server, which would mean that you're making port 53 calls LOCALLY and the gateway is either calling a local DNS or just going to 8.8.8.8 or whatever because it's not a mobile device and has no restriction). Without MDM on the devices, what's to stop you from installing some telnet software and opening a port home, or hitting up an old school FTP server for a new game?
