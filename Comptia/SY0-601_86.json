Round-robin is a load-balancing algorithm that evenly distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources. With this algorithm, the first request is sent to the first server, the second request is sent to the second server, and so on in a rotating manner. This ensures that each server receives an equal share of the workload.\n\nWeighted response is a load-balancing algorithm that takes into account the response time of each server and directs traffic to the server with the fastest response time.\n\nLeast connection is a load-balancing algorithm that directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.\n\nWeighted least connection is a load-balancing algorithm that combines the weighted response and least connection algorithms to direct traffic to the server with the fewest active connections and the fastest response time","timestamp":"1683037980.0","poster":"mouettespaghetti"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe round-robin algorithm equally distributes connections among a pool of servers, in a circular manner, providing a simple load-balancing solution.

ALL of the questions where the discussion group had split views of what the correct answer was were on my test. So were all of the simulation questions and a couple new ones. I had 6 simulation questions with 76 questions in total. I also recommend memorizing everything on the SYO-601 exam objectives document that CompTIA puts out.

Therefore, the digital forensics team should use a technique to obtain a sample of the malware binary from volatile memory.

By analyzing the data stored in memory, the digital forensics team can locate the malicious code and obtain a sample of the malware binary.\n\nOption A, pcap reassembly, involves reassembling network traffic captured in a pcap file.
