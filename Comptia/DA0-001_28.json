It involves using a program or tool to extract data from the website's HTML code and structure it into a format that can be analyzed. This technique is often used to extract large amounts of data from websites that do not have an API (application programming interface) or other means of accessing the data.\n\nIn the case of an analyst who is required to run a text analysis of data found in articles from a digital news outlet, web scraping would be the best technique to apply to acquire the data. The analyst can use a web scraping tool or program to extract the text data from the news articles and structure it in a way that is suitable for analysis.\n\nThe other options (sampling, data wrangling, and ETL) are not as relevant to the task of acquiring data from a digital news outlet for text analysis. Sampling involves selecting a subset of data for analysis, data wrangling involves cleaning and preparing data for analysis, and ETL (extract, transform, load) refers to a process used to move data between systems.","timestamp":"1704179040.0","comment_id":"763563"}],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","question_text":"An analyst is required to run a text analysis of data that is found in articles from a digital news outlet.

It doesn’t specifically involve quantifying data.\nEnumeration: This refers to the process of counting or listing items. In the context of data, enumeration helps quantify the number of elements in a set or the frequency of certain values. For example, enumerating categories in a data set or counting occurrences of specific values is a way to quantify the data.\nStructure: While structure refers to the organization or arrangement of data, it doesn't directly quantify the data itself. It’s more about how the data is organized for further analysis.\nCoding: This refers to assigning symbols or numbers to represent different data elements, but coding is typically about categorization, not quantification.\nSo, Enumeration is the most direct technique for quantifying data, especially when counting occurrences or categorizing and counting items."}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1738023180,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"EKTXf9jA3rfhYNZebflr","timestamp":"2025-02-08 03:36:00","answer_description":"","answer":"D","question_text":"An employer needs to maintain adequate office staffing during the winter and wants to track storm data.
