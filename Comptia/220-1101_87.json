Installing the latest graphics drivers ensures that the operating system has the necessary software support for the external monitor, potentially resolving any compatibility issues that may have arisen after the upgrade."}],"unix_timestamp":1715562840},{"id":"R3WbPJgvc1YdyBRXj7SJ","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/135678-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-488-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A customer's laptop is making clicking sounds in the area where non-volatile storage is installed. A technician examines the laptop and confirms the issue. Which of the following is the most appropriate replacement part?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe clicking sound coming from the area where non-volatile storage is installed is a common symptom of a failing mechanical hard drive (HDD). This issue typically indicates that the read/write heads or the internal mechanical components of the HDD are malfunctioning. Replacing the faulty HDD with another 7,200rpm HDD, which matches the specifications of the original drive, is the most appropriate solution.","timestamp":"1743349680.0","poster":"Isuckatexams","comment_id":"1413299","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1410228","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI understand that NVMe SSD would be the \"best\" option, but that would be an upgrade and we are jumping to a conclusion that this laptop even has the ability to accept one.

NVMe SSDs offer faster performance and lower latency than other types of SSDs, such as SATA (Serial ATA) or M.2 SATA. If a user reports that a PC occasionally fails to boot and makes clicking sounds in the area where non-volatile storage is installed, it indicates that the hard drive is failing and needs to be replaced with an NVMe SSD"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe question asks for a REPLACEMENT, not an UPGRADE.

NVMe SSD is the most appropriate replacement part.\n\nNVMe SSDs (Non-Volatile Memory Express Solid State Drives) are known for their high performance and reliability. They offer significantly faster read and write speeds compared to traditional HDDs and SATA SSDs, which can help to alleviate the clicking noise and improve overall system performance.\n\nHere's why the other options are less suitable:\n\nA. 7,200rpm HDD: While HDDs are more affordable, they are slower and more prone to mechanical failures, which can lead to clicking noises.\nC. M.2 SATA SSD: While M.2 SSDs are faster than traditional HDDs, they are still limited by the SATA interface. NVMe SSDs offer significantly better performance.\nD. SCSI 15,000rpm HDD: SCSI drives are high-performance drives, but they are more expensive and less common than NVMe SSDs. They are also prone to mechanical failures.\nBy replacing the failing drive with an NVMe SSD, the technician can improve the laptop's performance and reliability.\n\nGG","comment_id":"1316178","poster":"Nate_A","timestamp":"1732254480.0"},{"comment_id":"1314941","timestamp":"1732053000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nClicking sounds are HDD not SSD","poster":"CloudChef","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"carlito101","upvote_count":"1","content":"The replacement part is an HDD, which means A or D.
