It's pretty good.\nOption D (Navigate to the File menu and select FTP from the Export objects option) is not a direct method for viewing the file contents in the packet list pane. It's more related to extracting files from the capture, which might be useful but doesn't directly address the issue of viewing the file transfer in the current context.","timestamp":"1703374920.0"},{"timestamp":"1727764560.0","comment_id":"1291831","poster":"cy_analyst","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn Wireshark, when dealing with FTP sessions, the control commands (such as RETR, STOR, and responses like 226 Transfer complete) are visible with the ftp filter. However, the actual file transfer data is sent over a separate data channel and is not displayed by default with just the ftp filter, as that mainly captures the control messages.\n\nTo access the files transferred during the session, the analyst can go to File → Export Objects → FTP. This feature allows Wireshark to reconstruct and display any files transferred via FTP during the session, including those downloaded using RETR commands."},{"timestamp":"1710887580.0","poster":"m025","comment_id":"1177789","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://adrinanthony.wordpress.com/2019/07/19/how-to-extract-http-and-ftp-files-from-wireshark-pcap-file/"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/119808-exam-cs0-003-topic-1-question-35-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"A security analyst is reviewing a packet capture in Wireshark that contains an FTP session from a potentially compromised machine.
