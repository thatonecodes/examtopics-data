With D, you are allowing both external and internal entities to access the devices.\nVLANs contribute to security because they enable administrators to separate hosts from each other, usually based upon sensitivity. In other words, you can assign sensitive hosts to a VLAN and control which other hosts access them through the VLAN. Since VLANs are logical (and software-based), you can control other aspects of them from a security perspective. You can control what types of traffic can enter or exit the VLAN, and you can restrict access to hosts on that VLAN via a single policy.
