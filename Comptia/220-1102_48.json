Command Prompt.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- Command Prompt: It provides access to various powerful network monitoring tools like netstat and tasklist. These tools can display active network connections, including the originating process for each connection. This allows the administrator to identify processes generating unusual network traffic.\n\nOther options have limitations:\n- Resource Monitor (A): While useful for monitoring resource usage, it doesn't directly show which processes are connecting to the internet.\n- Performance Monitor (B): This tool can capture network-related performance data, but it doesn't provide real-time insights into individual process connections.\n- System Information (D): This tool offers general system information, but it lacks dedicated network traffic monitoring capabilities.","timestamp":"1706811780.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn the Resource Monitor window, select the “Network” tab and then select the “Network Activity” sub-tab to view a graph of the total bytes sent and received on your network.","poster":"Raffaelloo","timestamp":"1702375560.0","comment_id":"1094343","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mehsotopes","timestamp":"1691617380.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nResource monitor would be an efficient way to determine what programs are using the most resources.

The administrator can use Resource Monitor to view which processes on the kiosk machine are connecting to the internet and how much network traffic they are generating. While it is possible to use the Command Prompt to view network activity on a Windows machine, it is not the most user-friendly or intuitive tool for this task. The Command Prompt provides a text-based interface for running commands, and while there are commands that can display network information, such as netstat, the output may not be as easy to read or understand as the graphical display provided by Resource Monitor.","poster":"dcv1337"}],"question_text":"A systems administrator is monitoring an unusual amount of network traffic from a kiosk machine and needs to investigate to determine the source of the traffic.
