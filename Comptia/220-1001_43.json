A good first step in troubleshooting these kinds of issues is to clear the current jobs in the print queue and then try reprinting again. Since the printer is access via a print server, it is unlikely that restarting the user's workstation or updating the print drivers on their workstation will fix the printing issue. Also, a network printer usually uses a CAT 5e network cable, not a USB cable, for connection to the network.\n\nExplanation from Jason Dion's Udemy practice exams","timestamp":"1582827240.0"},{"content":"multiple complaints of the same issue","comment_id":"778165","timestamp":"1673897940.0","poster":"MoWally","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"640016","content":"Answer D","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Elvecchio","timestamp":"1659259140.0"},{"comment_id":"466102","content":"This is a pretty good real world scenario, Print Servers are often notorious with this.
