If you use the lowest ohms (resistance) setting, you can touch the multimeter's black lead to a grounded metal surface and touch the red lead to each wire of the circuit. If you get a meter reading of zero ohms (low resistance), then this indicates that the circuit is properly grounded. If you get a meter reading of infinity, O.L., Open Loop, or a needle that pegs high on the meter, this indicates an open circuit with no path to ground.\n\nFrom Jason Dion's Udemy practice exams","comments":[{"timestamp":"1654855320.0","poster":"nolte_eh","upvote_count":"1","content":"Excellent explanation, thanks!","comment_id":"614463"}],"poster":"betty_boop","timestamp":"1582827780.0","comment_id":"56138","upvote_count":"34"},{"content":"Thanks","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1613080320.0","comment_id":"288548","poster":"ale12"},{"comment_id":"283745","timestamp":"1612477260.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"dare2learn","content":"Thanks!
