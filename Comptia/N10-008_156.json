When a broadcast frame is sent by one device, it is typically received and processed by all devices within the broadcast domain (a LAN segment). Unmanaged switches do not have the capability to control or limit broadcast traffic.\n\nUse Managed Switches: Consider replacing unmanaged switches with managed switches.
