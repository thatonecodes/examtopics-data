Link Analysis"},{"comment_id":"802351","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1691510400.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Link analysis is the BEST type of analysis to conduct if the research analyst wants to determine whether the data being analyzed is connected to other datapoints.\n\nLink analysis is a statistical technique that helps to uncover relationships and connections between different data points. It can be used to identify correlations and dependencies in data, as well as to identify any outliers that might indicate a potential problem or error in the data.\n\nIn link analysis, data points are visualized as nodes in a network and the connections between them are represented as lines. This visualization makes it easier for the analyst to see the relationships between different data points, and to identify any correlations or dependencies. Link analysis is particularly useful when the data being analyzed is complex and the connections between data points are not immediately obvious.\n\nOverall, link analysis is a valuable tool for research analysts who want to better understand the relationships between different data points and uncover connections that might not be immediately apparent.","poster":"ronniehaang"},{"timestamp":"1691151720.0","comment_id":"798024","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
