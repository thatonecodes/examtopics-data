A container is not just a text file. The text file defines the layers of the container.

Some containers can consist of several gigabytes of stuff across several layers. For example a web application may have a base OS (alpine linux is common), then the Apache web server image, then perhaps an NGIX reverse proxy image, and finally the application image.
