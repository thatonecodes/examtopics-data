If it's just the VLAN that is wrong, local users connected to that VLAN will have access, but no one outside that VLAN can reach the server.

A DHCP scope is a range of IP addresses that are available for assignment to devices on the network.\n\nIf the DHCP scope is full, then new devices that try to connect to the network will not be able to get an IP address and other necessary network configuration settings from the DHCP server. In this case, removing old address leases from the active leases pool would free up some IP addresses for new devices to use, allowing them to access the internet.\n\nThe other options (A, C, D, and E) could also cause DHCP-related issues, but they are less likely to be the cause of this specific problem based on the information given.","comment_id":"868711","timestamp":"1728758340.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_text":"Users are able to connect to the wireless network, but they are unable to access the internet.
