RAID 0\nRAID 0, also known as striping, combines multiple disks into a single logical drive. It distributes data across all drives, allowing for parallel read and write operations. This results in significantly improved performance, especially for sequential data transfers.\n\nWhile RAID 0 doesn't provide any redundancy, it's the best choice for maximizing performance and storage utilization in this scenario, where redundancy is not a concern.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the other options are less suitable:\n\nRAID 1: Provides redundancy by mirroring data across multiple disks, but it's less efficient in terms of storage utilization.\nRAID 5: Offers a balance of performance and redundancy, but it sacrifices some storage capacity for parity data.\nRAID 10: Combines mirroring and striping for both performance and redundancy, but it's more complex and expensive than RAID 0.\nFor a video-rendering workstation, maximizing performance is crucial, and RAID 0 is the best option to achieve this goal. However, it's important to have a robust backup strategy in place to protect against data loss.\n\nGG","poster":"Nate_A"},{"content":"In this scenario, where redundancy is not a concern and the focus is on high read/write performance and maximum drive storage utilization, the most suitable RAID configuration is:\n\nA. RAID 0.\n\nRAID 0 (striping) provides improved performance by striping data across multiple drives without redundancy. It offers high read/write speeds because data is split evenly across all drives, maximizing throughput. Additionally, RAID 0 provides maximum storage capacity utilization since there is no parity or mirroring overhead.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1715563200.0","comment_id":"1210543","poster":"Duke_CT"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140446-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-513-discussion/","question_id":461,"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1715563200,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":339},{"id":"X9QUgpy4uV7Nki6ta87k","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/140447-exam-220-1101-topic-1-question-514-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1715563260,"timestamp":"2024-05-13 03:21:00","choices":{"A":"Install all applicable print drivers on the print server.","C":"Give all users temporary administrator rights to install the new printer.","B":"Map the users to a print share for driver installation.","D":"Remotely log in to all usersâ€™ computers and install the printer."},"question_id":462,"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"After a new network printer is installed and added to the print server, users are unable to install the printer.
