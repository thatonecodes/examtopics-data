When a file is setuid, the user executing the file has the same permissions as the owner of the file, regardless of their own permissions. This is often used for programs that need elevated privileges to run properly, such as system administration tools. When a program is executed with setuid, it runs with the same permissions as the owner of the program, which can be a security risk if not used properly.","comments":[{"content":"The answer is A. The permissions -rwSr-xr-x mean that the file is a binary file with read and write permissions for the owner, SetUID bit is set, execute permission for the owner, read and execute permissions for the group, and read and execute permissions for others. The SetUID bit means that the file is executed with the effective rights of the owner, rather than the user who executes the file. So, when the file is executed as a command, it will be executed with the effective rights of the owner.","comment_id":"806577","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676220480.0","poster":"linux_admin"}]}],"question_text":"What do the permissions -rwSr-xr-x mean for a binary file when it is executed as a command?","choices":{"B":"The command will be executed with the effective rights of the group instead of the owner.","D":"The command will be executed with the effective rights of the owner and group.","A":"The command is SetUID and it will be executed with the effective rights of the owner.","C":"The execute flag is not set for the owner.
