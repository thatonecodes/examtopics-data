Symmetric encryption because it is the most resource-efficient cryptographic method, using a single shared key for both encryption and decryption, which requires less processing power and is faster. While Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) (answer D) is more efficient than traditional asymmetric methods like RSA, it still involves asymmetric encryption, which is generally more computationally intensive than symmetric encryption.
