B The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a protocol used to exchange routing information across autonomous systems on the internet. The question describes a situation where traffic is being redirected through an unexpected route, which could be a sign of a BGP hijacking attack.\n\nOption B, \"Implement a BGP route reflector\", is the best solution. A BGP route reflector helps to control the propagation of routes in a network. It allows a router to advertise (or \"reflect\") BGP routes to other routers in the same autonomous system.

Implementing a BGP route reflector would be the best option to secure the routes while allowing the network to function in the event of a single provider failure. A route reflector is a BGP routing protocol component that helps distribute routing information within a single autonomous system (AS). It receives routing information from other routers in the AS and propagates it to other routers in the AS. By using a route reflector, the network engineer can ensure that routes are distributed evenly and redundantly across multiple ISP links while maintaining control over which routes are used. Additionally, it simplifies the configuration of BGP by eliminating the need for a full mesh of BGP peerings between all routers."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B.

The best solutions for this issue are: B. Increase the history to 20. Password history refers to how many previous passwords a user is prevented from reusing. By increasing the history requirement to 20, employees will not be able to reuse any of their last 20 passwords, including those that were compromised. This will make it much harder for employees to simply reuse old passwords and ensure they choose unique ones each time.\nE. Decrease the maximum age to 30 days. Password expiration forces employees to change their passwords regularly, and setting the maximum age to 30 days ensures that passwords are updated frequently. This reduces the risk of compromised passwords lingering in the system for too long. A shorter password expiration cycle, like 30 days, also encourages employees to adopt better security habits and creates more opportunities to ensure passwords are not reused from previous cycles.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1734380340.0"},{"timestamp":"1721482800.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nAB make sense, first 2 days between password changes and 20 passwords remembered takes over 40 days to get to a point where you are using your original password.
