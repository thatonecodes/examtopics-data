You can also use the set command to change the values of positional parameters, such as $1, $2, etc., which represent the command-line arguments passed to the shell.\n\nNote that the effects of the set command are only temporary and apply to the current shell session. If you want to make permanent changes to the settings and options of Bash, you will need to modify the shell configuration files (such as ~/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc) that are loaded when the shell starts up.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"806433","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1676212560.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98943-exam-lx0-103-topic-3-question-29-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-02-12 15:36:00","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"2Jro57EuRk7Uk6OWwnil","exam_id":353,"question_id":48,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2023-02-12 02:28:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98860-exam-lx0-103-topic-3-question-3-discussion/","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1676165280,"topic":"3","question_text":"What command will generate a list of user names from /etc/passwd along with their login shell?","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"content":"The correct command is \"cut -d: -f1,7 /etc/passwd\".","poster":"linux_admin","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"805842","timestamp":"1676165280.0"}],"choices":{"A":"column -s : 1,7 /etc/passwd","D":"cut -d: -f1,7 /etc/passwd","B":"chop -c 1,7 /etc/passwd","C":"colrm 1,7 /etc/passwd"},"answer":"D","isMC":true},{"id":"n433S4GWbi1OzuJiq23R","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1676212740.0","content":"Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command does:\n\nsed is a command-line utility used for text processing and manipulation.\n's/bob/Bob/g' is a command that tells sed to substitute (or replace) all occurrences of the string \"bob\" in the input with the string \"Bob\".
