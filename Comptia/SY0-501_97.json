The order is maintained from highly volatile to less volatile data. Highly volatile data resides in the memory, cache, or CPU registers, and it will be lost as soon as the power to the computer is turned off. Less volatile data cannot be lost easily and is relatively permanent because it may be stored on disk drives or other permanent storage media, such as floppy discs and CD-ROM discs. The crime scene technicians should collect evidence beginning with the most volatile and then moving towards a least volatile. The following order of volatility is reliable because it was taken from the standard document RFC 3227—Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving.\n\nCache, registers\nARP cache, routing table, memory, kernel statistics, process table\nTemporary files\nDisk\nMonitoring data and remote logging pertaining to the computer in question\nPhysical configurations, network topology\nArchival media","poster":"blacksheep6r","comment_id":"347760","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1619962740.0"}],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1619962740,"exam_id":366,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"When performing data acquisition on a workstation, which of the following should be captured based on memory volatility?
