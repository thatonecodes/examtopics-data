There’s no single guide to change management, though most organizations follow common-sense guidelines. Here’s an outline of the best practices CompTIA recommends:\n•   Consult documented business processes.\n•   Determine the purpose of the change.\n•   Analyze the scope of the change.\n•   Analyze risk involved in making (or not making) the change.\n•   Plan for the change.\n•   Educate end users about the need, benefit, and cost of the change.\n•   Create a dedicated team to manage the change.\n•   Have a backout plan in place in case the change creates negative consequences.\n•   Document everything thoroughly.","comment_id":"595357","poster":"iLikeBeagButt"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1617624720.0","content":"Backout Plan\nThere must a backout plan that defines the steps needed to return the infrastructure\nto its pre-change environment...
