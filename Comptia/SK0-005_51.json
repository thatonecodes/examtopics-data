RAID 6.\n\nRAID 6 offers the highest level of redundancy among the options listed. In RAID 6, data is striped across all disks in the array, similar to RAID 5. However, in addition to striping, RAID 6 also includes two sets of parity data distributed across all disks. This means that RAID 6 can tolerate the failure of up to two disks in the array without losing data, providing an extra level of protection compared to RAID 5.","timestamp":"1713405960.0","comment_id":"1196881"}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","exam_id":365,"answer":"B","question_id":255,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/138922-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-371-discussion/","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1713310080}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"name":"SK0-005","provider":"Comptia","numberOfQuestions":349,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"id":365},"currentPage":51},"__N_SSP":true}
