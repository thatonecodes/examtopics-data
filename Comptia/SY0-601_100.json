The process typically involves using vulnerability scanning tools to identify and assess potential security weaknesses in the network, systems, and applications. The scan may include checks for known security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, outdated software versions, and other potential issues that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nBy performing regular vulnerability scanning, the systems administrator can proactively identify and address security risks, allowing them to take appropriate measures to patch or mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Scanning is an essential part of a proactive security posture and helps ensure that the organization's systems and data remain secure and protected from potential threats.","comment_id":"965179","upvote_count":"5","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","timestamp":"1690502700.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nDon't overthink it.","comment_id":"1094129","timestamp":"1702357620.0","poster":"Oatsers","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":367,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":498,"timestamp":"2023-07-28 02:05:00","question_text":"A systems administrator set up an automated process that checks for vulnerabilities across the entire environment every morning.
