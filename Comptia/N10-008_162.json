IPSec itself can use different protocols to achieve these goals.\n\nESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), which is part of the IPSec suite, is specifically designed to provide data confidentiality through encryption as well as authentication and integrity. ESP encrypts the payload of the packet and can also include authentication of the entire packet (except for the IP header in transport mode).\n\nAH (Authentication Header), another protocol in the IPSec suite, provides authentication and integrity but does not provide encryption (data confidentiality). It only authenticates the packet and ensures it hasn't been tampered with, but it doesn't encrypt the data.\n\nThus, ESP is the best choice for a protocol that allows both data confidentiality and authentication when establishing a site-to-site VPN tunnel.\""},{"comment_id":"1246451","content":"ESP stands for **Encapsulating Security Payload**. It is a component of the IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) suite used to provide confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication of IP packets.

It can operate in two modes: transport mode, which only encrypts the payload, and tunnel mode, which encrypts the entire IP packet.\nC","poster":"441fa70","timestamp":"1720754880.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"bagoguy","comment_id":"1210050","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nESP is the likely answer.

This provides high redundancy and reliability because there are multiple paths for data to travel between devices. If one connection fails, data can still be routed through other paths.\n\nIn a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable, known as the bus, and data is transmitted along this shared medium. A ring topology features devices connected in a circular fashion, with each device linking to two others to form a ring where data circulates until it reaches its destination. In a star topology, devices are connected to a central hub or switch, and all data passes through this central node, with no direct connections between devices themselves.","comment_id":"1281033","timestamp":"1725895380.0"}],"exam_id":357,"question_id":807,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following is the physical topology in which all devices are connected to each other?","choices":{"C":"Mesh","A":"Bus","B":"Ring","D":"Star"},"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/142466-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-825-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1718282160,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-06-13 14:36:00"},{"id":"n4JZJaKrvzRppyF3cfwl","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following most likely occurs when an attacker is between the target and a legitimate server?","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/139830-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-826-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1714518600,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"tempovpn","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1204749","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt was on my exam (April 25th, 2024).\nOn-path attackers place themselves between two devices (usually a client and a server) and intercept or modify communications between the two.","timestamp":"1714518600.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAn on-path attack (previously known as a man-in-the-middle attack) occurs when an attacker intercepts and potentially alters the communication between a client and a server. This attacker can eavesdrop, capture sensitive information, or inject malicious data into the communication stream.\n\nIP spoofing involves an attacker falsifying the source IP address of packets to appear as if they are coming from a trusted source, but it does not specifically indicate the attacker is between the target and server. VLAN hopping refers to an attack where an attacker sends traffic to VLANs they are not supposed to access by exploiting VLAN tagging, which is not related to intercepting or altering communication between a client and server. Rogue DHCP involves setting up a fake DHCP server to assign incorrect IP addresses or network configurations, leading to issues like network misdirection or denial of service, but it does not necessarily involve intercepting communication between a client and server directly.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1281034","timestamp":"1725895500.0","poster":"a87d6a4"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":808,"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2024-05-01 01:10:00","exam_id":357,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"VLAN hopping","C":"Rogue DHCP","A":"IP spoofing","D":"On-path attack"}},{"id":"J1wsOYAmUeTztiJjfnGF","unix_timestamp":1714518420,"question_id":809,"isMC":true,"exam_id":357,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-05-01 01:07:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"New SFPs","C":"Cable tester","B":"OTDR","A":"Loopback adapter"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/139828-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-827-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"tempovpn","timestamp":"1714518420.0","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"1204746","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt was on my exam (April 25th, 2024).\nAn 'Optical Time Domain Reflectometer' (OTDR) is a fiber optic testing device used for identifying fiber break points, measuring cable lengths, and calculating relative optical power losses."},{"poster":"a87d6a4","timestamp":"1725895560.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAn OTDR is a specialized tool used to test the integrity of fiber optic cables.
