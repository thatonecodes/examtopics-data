Working with procurement and creating a requirements document to select a new IAM system/vendor. The auditor has flagged the current system as insecure and not consistent with best practices, which suggests that the underlying issue is the architecture and implementation of the homegrown identity management system. Rather than trying to patch or retrofit the current system, selecting a new, secure IAM system/vendor that follows best practices is likely the most effective first step. By procuring a more secure and scalable solution, the university can address long-term security needs and minimize risk, particularly given the potential exposure of sensitive data and systems. While investigating potential threats is essential for ongoing security, this action does not directly address the systemic issue highlighted by the auditor. The problem appears to be more related to overall design and security best practices, rather than an immediate incident or identified attack.

Utilize code signing by a trusted third party: Code signing is a process that allows a developer to digitally sign their code with a certificate. This certificate is issued by a trusted third party and confirms that the code has not been tampered with or modified since it was signed. When users run the program, their computer will check the code signature to ensure that it has not been modified, providing a strong assurance of code integrity.\n\nC. Verify MD5 hashes: A hash function is a mathematical function that takes input data and produces a fixed-size output called a hash value. MD5 is a commonly used hash function that can be used to verify the integrity of a file. By generating an MD5 hash value for each module of the program, the developer can verify that the module has not been modified. If the hash value changes, it indicates that the module has been tampered with."},{"poster":"Ariel235788","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nGuys, q68: A developer wants to maintain integrity to each module of a program and ensure the *code cannot be altered by malicious users*.
