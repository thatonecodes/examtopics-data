Port 22 (SSH) is typically associated with Unix-based systems, not Windows, and may not be the port of concern for manual logins in this case. My previous responses were based on the assumption of Unix-based systems.\n\nIn a Windows environment, manual logins and remote access are commonly achieved through protocols like RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) on port 3389. Given the situation with a Windows Server in the DMZ, it is more appropriate to focus on securing access via the RDP protocol and associated port.

Here's more information on why option D is the correct choice:\n\n1. Malware Distribution: The question mentions that the malware is distributed by manually logging on to servers and running the malicious code. This indicates that the attackers are gaining access to the server through a legitimate remote access method like RDP.\n2. Port 3389: RDP uses port 3389 by default to establish remote connections to Windows servers. By blocking inbound traffic on port 3389 from untrusted networks, you effectively limit the exposure of the server to potential attackers trying to use RDP as a means to gain unauthorized access.\n3. Mitigating Unauthorized Access: By blocking inbound RDP traffic from untrusted networks, you are preventing potential attackers from attempting to brute-force or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the server.","comments":[{"poster":"Protract8593","content":"4. Defense-in-Depth Strategy: Implementing network-level controls like blocking port 3389 is part of a defense-in-depth strategy, which involves using multiple layers of security measures to protect systems and data. In this case, it complements other security controls and helps mitigate risks associated with unauthorized remote access.\n5. Least Privilege: Limiting access to RDP only from trusted networks or specific IP ranges aligns with the principle of least privilege, which reduces the attack surface and potential impact of security incidents.\n\nIn conclusion, blocking inbound traffic on port 3389 from untrusted networks is a recommended security practice to prevent unauthorized access to RDP services and help protect against potential malware infections that rely on manual logins to servers.","comment_id":"961051","timestamp":"1690166040.0","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"938503","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDisabling file sharing over port 445 helps to prevent the malware from being manually copied and executed on the server.
