A reservation for the server based on the MAC address.\n\nAssigning a DHCP reservation for the server based on its MAC address ensures that the file server will consistently receive the same IP address every time it connects to the network.

A static IP address within the DHCP IP range\n\nHere's why the other options are not ideal:\n\n A. A separate scope for the file server using a /32 subnet: While technically possible, using a /32 subnet for a single device is inefficient and unnecessary. It also wouldn't guarantee the server receives a static IP.\n B. A reservation for the server based on the MAC address: A DHCP reservation is a good option, but it's not the most optimal. A static IP provides more control and avoids reliance on DHCP functionality for the critical file server.\n D. SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration): SLAAC is an automatic configuration method for IPv6 networks. It's not suitable for this scenario where the administrator specifically needs a static IP for the file server.\n\nTherefore, a static IP address within the existing DHCP IP range offers the most control and predictability for the file server while still allowing DHCP to function for other devices on the network","poster":"Cocopqr","comments":[{"timestamp":"1728489900.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"If you put a static IP within the scope without reserving it or excluding it, it will be assigned to something else and you'll get a conflict.\nAnyone answering C needs to seriously study DHCP","poster":"ETQ","comment_id":"1295213"},{"content":"A static IP would require an exclusion on the DHCP server, might as well kill 2 birds with 1 stone and setup a reservation","timestamp":"1714728060.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1206013","poster":"kinny4000"}],"upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1699316340,"timestamp":"2023-11-07 01:19:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/125539-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-669-discussion/"},{"id":"euPnkKy3Ep27Rrya4Utb","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","question_id":634,"question_text":"A fiber link connecting two campus networks is broken.
