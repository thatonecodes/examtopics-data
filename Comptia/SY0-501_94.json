These scans are typically more comprehensive than non-authenticated scans. They are able to identify poor configurations, insecure registry entries and malicious code and plug-ins.\n\nNon-authenticated scans do not use any login credentials. This is because they are solely a surface-level scan.

Passive scanning may be conducted by a network administrator scanning for security vulnerabilities or by an intruder as a preliminary to an active attack.\nFor an intruder, passive scanning's main advantage is that it does not leave a trail that could alert users or administrators to their activities. For an administrator, the main advantage is that it doesn't risk causing undesired behavior on the target computer, such as freezes. Because of these advantages, passive scanning need not be limited to a narrow time frame to minimize risk or disruption, which means that it is likely to return more information.\nPassive scanning does have limitations. It is not as complete in detail as active vulnerability scanning and cannot detect any applications that are not currently sending out traffic; nor can it distinguish false information put out for obfuscation.","question_id":469,"isMC":true,"exam_id":366,"discussion":[{"content":"the answer is B.","comment_id":"58137","timestamp":"1583237340.0","poster":"bigwilly69","upvote_count":"5","comments":[{"poster":"bigwilly69","comment_id":"58138","timestamp":"1583237400.0","upvote_count":"9","content":"My name is cHRIS McCafferty from slane ireland"}]}]},{"id":"hmlgkSJickBO6OPcQ6nI","question_id":470,"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"question_text":"Two users must encrypt and transmit large amounts of data between them.\nWhich of the following should they use to encrypt and transmit the data?","unix_timestamp":1567522020,"answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/4639-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-478-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Symmetric algorithm","B":"Hash function","C":"Digital signature","D":"Obfuscation"},"timestamp":"2019-09-03 16:47:00","exam_id":366,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"comments":[{"content":"Mike Meyers' CompTIA Security+ Cert Guide 3ed 2021:\n\n\"Asymmetric key cryptography has several advantages over symmetric\nkey cryptography, the major one being key exchange.
