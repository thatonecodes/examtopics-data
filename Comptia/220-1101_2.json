The HDD has no free space.\n\nOne of the possible reasons for the sluggish performance of the PC could be a lack of free space on the hard disk drive (HDD). When the hard disk is filled to capacity, the operating system and applications are forced to compete for limited space, slowing down performance. The constant light on the HDD and slow input/output performance are signs that the disk is running close to its maximum capacity. The failed updates may also be a result of a lack of disk space as Windows updates require a certain amount of free space to be installed.","timestamp":"1692031440.0","comment_id":"808694"},{"comment_id":"1209095","timestamp":"1731201540.0","poster":"MikeNY","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIf HDD was failing then there should be grinding or ticking sounds.

You'll also have to upgrade your power supply if it doesn't. \nAlso it says ADDING RAM, more RAM more power is being drawn. I am going D and F dor this one as optical drives dont draw as much power as everything else. \nPlus I wouldn't consider upgrading a computer with adding an optical drive, yeah it is a bit subjective but I don't have an optical drive on my PC and don't plan on \"upgrading\" it with adding one.","poster":"ajjrp18","comment_id":"719267"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"RSMCT2011","comments":[{"content":"F is always true, graphics cards are always the biggest power consuming component in the whole computer.","timestamp":"1695641760.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mango7","comment_id":"1016750"}],"comment_id":"713476","timestamp":"1667882220.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nAdding Optical Drive and adding memory most likely add power consumption.
