One of the first steps in this process is typically to develop a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, more manageable components.\n\nThe WBS provides a framework for organizing the project work, and it can help the team to identify the major deliverables and activities that will be required to complete the project. It is often used as a basis for developing the project schedule, budget, and other project management plans.\n\nTherefore, the most likely output from the first planning workshop would be the WBS. The other options, such as the Gantt chart, RACI, and risk register, are all important project management tools that will be developed later in the planning process, once the WBS and other key project plans are in place.","timestamp":"1677184920.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"768697","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA work breakdown structure (WBS) is most likely to be produced during the first planning workshop","poster":"kmanb","timestamp":"1673106420.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhy it's not WBS?","poster":"MJVIS","comment_id":"744555","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1670975040.0"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"gU8Hvk2FsHCLB8YZPOY0","answers_community":["AE (100%)"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1662993360,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"667103","poster":"Sutokuto","timestamp":"1662993360.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nAE is correct","upvote_count":"6"},{"upvote_count":"5","poster":"Chambone","timestamp":"1664672640.0","content":"I vote AE","comment_id":"684546"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"brvndvnwolf","timestamp":"1669152240.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nAE are the correct choices","comment_id":"724698"}],"answer_description":"","question_id":442,"answer":"AE","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/81825-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-732-discussion/","question_text":"A project manager is determining the strategy and response for each risk.\n//IMG//\n\nWhich of the following would BEST allow the project manager to complete the register?

This will allow the project manager to assess the likelihood and impact of the risk and develop a risk response plan if necessary. Once the risk has been added to the risk register, the project manager may then communicate the concern with the project sponsor, identify replacement resources, and review and update the project schedule as needed.","poster":"MJVIS"},{"poster":"kmanb","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1673112780.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe best next step for the project manager to take is to communicate the concern with the project sponsor. The project sponsor is responsible for providing the necessary resources and support for the project and should be informed about any potential changes to the project that may impact staffing. The project manager should explain the situation to the project sponsor and discuss the potential impact on the project. Together, they can determine the best course of action and make any necessary adjustments to the project plan. Other steps, such as identifying replacement resources, reviewing and updating the project schedule, and adding the risk to the risk register, may also be necessary, but communicating with the project sponsor should be the first step.","comment_id":"768780"}],"timestamp":"2023-01-07 18:33:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/94325-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-734-discussion/","exam_id":359,"question_images":[],"question_id":444},{"id":"MCXwrdCCDuydd2HOPufg","question_id":445,"discussion":[{"poster":"kmanb","comment_id":"768714","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nanswer is B to me","timestamp":"1673108220.0"},{"comment_id":"759121","poster":"MJVIS","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhy it's not B: Evaluate the impact of switching tasks on the schedule.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1672180200.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1672180200,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/93024-exam-pk0-004-topic-1-question-735-discussion/","topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-12-27 23:30:00","choices":{"C":"Consult with the CCB about the request.","A":"Negotiate with the vendor to complete the change earlier.","D":"Confront the stakeholder about the unrealistic request.","B":"Evaluate the impact of switching tasks on the schedule."},"answer":"B","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":359,"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_text":"After a change request is approved, a vendor shares the estimated delivery date with project management.
