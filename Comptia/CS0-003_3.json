MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is known to be vulnerable to collisions, meaning attackers can create different files that result in the same MD5 hash. This can lead to security risks, as the system may wrongly accept a malicious file if it has the same hash as a legitimate one.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, replacing the MD5 hash algorithm with a stronger hash function, like SHA-256 (part of the SHA-2 family), is an effective solution.
