These IoCs can then be used to detect if similar attacks or malware variants are present within the organization’s environment. By detonating the malware in a sandbox environment, security teams can capture all relevant IoCs associated with the malware, allowing them to detect whether the same attack or variant might be targeting their organization. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Sandbox detonation.","poster":"Bright07","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1331246","timestamp":"1735078560.0"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"B","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Antivirus","A":"Simulators","D":"Endpoint detection and response","B":"Sandbox detonation"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1735078560,"question_id":516},{"id":"thJo1LDUzTTX3Yfl7ULT","timestamp":"2024-12-24 23:21:00","unix_timestamp":1735078860,"question_id":517,"choices":{"D":"Private browsing mode","A":"DoH","B":"EAP-TLS","C":"Geofencing"},"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following is the best way to protect the website browsing history for an executive who travels to foreign countries where internet usage is closely monitored?","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":343,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","discussion":[{"poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1331248","timestamp":"1735078860.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a privacy-enhancing technology that encrypts DNS requests, preventing third parties (like ISPs or government authorities) from monitoring or logging the websites the executive is visiting. Normally, DNS queries are sent unencrypted, making it easy for anyone with access to the network (such as ISPs, government authorities, or malicious actors) to monitor what websites are being accessed. DoH solves this problem by sending DNS queries over HTTPS, encrypting them and making it more difficult to intercept or monitor the browsing history. In countries where internet usage is closely monitored, DoH provides a way to ensure that DNS queries (which reveal website URLs) are encrypted and hidden from surveillance. This makes it more difficult for attackers or monitoring agencies to track the websites being visited.","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153405-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-564-discussion/"},{"id":"mO29dAKRqad8vPsDRjlq","answer_images":[],"exam_id":343,"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Tabletop exercise","B":"Walk-through review","D":"Business impact analysis","C":"Lessons learned"},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

It also provides a feedback loop that helps to verify the effectiveness of the patching process and gives the administrator a clear view of the system's security posture.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Bright07","timestamp":"1735079220.0","comment_id":"1331250"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","exam_id":343,"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/153406-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-566-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-12-24 23:27:00","question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"D","choices":{"B":"Planning and conducting an annual security review","D":"Implementing a scan-patch-scan methodology","C":"Continuously monitoring system audit logs","A":"Instituting a rigorous change control process"},"unix_timestamp":1735079220},{"id":"78kCCB38XegAeQ0h4eTH","timestamp":"2024-12-24 23:34:00","answer_description":"","exam_id":343,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1735079640,"choices":{"A":"Deactivation of unused interfaces","B":"Configuration of anti-malware scanning for USB devices","D":"Activation of out-of-band maintenance interfaces","C":"Usage of 802.1x to limit network access to only authorized systems"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1735079640.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\n802.1X is a network access control protocol that provides port-based authentication to devices attempting to connect to a network. When applied, it ensures that only authorized devices or systems can connect to the network. This solution helps protect against unauthorized access and can be used to ensure that only legitimate systems are allowed to communicate over the network. For an environment where maintenance operations are performed by a data center operator, this is critical because it prevents malicious insiders (such as maintenance personnel) from gaining unauthorized access to the network during their tasks, reducing the risk of data exfiltration. By configuring 802.1X, you ensure that even if an attacker gains physical access to the infrastructure or is able to connect a device to the network during maintenance, they cannot access sensitive systems without proper authentication. It helps ensure that the network is accessible only by authorized systems with valid credentials.","comment_id":"1331252","poster":"Bright07","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_id":520,"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"A systems engineer is designing the infrastructure for an enterprise client with colocation services from a data center operator.
