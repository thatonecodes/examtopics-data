A forensics NDA is a non-disclosure agreement that is used to protect sensitive information during a digital forensics investigation.

It is important to include the order of volatility in the documentation, which is the sequence in which evidence is collected based on its volatility, starting from the most volatile to the least volatile, to ensure that volatile evidence is not lost. The provenance of the artifacts is also critical to include, as it tracks the origin, custody, and ownership of the evidence, which is essential in establishing its authenticity and admissibility in court. Other possible elements to include in the chain-of-custody form might include the date and time of collection, any relevant warning banners or disclaimers, and a forensics non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the evidence.

An evil twin access point is being utilized.\n\nIt's most likely that an attacker is forcing the user off the legitimate access point, and then getting them to reconnect to the attacker's Evil Twin access point.\n\nIt's unlikely that an attack is simply doing this only for the purposes of DoS-ing the user, and no other reason. The more specific reason would be to get them to join the Evil Twin access point, and then to capture sensitive data once they connect to the Evil Twin. \n\nA common scenario for an Evil Twin attack occurs in public places with free WiFi. In such places, users typically aren't verifying network authenticity, making it easy for attackers to trick them.\n\nAn Evil Twin is a deceptive WiFi access point (AP) that mirrors a legitimate one.
