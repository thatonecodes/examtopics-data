This is a strong indication that a malicious actor or malware was responsible for the creation and execution of these scripts, possibly as a means of gathering information or establishing persistence on the compromised system.

The successful execution of a script called \"amazing-3rdparty-domain-assessment.py\" and the failed execution of other scripts may indicate that the attacker was using a variety of tools to achieve their objectives, rather than relying solely on privilege escalation.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the most likely attack that was conducted on the environment is the use of a malicious script.","comment_id":"833280","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1678301160.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nBased on the provided information, it is more likely a Privilege Escalation attack rather than a Malicious Script attack. The reason being, the suspicious event logs show that a user account named \"scheduledtasks\" was able to successfully authenticate on AD at an abnormal time, which indicates that the user account had sufficient privileges to perform the authentication. The account was then able to execute a script related to 3rd party domain assessment, which suggests that the account had elevated privileges on the system. In a Privilege Escalation attack, an attacker gains access to a low-level user account and attempts to elevate their privileges to gain access to more sensitive data or resources. Attackers can abuse scheduled tasks by creating malicious tasks to execute code, such as backdoors or malware, with system-level privileges. By gaining access to a privileged scheduled task, attackers can bypass security controls and execute arbitrary code.","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"After more research, I think its malicious script","comment_id":"841134","comments":[{"content":"I love how you corrected yourself. thank you","comment_id":"846317","timestamp":"1679430480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"gladtam"}],"timestamp":"1678981800.0","poster":"Nishkurup"}],"timestamp":"1677859140.0","poster":"Nishkurup","comment_id":"828111"},{"comment_id":"796810","poster":"scarceanimal","timestamp":"1675407360.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\n\"amazing-3rdparty-domain-assessment.py\" lol they put amazing hilarious","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1675149780.0","comment_id":"793763","poster":"hsdj","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"793764","poster":"hsdj","upvote_count":"1","content":"option \"malicious script\" is not TYPE of attack! so my answer is privilege escalation B","comments":[{"content":"While the changed passwords potentially could be privilege escalation, there is definitely malicious scripts occurring that were recorded in the SIEM logs. \n\nObjective 6.1 covers \"Malicious code or script execution\", including python (.py), bash (.sh), powershell (.ps1), visual basic (.vba), and macro scripts. \n\nBecause the prompt has clear malicious scripts that were blocked by the security software, and the lack of proof of privilege escalation, I'm more inclined to select A as the correct answer.
