Site mirroring refers to the process of keeping the backup site updated so it is ready to assume the workload in the event of a primary data center failure. Site mirroring provides an identical copy of the original site’s data and applications operating in standby at a remote site. By implementing a mirroring strategy, you can be better prepared to survive an outage event with little or no impact on your operations"},{"comment_id":"337213","upvote_count":"3","poster":"xparta300","timestamp":"1618602300.0","content":"Going with C. \n\nIs closes to a hot site definition without the details.

While active/active and site mirroring are good answers, it's difficult to understand what the exact problem is. The questions says \"A company is interested in DRP\"... Site mirroring typically is copying the site to a different geographical area. DR is such a broad term because it can mean fixing a server in your cluster on location or it can mean moving the entire IT operations to a hot site location. So the question is absolutely terrible as it gives zero specifics about what incident they are concerned about. In my opinion, if it involves moving to another site then site mirroring is the answer but if it's an issue located inside the on-site data center, then active/active can be the correct answer.
