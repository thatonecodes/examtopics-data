By enriching security event data with intelligence, security analysts can better understand the context of threats and prioritize their response accordingly.

Security engineering focuses on the design and\narchitecture of hardware, software, and network platforms to reduce their attack\nsurface. Strategic threat intelligence is important for establishing an up-to-date model\nof threat sources and actors, and their motivations, capabilities, and tactics. This model\ncan be used as part of a risk management framework and security engineering to\nselect and deploy new technical and administrative security controls, or to improve the\nconfiguration of existing controls. Threat intelligence should be shared with network\nand application operational security teams so that they can apply best practices to the\ncontrols that they have responsibility for. For example, threat intelligence can provide\ninformation about new vectors for attacking application code. It is important for this\ninformation to be shared with software development teams so that they can adopt\nsuitable secure coding practices in response."}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1695653160},{"id":"8WWC6trI54sqW5gJj7uJ","unix_timestamp":1695369780,"question_id":355,"question_text":"A manager asks a security analyst to provide the web-browsing history of an employee.
