The technique described—transferring all on-premises data and virtual machines to an appliance and then shipping it to a cloud provider—is characteristic of a Lift and Shift approach, as it involves moving existing environments to the cloud without redesigning or rearchitecting them.","comment_id":"1268115","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SophyQueenCR82"},{"timestamp":"1718678400.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nLift and shift since it is not being restructured.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"BlueMan93","comment_id":"1232191"},{"comment_id":"1205191","timestamp":"1714587540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"e1c0c38","content":"Lift and shift is the correct answer here.\nLift and shift migration involves moving applications and data from an on-premises environment directly to the cloud without making changes to the applications themselves.

Firewalls are designed to restrict connectivity to cloud resources by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules. These rules can be customized to only allow traffic from specific IP addresses, ports, or protocols, effectively limiting access to the resources behind the firewall. By properly configuring a firewall, you can secure your cloud resources from unauthorized access.\n\nSource: https://examlab.co/comptia/cloud-essentials-clo-002","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA should be the answer.
