Break in the fiber\n\nCRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) errors in a Storage Area Network (SAN) switch are often indicative of physical layer issues, such as a break in the fiber optic cable. CRC errors occur when there is a mismatch or corruption in the data during transmission. In the context of a SAN switch, issues with the fiber optic cable, connectors, or transceivers can lead to CRC errors.\n\nWhile other issues like a bad switch port or mismatched duplex could potentially cause network errors, CRC errors specifically point to problems with the integrity of the data being transmitted, which is commonly associated with physical layer issues like a break in the fiber.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the CRC errors in this scenario is A.
