This means any files changed after that will be copied by backups between that full copy and the next one.\n\nIn contrast, a differential backup copies those files that have changed since the full backup. However, it does not reset the archive bit, meaning it will copy them again the next day. An incremental backup copies changed files and resets the archive bit so that it does not copy the file unless it changes again.\n\nReference: https://www.computerweekly.com/news/1347703/Incremental-vs-differential-backup-A-comparison#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20a%20differential%20backup,file%20unless%20it%20changes%20again.","comment_id":"306095"},{"timestamp":"1606323600.0","poster":"Alizadeh","upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer: C","comment_id":"227718"}],"question_text":"An administrator needs to make a file-level backup of a VM before deploying monthly updates.
