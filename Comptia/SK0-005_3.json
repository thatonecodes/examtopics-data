A DRP is an essential part of a business continuity plan (BCP). It is applied to the aspects of an organization that depend on a functioning information technology (IT) infrastructure.

The answer is C\n\nLets use an example. The company has a datacenter. You have a major power outage that last for days. Much longer then UPS are designed to support. At that point of the power outage is when you would be looking at your DRP. DRPs should lay out different scenarios depending on the extent of the outage or disaster and what you should be doing DURING a disaster. \n\nThe question is, what document would you refer to AFTER a unplanned outage. So the outage or disaster is over. At this point you need to look at what damage has the company suffered because of this outage.

Use an MFA out-of-band solution.\n\nThe most secure method to access servers located in remote branch offices is to use an MFA (multi-factor authentication) out-of-band solution. MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond the traditional username and password by requiring an additional form of authentication, such as a fingerprint or a one-time code sent to a mobile device. An out-of-band solution means that the second factor is sent through a separate channel or device, further reducing the risk of compromise.\n\nTelnet connections are not secure because they transmit data in clear text, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.
