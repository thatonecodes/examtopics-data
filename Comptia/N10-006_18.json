Wrong IP address - This would cause packet routing problems, but would not cause an interface to bounce.\nB. Loopback not set - Would not effect link status, this is primarily used in BGP routing and has nothing to do with link state.\nC. Bad wire - Since network wires don't move, this would typically cause an interface's line protocol to go and stay down.\nD. Incorrect encapsulation - This would impact routing, not physical link state.\nE. Duplex mismatch - By process of elimination, this is the only remaining answer. A mismatch in duplex between both sides of the connection will cause the link to bounce repeatedly.\n\nAnother way to look at it is based on the question. The thing to note is that it is asking about a physical layer issue (Interface flapping), and only C and E are physical layer problems. We know it can't be C since it is extremely unlikely a bad wire will \"sometimes work\". That leaves E as our only choice.","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"AALLII","timestamp":"1602630960.0","comment_id":"199452","upvote_count":"2","content":"EXPLANATION PLEASE!"}],"answer_description":"","question_text":"An administrator's network has OSPF for the internal routing protocol and has two interfaces that continue to flap.
