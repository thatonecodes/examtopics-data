Network File System (NFS) is a client/server file-sharing protocol used in Unix/Linux. Version 4 is the most current version of NFS. It operates over TCP port 2049. Secure NFS (SNFS) offers confidentiality using Digital Encryption Standard (DES).\n\nCommon Internet File System (CIFS)\nServer Message Block (SMB) is an application layer protocol used to provide shared access to resources. The Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol is a dialect of SMB. It is primarily used in Windows systems. The latest version is 3.1.1, which was released to support Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. It operates as a client-server application. It uses port 445.\n\nCompTIA Server+ Study Guide: Exam SK0-005 Chapter 4 Storage Technologies and Asset Management","poster":"Pongsathorn"},{"comment_id":"671638","poster":"Timock","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nNetwork File System (NFS): NFS is a network that was introduced by Sun Microsystems and is used by Unix or Linux-based operating systems and stands for Network File System. This is a network that is used for giving remote access capabilities to the applications. Remote access enables the user to edit or even take a closer look at his computer by using another computer. Old files can be repaired even when the user is at a distance from his computer. This protocol gives devices the functionality to modify the data over a network. \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-nfs-and-cifs/#","comments":[{"timestamp":"1663429560.0","comment_id":"671640","content":"Even the explanation states NFA for Linux and CIFS for Windows... but for some odd reason CIFS has been chosen as the answer here.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Timock"}],"timestamp":"1663429500.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1663429500,"choices":{"C":"SFTP","D":"NFS","A":"CIFS","B":"FTP"},"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_id":331,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/82548-exam-sk0-005-topic-1-question-77-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","exam_id":365},{"id":"zTARQ68djK4i2udSuB6r","answer_description":"","answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1634828340,"topic":"1","question_text":"A server in a remote datacenter is no longer responsive.

If a system is bare metal, there is no way to access the BIOS and Hardware without a crash cart, KVM, console, or remote management (iLO, etc).

Servers were kept on-premises and often belonged to the organization using and operating them. In computer networking, a bare-metal server is a physical computer server that is used by one consumer, or tenant, only. Each server offered for rental is a distinct physical piece of hardware that is a functional server on its own. They are not virtual servers running in multiple pieces of shared hardware. With that being the definition of On-Premises Server, you could use A. IP KVM, or C. A crash cart to gain access to the server. The question is vague enough not to be able to correctly determine by not knowing the need. Is the server in the same room? Do they have a OOB network set up? If you can access the server via IP KVM, why wouldn't you opt to?.
