Stratified\n\nStratified Sampling is a method in which the population is divided into smaller subgroups, or strata, based on characteristics such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, etc. and a random sample is taken from each subgroup. This ensures that each subgroup is represented in the sample, so that the sample accurately reflects the diversity within the population. \n\nSimple Random Sampling selects elements from the population at random, with no attempt to ensure representation of subgroups. \n\nCluster Sampling involves dividing the population into clusters, and then randomly selecting a number of clusters to be included in the sample. \n\nSystematic Sampling involves selecting elements from the population at regular intervals, rather than randomly.","upvote_count":"3"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/99023-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-46-discussion/","exam_id":351,"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"XgBSLJete8E1ChDabPDa","question_id":162,"timestamp":"2023-02-04 15:32:00","topic":"1","answer":"A","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image15.png","https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image16.png"],"exam_id":351,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/97975-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-47-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1675521120,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (55%)","B (45%)"],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Given the following customer and order tables:\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\nWhich of the following describes the number of rows and columns of data that would be present after performing an INNER JOIN of the tables?","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Nine rows, five columns","C":"Eight rows, seven columns","B":"Seven rows, eight columns","A":"Five rows, eight columns"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"802323","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

There are 7 rows in the order table, all those 7 rows will retain when inner join occurred because Customer_ID matches the customer table. Since customer like 001 and 004 appear twice in the order table, they will appear twice in the newly joined table as well. There are 8 columns because Customer_ID column is in both tables, 4 unique columns in customer table, 3 unique columns in order table, combined is 8 columns.

Sorting is the function that will allow the data analyst to organize the table in the desired manner. Sorting allows the data analyst to arrange the data in a specific order, either in ascending or descending order, based on one or multiple columns.
