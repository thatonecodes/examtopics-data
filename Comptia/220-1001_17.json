This question is terrible. Undetected memory errors can result in no consequences, or permanent corruption of data/machine crash. Parity will only detect the error and not correct it. For correction on the fly you need ECC. When a parity error is detected, the motherboard parity-checking circuits generate a nonmaskable interrupt (NMI), which halts processing and diverts the system's attention to the error. In some older systems, parity-check routine halts the CPU and causes the system to lock up, leaving you to perform a hardware reset. Meaning all your work is lost. The idea for parity is to catch RAM errors before they become catastrophic and allow you to schedule downtime to replace it. Most systems don't halt the CPU when parity error is detected; instead, they offer the choice of rebooting the system or continuing as though nothing happened. Parity will not reduce downtime and is not a \"type of RAM\" but a FEATURE built into certain TYPES of RAM.\n\nLRDIMMs are a load-reduction DIMM used in servers to reduce load on the server memory bus. This has noting to do with preventing downtime.","timestamp":"1616073360.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"123123321123"}],"comment_id":"127054","timestamp":"1593969540.0"}],"topic":"1","exam_id":337,"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/24795-exam-220-1001-topic-1-question-174-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1593969540,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"B","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"A technician is upgrading the RAM in a server-grade laptop for a company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
