The > operator is used to redirect output from one file descriptor to another.\n\nSo, when you run a command followed by 1>&2, the standard output of that command will be redirected to standard error, which means that the output of the command will be written to the same place as error messages. This can be useful in certain situations, such as when you want to capture both the output and error messages of a command in the same log file."}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98859-exam-lx0-103-topic-3-question-2-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"3CXjO4IwgKnnQoJ73atH","question_images":[],"answer":"B","exam_id":353,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-02-12 15:19:00","topic":"3","question_text":"What is the effect of the egrep command when the -v option is used?","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1676211540,"choices":{"A":"It enables color to highlight matching parts.","C":"It shows the command's version information.","D":"It changes the output order showing the last matching line first.","B":"It only outputs non-matching lines."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/98939-exam-lx0-103-topic-3-question-22-discussion/","question_id":40,"discussion":[{"content":"The effect of the egrep command when the -v option is used is option B: it only outputs non-matching lines. The -v option inverts the match, so instead of showing lines that match a pattern, it shows lines that do not match the pattern.\n\negrep is a command-line tool that is used to search for text patterns in files or streams of text. It stands for \"extended grep\" and is similar to the grep command, but with more advanced pattern matching capabilities.\n\negrep uses regular expressions to match patterns in the text, and it can search for patterns that include special characters, such as metacharacters and quantifiers. These allow for more complex and flexible pattern matching.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"806410","poster":"linux_admin","timestamp":"1676211540.0"}]}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":353,"name":"LX0-103","numberOfQuestions":95,"provider":"Comptia","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":8},"__N_SSP":true}
