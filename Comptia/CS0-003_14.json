After in-depth analysis, I realized and came to the conclusion that option A, “Proprietary Systems”, is the most appropriate.

This is evident in the situation described, where two critical systems cannot be updated due to a vendor device that the company does not have access to.\nOn the other hand, legacy systems, which are older systems that are still in use, can be accessed and potentially updated by the company.
