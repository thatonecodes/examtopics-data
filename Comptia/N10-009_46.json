SOA is service orientated architecture. PTR is a pointer record which maps a domain name essentially opposite of A or AAAA (IP<Domain). CNAME is used to create an alias for a domain name, allowing multiple subdomains to point to the same sever without needing separate A records","poster":"efe498c","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1325373","timestamp":"1733972400.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1733949900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A. NS (Name Server).\n\nTo change where the outside DNS records are hosted, the network administrator needs to update the NS (Name Server) records at the domain registrar. NS records specify which DNS servers are authoritative for the domain. When the administrator updates the NS records, they are directing queries for the domain to the new DNS servers.\n\nHere's what the other records do:\n\n B. SOA (Start of Authority): The SOA record indicates the start of a zone and includes details like the primary DNS server and the email of the domain administrator. While important for DNS zone configuration, changing the hosting of DNS records typically requires updating the NS records, not the SOA record.\n\n C. PTR (Pointer): PTR records are used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a domain name. They are not used to control where DNS records are hosted.\n\n D. CNAME (Canonical Name): A CNAME record is used to alias one domain name to another. Changing DNS hosting typically involves modifying the NS records, not CNAME records.\n\nThus, to change the DNS hosting, the administrator should modify the NS records at the domain registrar.","poster":"TheCrumbs","comment_id":"1325232"}],"answer_description":""},{"id":"sOjTzOttf2u0bE53aAmC","choices":{"C":"Moving the devices closer to the modem","B":"Switching the devices to wireless","D":"Lowering the network speed","A":"Removing any splitters connected to the line"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/154478-exam-n10-009-topic-1-question-59-discussion/","topic":"1","question_id":227,"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1736803440,"question_images":[],"question_text":"A support agent receives a report that a remote user's wired devices are constantly disconnecting and have slow speeds.
