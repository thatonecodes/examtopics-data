Integrate threat intelligence feeds into the FIM.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIntegrating threat intelligence feeds into the FIM (Federated Identity Manager) can help limit the attack surface by providing real-time information about known threats. This allows the FIM to make informed decisions about access control and can help prevent unauthorized access.\nUpdating firewall rules and configuring SIEM dashboards are important security measures, but they don't directly address the goal of limiting the attack surface and improving access control for external and internal network security.\nDeploying DLP rules is relevant for data protection, but it doesn't specifically address the goal of limiting the attack surface and improving access control.\nTherefore, integrating threat intelligence feeds into the FIM is the most effective solution for achieving the stated requirements.","comment_id":"1294708","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1243169","timestamp":"1720239120.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nUpdating firewall rules to ensure they match the new IP addresses in use is crucial for maintaining effective access control. This action helps to limit the attack surface by ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed through the firewall.

Risk acceptance\n\nIn this situation, where the cost of anti-malware software exceeds the potential loss from a malware threat, the most cost-effective risk response would be risk acceptance. This means understanding the risk associated with the malware threat and choosing to accept that risk rather than investing in costly anti-malware solutions. By accepting the risk, the organization acknowledges the potential impact of a malware incident but decides that it is more cost-effective to deal with the consequences if an incident occurs.","poster":"cf13076","comment_id":"1199876","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1198960","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
