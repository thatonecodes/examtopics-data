Reverse engineering's objective is to determine how much information can be extracted from delivered software. For example, reverse engineering can sometimes extract source code, identify software methods and languages used, developer comments, variable names and types, system and web calls, and many other things. An adversary can perform reverse engineering on a software patch to identify the vulnerabilities it is crafted to fix, or an analyst can perform reverse engineering on malware to determine how it operates."},{"poster":"TyrionL26","comment_id":"1410492","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI would go to reverse engineering since it will show deeper understanding of any malware compare to static analysis.","timestamp":"1743009600.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nHere is why I will go with C:\n B.

But static would not be the best to analyze this code. Static is what we would likely do first to determine if it's malicious or vulnerable. Here... We know that it's malicious and static does not run the code to determine it's actions and what it might be targeting and that would be the entire purpose around analyzing this code. We need to dissect it in a sandbox and figure out not only what the code does, but what it's target is, how it's intended to exploit, what techniques it may use for privelege escalation and more. Once again, you know it's malicious, why do you run a static? Root cause people.

First, they can attempt to use a specialized program known as a decompiler to convert the binary code back to source code. Unfortunately, however, this process usually does not work very well. Second, they can use a specialized environment and carefully monitor how software responds to different inputs in an attempt to discover its inner workings. In either case, reverse engineering compiled software is extremely difficult.\nUnderstand how reverse engineering techniques attempt to determine how hardware and software function internally. Sandboxing is an approach used to detect malicious software based on its behavior rather than its signatures.
