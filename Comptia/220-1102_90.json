Rootkit\n\nRootkits are particularly stealthy and persistent forms of malware that can embed themselves deeply within the operating system. Even after reinstalling the OS, if a rootkit is present, it can remain undetected and continue to infect the system. Rootkits often have the capability to reinstall themselves even after system reinstallation or other remediation attempts. Therefore, a rootkit is the most likely source of the persistent malware infection in this scenario.\n\nBoth GPT and Gemini seem to agree.","comment_id":"1193711","upvote_count":"2","poster":"yutface"}],"timestamp":"2024-04-11 13:07:00","exam_id":340,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1712833620,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[]},{"id":"zFLZmo8i9aCSwNlPQpNe","answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_text":"A technician is doing a bare-metal installation of the Windows 10 operating system.
