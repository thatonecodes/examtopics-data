Mandatory.\nIn The Official CompTIA Project+ Guide (PK0-005), mandatory dependencies (also known as hard logic) are those that are legally or contractually required or inherent to the nature of the work.

They could do install > powered on > install peripherals > install software for example. This example would fit internal and not mandatory, and the question does not state that is HAS to be done after the installation, only that it can only begin after that step.","comment_id":"1064027","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1699286760.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1699287060.0","content":"To clarify a point, a task can be internal(external) AND mandatory(discretionary), but based on wording I would say it is only internal.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1064032","poster":"Narobi"}],"poster":"Narobi"},{"comment_id":"1041977","timestamp":"1697132340.0","poster":"Caoilfhion","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt is B, as we need to break the question and given answer sets down. If internal was not offered in the list, then Mandatory would be the answer. But, since both classification types of Internal and External were offered, the question is looking for a more specific answer. As Mandatory can be applied to either Internal or External, it's not the best/specific answer, hence the \"trip up\" here. Mandatory is not wrong, but its not the most detailed way to describe this scenario. We aim for the most detailed classification, so we can find a solution more quickly, regardless if the problem is holding the project up or not.
