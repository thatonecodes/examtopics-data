This may sound like ordinary authentication, the kind based on a username/password combination, but identity proofing actually comes into play before users get their credentials to access an application or alongside the traditional authentication process.\n\nIdentity proofing allows you to verify a user's identity based on life history (a credit report), biometrics (a facial scan), and other factors before granting them access to your system.\n\nOf course, you can manually verify your users' identities by requiring them to provide paper documentation (a copy of their passport) or performing an interactive check via online meeting tools like Zoom. As you might expect, these time-consuming manual processes don't scale effectively, and they inevitably detract from your user experience.\n------------------------------------------\nSource: https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-identity-proofing-and-why-does-it-matter/","timestamp":"1677121800.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"EZPASS"},{"comment_id":"644740","timestamp":"1675999740.0","poster":"Agrona","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBecause this is a bank account, I believe this would be considered KYC: https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/banking-payment/issuance/id-verification/know-your-customer","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1660094940,"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"LrQJRXNSXV2t7TtKA3CW","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/78174-exam-cas-004-topic-1-question-96-discussion/","question_id":639,"answer_description":"","exam_id":343,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Recovery","A":"Remediation","C":"Response","B":"Containment"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1723186440.0","content":"Preparation -> Detection -> Analysis -> Containment -> Eradication -> Recovery -> Lessons learned\n\nThe SOC has been notified, so preparation and detection is complete.
