Battery backup\n\nTo mitigate micro power outages, such as short power interruptions lasting a few minutes, a battery backup, often referred to as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), is the most appropriate solution. A UPS provides a temporary power source during such interruptions, allowing connected devices to continue operating without disruption.

A CMOS battery (C) is a small battery on a computer's motherboard that primarily maintains the system's hardware clock and BIOS settings; it does not address power outages.
