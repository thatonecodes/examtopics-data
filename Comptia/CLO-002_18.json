Configure encryption in transit.\n\nEncrypting data in transit ensures that data is protected while it is being transferred between the on-premises environment and the cloud infrastructure. This prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting and accessing sensitive data during transit, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.","comment_id":"1175953","poster":"Bluebird33","timestamp":"1726584540.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/87045-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-87-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-11-06 02:46:00","topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_id":86,"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","choices":{"C":"Perform server hardening.","B":"Perform a vulnerability scan","A":"Review the risk register.","D":"Configure encryption in transit."}},{"id":"Rtm08CWWAqXlSyIQyuKP","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1710694140,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1726584540.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Availability\n\nAvailability refers to the ability of a system or service to be operational and accessible when needed. For critical servers and system uptime, ensuring high availability is paramount. A CSP that offers robust availability guarantees, including redundancy, failover mechanisms, and SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for uptime, will be crucial in maintaining continuous access to critical servers and minimizing downtime.","poster":"Bluebird33","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1175954"}],"answer":"C","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":87,"isMC":true,"question_text":"A systems administrator must select a CSP while considering system uptime and access to critical servers.

Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology utilizes a distributed ledger system where transactions are recorded across multiple nodes in a network. Each node maintains a copy of the ledger, ensuring transparency and immutability of transactions. This decentralized approach ensures that all users participating in the network have access to the same transaction records, eliminating the need for a central authority to validate or authorize transactions."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/136420-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-89-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Artificial intelligence","A":"Big Data","B":"Blockchain","C":"Machine learning"},"unix_timestamp":1710694200,"timestamp":"2024-03-17 17:50:00"},{"id":"Rn4cVX4xbwHxoLYHFXPg","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1738208460,"timestamp":"2025-01-30 04:41:00","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"blockchain.","B":"Big Data.","C":"microservice design.","E":"object storage.","A":"machine learning."},"isMC":true,"exam_id":344,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","answer":"B","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nBig Data has generally been characterized by four attributes: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity.\n\nThese four dimensions of Big Data pose challenges and also create opportunities while handling large volumes of data:\n\nVolume: Huge amounts of data generated daily may include information from social media, IoT devices, and all kinds of transactions.\nVariety: Includes the different types of data such as structured, unstructured, and semi-structured emanating from a myriad of sources.\nVelocity: Refers to the high speed at which data is generated, processed, and analyzed in real time.\nVeracity: Concerns the credibility, precision, and quality of the data.\n\nThese characteristics underline the need for advanced data processing, storage, and analytics solutions—like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning—to extract meaningful value from big data.","poster":"LiviT","comment_id":"1348899","timestamp":"1738208460.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/155692-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-9-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_text":"Volume, variety, velocity, and veracity are the four characteristics of:","answer_images":[],"question_id":89},{"id":"MTY3j1M9x4NJbb4UHnE9","question_id":90,"question_text":"Which of the following should be considered to ensure the availability of data that is accessed across multiple sites?
