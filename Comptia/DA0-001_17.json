A trend analysis\n\nWhen an analyst notices changes in sales ratios over time, they are likely conducting a trend analysis. Trend analysis involves examining data points over a period to identify any consistent patterns, trends, or changes that may occur. In this case, the analyst is observing how sales ratios have changed from one quarter to another, which falls under the purview of trend analysis. This analysis helps in understanding the direction and magnitude of changes in sales ratios over time, which can provide valuable insights for decision-making and strategic planning.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","timestamp":"1729196940.0","comment_id":"1197469"}]},{"id":"Mfc43van8uBuCzXxWHJt","answer":"D","timestamp":"2024-04-17 22:54:00","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST example of unstructured data?","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/139023-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-173-discussion/","question_id":83,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1197494","content":"D.

Variance\n\nVariance is a statistical measure of the dispersion or spread of a dataset. It quantifies how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean. In the context of actual and projected sales for the fourth quarter of 2019, the analyst can use variance to measure the extent to which the projected sales differ from the actual sales. This measure provides insights into the variability or dispersion of the sales data, which is valuable for assessing the accuracy of the projections and understanding the potential risks or uncertainties associated with them."}],"question_id":84,"exam_id":351,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1713387360,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"B"},{"id":"TdO50SwrujyDsFw0KZkY","answers_community":[],"answer":"D","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/da0-001/image59.png"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1197498","content":"D is correct. \n\nMean is 6, (5 + 7 + 3 + 7 + 8) / 5. \n\nMedian is 7, 7 is in the middle of the sorted sequence: 3, 5, 7, 7, 8. \n\nMode is 7, as itâ€™s the only number that appears twice.","timestamp":"1729198800.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Swift_and_Quick"}],"answer_ET":"D","question_id":85,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/139025-exam-da0-001-topic-1-question-176-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1713387600,"exam_id":351,"choices":{"B":"Mean: 5 -\n\nMedian: 7 -\n\nMode: 7 -","C":"Mean: 6 -\n\nMedian: 3 -\n\nMode: 7 -","D":"Mean: 6 -\n\nMedian: 7 -\nMode: 7","A":"Mean: 5 -\n\nMedian: 3 -\n\nMode: 7 -"},"question_text":"A data analyst has been asked to find the mean, median, and mode of the distribution in the data shown below:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich of the following is the correct answer?","timestamp":"2024-04-17 23:00:00"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"id":351,"provider":"Comptia","name":"DA0-001","numberOfQuestions":219,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":17},"__N_SSP":true}
