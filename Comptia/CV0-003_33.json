Since disk throughput is nearly maxed out, increasing caching can help reduce the number of disk reads and improve query performance.\n\nCaching stores frequently accessed data in memory (RAM), significantly reducing disk I/O operations, which is the primary bottleneck here.","poster":"BigM","timestamp":"1740751080.0","comment_id":"1363051","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-02-28 14:58:00","question_text":"A systems administrator is diagnosing performance issues on a web application.

Configuring infrastructure as code\n\nConfiguring infrastructure as code (IaC) is the best approach for automating the provisioning of resources at the infrastructure layer without modifying application code. With IaC, you define and manage your infrastructure using code, which can be versioned and automated. This allows you to consistently and efficiently provision and manage resources, ensuring that the infrastructure is aligned with your application's requirements. IaC tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation are commonly used for this purpose.","timestamp":"1710389760.0"},{"timestamp":"1708532820.0","comment_id":"986609","poster":"Tomtom11","upvote_count":"2","content":"Some orchestration systems allow for an approach called infrastructure-as-\ncode\n(IaC).

If there was a logic bomb for instance or something that would be more specific to targeting the machine with a rootkit without external network connections you wouldn't be able to see it through a traffic capture.
