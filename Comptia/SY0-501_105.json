This works much like HTTPS with a certificate on the SMTP server and a negotiation between client and server about which cipher suites to use. There are two ways for SMTP to use TLS: STARTTLS—this is a command that upgrades an existing unsecure connection to use TLS. This is also referred to as explicit TLS or opportunistic TLS. Note that despite the name, the connection can be configured to use legacy SSL versions if required. SMTPS—this establishes the secure connection before any SMTP commands (HELO, for instance) are exchanged. This is also referred to as implicit TLS.\n\nConnection security goes a long way toward preventing the compromise of email accounts and the spoofing of email, but there is still a need for message authentication and confidentiality in many scenarios. One means of doing this with PKI is called Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME).","timestamp":"1622288820.0","comment_id":"369409","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Dion79"}],"question_id":521,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/53758-exam-sy0-501-topic-1-question-525-discussion/","timestamp":"2021-05-29 13:47:00","question_text":"Confidential emails from an organization were posted to a website without the organization's knowledge.

The advantage of single sign-on is that each user does not have to manage multiple user accounts and passwords.

Every activity, even standing still, represents a unique movement pattern. That pattern is bred from your habits and lifestyle, as well as your body's mobility, stability, flexibility and strength. Every action you take—running stride, pedal stroke, swim stroke, etc.—represents that unique movement pattern. If your movements include compensations (and they likely do), gait analysis can pinpoint the areas in the body where these losses of efficiency originate.","poster":"MagicianRecon","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"118589"},{"comment_id":"106020","content":"If you're into your running, you may have heard of something called a gait analysis.
