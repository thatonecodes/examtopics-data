VDI can be used to provide the desktop experience.\n\nThe computing hardware for VDI can be split into thin clients and thick clients:\n\n- Thin clients are simple computers that can be accessed through a remote connection to a central server which provides the client all of its resources.

Thin clients would work for this scenario since data can't be stored in the conference rooms and thin clients cant store data anyway.\n\n- Thick clients are fully functional networked computers that have their OS, local storage, and handles their own processing. Just think company-provided desktop computers or laptops. They can connect to a server if they want, but can work independently as well.

With VDI, sensitive data can be stored in a centralized and secure data center rather than being physically stored in the conference rooms. Thin clients are lightweight devices that connect to virtual desktops hosted on servers in the data center. When users access the virtual desktops via thin clients in the conference rooms, they are essentially viewing a display of the desktop environment, and no data is stored locally on the thin clients themselves.\n\nThis approach ensures that sensitive data remains secure in the data center, and it reduces the risk of data exposure or loss if a thin client is stolen or compromised. Additionally, VDI allows for easy management and control of the desktop environment, enabling the security architect to enforce security policies and access controls effectively.","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"assfedassfinished","timestamp":"1680787200.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis is how we do this exact thing at my job, thin client & vdi.","comment_id":"862990","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"977098","timestamp":"1691623980.0","content":"Now I know its right.
