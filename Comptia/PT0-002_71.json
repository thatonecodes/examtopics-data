Stop the assessment and inform the emergency contact.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nEthical and Legal Considerations: Accessing a third-party supplier’s network without explicit permission could violate legal and ethical guidelines. It’s crucial to respect the scope of the engagement and avoid unauthorized access.\nScope of Work: The IP range associated with the third-party supplier is likely out of the defined scope of the penetration test. Continuing to explore this range could lead to unintended consequences and potential legal issues.\nCommunication: Informing the emergency contact ensures that the client is aware of the situation and can take appropriate actions, such as notifying the third-party supplier or adjusting the scope of the engagement.\nTaking this approach demonstrates professionalism and adherence to ethical standards in penetration testing.","poster":"MeisAdriano","timestamp":"1722960600.0"},{"comment_id":"1229554","timestamp":"1718235360.0","poster":"stinger00541","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI have to go with B.
