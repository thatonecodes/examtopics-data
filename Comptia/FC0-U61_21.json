Password reuse\n\nExplanation:\nThe second compromise occurred because the user likely reused the same password from the first compromised account on another site. When attackers obtain credentials from one breach, they often try the same login information on other sites (credential stuffing attacks).\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA. Password age – While changing passwords regularly can help, it wouldn't have prevented the second compromise if the user reused the same password elsewhere.\nB. Password complexity – A complex password is important, but if it was already compromised and reused, complexity wouldn’t have prevented the second attack.\nD. Password length – A longer password improves security, but it does not help if the same password is reused across multiple accounts.","timestamp":"1741113720.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Password reuse\n\nPassword reuse is the practice of using the same password for multiple accounts or services. In this scenario, the second compromise occurred because the user reused the same credentials that were compromised in the first incident. If the user had used unique passwords for each account or service, the second compromise could have been prevented, even if the credentials from the first compromise were exposed.","poster":"_denw","comment_id":"1148300","timestamp":"1723470780.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I don't really understand a lot of these password questions because \"Password Reuse\" makes sense to me. Obviously, it's meaning \"do not reuse your password\" as a preventative measure. I don't think any other option makes sense when talking about 2 different accounts being hacked because you are using the same password for both. Password age is when the duration of the password is considered valid before it needs to be changed. This wouldn't prevent a second compromise.\n\nEven Chat GPT shows it is C.

The user has reused this password for too long.

Variables\nExplanation:\nA variable is a fundamental programming concept used to store and represent changing values in an algorithm. Since a user’s favorite ice cream flavor can differ from person to person and might change over time, it should be stored in a variable for processing in the personality prediction algorithm.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n\nA. Vectors – Typically used in advanced mathematical or machine learning computations but not necessary just for storing a single value like an ice cream flavor.\nB. Arrays – Used to store multiple values, such as a list of different ice cream flavors, but the question refers to a single selection per user, making a variable more appropriate.\nD. Constants – Constants store values that do not change, but a user’s favorite flavor might change over time, so a variable is more suitable.\nSince the flavor choice can vary per user, variables are the best way to represent it.","comment_id":"1360809"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1247328","content":"Selected Answer: B\nArrays (B): Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. If the programmer wanted to store multiple favorite flavors for a user, an array might be appropriate, but for a single flavor, a simple variable is more suitable.\n\nIt's ice cream flavors, not flavor.

One-tier\nExplanation:\nNotepad.exe is a simple text editor that runs entirely on the local machine without requiring a separate database or server. This makes it a one-tier (single-tier) architecture, where the application, logic, and data are all handled within the same environment.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n\nA. n-tier – This refers to architectures with multiple layers, such as web applications with separate front-end, business logic, and database layers. Notepad does not use this structure.\nC. Two-tier – A two-tier architecture involves a client and a separate database server, which Notepad does not require.\nD. Three-tier – A three-tier system has presentation (UI), application logic, and a database layer, typically used in web or enterprise applications—not in simple programs like Notepad.\nSince Notepad.exe runs everything on a single machine, it is an example of a one-tier architecture.","poster":"fcc_class","timestamp":"1740360720.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1740360720,"isMC":true,"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"C":"Two-tier","A":"n-tier","D":"Three-tier","B":"One-tier"},"exam_id":352,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-02-24 02:32:00","question_text":"Which of the following architectures is notepad.exe an example of?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157050-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-225-discussion/"},{"id":"hZnSaPMrtG7Qub1dHoJp","exam_id":352,"answer":"A","question_id":104,"timestamp":"2025-02-24 02:35:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/157051-exam-fc0-u61-topic-1-question-227-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
