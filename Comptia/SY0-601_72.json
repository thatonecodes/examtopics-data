This is a common response in incident response to prevent the attacker from maintaining control over the system and to preserve the system's current state for forensic analysis. Fileless malware, in particular, operates in memory and may not leave traces on disk, so preserving memory contents for analysis is crucial to understanding the extent of the compromise and identifying the attacker's methods.","comment_id":"1055175","comments":[{"poster":"BD69","timestamp":"1706554320.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1135228","content":"If you power it down, you will lose all your information.
