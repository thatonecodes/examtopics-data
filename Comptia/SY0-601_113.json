If the question focuses solely on the initial identification of the C2 communication, then the firewall log may have a slight edge because it would log any attempts of an internal machine trying to reach out to an external one, regardless of the nature of that communication. Authentication logs are valuable for understanding lateral movement and potential privilege escalation but may not be the first place to identify a host impacted by C2 communication unless that communication mimics authentication traffic.\n\nThat said, the choice between B and E can depend on the specific architecture and logging capabilities of the organization.
