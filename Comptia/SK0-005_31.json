A full, weekly backup with daily differential backups\n\nDifferential backups capture all changes made since the last full backup. By performing a full backup of the accounting server every seven days and then creating daily differential backups, you ensure that you have a comprehensive backup of all modified data since the last full backup.\n\nWhen restoring the server data, you only need to restore the last full backup and the latest differential backup. This minimizes the restore time compared to other backup types because you only need to apply the latest differential backup to the full backup to bring the data up to date.","poster":"surfuganda","comment_id":"1172141"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nTo restore a full backup as quickly as possible in the event of a complete loss of server data, you would want to minimize the number of backup sets you need to restore. Given the options:\n\nD. A full, weekly backup with daily differential backups\n\nThis would be the best choice. With differential backups, each backup contains all the changes since the last full backup. So, in the event of a complete loss, you would only need to restore the latest full backup and the latest differential backup. If you were using incremental backups, you would need to restore the full backup and every incremental backup since the last full backup, which would take longer.","poster":"Kraken84","timestamp":"1697656800.0","comment_id":"1047169","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"hasquaati","timestamp":"1694980800.0","comment_id":"1010038","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOnly backing up modified data on a daily basis.

Connect the server to a SAN\n\nConnecting the server to a SAN would allow the administrator to expand the storage capacity without downtime by adding additional storage resources from the SAN to the file server without needing to physically replace disks or disrupt server operations. The SAN can provide additional storage capacity without requiring the server to be taken offline. This solution offers scalability and flexibility in expanding storage capacity while minimizing downtime.","timestamp":"1726179120.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"surfuganda","comment_id":"1172143"},{"content":"Key word is no downtime.

The UEFI boot was interrupted by a missing Linux boot file.\n\nThis is the most likely cause. If the UEFI firmware cannot find the EFI boot loader for Linux (e.g., grubx64.efi or shimx64.efi in the EFI System Partition), it may drop to the UEFI shell (fs>) instead of booting the operating system.\n\nWhen a Linux server stops during the boot process with a blank screen and an fs> prompt, this indicates that the system has entered the UEFI Shell. This usually occurs when the UEFI firmware cannot find a valid boot device or boot file to load the operating system. The fs> prompt is a typical UEFI file system shell prompt, suggesting that the issue is related to UEFI and the boot process.","comment_id":"1172147","timestamp":"1726179540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"surfuganda"}],"question_id":153,"unix_timestamp":1710289140,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"rQLwBcacrMnVHdZoEfp4","exam_id":365,"question_id":154,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-12-11 19:34:00","answer":"C","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1702319640,"choices":{"D":"Connect the virtual administration console.","B":"Connect a console cable to the server NIC.","A":"Connect the diagnostic card to the PCIe connector.","C":"Connect to the server from a crash cart."},"question_text":"A server technician arrives at a data center to troubleshoot a physical server that is not responding to remote management software.
