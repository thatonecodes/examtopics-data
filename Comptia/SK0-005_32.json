The controller has disabled the write cache.\n\nWhen the battery fails, the RAID controller may disable its write cache to prevent data loss in the event of a power failure.

The disk uses GPT.\nCompatibility with Older Server: If the disk originally came from a newer Windows server, it's likely formatted using the GPT (GUID Partition Table) partitioning scheme, which is commonly used in modern Windows installations.\n\nOlder Windows Server: The older Windows server may not support GPT partitioning. Older versions of Windows, particularly those released before Windows Server 2008, often only support the MBR (Master Boot Record) partitioning scheme.\n\nVisibility Issue: The fact that the hardware recognizes the drive but the data isn't visible to the operating system suggests a compatibility issue related to the disk's partitioning scheme rather than the file system format.","timestamp":"1726180380.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1172156"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"tame_rabbit","comment_id":"1164347","timestamp":"1725299340.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe newer disk uses GPT and so is not accessible on the old server which only recognizes MBR so A is correct"},{"comment_id":"1108013","poster":"RBL23168","timestamp":"1719589380.0","content":"If the disk was originally set up with GPT on the new Windows server and then moved to an older Windows server that does not support GPT, it could result in the data not being visible to the operating system on the older server.\n\nIn that case, option A, \"The disk uses GPT,\" would indeed be the most likely cause of the issue.
