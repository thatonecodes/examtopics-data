Avoidance\n\nAvoidance is a risk response strategy that involves eliminating or withdrawing from activities, decisions, or situations that pose unacceptable risks or where the potential negative consequences outweigh the benefits. In this case, the organization has decided not to proceed with the cloud migration due to the perceived risks, effectively avoiding the associated risks by not pursuing the migration.","upvote_count":"1"}],"choices":{"B":"Transference","C":"Avoidance","D":"Mitigation","A":"Acceptance"},"question_id":6},{"id":"aXBaFsF2cVF7ZQcrds7X","exam_id":344,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A cloud developer chooses to use private key encryption for all traffic in a new application.

Confidentiality\n\nPrivate key encryption is a form of encryption where both encryption and decryption keys are the same. It ensures that only parties possessing the private key can decrypt the encrypted data. By using private key encryption for all traffic in the new application, the developer aims to protect the confidentiality of the data being transmitted. This means that even if an unauthorized party intercepts the data, they won't be able to decipher its contents without the private key.","poster":"Bluebird33","comment_id":"1175971"}],"question_id":7,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/136427-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-105-discussion/","answer":"B","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-03-17 18:11:00","isMC":true},{"id":"iPDWRa2StdXXB4TeLp9O","answer":"CD","choices":{"E":"Hardening","A":"Continuous deployment","F":"Backups","D":"Geo-redundancy","B":"Right-sizing","C":"Availability zones"},"exam_id":344,"question_id":8,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/136428-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-107-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1710695580,"answers_community":["CD (100%)"],"answer_ET":"DF","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1175972","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726585980.0","poster":"Bluebird33","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nI think this one should be C & D\n\nC. Availability zones: Availability zones are separate data centers within a geographic region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. Distributing application components across multiple availability zones ensures redundancy and fault tolerance. If one availability zone experiences an outage, the application can continue running from other zones, minimizing downtime.\n\nD. Geo-redundancy: Geo-redundancy involves replicating data and resources across multiple geographic regions. In the event of a regional outage or disaster, geo-redundancy ensures that the application remains available by directing traffic to alternative regions. This redundancy minimizes downtime and ensures business continuity.\n\nNot 100% sure, though."}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"A cloud administrator is reviewing the requirements for a SaaS application and estimates downtime will be very expensive for the organization.

Software-defined network\n\nSoftware-defined networking (SDN) allows for the management of network policies from a central portal while maintaining a hardware-agnostic approach. With SDN, network administrators can dynamically control and manage network resources using software-based controllers, decoupling the control plane from the physical network infrastructure. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and automation in managing network policies across diverse hardware environments.","poster":"Bluebird33","comment_id":"1176808","timestamp":"1726685280.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2024-03-18 21:48:00","question_text":"Which of the following allows for the management of network policies from a central portal while maintaining a hardware-agnostic approach?","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Load balancing","D":"Direct Connect","B":"Software-defined network","A":"Virtual private network"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/136529-exam-clo-002-topic-1-question-109-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1710794880,"exam_id":344,"answer":"B","question_images":[],"question_id":9},{"id":"ydIRjAaS0xZ2p44VgB78","question_id":10,"timestamp":"2020-05-12 17:25:00","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1589297100.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1606293480.0","content":"indeed","poster":"studdent","comment_id":"227315","upvote_count":"2"}],"poster":"iqilito","comment_id":"87760","content":"D) Change management","upvote_count":"12"},{"timestamp":"1723897980.0","poster":"SophyQueenCR82","comment_id":"1267709","content":"D.
