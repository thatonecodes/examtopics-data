Access control vestibule\n\nAn access control vestibule, also known as a mantrap, is a physical security measure designed to control access to a restricted area. It typically consists of an enclosed space with two sets of interlocking doors. The inner set of doors will only open if the outer set is securely closed, preventing unauthorized individuals from directly entering the restricted area.\n\nThe use of an access control vestibule helps maintain a record of events because each entry or exit is typically monitored and logged. It provides a controlled and monitored environment for individuals to pass through, and any attempt to gain unauthorized access or bypass the system would trigger an alarm or be recorded for security purposes.","timestamp":"1717432200.0"},{"comment_id":"1559057","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kriegor","timestamp":"1744144680.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFor those that say B, an Access Control Vestibule does not audit or record access on its own, the lock or whatever that uses the key fob is what does that, so while C is the correct answer, it may be used in conjunction with an ACV but the ACV is not the asnwer."},{"comment_id":"1339085","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ibn_e_nazir","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf you read the question carefully it says \"access to a restricted area\". Key fob used in all the areas of the building as a general access control no matter wherever you have to go, you need to use your key fob to enter the doors even in the washroom. But the question is about the \"restricted area\" in a building which usually points towards data center or more critical server rooms. In this scenario, access control vestibule might be the good choice. \nFinal Answer:\nB.

How does video surveillance make any sense to being a solution of preventing physical access to any part of a building? Video will only allow you to monitor access points, not keep people from accessing. The only legit answer to prevent physical access is a badge reader as it is a physical locking mechanism that will not allow the door to be opened without approved access card. And if you're trying to say that someone who is monitoring the cameras are able to allow physical access to people by seeing who they are and can approve it, the person monitoring the screens will still need to push a button of some sort to allow the lock to open to permit access. So again, that still means it's not the video surveillance that is allowing access.","comment_id":"1095876","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1702506960.0"}],"timestamp":"1702228500.0","poster":"Raffaelloo"}],"timestamp":"2023-02-02 06:00:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (88%)","13%"],"question_text":"Which of the following could be used to implement secure physical access to a data center?","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/97610-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-37-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","question_id":299,"exam_id":340,"choices":{"D":"Motion sensor","B":"Alarm system","A":"Geofence","C":"Badge reader"},"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1675314000,"answer":"C","answer_images":[]},{"id":"RUyXxG08ubamOnaklO5r","question_text":"A remote user is experiencing issues connecting to a corporate email account on a laptop.
