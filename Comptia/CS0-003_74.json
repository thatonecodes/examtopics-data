TBH, I feel like A could also be the answer. The question states the analyst is \"working with the respective system owners to help determine the best methodology... to promote confidentiality, availability, and integrity...\". So clearly, it's a collaborative effort. The issue is, differentiating between system owners (question) and users (answer). Why would you interview the users and not the owners? The end users most likely don't have the knowledge required to best determine the security method. This would be system owners, so read answer choice A carefully.

Scanning\n\nIn this scenario, the consistent requests originating from an internal host to a blocklisted external server indicate scanning activity. Scanning typically involves sending multiple requests or probes to various hosts or services to identify vulnerabilities or discover open ports.
