It involves revoking the employee's access to company systems, applications, and data to ensure that they no longer have unauthorized access after leaving the organization. Offboarding typically includes disabling user accounts, changing passwords, and removing any privileges or permissions associated with the employee's role.\n\nIn this scenario, if the offboarding process had been followed correctly, the departed executive's accounts would have been promptly deactivated or deleted, preventing any further logon attempts or unauthorized access.
