Time drift.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTime drift occurs when the system clock gradually becomes inaccurate over time, often resulting in a slight misalignment like being an hour off. Since the user is seeing an error related to the system’s date/time, and the technician has confirmed the date is correct but the time is behind, time drift is the most likely cause. Additionally, it seems to only affect this specific workstation, which further points to time drift rather than network-wide issues like NTP failure.\n\n• B. NTP failure: If the Network Time Protocol (NTP) service were down, multiple systems would likely be affected, not just one.","comment_id":"1280684"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. NTP failure\n\nReason:\n\n NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to synchronize the system clock with a time server. If the workstation is not synchronizing correctly with an NTP server, the clock can drift and display incorrect time, such as being an hour behind.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1273522","timestamp":"1724770740.0","poster":"Rixon"}]},{"id":"hTLdWk0wJHxkfkNWO1Tx","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/168961-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-673-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":["BD (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"BD","isMC":true,"answer":"BD","unix_timestamp":1741804440,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741804440.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1388026","poster":"BKnows007","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB.
