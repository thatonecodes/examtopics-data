When speed is important, such as in a disaster recovery scenario where downtime is unacceptable, rapid restores can be crucial. Restoring a differential backup never requires more than two backup sets. Incremental backups, on the other hand, could require a great number of backup sets. Of course, the tradeoff in incremental vs. differential backup is that, as time progresses, differential backup media can grow to contain much more data than an incremental backup.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"DragonPender","timestamp":"1575682320.0"},{"poster":"Sakmoto","content":"The answer is B.
