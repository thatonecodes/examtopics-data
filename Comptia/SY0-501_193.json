Anything that is “suspicious” or potentially “malicious” is closely examined to determine whether or not it is a threat to the system. Using heuristic scanning, an antivirus product attempts to identify new viruses or heavily modified versions of existing viruses before they can damage your system."},{"comment_id":"840324","content":"C.
