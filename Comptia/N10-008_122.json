Extended Service Set\n\nAn Extended Service Set (ESS) is a set of interconnected Basic Service Sets (BSS) in a wireless LAN. In a scenario where multiple Access Points (APs) are used to provide better coverage and allow roaming between them, an Extended Service Set is the appropriate configuration. An ESS allows wireless clients to roam seamlessly between different APs within the same wireless network."},{"content":"C.

Reduce the TTL record prior to the MX record change.\n\nThe Time-to-Live (TTL) value in DNS records determines how long the information is cached by DNS resolvers. When making changes to critical DNS records like the MX (Mail Exchange) record, it's a good practice to reduce the TTL in advance. This way, when you make the actual change, the updated information propagates more quickly through the DNS infrastructure, minimizing downtime and potential issues."},{"content":"B. Reduce the TTL (Time To Live) record prior to the MX record change.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTTL (Time To Live): TTL is a value in a DNS record that determines the amount of time it can be cached by DNS resolvers and other devices on the internet. When making changes to DNS records, reducing the TTL beforehand helps minimize the time it takes for the changes to propagate throughout the internet.\n\nMX Record Change: Changing the MX (Mail Exchange) record directs email traffic to the specified mail server. However, DNS changes take time to propagate across the internet due to caching. If the TTL is set too high, old records may be cached for an extended period, leading to email delivery issues.","timestamp":"1731678420.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"lauren2wright","comment_id":"1071507"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1700056020,"question_images":[],"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":357,"choices":{"B":"Reduce the TTL record prior to the MX record change.","A":"Change the email client configuration to match the MX record.","C":"Perform a DNS zone transfer prior to the MX record change.","D":"Update the NS record to reflect the IP address change."},"question_text":"A network engineer performed a migration to a new mail server.

Mesh\n\nIn a mesh network topology, every node (device or computer) is directly connected to every other node in the network.
