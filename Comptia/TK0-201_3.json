It was appropriate because the students were given a frame of reference upon which to apply what they learned.\n\nWhen an instructor finishes the course material early, it is important to find a productive way to fill the remaining time. Option A implies that the instructor's actions were purely to fill the gap in timing, which is not necessarily the best use of the remaining time. Option C is not true because the instructor provided a timeline for the overall task completion, which suggests that the expectations were reasonable. Option D is also not true because the task assigned allowed the learners to apply what they learned, which is a stated learning result. Therefore, option B is the best choice because the task assigned provided the learners with a practical and relevant context in which to apply their new knowledge. This can help them better understand the material and reinforce their learning.","comment_id":"855422"}],"exam_id":369,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-03-30 09:48:00","question_id":11,"unix_timestamp":1680162480,"question_text":"An instructor completed the required content of a technical course early. The instructor decided to fill the time by writing tasks on the board and assigning them to individual students.

Even if many of them know the beginner material, assuming everyone is advanced and then going straight to the advanced learners and asking them what they'd like to cover doesn't seem productive. There could be several levels of learners in the class. I think in that case, option D would be the best. You could modify the curriculum as needed. Option D never said to modify the ENTIRE curriculum. It just said to modify for the learners, which makes the most sense"},{"comment_id":"856124","content":"The best option in this situation would be to choose option B: Ask the advanced learners what they would like to cover in the course and then change objectives based on advanced learner's requests.\n\nThis approach would not only keep the advanced learners engaged but also challenge them with more advanced material. It also allows the instructor to personalize the course content to the learners' needs, which can help increase the effectiveness of the course.\n\nOption A would be suitable if only a few learners expressed familiarity with the content. However, if the majority of the learners are already familiar with the material, continuing the class as planned may lead to disengagement from the learners who are already familiar with the content.\n\nOption C may not be the best approach as the experienced learners may not have the time or resources to return for another course. Additionally, it is not an effective solution for the current course.\n\nOption D may also be suitable, but it may not be necessary to modify the entire curriculum. Instead, modifying some parts of the curriculum or introducing more advanced topics based on the learners' requests may be sufficient.","timestamp":"1711833180.0","poster":"JimGrayham","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2023-03-30 21:13:00","question_images":[],"question_id":12,"question_text":"An instructor is teaching a beginner topic.
