The answer is technically no, but operationally yes.\nYou can support all three security mechanisms on a single physical Wi-Fi network. However, client devices must find a protocol match on the APs to which they associate. In other words, WEP has to talk to WEP; it can’t talk to WPA or WPA2.\nThe way you accommodate this is by divvying up the physical network into separate logical “security networks.” Most of the enterprise-class access point makers support all three protocols at the high end, as well as the ability to create separate service set identifiers (SSID) associated with corresponding virtual LANs (VLAN) to accommodate each protocol. So, in other words, on one physical Wi-Fi network, you could have three logical security networks: a WEP network, a WPA network, and a WPA2 network.\nhttps://www.networkworld.com/article/2309159/is-wi-fi-security-backward-compatible-.html","timestamp":"1595768880.0","poster":"Fastiff","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"144131"},{"timestamp":"1594112220.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"The answer is correct, the key word is ‘encrypt’.
