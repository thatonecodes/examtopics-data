This is because E2EE is designed to encrypt data from the time it leaves the sender's application until it is decrypted by the recipient's application, ensuring that it remains secure throughout its journey.\n\nApplication Layer (Layer 7): This is where E2EE protocols, such as Signal Protocol, OpenPGP, and various proprietary methods used in messaging apps, work. They ensure that the data is encrypted and decrypted only by the end-users' applications.\n\nThe transport layer (Layer 4), which includes protocols like TLS, does provide encryption, but it doesn't always maintain encryption throughout the entire path between sender and receiver, since data may be decrypted at intermediate points.","timestamp":"1731337560.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nPresentation Layer responsible for end-to-end encryption","comment_id":"1309539","poster":"342d098","timestamp":"1731257280.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"1307042","poster":"FrostyBoi","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD, The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end encryption using protocols such as TLS.","timestamp":"1730743140.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1730743140,"isMC":true,"exam_id":358,"question_id":213,"answer":"A","choices":{"D":"Transport","A":"Presentation","B":"Application","C":"Session"},"question_images":[]},{"id":"PfzynQgkKAhWCEc92SJN","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"B":"Flow data","D":"SNMP traps","A":"Port mirroring","C":"Syslog entries"},"question_text":"A network security administrator needs to monitor the contents of data sent between a secure network and the rest of the company.

Port mirroring\n\nPort mirroring is a technique used on a network switch to duplicate (or \"mirror\") the traffic from one or more ports to another port where a monitoring device, such as a network analyzer or intrusion detection system, is connected.
