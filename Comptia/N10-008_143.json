If the roaming settings are not configured correctly, the user may experience poor connectivity when the device maintains an association with a distant AP. Improper roaming settings can result in slow speeds, dropped connections, and low signal strength.\n\nTherefore, validating the roaming settings is the first step the network administrator should take when addressing the issue of poor connectivity. The roaming settings need to be configured in a way that allows the device to seamlessly switch from one AP to another as the user moves around the network. If the roaming settings are not configured properly, the network administrator should adjust them to ensure the best possible user experience.\n\nBy validating the roaming settings first, the network administrator can eliminate the possibility of this being the root cause of the issue, and move on to other potential causes if necessary.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1236817","poster":"NBE","content":"This would be true if option A only specified AP roaming settings.
