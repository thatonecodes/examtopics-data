Check the RJ45 end connectors, the jacks, and the ends of the run of the Cat 5 UTP cable for loose connections, pinched bends, and visible damage.\n\nThe flashing green LED on the NIC indicates that the NIC is receiving power, and the flashing orange LED indicates that the NIC is attempting to establish a network connection. Since the technician installed a Cat 5 UTP cable for this connection, the issue is most likely related to the cable or the connectors. Therefore, the technician should first check the RJ45 end connectors, the jacks, and the ends of the run of the Cat 5 UTP cable for loose connections, pinched bends, and visible damage.","comment_id":"824493"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"freeman016","timestamp":"1677560700.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe first step the technician should take is A. Check the RJ45 end connectors, the jacks, and the ends of the run of the Cat 5 UTP cable for loose connections, pinched bends, and visible damage.\n\nThe flashing green LED on the workstation's NIC typically indicates that the link is up, which means that the NIC is detecting a physical connection to the network. The flashing orange LED usually indicates that data is being transmitted or received on the network.\n\nHowever, the fact that both LEDs are flashing does not necessarily mean that the network connection is working properly. The most common cause of connectivity issues with a UTP cable is a poor physical connection. This can be caused by loose connections, pinched bends, or damage to the cable or connectors.\n\nTherefore, before attempting any other troubleshooting steps, the technician should check the cable and connectors for any visible damage or loose connections. If any issues are found, they should be corrected before proceeding with further troubleshooting.","comment_id":"824401"},{"comment_id":"692308","poster":"PythonWolf","timestamp":"1665510300.0","content":"I would check for any obvious visual damage and then check it with a cable tester, as you still need to travel to plug both RJ45 jacks into a loopback device on one end and micro scanner on the other.","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/85179-exam-220-1001-topic-1-question-507-discussion/","question_text":"A technician installed a Cat 5 UTP cable approximately 275ft (84m) from a network switch in an office to a workstation located on a factory floor.

Require a code or badge before releasing a print job.\n\nRequiring a code or badge before releasing a print job is an effective method to control and monitor printing activities. Users would need to authenticate themselves before the printer produces the documents, reducing the likelihood of forgotten or abandoned print jobs being left on the printer tray. This not only helps in preventing waste but also enhances security by ensuring that sensitive documents are not left unattended.","poster":"Mssa","timestamp":"1699566960.0"},{"timestamp":"1679059800.0","content":"Would a user really care if their department was getting billed?
