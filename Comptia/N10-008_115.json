RPO\nRTO Represents the maximum acceptable amount of time it should take to restore a system or service after a disruption. It is concerned with how quickly systems can be brought back online, not the amount of data lost.\n\nRPO (Recovery Point Objective): Refers to the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.

RPO (Recovery Point Objective)\n\nThe executive's concern about the amount of data that must be reentered aligns with the concept of Recovery Point Objective (RPO). RPO defines the acceptable amount of data loss in the event of a disaster or disruption. It represents the point in time to which data must be restored after an outage.\n\nIn this context, the executive is concerned about how much data might be lost and, consequently, how much needs to be reentered after the fire in the data center.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
