If multiple APs are in use at once and they're using nearby frequencies, that might cause signal overlap or interference between them. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the most likely reason here.\nThen there's Roaming misconfiguration. roam misconfig could mean something about how the AP is being managed as it moves around the network. If the AP isn't properly configured to change channels when needed, maybe this causes signal changes or disruptions. That seems plausible too."}],"question_text":"A network administrator recently upgraded a wireless infrastructure with new APs.
