Users access the applications over the internet, and the provider is responsible for ensuring the software is up to date, secure, and performing optimally. This model contrasts with IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a\n \nService), where the customer has more control and responsibility over the environment and may need to manage patching for applications they develop or install.\n\nReferences: SaaS is designed to relieve users from the complexity of software maintenance, including patch management, as highlighted in cloud computing service model descriptions"},{"content":"The cloud service model that is most likely to provide application patching is:\n\nD.

The term \"Software as a Service\" (SaaS) refers to a cloud computing model where software applications are hosted on remote servers and made available to users over the internet. In this model, users can access and use the software via a web browser or thin client without needing to install the application locally on their devices.\n\nWhen an application is deployed as a SaaS solution, it is installed and maintained on servers centrally managed by the service provider. Multiple users can then access and use the application simultaneously, each with their own unique user accounts and data, without the need for individual installations on their devices. This centralized approach to software deployment and access enables efficient sharing and collaboration among users while minimizing the overhead associated with local installations and maintenance.","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1717754700.0","comment_id":"1226038","poster":"kamac1"},{"comment_id":"1413542","poster":"Isuckatexams","timestamp":"1743353460.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nClient virtualization involves hosting an application on a server, enabling multiple users to access and run the application concurrently without the need to install it locally on their devices.
