The thin client computer need only be powerful enough to display the screen image, play audio, and transfer mouse, key commands and video, and audio information over the network.\n\nThey are better locked against unsecure user practices because any changes to the VM can easily be overwritten from the template image. With VDI, it is also easier for a company to completely offload their IT infrastructure to a third-party services company.”","timestamp":"1681589280.0","comment_id":"695693","poster":"NotAHackerJustYet","upvote_count":"26"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)\n\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a technology that provides remote access to a virtualized desktop environment that runs on a centralized server. With VDI, the company can provide third-party developers with access to a desktop environment that the company controls, while keeping the data and applications on the corporate network secure. This solution allows the company to monitor and control the desktop environments used by third-party developers, ensuring that only approved applications and data are used. A sandbox (Option A) is a separate environment used for testing and development, but does not provide remote access to a desktop environment. A private cloud (Option C) provides access to centralized resources, but does not necessarily provide remote access to a desktop environment. Software as a Service (Option D) provides access to cloud-based applications, but does not provide remote access to a desktop environment.","comment_id":"800988","timestamp":"1691411220.0","upvote_count":"8","poster":"freeman016"},{"timestamp":"1725718620.0","poster":"lara400","content":"Virtual Desktop Infastructure create avirtual desktop on central server and remote user can acces this desktop fromany physical machine over the internet .","comment_id":"1168163","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Chavozamiri","timestamp":"1713481560.0","comment_id":"1047312","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
