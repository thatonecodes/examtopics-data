By identifying any recent changes, the administrator can narrow down potential causes and focus troubleshooting efforts more effectively.\n\nThis step involves asking questions and gathering information from users or other team members to understand if any modifications or updates have been made to the network infrastructure, server configuration, or client devices that could be contributing to the performance issues.\n\nOnce the administrator determines if anything has changed, they can proceed with establishing a theory of probable cause and implementing a fix or workaround to address the performance issues if necessary.\n\nTherefore, B. Determine if anything has changed is the correct next step in the network troubleshooting methodology in this scenario.","comments":[{"content":"Correct!","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723421580.0","comment_id":"1147788","poster":"Popeyes_Chicken"}],"poster":"Babatundeio","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1145962"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nDetermine if anything has changed is part of Step 1 which is where you would start when you first receive a report of a symptom such as slowness.","timestamp":"1722955800.0","poster":"Pisces225","comment_id":"1142382","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_id":646,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/133077-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-680-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Determine if anything has changed.","D":"Document all findings, actions, and lessons learned.","A":"Implement a fix to resolve the connectivity issues.","C":"Establish a theory of probable cause."},"unix_timestamp":1707238200,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"KC1kLlJKM1fnFnCnbuUQ","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/133078-exam-n10-008-topic-1-question-681-discussion/","exam_id":357,"timestamp":"2024-02-06 17:52:00","answer":"D","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
