When you enable EFS on a folder, the files within that folder are encrypted using a unique key tied to the user's account. This means that only the user who encrypted the files (or users with appropriate permissions) can access them. EFS is a good choice if you want to protect specific files or folders on a Windows system without encrypting the entire drive.\n\nBitLocker, on the other hand, is primarily used for full-disk encryption. When enabled, it encrypts the entire drive, including all files and folders on it. While BitLocker can encrypt individual folders as well, it is more commonly used to encrypt the entire system drive or additional data drives. BitLocker is useful when you want to protect all the data on a drive and ensure that it remains encrypted even if it is removed from the computer.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"956862","timestamp":"1705692660.0"}],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","answer_images":[]},{"id":"OQEKz7Wc4LRzWG0ADPIe","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/117687-exam-220-1102-topic-1-question-294-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1691602620,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","question_id":217,"discussion":[{"content":"A workgroup network is the most suitable choice for a small office with three PCs and no central server.
