When a port reaches its maximum number of allowed MAC addresses, it will prevent any further connections to that port.

This feature is meant to provide path diversity within an autonomous system (AS), within a single cluster only. That is, a route reflector is allowed to advertise the diverse path to its client peers only.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/xe-16/irg-xe-16-book/irg-diverse-path.html#:~:text=A%20diverse%20path%20can%20be%20configured%20on%20a,an%20AS%2C%20within%20a%20single%20route%20reflector%20cluster.","timestamp":"1701134760.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"geocis","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"do a quick control F on the exam obj. and you will find both actually.","poster":"e5c1bb5","comment_id":"1162784","timestamp":"1709223360.0"}],"timestamp":"1697933460.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSo here's my issue with selecting ( A ) as my answer.

A good example of this is to have multiple internet service providers in and out of the data center. This way, if you lose connectivity to one ISP, you can use the redundant or diverse path to the secondary ISP to maintain your uptime. As you can imagine, this involves more than simply installing a separate network connection. We have to consider the dynamic routing protocols that are in place.\n----------\nSo Diverse paths would be correct if there were MULTIPLE ISPs, but this questions clearly states its the SAME ISP","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"851992","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1679912820.0"},{"timestamp":"1679634180.0","comment_id":"848975","poster":"StellarSteve","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Diverse paths is the BEST description of this configuration.\n\nDiverse paths, also known as path diversity, refers to the use of multiple network paths to ensure redundancy and high availability in case of network failures or outages. In this scenario, the company has set up a secondary connection to the same ISP to provide an alternate path for traffic when the primary connection fails. This allows the traffic to continue to flow without interruption, minimizing downtime and maximizing network uptime.","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Jakub2023","comment_id":"842213","timestamp":"1679078100.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSee Leonard Snart's explanation.

This can be achieved through the use of multiple physical links, different routing paths, or different physical locations.\n\nMultipathing refers to the use of multiple parallel paths to a destination and the ability to balance traffic over these paths. The goal of multipathing is to improve network availability and increase network performance by allowing multiple routes to be used simultaneously.\n\nIn this scenario, the network administrator noticed that traffic was continuing to flow through a secondary connection to the same ISP, indicating that there is more than one path to the same destination and that traffic is being balanced over these paths.
