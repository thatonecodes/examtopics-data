Yellow\n\nExplanation:\nThe Yellow Team is a relatively newer concept in cybersecurity testing that combines both defensive (Blue Team) and offensive (Red Team) methodologies. This team works with developers to securely build key applications and software by integrating security practices throughout the development lifecycle, also known as Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Their focus is on proactively addressing vulnerabilities while also testing the application for security flaws from an attacker's perspective.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nC.
