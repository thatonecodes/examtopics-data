IBGP is the internal border gateway protocol\n- The static null0 route is used to redirect the traffic from the DDoS attack and effectively drops the traffic before it reaches the internal network.\n- the internal network can remain functional, even while the external network connection is being bogged down by this DDoS attack that's underway.\n - this mitigates the damage it can perform and can allow the network administrator's time to reroute the internal network traffic out through a different wide area network connection, if one's available.","poster":"quagga","comment_id":"484632","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1622392260.0","content":"Maybe: D.

I think we have to assume unknown, because even if the attacking hosts are known, it's easy to attack from another host. Since the server is available to the internet, I assume the server must be open to unknown hosts. If the server only needs to be accessed from a limited number of known hosts, that could be accomplished by setting up a local firewall.","poster":"D1960","timestamp":"1618592580.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"337159"},{"timestamp":"1613999220.0","content":"I guess it has to be C since that's the only answer dealing with BGP route advertisement, but there are just... so many problems with C as an answer.","comment_id":"296666","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1618592520.0","poster":"D1960","content":"Answer A could possibly be said to deal BGP route advertisements.

Use the route protection offered by the ISP to accept only BGP routes from trusted hosts on the Internet, which will discard traffic from attacking hosts?\nThis is the only answer that mentions BGP. Considering that BGP was mentioned in the question, I suspect that CompTIA is looking for that in the answer. Also, notice that answer A will also discard traffic from attacking hosts.\nThat said, it could be a red herring. \nI am not sure if there is enough information given to confidently chose any of the options. \nFor example, with answer 'A', is it acceptable to only accept traffic from known trusted hosts? Can the server do it's job without accepting traffic from unknown hosts? \nAs to the supposedly correct answer: C. Advertise a /32 route to the ISP to initiate a remotely triggered black hole, which will discard traffic destined to the problem server at the upstream provider. \nWill this discard all traffic to the problem server? Or will it only discard traffic from one particular server? Either way the answer does not seem to make sense. If we know the one host sending problem traffic, just block that host. If we want to stop all traffic, just disconnect the problem host.","comment_id":"295904","timestamp":"1613926920.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1613926920,"isMC":true,"exam_id":342,"timestamp":"2021-02-21 18:02:00","choices":{"C":"Advertise a /32 route to the ISP to initiate a remotely triggered black hole, which will discard traffic destined to the problem server at the upstream provider.","B":"Work with the ISP and subscribe to an IPS filter that can recognize the attack patterns of the attacking hosts, and block those hosts at the local IPS device.","D":"Add a redundant connection to a second local ISP, so a redundant connection is available for use if the server is being attacked on one connection.","A":"Use the route protection offered by the ISP to accept only BGP routes from trusted hosts on the Internet, which will discard traffic from attacking hosts."},"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"A network administrator is concerned about a particular server that is attacked occasionally from hosts on the Internet.
