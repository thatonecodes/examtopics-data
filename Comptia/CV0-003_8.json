Move the virtual machine to flash storage and test again.\nExplanation:\n\nIf a performance issue has been identified as disk related and the cause is determined to be a lack of IOPS on the existing spinning disk storage, the next step to resolve the issue should be to move the virtual machine to flash storage and test again. Flash storage is known to have a much higher IOPS capacity than spinning disk storage, which should help to resolve the performance issue. Upgrading the virtual database server or checking if other machines on the same storage are having issues may not necessarily resolve the disk-related performance issue.
