Two pairs are used to transmit the signal and two to receive. The cables are fitted with RJ45 connectors. The pairs must be connected in accordance with either the T568A or T568B standard, although most installations use T568B.\n\nIn order to reduce the amount of crosstalk between adjacent pairs, each pair has a different number of twists per inch. Apart from that, it’s essential to use good quality cable that complies with industry standards.\n\nAlthough not originally intended for 1Gb Ethernet, Cat 5 cable does usually perform well enough for 1 Gbps operation. Also note that some Cat 5 cables have only 4 wires (2 pairs).\n\nA better to use Cat 5e cable, which is specifically designed for high-speed Ethernet, or Cat 6 cable. Careful attention must be paid to ensure there are no split pairs, that all connections are to specification, and that the cable is not kinked. It’s also essential that the length of each patch cable doesn’t exceed 100 meters (328 feet).","poster":"ronah"},{"comment_id":"443281","timestamp":"1631422560.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1643467320.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"535519","content":"Cat5e supports 1GB, not cat5.","poster":"rva555"}],"poster":"ssamny","content":"According to Professor messer, Cat5 supports 1Gb.
