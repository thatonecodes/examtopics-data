System logs are a critical part of system administration, as they provide valuable information about the performance and operation of a system. However, system logs can quickly become large and unwieldy, leading to disk space and performance issues.\n\nThe logrotate command addresses this problem by automatically rotating system logs on a regular basis. This means that older logs are compressed and archived, and the current logs are truncated. This helps to conserve disk space and prevent logs from consuming too much disk space.\n\nlogrotate can be configured to perform a variety of tasks, including rotating logs daily, weekly, or monthly; compressing rotated logs using gzip, bzip2, or other compression algorithms; mailing rotated logs to specified recipients; and preserving specified numbers of old logs for historical reference. The logrotate command is typically executed by a cron job or run by a script as part of a system's boot process.","timestamp":"1676045040.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"linux_admin","comment_id":"804541"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","topic":"4","answer_images":[],"choices":{"E":"logger","A":"rotatelog","B":"striplog","C":"syslogd --rotate","D":"logrotate"}}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"name":"LX0-104","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":99,"provider":"Comptia","isBeta":false,"id":354},"currentPage":9},"__N_SSP":true}
