The median represents the middle value of a data set when the data is sorted in ascending or descending order. It is less sensitive to outliers and provides a better representation of typical values compared to the mean, which is affected by outliers. The mode represents the most frequently occurring value in a data set, but it may not provide a good representation of typical values.
