ESD-safe vacuum\n\nWhen toner spills inside a printer, it's crucial to clean it up properly to prevent damage to the printer and ensure proper functioning. An ESD-safe vacuum is the best option for cleaning up toner spills because it's specifically designed to safely remove toner particles without generating static electricity that could damage sensitive printer components.
