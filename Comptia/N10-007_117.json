The attack works as follows:\n\nThe attacker must have access to the network. They scan the network to determine the IP addresses of at least two devices⁠—let’s say these are a workstation and a router. \nThe attacker uses a spoofing tool, such as Arpspoof or Driftnet, to send out forged ARP responses. \nThe forged responses advertise that the correct MAC address for both IP addresses, belonging to the router and workstation, is the attacker’s MAC address. This fools both router and workstation to connect to the attacker’s machine, instead of to each other.\nThe two devices update their ARP cache entries and from that point onwards, communicate with the attacker instead of directly with each other.\nThe attacker is now secretly in the middle of all communications.","timestamp":"1606664700.0","upvote_count":"22"},{"content":"ARP spoofing is a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack in which the attacker (hacker) sends forged ARP Messages.
