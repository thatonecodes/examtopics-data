Disaster recovery requires considerable resources, sush as SHIFTING PROCESSING TO A SECONDARY SITE. Disaster recovery will involve a wider range of stakeholders than a less serious incidents.\nBusiness Continuity Plan (BCB) -- this identifies how business processes should deal with both minor and disaster-level disruption. During an incident, a system may need to be isolated. Continuity planing ensures that there is processing redundancy supporting the workflow so that when a server is taken offline for security remediation, processing can failover to a separate system. If systems do not have this sort of planned resilience, incident response will be much more disruptive.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"DoDaResearch","comments":[{"comment_id":"712718","poster":"DoDaResearch","upvote_count":"1","content":"Not all disasters are natural, if a fire marshal closes your building for various reasons that may not even be related to your building, you still can not enter","timestamp":"1667779740.0"}],"comment_id":"712466","timestamp":"1667751840.0"},{"comment_id":"672769","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1663539900.0","content":"Remember that BCP is all-encompassing, including natural disaster recovery.
