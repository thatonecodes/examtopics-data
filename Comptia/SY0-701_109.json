EDR solutions like CrowdStrike do not provide direct link click-through protection. I’d like to better understand how modifying an EDR policy would prevent users from clicking on a phishing link without outright blocking all links they attempt to open.\n\nA Secure Email Gateway (SEG) / Email Security Gateway (ESG) is responsible for filtering malicious emails containing phishing URLs or attachments. Click-through protection is a key feature of ESGs like Proofpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, and Mimecast. Admins can adjust filtering aggressiveness, and in this case, it’s likely that the current settings were too lenient, allowing phishing emails through.\n\nThe best course of action is to modify ESG security filters to prevent these emails from reaching users. Ideally, this would be complemented by reviewing and enhancing security awareness training to reinforce phishing detection skills.","poster":"tsummey","comment_id":"1359213","timestamp":"1740051600.0"},{"timestamp":"1734537540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Exam_Prep221","comment_id":"1328608","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThey are talking about analyst \n\nSo it'll be EDR"},{"comment_id":"1328050","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC because Question is about when a user clicks on a link in a phishing message","timestamp":"1734454800.0","poster":"darpanne"},{"comment_id":"1317997","poster":"Spoudel001","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBy implementing advanced email security filters, the organization can significantly reduce the likelihood of phishing emails reaching employees in the first place.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732614000.0"},{"poster":"Bito808","upvote_count":"1","content":"Blocking automatic execution does not block all Phishing emails.
