Vulnerability scans are designed to detect known vulnerabilities, and the true positive rate of findings is increased, not reduced, by running a scan on a hybrid network.\n\nD. will create a denial-of-service condition on the IP networks - Incorrect. While running a vulnerability scan may create a large amount of traffic on the network, it will not create a denial-of-service condition. A denial-of-service condition is caused by malicious actors sending large amounts of traffic or malicious requests to a network or system with the intent of overwhelming it and preventing legitimate requests from being processed."},{"comment_id":"951402","timestamp":"1720948620.0","poster":"bieecop","content":"Selected Answer: B\nVulnerability scanners are designed to identify weaknesses and security flaws in networked systems.
