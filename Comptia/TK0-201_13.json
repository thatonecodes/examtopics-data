The instructor has failed to demonstrate proper use of non-verbal communication. The constant pacing and noise-making with a set of keys can be distracting to the students and may prevent them from fully engaging with the content being presented. Proper use of non-verbal communication involves being aware of one's body language, gestures, and tone of voice and using them effectively to enhance the message being communicated. In this case, the instructor's non-verbal communication is hindering rather than enhancing the learning experience.","timestamp":"1712133180.0"}],"question_id":61,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-04-03 10:33:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":369,"topic":"3","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/104949-exam-tk0-201-topic-3-question-13-discussion/","question_text":"During a lecture an instructor constantly paces about the room making noise with a set of keys.

This will help ensure that learners are not bored or overwhelmed with material that they already know or that is too advanced for them.\n\nOption A may not be the best option as proceeding with the course at a beginner level could be too basic for some learners, who may become disengaged and uninterested.
