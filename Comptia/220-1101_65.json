Heating element.\n \nA 3in (2.5cm) point-of-sale printer is a type of thermal printer that uses heat to print receipts on special thermal paper. The printer has a heating element that heats up the paper as it passes through the rollers, creating black marks on the paper where the heat is applied.

If DNS is not functioning correctly, clients will be unable to access resources using hostname or fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This can also lead to issues with pinging network resources by name.\n\nDHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is responsible for automatically assigning IP addresses to network clients, so it can be checked next after DNS. AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) is used for network security purposes and is less likely to be the cause of network connectivity issues.
