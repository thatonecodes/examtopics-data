This scenario is more focused on physical actions than managerial oversight.\n\nC) Technical: Technical controls involve systems and software (e.g., firewalls, encryption) that secure data and systems electronically. The scenario here involves people and physical infrastructure, not technology.\n\nD) Operational: Operational controls are implemented by people in their day-to-day activities, such as security training or incident response. While the scenario involves operational tasks, the primary focus is on physical security measures.\n\nIn summary, physical controls like ID checks and vestibules are examples of barriers to control access to secure areas, making A) Physical the best choice.","poster":"d4a5620","comment_id":"1280106"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1222011","timestamp":"1717141620.0","content":"A.

Using least privilege: This is important but doesn't address the issue if the default password is still in use.\nC.

Changing the default password\n\nHere’s why:\n\n- Changing the default password: Many VPN appliances come with default usernames and passwords. If these are not changed, anyone with knowledge of the default credentials (which are often easily found online) can gain access to the appliance. Changing the default password to something strong and unique would make it much more difficult for unauthorized users to log in.\n\n- A. Using least privilege: While this is a good security practice, it typically refers to ensuring users have only the minimum level of access needed to perform their tasks. In the case of an administrator account being used, the issue is more likely related to the strength of the password rather than inappropriate access rights being assigned.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1732002540.0","comment_id":"1314503","upvote_count":"1","content":"I will go for C, this will help to track the exact user that logged in","poster":"9ef4a35"},{"poster":"KelvinYau","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1306803","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNowadays, there are not much systems that allow you to log in with a default password.

Failure to change these passwords leaves systems vulnerable to unauthorized access.
