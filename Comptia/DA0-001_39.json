A column chart would show which site has the highest average. There's no additional dimensionality that would necessitate a scatter chart. Moreover, the outliers for site B1 would make a scatter plot difficult to read. I first checked ChatGPT, it agreed with me. Then, I built the table myself and played with building the charts in Excel. A column chart is far easier to read and correctly shows that B1 has the highest sales average per customer.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Norm141"},{"content":"C. A scatter chart would allow you to visualize the relationship between sales volume and average sales per customer for each site. Each point on the scatter chart would represent a site, with the x-axis representing sales volume and the y-axis representing average sales per customer. This chart type is effective for identifying patterns and outliers in the data and can help determine which site is providing the highest sales volume per customer.","comment_id":"1196270","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713228000.0","poster":"Swift_and_Quick"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":351,"timestamp":"2024-04-16 02:40:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Include a line chart using the site and average sales per customer.","B":"Include a pie chart using the site and sales to average sales per customer.","C":"Include a scatter chart using sales volume and average sales per customer.","D":"Include a column chart using the site and sales to average sales per customer."}},{"id":"zZQw4xCvRejPRolJcKdf","answer":"A","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729039560.0","poster":"Swift_and_Quick","comment_id":"1196273","content":"A. Exploratory analysis helps in understanding the basic structure of the data, identifying patterns, detecting outliers, and gaining insights into its distribution. Descriptive statistics provide summary measures that describe the main features of the dataset, such as mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation.

The common column used for joining is \"Customer ID\". In this case, there are 6 customers with matching Customer IDs in both the Customer Table and In-store Transactions table, so the number of rows after performing an INNER JOIN would be 6.\n\nLEFT JOIN: A LEFT JOIN returns all the rows from the left table (Customer Table), and the matching rows from the right table (In-store Transactions). If there is no match, NULL values will be displayed in the right table columns. In this case, there are 9 customers in the Customer Table, but only 6 have matching Customer IDs in the In-store Transactions table, so there would be 9 rows after performing a LEFT JOIN.","poster":"ronniehaang","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"802224"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Use scheduled report delivery.\n\nScheduled report delivery allows you to set up automated delivery of the report at specified intervals, such as weekly in this case. This method ensures that the report is delivered consistently and reliably without manual intervention.
