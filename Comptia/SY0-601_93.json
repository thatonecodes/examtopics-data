In this scenario, the badge readers are meant to control building access, but unauthorized individuals are gaining access by simply following authorized employees who use their badges to open doors. This practice compromises the security of the building and allows unauthorized people to roam the hallways. To prevent tailgating, employees should be trained to be vigilant about not allowing unauthorized individuals to follow them through access-controlled doors.

Since the traffic is encrypted, the DLP (Data Loss Prevention) appliance will not be able to inspect the content of the data packets passing through the VPN tunnel. This lack of inspection can potentially allow malicious or unauthorized data to be transmitted without detection.\n\nTo enhance security, it is essential to implement a solution that allows for the inspection of encrypted VPN traffic. One approach is to deploy a next-generation firewall (NGFW) with SSL/TLS decryption capabilities. The NGFW can decrypt the VPN traffic, inspect it for potential threats or sensitive data, and then re-encrypt it before sending it to its destination. By doing so, the organization can maintain security while still enabling remote users to access corporate resources through the VPN.","upvote_count":"21"},{"poster":"Paula77","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhen users connect via split-tunnel VPNs, their internet-bound traffic doesn’t pass through the corporate data center. As a result:\nThe DLP appliance does not inspect internet-bound traffic.\nThe firewall at the internet border does not filter this traffic.\nWhile this design optimizes internet performance for users, it weakens security.\nThe DLP appliance’s effectiveness relies on inspecting all traffic, including internet-bound data. By excluding this traffic, the organization risks data leakage or policy violations.","comment_id":"1163679","timestamp":"1709317920.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702598520.0","comment_id":"1096922","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

The DLP appliance should be integrated into an NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall).\n\nIntegrating the DLP appliance into a NGFW would enhance the overall security posture. A NGFW combines traditional firewall functionality with advanced security features such as intrusion prevention, application awareness, and content filtering. This integration would allow for more effective handling of data loss prevention and security monitoring.\n\nOption C (Encrypted VPN traffic not being inspected) is indeed a concern, but it's a limitation imposed by the necessity of maintaining the security and privacy of VPN traffic, rather than a design choice.","timestamp":"1693069560.0","comment_id":"990965","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1694661360.0","poster":"Kingbumi777","content":"DLP cannot read VPN encrypted data.","comment_id":"1007137"}],"poster":"CS3000"},{"poster":"Gamsje","upvote_count":"3","content":"Can anyone explain all options ?","comment_id":"954928","timestamp":"1689653700.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nDLP won't be able to inspect data that is passing through a VPN","timestamp":"1689073620.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"948912","poster":"mtnews"}]},{"id":"IGcKcJsonnBZzDcMSL4h","timestamp":"2023-07-19 11:58:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"964066","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDigital certificates are the best method for ensuring non-repudiation. A digital certificate is an electronic credential that binds an entity's identity to a public key. It is issued by a trusted third party known as a Certificate Authority (CA). When a user digitally signs a message or document using their private key, the recipient can verify the signature using the corresponding public key from the user's digital certificate. This process provides assurance that the sender of the message cannot later deny having sent it, thus ensuring non-repudiation.","poster":"ApplebeesWaiter1122","timestamp":"1690393860.0"},{"timestamp":"1714822800.0","poster":"shady23","comment_id":"1206482","upvote_count":"1","content":"B.
