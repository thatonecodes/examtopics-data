But they don't even try to understand WHAT the question is asking for. Here we are looking for something that allows to perform a post-incident REVIEW: that means something that allows to understand when, where, how and why the incident occurred.\nWhat's a corrective control? Gibson's guide defines a corrective control as something that \"attempt to reverse the impact of an incident\"; an example given is Backups. Now, how can I accomplish a post-incident REVIEW using backups??? Instead, MOST of DETECTIVE controls are monitoring devices that are able to RECORD details of activities on systems and networks: logs from IDS or video-tapes from a close-circuit video surveillance system are examples of something that can provide useful infos about HOW the incident occurred allowing for a post-incident REVIEW.","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"136795","timestamp":"1594941540.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"118609","content":"post incident= corrective","timestamp":"1593017760.0","poster":"M31"},{"timestamp":"1587050040.0","poster":"joe91","upvote_count":"5","content":"Detective control is one such as alerts and logs\nCorrective is after the event\n\nNone other than corrective fits this question","comment_id":"75359"},{"content":"The correct answer is detective 100%. No actions were taken to fix the problem. A review does not implement any type of solution; instead, a review detects what has happened. Corrective actions do occur post-incident, but there MUST be a corrective action that occurs for it to be considered corrective.
