As the PM, you can inform Stakeholders all you want, but you're in charge of the Project Teams and therefore need to resolve this through proper procedures with them. You can't expect Stakeholders to stop asking for things, whether or not they've been informed that's not the proper procedure. You can prevent your own teams from accepting this work, by enacting Change Control \"Management\".\n\nI do think it would be beneficial to inform Stakeholders of the issue, to try to prevent these requests in the future, but CompTIA is definitely looking for the \"book\" answer here.
