SQL injection\n\nSQL injection is a type of attack that involves inserting malicious SQL statements into an input field. These statements can then be executed by the database, allowing the attacker to view or manipulate the data. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, or even the modification and deletion of data.\n\nHere’s why the other options are not correct in this context:\n\n- A. \nThis involves injecting malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users, but it does not specifically involve running commands that directly view or manipulate data in a database.\n \n- B\nThis typically refers to installing applications from unofficial sources, not related to input fields and running commands.\n \n-C. \nThis involves exploiting a program by writing more data to a buffer than it can hold, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code, but it does not specifically use input fields to run commands on data.","poster":"Etc_Shadow28000","upvote_count":"24","comments":[{"poster":"aws_guru1","comment_id":"1288820","content":"Thanks for the detailed analysis!","timestamp":"1727220900.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"1727928480.0"},{"upvote_count":"14","poster":"metzen227","content":"SQL injection: SQL injection involves inserting malicious SQL queries into input fields or other user-controllable data sources to manipulate the database backend. By exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands that can view, modify, or delete data stored in the database. This technique directly enables the use of an input field to run commands that manipulate data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is SQL injection. It allows attackers to execute commands through input fields to manipulate data within a database.","comment_id":"1208573","timestamp":"1715206380.0"},{"comment_id":"1401289","content":"Selected Answer: D\nEven though I believe the answer is D (SQLi) I still think A (XSS) is a valid answer. The question does not specify whether \"data\" refers specifically to application data or database data. If the question explicitly mentioned \"database data,\" then SQL Injection (D) would be 100% correct.\n\nWhy can it be A then? When an XSS script runs, it can view, modify, or exfiltrate data. A simple example would be grabbing and replacing cookies, which requires the ability to view and manipulate data. XSS can also exhibit CSRF-like behavior, as it can steal a session and use it to interact with APIs as if it were the victim, which also requires viewing and manipulating data.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"shootweb","timestamp":"1742498640.0"},{"poster":"PAWarriors","timestamp":"1724104260.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect answer is D (SQL injection). \n\n> SQL injection Involves inserting malicious SQL code into input fields.","comment_id":"1268945","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2024-05-09 00:13:00","question_id":256,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","exam_id":368,"unix_timestamp":1715206380,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Buffer overflow","D":"SQL injection","B":"Side loading","A":"Cross-site scripting"},"question_images":[]},{"id":"82iPc7dW3bKNyYTQcaL5","answer":"A","choices":{"D":"Firewall logs","B":"Vulnerability scanner logs","C":"IDS/IPS logs","A":"Application logs"},"question_text":"An employee used a company’s billing system to issue fraudulent checks.
