The naming strategy should allow administrators to identify the type and function of any particular resource or location at any point in the directory information tree.\n\nUsing Active Directory as an example, one of the first decisions is to determine how your AD namespace will integrate with your public DNS records. For example, you may make the AD namespace a delegated subdomain of your public DNS domain name (for example, ad.widget.com). This solution isolates AD from the public Internet and means that the DNS servers supporting the public domain name (widget.com) do not need to support Active Directory.\nUser account names are usually either based on the firstname.lastname format (bob.dobbs), or a combination of first or first and second initial with lastname (jrdobbs). Accounts should be named in a consistent manner. This helps facilitate management of accounts, especially through scripting and command-line usage. You should also refrain from naming accounts based on nicknames or common words so as not to anonymize users.","poster":"Dion79","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1623606480.0","comment_id":"381249"},{"content":"C is more right than the others.
