It involves continually analyzing instance performance and usage needs and patterns—and then turning off idle instances and right sizing instances that are either overprovisioned or poorly matched to the workload.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/right-sizing/"},{"poster":"SophyQueenCR82","content":"he correct answer is C. Right-sizing.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • Right-sizing refers to the process of adjusting the resources allocated to a system or application to match the actual workload demands. This involves decreasing or increasing resources to ensure that you’re not over-provisioning (which would result in paying for unused capacity) or under-provisioning (which could lead to performance issues).","timestamp":"1724077140.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1268769"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718737680.0","poster":"BlueMan93","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAuto-scaling differs from right-sizing. Auto-scaling is a dynamic process that\noperates within defined performance thresholds. Right-sizing is a manual\nprocess that more closely aligns a virtual machine instance’s specifications to\nits workload.","comment_id":"1232576"},{"poster":"Bluebird33","timestamp":"1710684180.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRight-sizing involves adjusting the resources allocated to a system or application to match its actual usage needs. By rightsizing, organizations can optimize their resource allocation and avoid over-provisioning, which leads to paying for unused capacity. This optimization ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, balancing performance requirements with cost considerations.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1175869"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1016212","timestamp":"1695595440.0","poster":"techcreators","upvote_count":"1","content":"Which book is this?"}],"comment_id":"711449","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAuto-scaling fits best, according to the cloud essentials book:\nRight-sizing is the process of evaluating current on-premises servers for need and sizing before moving to the cloud. \nAutoscaling is sizing resources in the cloud.","timestamp":"1667605800.0","poster":"macxsz"}],"unix_timestamp":1583912460,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-03-11 08:41:00","answers_community":["B (60%)","C (40%)"],"choices":{"B":"Auto-scaling","C":"Right-sizing","D":"Scalability","A":"Orchestration"},"question_id":51,"isMC":true,"exam_id":344,"answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"ymtPkW7YWiLk0vV4Pdwu","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Configure geo-redundancy.","D":"Configure auto-scaling.","B":"Configure high availability.","A":"Configure availability zones."},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","poster":"JD_TDG","content":"This problem is poorly formulated.

Sufficient for DR purposes – Both employ replication that INFORMALLY provides a basis for DR, however, this raises a huge best-practice caution: operational replication is NOT a substitute for backups! By current best-practice DR planning, we would restore from a valid, verified backup.\n2. Effective for “natural disaster” events – GR’s wider geographic replication is superior to AZ’s replication among geographically “close” data centers. Indeed, where a single natural disaster incapacitates an entire AZ, a GR configured service may not even experience downtime!\n3. Effective in achieving low RTO (i.e., “little to no downtime”) – AZ’s performance advantage over GR is lower latency for synchronous (vs. asynchronous) replication. However, this is an operational advantage. Per #1, we would restore from the most recent validated and verified backup(s).
