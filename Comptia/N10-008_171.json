Control layer\n\nIn a software-defined network (SDN), the control layer is responsible for managing and directing network traffic and ensuring that instructions from the application layer are properly translated and implemented by the infrastructure layer. If there's an issue with the application's instructions not being properly translated, it is most likely related to the control layer's function. The infrastructure layer refers to the physical network components, the session layer deals with session management, and the application layer is concerned with end-user applications.","comment_id":"1281096"}],"timestamp":"2024-09-09 18:38:00","answer_description":"","question_id":851},{"id":"KWW0UiKo15Qlguxx1KiY","question_id":852,"answer":"B","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"a87d6a4","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

A router can perform PAT, but a Layer 3 switch cannot.\n\nPort Address Translation (PAT) is a form of Network Address Translation (NAT) that allows multiple devices on a local network to be mapped to a single public IP address. Routers typically perform this function to enable multiple devices to share a single public IP address for internet access. While some advanced Layer 3 switches may support limited NAT features, they generally do not perform PAT as routers do."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725900060.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. A Layer 3 switch is more efficient than a router.\n\nA major difference between a router and a Layer 3 switch is that Layer 3 switches are generally more efficient than routers for performing routing tasks within a LAN. They are optimized for high-speed packet forwarding and are typically used in environments where high performance is required. Routers, on the other hand, are designed for more complex routing tasks and often operate at lower speeds compared to Layer 3 switches. The other options are not accurate: both devices can perform PAT, routers generally have a wider range of routing protocols, and Layer 3 switches do not inherently have faster interfaces compared to routers.","comment_id":"1281099","poster":"a87d6a4"},{"timestamp":"1725362220.0","comment_id":"1277512","content":"Selected Answer: B\ngpt says the correct answer is B","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Cloud1128"}],"exam_id":357,"question_id":853,"question_text":"Winch of the following is a major difference between a router and a Layer 3 switch?","answers_community":["A (70%)","B (30%)"]},{"id":"8gOH89wLei82F9zvEKZX","exam_id":357,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1733847540.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAn NDA is a legal contract that ensures employees do not disclose confidential information or trade secrets to unauthorized parties.

Rogue DHCP server\n\nThe user has most likely introduced a rogue DHCP server into the network. Personal routers often come with their own DHCP servers that automatically assign IP addresses to connected devices. If the user’s router is not properly configured or is conflicting with the network’s primary DHCP server, it can cause IP address conflicts and connectivity issues. The other options—broadcast storms, collisions, and DNS poisoning—are less directly related to the introduction of a personal router and switch.","comment_id":"1281102","poster":"a87d6a4","timestamp":"1725900120.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"2024-09-09 18:42:00"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":877,"isBeta":false,"id":357,"name":"N10-008","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Comptia","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":171},"__N_SSP":true}
