Configuring jumbo frames ensures that the tool can handle and process larger payloads effectively.\n\nA. LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol): LACP is used to combine multiple physical network connections into a single logical link to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy, but it does not address payload size.\n\nB. Flow control: Flow control manages the rate of data transmission to prevent network congestion and data loss but does not impact the size of the payload that can be handled.\n\nC. Port mirroring: Port mirroring copies traffic from one port to another for monitoring and analysis purposes but does not affect the configuration of frame sizes or payload capacities."}],"answer":"D","answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1717816140},{"id":"OTafZLDGnhshBkntgLy4","question_id":812,"timestamp":"2022-01-27 04:11:00","question_text":"Which of the following would need to be configured to ensure a device with a specific MAC address is always assigned the same IP address from DHCP?","exam_id":357,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1643253060,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1645120620.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIP reservation assigns the same IP upon requesting IP renewal by a client.","comment_id":"549590","upvote_count":"11","poster":"waqdhiyo"},{"comment_id":"533461","upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1643253060.0","poster":"Pongsathorn","content":"Perhaps you have noticed that DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses and subnet masks to clients, but they need more IP addressing information than\nthat in order to communicate properly on the network. For example, clients need DNS server addresses, they need a default gateway assigned, and they might even need the IP addresses associated with other key services, such as NTP and TFTP servers on the network. Your DHCP server can provide\nall this required IP addressing information. You enable this as part of the scope options you can configure on the DHCP server. The scope is the\naddresses that your DHCP server will lease out to clients.
