Redundant power\nFault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue operating despite hardware or software failures. Redundant power, such as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) or backup generators, ensures that a system remains operational even if the primary power source fails.\n\nA. Data restoration and D. Restoring access are related to recovery after a failure, not fault tolerance.\nC.

Portability\nFlat files are simple text-based files that store data in a plain format, usually separated by delimiters like commas or tabs (e.g., CSV files). One of their main advantages is portability, as they can be easily transferred between different systems without requiring specialized database software.\n\nA. Variety of data – Flat files store structured data but do not support complex relationships like relational databases.\nB. Scalability – Flat files are not efficient for large datasets or complex queries, making them less scalable.\nD.
