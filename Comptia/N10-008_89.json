Implementing a screened subnet\n\nImplementing a screened subnet, also known as a \"DMZ\" (Demilitarized Zone), involves creating a separate network segment that acts as an intermediary zone between the internal network and the external (Internet-facing) network. Internet-facing hosts are placed in the DMZ, providing controlled access to services like web servers or email servers, while keeping them separate from the internal LAN and critical server IP ranges. This helps mitigate the risk of external attacks directly affecting internal systems.\n\nThe other options do not directly address the requirement of partitioning off internet-facing hosts","comment_id":"992174","poster":"Hchfyvggjg","upvote_count":"5"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1720920180.0","content":"It is A","poster":"S5Networking","comment_id":"951129"}],"question_id":441,"exam_id":357,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"D":"Enforcing a Zero Trust model","A":"Implementing a screened subnet","B":"Deploying a honeypot","C":"Utilizing network access control"},"answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_text":"An engineer is designing a network topology for a company that maintains a large on-premises private cloud.
