For example, if the project scope is increased, this may have an impact on the schedule and budget, as more work will need to be completed within the same time frame and budget.\n\nIn this scenario, the project is ahead of schedule and under budget, but additional time is needed to improve the quality to acceptable levels. While the quality constraint may be interacting with the schedule and budget constraints, the team is not adjusting the priorities of the constraints in order to achieve the project objectives. Instead, the team is requesting a change to the project plan in order to allocate additional time for quality improvement, which would be considered a change request.","timestamp":"1673208960.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kmanb"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWe're going to reprioritize quality","poster":"Manzer","comment_id":"674907","timestamp":"1663747800.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"An example of interaction between constraints may occur when you have changes to scope that in turn impact the schedule and/or budget. Scope can change through the formal change control process or through scope creep. Perhaps your project sponsor has decided you need one more deliverable in order to satisfy the overall goals and objectives of the project. This is approved in a formal change request process. However, scope changes require schedule changes, and they often require budget changes as well. The interaction here is like a domino effect, and all the constraints should be reexamined to ensure that they still accurately reflect the conditions of the project."},{"id":"ur1a76N07BcHWmyDlmRK","discussion":[{"comment_id":"769810","timestamp":"1673209260.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nRFQ just includes the cost estimate.
