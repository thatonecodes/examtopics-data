However, I take it he's an employee of a company. I don't see why the computer name would have to be updated on an inventory document. The company would have tracking labels on their computers, not reliant on the system name. I lean towards AUP for renaming a company computer. \nFrom Comptia:\nThere are many software suites and associated hardware solutions available for tracking and managing assets (or inventory). An asset management database can be configured to store as much or as little information as is deemed necessary, though typical data would be type, model, serial number, asset ID, location, user(s), value, and service information. Tangible assets can be identified using a barcode label or Radio Frequency ID (RFID) tag attached to the device (or more simply using an identification number).","poster":"K_Dawg"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1643109540.0","poster":"Dedony","content":"An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a document that outlines a set of rules to be followed by users or customers of a set of computing resources, which could be a computer network, website or large computer system. An AUP clearly states what the user is and is not allowed to do with the these resources.\n\nAn AUP is very similar to the ubiquitous terms and conditions or end-user license agreements (EULA) found on almost all software applications. The main difference is that an AUP covers the use of a much larger shared computing resource, such as an LAN or website, as opposed to a single software item. One consequence of sharing is that an AUP typically goes into detail about etiquette and respect for fellow users of the resource, which is not applicable for single-user software applications.","comment_id":"532063"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Answers a\n\nA.
