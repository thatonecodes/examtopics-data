By implementing network segmentation, the financial company can create separate network zones or segments for employees who frequently exchange files at client sites.\nBenefits of network segmentation include:\nContainment of malware: By isolating the segment where employees exchange files, any malware infections or threats introduced in that segment would be limited to that specific network zone. \nEnhanced visibility and control: Network segmentation allows for improved visibility and control over network traffic. \nReduced lateral movement: Segmented networks limit the ability of malware to move laterally across the network.","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"content":"This points out the biggest issue with ChatGPT: I ran the question through 5 times, and it flip-flopped it's answer between C and F every time.
