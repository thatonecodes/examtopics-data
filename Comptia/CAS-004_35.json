Mobile device management with remote wipe capabilities.\nWhy this is the best option: Mobile device management (MDM) with remote wipe allows the security team to remotely erase all data on the employee’s devices, including the laptop and mobile devices, as soon as the theft is reported. This ensures that no sensitive or proprietary data can be accessed, modified, or leaked from the stolen devices.\nRemote wipe capabilities ensure that even if the devices are offline, the data will be deleted once they connect to the internet. NOT D. Full disk encryption with centralized key management: Full disk encryption (FDE) would make it much more difficult for attackers to access the data without the decryption key. However, encryption alone doesn't completely guarantee that data won't be compromised if the attacker has access to the devices long enough to perform brute-force attacks or other methods. Centralized key management is helpful, but it doesn't directly allow for the remote deletion of data on the device, which is what the situation requires.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1733183520.0","comment_id":"1321138"},{"poster":"Bright07","comment_id":"1273543","timestamp":"1724773860.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"ANS is CAPITAL A.

This means that the data remains confidential and cannot be compromised or altered without proper decryption keys.\n\nCentralized Key Management: Centralized key management allows the organization to control and manage encryption keys securely. It ensures that even if the device is stolen, the keys required to decrypt the data are not on the device and can be revoked or rotated as necessary.

A reverse shell is a technique used in penetration testing where the attacker's machine connects back to a compromised target machine, allowing the attacker to gain remote access and control over the target.\n\nIn this case, the command is using the telnet utility to establish two connections. The first connection (telnet 192.168.99.254 343) is intended to execute the /bin/bash command on the target machine, which could potentially provide a shell session on port 343. The output of this command is then piped (|) to another telnet connection (telnet 192.168.99.254 344), which may establish a reverse shell connection back to the penetration tester's machine on port 344.\n\nBy executing this command, the penetration tester is attempting to create a reverse shell connection from the target machine to their machine, enabling remote access and control over the compromised system."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSorry.
