Any changes require the creation of a new, identical VM with the desired modifications. This ensures that the original VM remains unchanged and secure, with data stored externally. Since the system is immutable, there's no risk of unauthorized alterations to the existing VM.

Threat hunting would be the best option to determine whether the company is vulnerable to a specific active campaign. Threat hunting involves proactively searching through networks or endpoints to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. By performing threat hunting, the company can identify any indicators of compromise (IoCs) or unusual activity that may be associated with the known vulnerability and active campaign. System penetration testing, log analysis, and the Cyber Kill Chain are all useful security techniques, but they are not specifically designed for identifying vulnerabilities in response to a specific active campaign.","poster":"CASP_Master","timestamp":"1683733980.0","comment_id":"894136"},{"comment_id":"856457","poster":"Geofab","content":"Selected Answer: B\nconducting a Pen Test seems the most logical to me","timestamp":"1680222060.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"poster":"FoxTrotDG","comment_id":"849518","content":"Idk.
