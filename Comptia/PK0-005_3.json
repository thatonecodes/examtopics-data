KPIs are specific, measurable metrics that are aligned with the project's goals. They provide a clear and quantitative way to evaluate project performance and determine whether the project has achieved its intended outcomes. While schedule variance and cost variance are important measures, KPIs offer a more comprehensive view of the project's success in meeting its objectives."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/119495-exam-pk0-005-topic-1-question-109-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"exam_id":360,"answer":"D","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-08-31 02:10:00","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following would be the MOST beneficial to determine whether a project has met the defined objectives?"},{"id":"C9PvZfTFzhZkzocmO5CH","choices":{"A":"Allocate resources.","C":"Develop a communication plan.","D":"Establish baselines.","B":"Determine the project budget."},"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (82%)","D (18%)"],"question_id":13,"unix_timestamp":1682373780,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1738559100.0","poster":"ExamNinja1","comment_id":"1350747","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDeveloping a schedule in Project+:\n• Identify Tasks\n• Estimate Durations\n• Sequence Tasks\n• Resource Requirements\n• Allocate Resources\n• Create Schedule\n• Validate\n• Set Baselines\n• Document/Communicate\n• Monitor/Update","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nChat GPT says D. I think its reasoning is solid. \nDuring the scheduling phase, the project manager may review the planned schedule, adjust task durations, sequences, dependencies, and resource assignments as necessary to ensure feasibility and alignment with project objectives. Establishing baselines during the scheduling phase involves setting the schedule baseline, which includes freezing the schedule to reflect the agreed-upon plan against which actual progress will be measured.\n\nTherefore, even though establishing baselines is typically associated with the planning phase, it's also an essential activity during the scheduling phase to complete and formalize the project schedule before moving into execution and monitoring phases.","comment_id":"1182978","timestamp":"1727314320.0","poster":"AdmiralGimme","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nYou've already established baselines by outlining the duration.

Allocate resources still needs to be performed to complete the project schedule.\n\nDeveloping a project schedule involves identifying the tasks, estimating their duration and sequencing them in the proper order. Once the tasks have been sequenced, the project manager needs to allocate resources to each task to ensure that the tasks are adequately staffed to complete them as outlined in the schedule. Resource allocation also ensures that the project is staffed with the right skills and that the resources are working on the right tasks at the correct levels of effort.","comment_id":"879724","timestamp":"1698184980.0","poster":"SkylarC"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/comptia/view/107365-exam-pk0-005-topic-1-question-11-discussion/","question_images":[],"exam_id":360,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-04-25 00:03:00","isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_text":"By developing a project schedule, a PM has already validated the constraints, outlined the duration of the tasks and the phases, and confirmed the proper sequence and flow of the project.
