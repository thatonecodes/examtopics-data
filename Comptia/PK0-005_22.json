Root causes analysis is a red herring as RCAs are done after a problem arises.

Project momentum is an intangible asset that you grow by minimizing risks, hitting or beating deadlines, and showing off successes. So sure, you could hold a survey after a well received release, and then announce it to the world. If that's the answer then the question is faulty.
