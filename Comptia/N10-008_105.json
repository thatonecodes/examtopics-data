Crimp the cable as a straight-through cable.\n\nThe issue in this scenario is likely due to the mismatched wiring standards (TIA/EIA 568A on one end and TIA/EIA 568B on the other end) for the Ethernet cable. To fix the problem, the technician should crimp the cable as a straight-through cable, ensuring that both ends follow the same wiring standard (either 568A or 568B).
