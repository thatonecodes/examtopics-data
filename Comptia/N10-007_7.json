Therefore the Wifi would still be on, on the laptop. Not modifying a laptop in \"any way\" indicates that everything in exactly the same on the laptop as it was before. Exam questions should not be misleading or open to interpretation. They should be specific and factual. This question is NOT factual. It in fact it actually lies to you. Don't get me wrong, the answer is still where I would start, but it doesn't indicate whether the statement came from. If it came from the user, then yeah, you can assume that something could have accidentally changed on the laptop without them knowing. If the statement came from compTIA and is strictly information about the situation in the question, then you are to assume the problem isn't with the laptop... because compTIA told you that themselves!
