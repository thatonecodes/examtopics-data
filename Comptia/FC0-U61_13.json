RF (Radio Frequency)\n\nRF refers to the use of electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency range for various wireless communications, including cellular networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Mobile phones typically connect to the Internet via RF technologies such as cellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G), which enable data transmission between the mobile device and the Internet infrastructure, allowing users to access online services, browse websites, use apps, and more.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708274700.0"},{"poster":"Agognut","timestamp":"1702887900.0","comment_id":"1099532","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Password History: determines the number of unique new passwords that must be associated with a user account before an old password can be reused. \nB.

Password complexity: how difficult a password is to guess in relation to any number of guessing or cracking methods. In some cases, the term is also used to refer to requirements for password selection that are designed to increase password complexity in the interest of better security.\n\nMy two coins: \nReuse is definitely not the measure that improves security. Length is just the length of the password; could different requirements in Ann's account result to different passwords?

Java\nJava is a compiled language because it is first compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler and then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Spreadsheet software\n\nSpreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets is commonly used for organizing and managing data, including dates, timelines, and other project-related information. Spreadsheets provide features like rows, columns, formulas, and formatting options that make it easy to create and maintain schedules, track dates, calculate durations, and perform various analyses related to project timelines and milestones.

Scripting language\nExplanation:\nScripting languages (e.g., Python, Bash, JavaScript) are interpreted rather than compiled, making them faster for writing ad hoc programs and automating tasks. They require minimal setup, do not need compilation, and can be executed directly, making them the fastest way to write a program for quick tasks.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. Compiled programming language – Requires compilation before execution, making development slower for quick tasks.\nB. Assembly language – Low-level and complex, requiring detailed hardware instructions, making it very slow for writing programs quickly.\nD.
