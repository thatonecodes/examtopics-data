Let's break it down step by step:\n\nDivision Operation:\n\nWhen you perform the division -1 / 2, the result is -0.5.\nType Conversion:\n\nThe int function converts a floating-point number to an integer by truncating the decimal part. This means it removes the fractional part without rounding.\nTherefore, int(-0.5) becomes 0.\nList Indexing:\n\nIn Python, list indexing starts from 0. So, data[0] refers to the first element of the list.\nCombining these steps, the expression data[int(-1 / 2)] is equivalent to data[0], which accesses the first element of the list data, which is 'Peter'.\n\nSo, the reason (-1 / 2) prints 'Peter' is because the expression evaluates to 0, and data[0] refers to the first element of the list.","poster":"hovnival","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1724134920.0","comment_id":"1269166","poster":"christostz03","upvote_count":"1","content":"e is the correct answer"}],"timestamp":"2024-08-20 08:22:00","answer_description":"","question_text":"What is the expected output of the following code?\n//IMG//","question_id":44,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/python-institute/view/146099-exam-pcep-30-02-topic-1-question-49-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Mary","E":"Peter","D":"None of the above.","C":"The code is erroneous.","A":"Paul"},"answer":"E","answers_community":["E (100%)"],"isMC":true},{"id":"sKqL6rjsRMuJIRDJW38V","answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","exam_id":194,"topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-07-10 19:29:00","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1245634","upvote_count":"9","poster":"vmse10","content":"The print(data[1:3]) statement uses list slicing to extract a sublist from the data list.
