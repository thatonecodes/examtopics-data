Let's break down the code to understand the expected output:\n \nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnums = numbers[2:]\nprint(nums)\n \nHere, numbers is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nThe slicing operation numbers[2:] means \"take all elements from index 2 to the end of the list\". In Python, list indices start at 0, so index 2 refers to the third element in the list, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, numbers[2:] will result in a sublist that starts from the element at index 2 and includes all subsequent elements.\n\nThe resulting sublist will be [3, 4, 5].\n\nSo, the expected output of the code is:\n \n[3, 4, 5]\n \nThe correct answer is:\nB.
