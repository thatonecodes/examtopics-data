Both are lists: Mutable sequence types and immutable sequence types. \nWe can index and slice both, lists and Tuples"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. they can be indexed and sliced like lists\n\nTuples are immutable sequence types in Python, meaning they cannot be modified (no item assignment or deletion) and do not have methods like .append() for extension. However, like other sequence types such as strings and lists, tuples support indexing and slicing to access their elements.","timestamp":"1734799560.0","poster":"hovnival","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1330131"},{"timestamp":"1733631660.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nin Python, it is entirely possible to index and slice tuples","comment_id":"1323355","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sam_sgv"},{"poster":"Nfyughguygjhg","comment_id":"1322445","timestamp":"1733416980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nc is the correct answer","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1724133300.0","comment_id":"1269121","content":"d is the correct answer","poster":"christostz03"}],"answer":"D","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1724133300,"question_text":"The fact that tuples belong to sequence types means:","answer_description":"","topic":"1","exam_id":194,"question_id":6},{"id":"mHVH0o30KXSJONsYJmYI","exam_id":194,"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"[3, 1, 1]","A":"[1, 1, 1]","B":"[3, -1, 1]"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/python-institute/view/146070-exam-pcep-30-02-topic-1-question-15-discussion/","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pcep-30-02/image27.png"],"question_text":"What is the output of the following code?\n//IMG//","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-08-20 07:55:00","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1724133300,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","question_id":7,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nLet's analyze the code step by step:\n\n Initialization of the list:\n my_list = [3, 1, -1]\n At this point, my_list is [3, 1, -1].\n\n Assignment operation:\n my_list[-1] = my_list[-2]\n Here:\n my_list[-1] refers to the last element of the list (-1).\n my_list[-2] refers to the second-to-last element of the list (1).\n\n The operation assigns the value of my_list[-2] (which is 1) to my_list[-1].\n After this, the list becomes [3, 1, 1].\n\n Print the list:\n print(my_list)\n The output is [3, 1, 1].\n\nFinal Output:\n\n[3, 1, 1]","poster":"hovnival","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1330132","timestamp":"1734799920.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe code performs the following operations:\n\nmy_list = [3, 1, -1] initializes a list with the elements [3, 1, -1].\nmy_list[-1] = my_list[-2] assigns the value of the second last element in the list (my_list[-2]) to the last element (my_list[-1]).
