To get the output 3, the inc() method must increment self.prop by val (2 in this case).\n\nThe correct answers are:\nB. self.put(self.prop &#43; val)\nself.put() is a method of MyClass that updates self.prop.\nself.prop &#43; val calculates 1 &#43; 2 = 3 and assigns it to self.prop.\n\nC. self.put(self.get() &#43; val)\nself.get() returns the current value of self.prop, which is 1.\nself.get() &#43; val calculates 1 &#43; 2 = 3.\nself.put(3) assigns 3 to self.prop.","poster":"flthymcnsty"}],"answer_ET":"BC","answer":"BC","answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"self.put(get() + val)","B":"self.put(self.prop + val)","A":"put(self.prop + val)","C":"self.put(self.get() + val)"},"timestamp":"2024-11-26 05:08:00","exam_id":193,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pcap-31-03/image42.png"],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1732594080,"question_text":"Which of the following lines of code will work flawlessly when put independently inside the inc() method in order to make the snippet's output equal to 3?
