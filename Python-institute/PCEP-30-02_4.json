('1', '2', '3', '4')\nExplanation:\n\n data1 = '1', '2': This is a tuple assignment. In Python, writing values separated by commas without parentheses creates a tuple. So, data1 becomes ('1', '2').\n\n data2 = ('3', '4'): This explicitly creates a tuple with parentheses. So, data2 becomes ('3', '4').\n\n data1 + data2: The + operator concatenates two tuples. So, ('1', '2') + ('3', '4') results in ('1', '2', '3', '4').\n\n print(data1 + data2): This prints the concatenated tuple ('1', '2', '3', '4').\n\nHence, the correct answer is C.","comment_id":"1330345","poster":"hovnival","timestamp":"1734864300.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"c is correct answer","timestamp":"1724133960.0","comment_id":"1269139","poster":"christostz03"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/python-institute/view/146082-exam-pcep-30-02-topic-1-question-27-discussion/"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Python-institute","isImplemented":true,"name":"PCEP-30-02","numberOfQuestions":330,"id":194},"currentPage":4},"__N_SSP":true}
