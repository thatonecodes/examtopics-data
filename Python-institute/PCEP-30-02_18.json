Let's break down the expression step by step, considering floor division in Python:\n\nx = 1 + 1 // 2 + 1 / 2 + 2\n\n1. The `//` operator (floor division) and `/` operator (float division) have higher precedence than the `+` operator, so they will be evaluated first.\n2. Evaluate `1 // 2`:\n - `1 // 2` results in `0` because floor division of 1 by 2 rounds down to 0.\n3. Evaluate `1 / 2`:\n - `1 / 2` results in `0.5` because it is float division.\n\nNow substitute these results back into the expression:\n\nx = 1 + 0 + 0.5 + 2\n\n4. Next, evaluate the additions from left to right:\n - `1 + 0` results in `1`\n - `1 + 0.5` results in `1.5`\n - `1.5 + 2` results in `3.5`\n\nTherefore, the expected output of the code is:\n\nD. 3.5"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"]}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":330,"name":"PCEP-30-02","isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Python-institute","id":194,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":18},"__N_SSP":true}
