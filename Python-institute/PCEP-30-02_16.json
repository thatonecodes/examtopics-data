In Python, the float 1.0 is considered equal to the integer 1, so this updates the value for the key 1 to 4. Now data becomes {1: 4, '1': 2}.\nThe dictionary data now contains two key-value pairs: {1: 4, '1': 2}.\n\nThe for loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary:\n\nFor the first key 1, it adds data[1] (which is 4) to res, so res becomes 4.\nFor the second key '1', it adds data['1'] (which is 2) to res, so res becomes 6.\nFinally, the print(res) statement outputs 6.","timestamp":"1735160280.0","comment_id":"1331705","poster":"hovnival"}],"timestamp":"2024-12-20 14:05:00","question_text":"What is the expected output of the following code?\n//IMG//","topic":"1","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pcep-30-02/image159.png"],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/python-institute/view/153231-exam-pcep-30-02-topic-1-question-78-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1734699900,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_id":76,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":194,"answer":"C"},{"id":"lxWUIrmSmylmfJKuBCKP","choices":{"B":"[h, e, l, l, o]","D":"['h' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o']","A":"hello","C":"['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']","E":"None of the above."},"answer_description":"","exam_id":194,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1719299280,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1727666520.0","comment_id":"1269057","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis code does the following:\n\nThe string 'hello' is passed to the list() function.\nlist() converts the string into a list, where each character of the string becomes an individual element of the list.\nThe resulting list \"['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\" is then printed.\n\nEach character from the string 'hello' becomes a separate string element in the list, preserving the order of the original string.
