Now both vals and nums point to the same list object in memory.\n\n del vals[1:2]\n The slice vals[1:2] selects the element at index 1 (value 2).\n The del statement removes this element from the list. Since vals and nums point to the same list, the change affects both.\n\n After this operation, the list becomes [1, 3].\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n A. nums is longer than vals\n False. Both nums and vals refer to the same list, which now has a length of 2.\n\n B. nums and vals are of the same length\n True. Both nums and vals are the same list, so their lengths are equal.\n\n C. vals is longer than nums\n False. Both nums and vals refer to the same list.\n\n D. nums and vals refer to the same list\n True. nums and vals point to the same memory location, so they refer to the same list.\n\nCorrect Answers:\n\nB. nums and vals are of the same length\nD. nums and vals refer to the same list"},{"poster":"christostz03","upvote_count":"1","content":"b & d are correct answers","comment_id":"1269109","timestamp":"1724133060.0"},{"timestamp":"1721317740.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"vals = nums -> this statement means both the Vals & nums will share same memory pool\nvals = noms[:] -> this means both have different memory pool","poster":"froster02","comment_id":"1250529"}],"unix_timestamp":1721317740,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/python-institute/view/144117-exam-pcep-30-02-topic-1-question-6-discussion/","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pcep-30-02/image12.png"],"answer_ET":"BD","timestamp":"2024-07-18 17:49:00","answer":"BD"},{"id":"fK2jJ7ip49f1YDbrvhQr","exam_id":194,"question_text":"What is the expected output of the following code?\n//IMG//","timestamp":"2024-08-20 08:29:00","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1400748","timestamp":"1742418780.0","poster":"akumo","content":"Selected Answer: C\ndata.vals() is incorrect because there is no vals() method in Python dictionaries.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1735122300.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe code you provided contains an error.
