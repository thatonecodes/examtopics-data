Since -1 refers to the last element for access, inserting before this position means the new element goes before the current last element, not at the very end.\n\nThis might seem counterintuitive at first, but it's consistent with how Python treats indexing for modification versus access:\n\nAccess: -1 gets you the last element.\nInsertion: -1 means insert just before where you would access with -1.","comment_id":"1324343","poster":"Sam_sgv","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1733799360.0"},{"timestamp":"1732334820.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1316556","upvote_count":"1","content":"why is insert(-1, ...) mean insert at the second to last position?\n\nwouldn't insert(0, ...) insert at the first place as it's meant for 0 of index place? therefore, -1 is the last digit... is it not?"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nLet's step through this code to understand what's happening:\n\nWe start with my_list = [1, 2]\nThe loop for v in range(2): will run twice, with v taking values 0 and 1.\nIn each iteration, we're using my_list.insert(-1, my_list[v]):\n\ninsert(-1, ...) means insert at the second-to-last position\nmy_list[v] is the element we're inserting\n\n\n\nLet's go through the iterations:\nFirst iteration (v = 0):\n\nWe insert my_list[0] (which is 1) at index -1\nmy_list becomes [1, 1, 2]\n\nSecond iteration (v = 1):\n\nWe insert my_list[1] (which is now 1) at index -1\nmy_list becomes [1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n\nAfter the loop, we print my_list\n\nTherefore, the output will be:\n[1,1,1,2]","poster":"consultsk","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1271943","timestamp":"1727666640.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nmy_list = [1,2]\nfor v in range (2):\n my_list.insert(-1,my_list[v]) >>> loop 1: v=0 >> insert my_list[0] in the position my_list[-1] >> my_list = [1,1,2]\n >>> loop 2: v=1 >> insert my_list[1] in the position my_list[-1] >> my_list = [1,1,1,2]\n \nprint(my_list) >>>> [1,1,1,2] (B)","timestamp":"1724571960.0","comment_id":"1272048","poster":"megan_mai"},{"poster":"christostz03","content":"b is the correct answer","comment_id":"1269128","timestamp":"1724133420.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":13,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"DYXSpAl9KmUhhjhMSc23","timestamp":"2024-08-20 07:58:00","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pcep-30-02/image39.png"],"question_id":14,"isMC":true,"question_text":"What is the expected output of the following code?\n//IMG//","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","exam_id":194,"unix_timestamp":1724133480,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"3","A":"4","B":"6","C":"5"},"discussion":[{"poster":"akumo","comment_id":"1400684","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1742412480.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe code defines a list data containing the following elements:\n\ndata = [1, 2, 3, None, (), [],]\n\n The elements of the list are 1, 2, 3, None, an empty tuple (), and an empty list [].\n The len() function returns the number of elements in the list, regardless of the types or contents of those elements.\n\nIn this case, the list data contains 6 elements: 1, 2, 3, None, (), and [].\n\nThus, the output of the code will be:\n\n6","poster":"hovnival","timestamp":"1734809760.0","comment_id":"1330176"},{"content":"b is the correct answer","timestamp":"1724133480.0","comment_id":"1269130","upvote_count":"1","poster":"christostz03"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/python-institute/view/146076-exam-pcep-30-02-topic-1-question-21-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B"},{"id":"kKugtcC5ra43Clf8ueux","choices":{"A":"stack","D":"heap","C":"list","B":"tree"},"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A data structure described as LIFO is actually a:","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/python-institute/view/146077-exam-pcep-30-02-topic-1-question-22-discussion/","exam_id":194,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2024-08-20 08:00:00","unix_timestamp":1724133600,"isMC":true,"question_id":15,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSTACK Data structure, LIFO - Last in first out","comment_id":"1415061","timestamp":"1743421680.0","poster":"jobseeker"},{"poster":"hovnival","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. stack\n\nLIFO stands for \"Last In, First Out,\" which is a characteristic of a stack data structure.
