This is a valid Python string assignment. In Python, the backslash (\\) is an escape character.\n\nHere's how it works in this case:\n\nThe first backslash escapes the second backslash, resulting in a single backslash character.\nThe third backslash is not followed by any special character, so it remains as a backslash.\nTherefore, the string x actually contains two backslashes: '\\\\'.\n\nSo, the length of the string x is 2.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2","timestamp":"1718351640.0","comment_id":"1230303"}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"The code is erroneous.","B":"2","C":"3","D":"1"},"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"exam_id":194,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"What is the expected output of the following code?\n//IMG//","answer":"A","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pcep-30-02/image298.png"]}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":330,"isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Python-institute","id":194,"name":"PCEP-30-02"},"currentPage":30},"__N_SSP":true}
