Risk taxonomy\nFor a global organization, developing a unified risk taxonomy that is consistent across diverse business units, regions, and cultures can be particularly challenging. Different regions might have varying definitions of risk, diverse risk priorities, or different terminologies. Establishing a consistent language and structure for risk (i.e., a risk taxonomy) that is universally understood and applied across the organization is crucial for effective risk management on a global scale.","comment_id":"1013308","poster":"eblue","timestamp":"1726939620.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nGoing with D.
