They may set out the metrics for measuring the service, along with any remedies, penalties or service credits if agreed service levels are not met.","timestamp":"1723711260.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following can help a cloud customer define provider evaluation criteria?","answer":"A"},{"id":"HGmNEIVkiwlywVZdgJm4","isMC":true,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133948-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-203-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A hypervisor bug that results in the access of RAM of a neighboring cloud computer belonging to another cloud customer is an example of which of the following?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Isolation failure\n\nA hypervisor bug that results in the access of RAM of a neighboring cloud computer belonging to another cloud customer is an example of an isolation failure. In cloud computing, isolation is a critical security measure that ensures that the resources and data of one customer are kept separate from those of another. The hypervisor plays a key role in maintaining this isolation by managing virtual machines on shared physical hardware.\n\nWhen a hypervisor bug allows one virtual machine to access the memory of another, it represents a failure of this isolation mechanism. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and compromise the security and privacy of cloud customers. Isolation failures highlight the importance of robust hypervisor security and effective vulnerability management in cloud environments.","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1743000000.0","comment_id":"1410428"},{"comment_id":"1150896","content":"Selected Answer: D\nP# 55 Isolation failure—Cloud computing often uses shared resources and multitenancy.

As a result, which type of termination is triggered by the cloud customer?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Termination for convenience\n\nTermination for convenience is the type of termination triggered by the cloud customer in this scenario. This type of termination allows a customer to end the contract with a cloud service provider without needing to provide a specific reason or cause. In the context of an acquisition aimed at consolidating cloud services under a single provider, the customer would use termination for convenience to streamline operations and align with the new strategic direction, even if there were no issues with the existing service. This approach provides flexibility to the customer to reorganize their cloud service arrangements according to their business needs following the acquisition.","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1743000060.0","comment_id":"1410429"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nP# 77 Termination for convenience—This type of termination occurs at the initiative of one party and without the fault of the other party.

The threat landscape is dynamic and can evolve rapidly, introducing new risks and vulnerabilities that organizations must address to maintain compliance and security. By continuously monitoring and assessing the threat landscape, organizations can identify emerging threats and adjust their controls accordingly to ensure they remain effective against potential attacks. \n\nWhile key control indicators (KCIs), risk scoring criteria, and risk owner expertise are important elements of risk management and compliance, they are typically more static compared to the ever-changing threat landscape, which requires more frequent reassessment and adaptation of controls."}],"question_id":114,"answer_description":"","answer":"B","choices":{"C":"risk scoring criteria.","D":"risk owner expertise.","A":"key control indicators (KCIs).","B":"threat landscape."},"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"pdE00wtjcvEkEssjh0co","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1410435","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Encryption for data at rest.\n\nEncryption for data at rest is an example of a preventive control in an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment. Preventive controls are designed to avoid or mitigate security incidents before they occur. By encrypting data at rest, the IaaS service provider ensures that stored data is protected from unauthorized access, thereby preventing data breaches and ensuring confidentiality. This control helps guard against potential threats by making it more difficult for attackers to access sensitive information even if they gain access to the storage system.\n\nThe other options—privileged access monitoring, threat hunting, and incident response—are more aligned with detective or corrective controls. Privileged access monitoring involves tracking access to detect potential misuse, threat hunting involves actively searching for threats, and incident response deals with managing and mitigating incidents after they occur.","timestamp":"1743000180.0"},{"poster":"sai_murthy","timestamp":"1723711980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCCAK P# 122","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1150906"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"incident response.","B":"threat hunting.","A":"privileged access monitoring.","C":"encryption for data at rest."},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-02-15 11:53:00","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1707994380,"exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133952-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-206-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":115,"question_text":"An example of a preventive control that may be identified in an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) service provider is:","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Isaca","isBeta":false,"name":"CCAK","id":153,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":258,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":23},"__N_SSP":true}
