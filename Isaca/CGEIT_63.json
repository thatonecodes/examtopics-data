Qualitative analysis.\nQualitative analysis is the most suitable method for assessing risks in scenarios where precise quantitative data may be unavailable or difficult to obtain. It involves evaluating risks based on their likelihood, impact, and other qualitative factors. It often relies on expert judgment, subjective assessments, and qualitative scales to assess the severity of risks.\nIn this case, where the enterprise has identified plausible risk scenarios, qualitative analysis allows for a systematic evaluation of the risks based on their qualitative attributes. It helps identify and prioritize risks based on their potential impact on the organization's objectives and economic loss."}],"answers_community":["A (89%)","11%"],"answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-06-19 06:58:00","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[]},{"id":"8kFi8BIFIBSHBhDFXxWf","topic":"1","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1710136080,"timestamp":"2024-03-11 06:48:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","question_id":312,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following BEST facilitates the standardization of IT vendor selection?","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":155,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/135714-exam-cgeit-topic-1-question-463-discussion/","choices":{"D":"Cost-benefit analysis","A":"Contract management office","B":"Service level agreements (SLAs)","C":"Procurement framework"},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nA procurement framework provides a standardized process for selecting vendors, which can help ensure consistency, fairness, and efficiency in the vendor selection process.
