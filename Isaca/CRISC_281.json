Residual risk is reduced.\n\nAutomated system configuration validation tools help reduce the residual risk, which is the risk that remains after controls and mitigation efforts have been implemented. By automatically identifying and rectifying configuration errors and vulnerabilities, these tools help ensure that systems are operating in a secure and compliant manner. This, in turn, reduces the likelihood of security incidents and breaches, ultimately lowering the residual risk to the organization.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"mynk29","content":"An automated validation tool will most likely reduce the likelihood of the incorrect configuration which will reduce the risk risk.","timestamp":"1716673380.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"mynk29","timestamp":"1716673380.0","content":"D is right in my view.","comment_id":"906889"}],"comment_id":"906888"},{"comment_id":"894613","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI go with \"B\". Manual validation is more costly, think of this as man-days. Automated validation will make the process more efficient with less cost.
