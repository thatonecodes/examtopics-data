Collect and correlate IT infrastructure event logs.\n\nCollecting and correlating IT infrastructure event logs is the most reliable way to ensure that network security incidents are identified as soon as possible. Event logs are records of activity on a system or network, and they can provide valuable information about security incidents. By collecting and analyzing event logs from different systems and devices, organizations can identify patterns of activity that may indicate a security incident. Correlating event logs can help organizations quickly identify the root cause of an incident, as well as its scope and potential impact. This can help organizations quickly respond to security incidents, minimizing the damage they cause. While other options such as installing firewalls or training employees can help improve security, they do not provide the same level of real-time visibility into network activity and potential incidents."},{"timestamp":"1733387700.0","poster":"richck102","comment_id":"915124","content":"C.

Requiring regular reporting from the IT service provider.\n\nWhile all of the options listed can contribute to information security, requiring regular reporting from the IT service provider is a proactive measure that allows the organization to monitor and verify the IT service provider's compliance with information security requirements on an ongoing basis. This reporting can include key performance indicators (KPIs), security incident reports, compliance checklists, and other relevant information.

Requiring regular reporting from the IT service provider would be the best option to ensure compliance with an organization's information security requirements by an IT service provider. Regular reporting will help to ensure that the IT service provider is meeting the agreed-upon service level agreements and other security requirements. This reporting can include metrics such as system uptime, response times, security incidents, and compliance with security policies and standards. It will also enable the organization to identify potential security risks and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.","comment_id":"878380","timestamp":"1698066240.0","poster":"Abhey","upvote_count":"2"}],"exam_id":157,"answer":"A","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1682255040,"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (60%)","D (40%)"],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following would BEST help to ensure compliance with an organization's information security requirements by an IT service provider?","timestamp":"2023-04-23 15:04:00","isMC":true},{"id":"lZtbNGyPUb5qdm9NBFd7","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-06-05 08:39:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/111159-exam-cism-topic-1-question-279-discussion/","exam_id":157,"unix_timestamp":1685947140,"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"Which of the following is MOST important to include in an information security status report to senior management?","topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"richck102","comment_id":"915128","timestamp":"1733387940.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
