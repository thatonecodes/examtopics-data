A vulnerability has been identified within the industry.\n\nThe identification of a new vulnerability within the industry can significantly impact the risk landscape for an organization. It may introduce new threats or alter the risk scenarios associated with existing vulnerabilities. In response to such changes, a risk reassessment is often necessary to evaluate the potential impact on the organization's risk profile and to update risk management strategies accordingly.","comment_id":"1110154"}],"exam_id":160,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-12-31 01:13:00","answer":"C","question_id":471,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"96bBUdhhIXH82YNuaIkA","answer":"C","choices":{"C":"data retention and destruction.","A":"data classification and labeling.","B":"data mining and analytics.","D":"data logging and monitoring."},"question_id":472,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"K5000ism","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1110157","timestamp":"1719699600.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C\nwe are reducing the amount of data we retain and destroy at the end of the retention period so that we decrease the cost"},{"comment_id":"1086632","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Data retention and destruction.\n\nImplementing clear and effective data retention and destruction policies helps in managing the volume of data that needs to be stored, reviewed, and potentially retrieved during litigation. By properly retaining only necessary data for legally required or business-critical periods and systematically destroying outdated or irrelevant data, an organization can significantly reduce the volume of data to sift through during litigation, thereby lowering associated costs. This approach also ensures that the data retained is more likely to be relevant and organized, facilitating quicker and more cost-effective retrieval.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Kennethlim79","timestamp":"1717386420.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nRetrieval is always a challenge if data cannot be retained and already destructed","timestamp":"1711701120.0","poster":"krishccie","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1020537"},{"timestamp":"1709000820.0","comment_id":"991137","content":"Selected Answer: A\nClassify will assist in retrieving","upvote_count":"2","poster":"HS2804"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/119167-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1452-discussion/","answers_community":["C (67%)","A (33%)"],"question_text":"The BEST way to mitigate the high cost of retrieving electronic evidence associated with potential litigation is to implement policies and procedures for:","timestamp":"2023-08-27 02:27:00","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1693096020,"answer_description":"","exam_id":160,"isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"bcI82XB2qXKQLi3G6hBx","choices":{"C":"Increase in risk event impact","D":"Increase in cybersecurity premiums","B":"Increase in mitigating control costs","A":"Increase in risk event likelihood"},"exam_id":160,"answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":473,"unix_timestamp":1703982180,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1110158","poster":"K5000ism","content":"A.

Implementing mock phishing exercises.\n\nMock phishing exercises are a practical approach to assessing whether employees can recognize and respond appropriately to phishing attempts, a common cybersecurity threat. These exercises provide real-time feedback on the level of awareness and readiness of employees to deal with such risks. While security awareness training is crucial for educating employees, mock phishing exercises actively test and validate the effectiveness of this training. Two-factor authentication and updating the information security policy are important security measures, but they do not directly validate employees' awareness of cybersecurity risk","timestamp":"1717386600.0","comment_id":"1086634","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kennethlim79"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"krishccie","content":"Selected Answer: A\nvalidating","timestamp":"1711700880.0","comment_id":"1020534"},{"comment_id":"1005254","poster":"HS2804","timestamp":"1710208320.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nKeyword is validating."},{"content":"A.
