Enterprise architecture provides a holistic framework that aligns business goals with IT infrastructure and processes. It helps in managing the complexity of cloud migration by ensuring that all components—business, information, application, and technology architectures—are considered and aligned. This approach facilitates strategic planning, risk management, and efficient resource allocation throughout the cloud migration process.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732196160.0","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1315842"},{"poster":"Wessywes24","comment_id":"1303599","timestamp":"1730036040.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. enterprise architecture\n\nFor planning and executing a cloud migration strategy, an enterprise architecture (EA) is the most suitable approach. EA provides a holistic view of the organization’s IT and business processes, helping to align the cloud migration strategy with overall business goals, optimize resource allocation, and manage dependencies. It also ensures that all aspects of the migration, including infrastructure, applications, data, and security, are planned in an integrated and strategic manner.\n\nThe other options are less comprehensive for cloud migration planning:\n\nA. Object-oriented architecture focuses on software design patterns, not migration strategy.\nB. Software architecture is relevant but limited to software structure and doesn’t cover the full scope of a cloud migration.\nC.

When an auditor assesses the implementation of continuous auditing of performance on a cloud system, they need to review the SLOs to ensure that the system is meeting the established performance targets.\n\nOn the other hand, Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) are related to disaster recovery and business continuity, rather than continuous performance auditing.
