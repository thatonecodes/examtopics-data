Among the options provided, the method that BEST enforces data leakage prevention is:\n\nC. Data for different tenants is segregated by database schema.\n\nThis approach ensures that data from different tenants is physically separated at the database schema level, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data leakage between tenants. It provides a strong isolation mechanism to prevent data from leaking from one tenant to another. However, it's important to note that additional security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and regular security reviews, should complement this segregation to create a comprehensive security strategy.","poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1022745","timestamp":"1712025660.0"},{"poster":"hoho","timestamp":"1704123180.0","content":"Agree on C, Segregating database schema","comment_id":"939998","upvote_count":"3"}],"topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":153,"unix_timestamp":1679890140,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-03-27 06:09:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Monitoring tools are configured to alert in case of downtime.","C":"Data for different tenants is segregated by database schema","D":"Tenants are required to implement data classification policies.","B":"A comprehensive security review is performed every quarter."},"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"2iF3LfRzHyTtZG1VgcfO","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1129848","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Audit transparency is the PRIMARY advantage of an IS auditor requesting direct access to data required to perform audit procedures.

In a role-based model, users are assigned roles based on their job functions, and each role is associated with specific access rights and permissions. This helps in preventing conflicts of duties by ensuring that individuals only have access to the resources necessary for their specific roles.","comment_id":"1070424","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1731592500.0","poster":"FAGFUR"},{"timestamp":"1727836920.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1022746","poster":"SuperMax","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD: Granting user access using a role-based model.\n Granting user access using a role-based model: This is the best approach because it involves designing access control based on roles and responsibilities within the organization. A well-designed role-based model should inherently address segregation of duties issues by defining roles that have specific access permissions that align with job functions. By implementing a role-based access control system, you can prevent users from having conflicting permissions, reducing the risk of segregation of duties issues from occurring in the first place.\n\nSo, option D is the most proactive and effective way to prevent the misconfiguration from recurring."},{"poster":"hoho","timestamp":"1717884840.0","content":"On B, standard UA Matrix will help to prevent SoD effective","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"918710"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think D","poster":"BabaP","comment_id":"893782","timestamp":"1715332620.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Granting user access using a role-based model","B":"Referencing a standard user-access matrix","C":"Correcting the segregation of duties conflicts","A":"Monitoring access rights on a regular basis"},"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D"}],"exam":{"name":"CISA","provider":"Isaca","id":156,"numberOfQuestions":1441,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":31},"__N_SSP":true}
