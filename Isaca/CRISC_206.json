Avoiding a risk that was previously accepted.\n\nThe most important risk register update for senior management to review is \"A. Avoiding a risk that was previously accepted.\" This update represents a significant change in the organization's risk posture and risk management strategy. When a risk that was previously accepted is now being avoided, it signals a change in the organization's willingness to tolerate that risk, which could have implications for overall risk appetite and strategic decision-making.\n\nWhile the other updates (extending the date of a future action plan, retiring a risk scenario, changing a risk owner) are also important, they may not have the same level of impact on risk posture and strategic decisions as a change in risk acceptance status. The decision to avoid a risk may indicate a shift in business objectives, external factors, or the organization's approach to risk management that senior management should be informed about and review."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nGoing with Kozy.

This update indicates that the organization's risk posture has changed and that new controls or risk mitigation strategies may need to be implemented. This update should be reviewed by senior management to ensure that the organization's risk management approach remains effective and that appropriate actions are taken to address the newly identified risk.\n\nExtending the date of a future action plan by two months, while important, is not as critical as the update related to avoiding a risk that was previously accepted. This update does not indicate a change in the risk posture of the organization, but rather a delay in the implementation of a planned action. While delays may have an impact on the organization's ability to mitigate risk, they do not necessarily require immediate attention from senior management unless they significantly impact the organization's ability to achieve its objectives."},{"poster":"Kozy","timestamp":"1695744600.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nFrom risk point of view, Answer A tells you that the risk was fully eliminated by avoiding it.
