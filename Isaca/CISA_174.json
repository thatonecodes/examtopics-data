Examine project change request logs.\n\nDuring a post-implementation review of a critical application that has been operational for six months, the IS auditor should examine project change request logs. This is important because it allows the auditor to review any changes made to the application after it went live. Examining change request logs helps assess whether changes were properly authorized, documented, and tested, and whether they have had any unexpected impacts on the system's performance or security. It also provides insights into the change management process, which is a crucial aspect of maintaining the application's stability and integrity. While the other options mentioned (testing program system interfaces, verifying data conversions, and assessing project management risk reports) are important activities, examining change request logs specifically addresses post-implementation change management, which is a critical aspect of maintaining the application's reliability and security.","comment_id":"1003312","timestamp":"1710001980.0","upvote_count":"7"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe IS auditor evaluates how well the application is functioning in its operational environment.

Parallel testing is the process of feeding data into two systems-the modified system and an alternate system- and comparing the results. In this approach, the old and new systems operate concurrently for a period of time and perform the same processing functions.
