Engage line management in risk assessment workshops\n\nEngaging line management in risk assessment workshops is the best approach to identify relevant risk scenarios. Line managers have a hands-on understanding of day-to-day operations, as well as the risks associated with their specific areas of responsibility. Their practical knowledge and experience make them valuable contributors to the risk identification process.\n\nThe other options:\n\nB. Escalate the situation to risk leadership: While risk leadership should be involved in strategic risk management decisions, they might not have the same level of detailed, operational knowledge as line management to identify specific risk scenarios.\n\nC. Engage internal audit for risk assessment workshops: Although internal audit can provide valuable input into risk assessments, they often have a more independent, oversight role rather than a deep operational understanding that line management can provide.\n\nD. Review system and process documentation: While reviewing documentation is certainly part of identifying risks, it might not capture all the nuances of real-world operations and potential risks that engaging with line management can uncover.","timestamp":"1721913480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"01010100","comment_id":"962749"},{"poster":"mraiyan","timestamp":"1717404120.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nStakeholder engagement is the most important when developing risk scenarios.

Of the options listed, 'A' provides a broader view to identify 'relevant risk scenarios'.\n\nIn addition, in the section on 'risk scenario techniques' of the 7th CRISC manual it is indicated: ensure the requirements of adequate people and skills to develop relevant risk scenarios.
