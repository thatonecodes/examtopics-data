Recovery time objectives (RTOs).\n\nRecovery time objectives (RTOs) define the maximum allowable downtime for a system or service after a failure or disaster. It represents the target time within which the system should be fully operational again. Choosing the appropriate failover site type largely depends on your organization's RTO requirements because it directly relates to how quickly you need to recover from a failure."},{"timestamp":"1724685000.0","comment_id":"990897","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Agamennore","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRTO for sure the best"},{"poster":"richck102","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"931186","timestamp":"1719113880.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Legal and regulatory requirements\n\nLegal and regulatory requirements are typically the most important constraints to consider when developing an information security strategy. These requirements are mandated by governments and regulatory bodies and carry legal implications for organizations. Failing to comply with these requirements can result in legal consequences, fines, and damage to an organization's reputation. Therefore, ensuring that your information security strategy aligns with and meets these legal and regulatory obligations is paramount.","poster":"oluchecpoint","comment_id":"1000730","timestamp":"1694012220.0"},{"timestamp":"1693062780.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIf we talk about “constraint” is the D","comment_id":"990903","poster":"Agamennore","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"richck102","timestamp":"1687491720.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
