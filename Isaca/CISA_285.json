Risk scenario development involves identifying and analyzing potential risks and vulnerabilities that could affect the organization's information systems and networks. By participating in risk scenario development workshops, the audit team can gain a better understanding of the organization's risk profile and the potential impact of different types of risks on the organization's operations and objectives.

By having both production and developer access, the DevOps team may be able to both develop and deploy changes to the organization's systems, potentially leading to conflicts of interest or the potential for fraud or abuse. To address this concern, the auditor's best recommendation would be to implement an automated control that prevents deployment if the developer is also trying to deploy the change. This would ensure that there is a separation between the development and deployment of changes, and it would help to reduce the risk of potential conflicts of interest or abuse.","poster":"Staanlee","comments":[{"content":"Option A (Implement weekly management reviews) is not the best recommendation because it relies on manual reviews, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and may not prevent issues in real-time.\nOption B (Reauthorize access quarterly) is a step in the right direction, but it may not provide real-time control and may still allow for periods where a single individual has both types of access.\nOption C (Remove developer access) is too restrictive and might hinder the DevOps team's ability to work efficiently and collaboratively.\nOption D is the best choice because it suggests implementing an automated control.
