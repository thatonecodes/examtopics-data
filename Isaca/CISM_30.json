Engage business process owners. Because alignment means that the security program supports and enables the business, rather than being a separate or disconnected function. To truly understand if your security objectives align with business goals, you need input from the process owners. \nKPIs measure performance, but not necessarily strategic alignment, unless those KPIs are built around business value which again is provided by the process owner.","timestamp":"1743501720.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1416867","poster":"SHERLOCKAWS"},{"timestamp":"1737419880.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Josef4CISM","comment_id":"1343942","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe question asks about the most EFFECTIVE way.

The purpose of a BCP is to keep the business running in a disaster. The main focus point of a BCP is NOT the recovery of the business, but the maintenance of critical business services. \n\nInstead, the DRP intends to recover the business services to a normal state. Why else there is RECOVERY in DRP?\n\nYou could argue for option A - BIA, since a BIA is the pre-requisite for DRP and for BCP's (e.g., you determine main recovery targets like RTO, RPO etc.). But the question clearly asks about the recovery of the business, hence I go for option C.","poster":"Josef4CISM","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1343945","timestamp":"1737420240.0"},{"comment_id":"1213693","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBIA is a preparatory step that identifies which business processes are essential, their dependencies and the potential impact of a disruption to those processes. The BIA itself does not include strategies or actions for recovery.\n\nIn contrast, a BCP uses the insights gained from a BIA to develop plans to ensure the business can continue operating during and recover after a disaster.
