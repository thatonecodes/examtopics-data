The incident response team has the appropriate training.\n\nEnsuring that incident management plans are executed effectively is crucial to minimize the impact of a security incident. One of the most important factors to consider is that the incident response team has the appropriate training. This includes training on incident response procedures and best practices, as well as training on the specific tools and technologies that will be used to respond to incidents. This will ensure that the team is properly prepared to handle the incident, and that they are able to respond quickly and effectively. Training also helps to build the team's confidence and expertise, which can be critical in high-pressure incident response situations.

Level of residual risk.\n\nWhen informing a risk treatment decision, the information security manager should compare the level of residual risk with the organization's risk appetite. Residual risk is the risk that remains after risk treatment has been applied. By comparing the level of residual risk to the organization's risk appetite, the information security manager can determine if the risk is acceptable or if additional treatment is required. The organization's risk appetite is a statement of the level of risk that the organization is willing to tolerate and accept. By understanding the residual risk, the information security manager can make informed decisions on risk treatment options and prioritize them accordingly.
