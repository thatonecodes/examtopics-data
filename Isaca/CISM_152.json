These controls use a database of signatures or patterns associated with known malware to identify and block malicious files or code. When a file or code matches a signature in the database, the anti-malware software can take appropriate action, such as quarantining or deleting the file. \nPoorly configured firewall rules (A) and reused virus code (B) are not directly related to the effectiveness of signature-based anti-malware controls. Firewall rules are network-level controls that regulate incoming and outgoing traffic, while reused virus code refers to the practice of using existing malicious code in new malware. However, signature-based anti-malware controls can complement firewall rules and help detect and block malware, including instances of reused virus code.","poster":"koala_lay"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1002142","timestamp":"1709882700.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption B","poster":"oluchecpoint"},{"comment_id":"955614","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: B\nthreats can be DDOS too. how can AV protect against ddos","timestamp":"1705601760.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Goseu","timestamp":"1705402740.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC .known threats .","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"953198","comments":[{"content":"wrong. threats can be non malware. how can antivirus block DDOS threats?","timestamp":"1705601700.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"955612","comments":[{"timestamp":"1706633940.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"967226","content":"Your point makes sense.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"nowhere says that Antivirus should be affective against ALL the known threats","timestamp":"1722169860.0","comment_id":"1134158","comments":[{"timestamp":"1722169920.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Marcelus1714","comment_id":"1134162","content":"additionally if it's signature based, the AV will detect hashes, if you reuse code, you are not using a known hash, just getting part of the code that will generate other hash"}],"poster":"Marcelus1714"}],"poster":"Goseu"}],"poster":"[Removed]"}]},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"C. known threats.","comment_id":"937519","poster":"richck102","timestamp":"1703832420.0"},{"timestamp":"1703139960.0","comment_id":"929042","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. known threats.","poster":"Jae_kes","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"bambs","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDefinitely C","comment_id":"800525","timestamp":"1691373480.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nClearly, C.","timestamp":"1687531740.0","comment_id":"754366","upvote_count":"2","poster":"aokisan"},{"upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"timestamp":"1686985080.0","poster":"Ziggybooboo","comment_id":"747897","content":"Agreed","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1686311760.0","comment_id":"740168","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt's known.","poster":"Manzer"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (56%)","B (44%)"],"unix_timestamp":1670594160,"question_images":[]},{"id":"vJyuyyMHqEPufzU2sLfh","choices":{"B":"Determine recovery priorities.","D":"Analyze vulnerabilities.","C":"Define the recovery point objective (RPO).","A":"Confirm control effectiveness."},"answer":"B","question_text":"Which of the following is the PRIMARY objective of a business impact analysis (BIA)?","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-02-17 05:29:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":758,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1726764540.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the best option here.","poster":"yottabyte","comment_id":"1177633","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"937520","timestamp":"1703832480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"richck102","content":"B.
