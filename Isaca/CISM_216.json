To assess and approve the security application architecture\n\nThe PRIMARY role of an information security manager in a software development project is typically to assess and approve the security application architecture. This involves ensuring that the design and architecture of the software include appropriate security measures and that it complies with security best practices and organizational security policies. While the other options (A, B, and D) are important responsibilities of an information security manager in the context of software development, assessing and approving the security architecture is a fundamental step to establish a strong foundation for secure software development.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712371860.0","comment_id":"1026179","poster":"oluchecpoint"},{"timestamp":"1706474040.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"wickhaarry","comment_id":"965759","content":"C.

Independent compliance audit\n\nAn independent compliance audit is the most effective method for identifying issues related to noncompliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements. An independent audit is typically conducted by a third-party or internal audit team that has no vested interest in the outcome, ensuring impartiality and accuracy in the assessment. This approach provides a comprehensive and objective evaluation of an organization's compliance with various requirements and can uncover issues that may not be apparent through other methods."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nA compliance gap analysis (option C) is the most effective method for identifying issues related to noncompliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements. This process involves comparing the organization's current practices, policies, and controls against the specific requirements outlined in relevant laws, regulations, and contracts.
