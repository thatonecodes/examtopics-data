Involving functional managers in program development.\n\nInvolving functional managers in program development is a critical element for the success of an information security program. The involvement of functional managers ensures that security considerations are integrated across different business areas, reflecting the unique needs of each part of the organization. This collaboration fosters a culture of security, aligns security objectives with business objectives, and ensures that security controls are applicable and practical.\n\nIn the ISACA article \"Essential Functions of a Cybersecurity Program,\" they mention how a program-oriented approach to cybersecurity \"supports the organization’s vision, goals and objectives.\" This highlights that without proper stakeholder engagement, alignment with the broader organizational goals might be compromised, potentially making the security program ineffective.","poster":"helg420"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1139033","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
