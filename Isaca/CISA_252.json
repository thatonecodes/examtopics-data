This allows you to effectively prioritize risk management and allocate resources.\n\nTherefore, prioritizing IT risk scenarios across the organization is more appropriate for determining the overall IT risk tolerance of the organization than simply averaging the IT risk levels of each business unit or identifying the highest rating.

By executing test transactions with various types of data, auditors can assess how well the edit routine functions in detecting and handling different scenarios, such as invalid inputs, out-of-range values, or inconsistent data. This approach allows auditors to directly observe the behavior of the edit routine in action and identify any potential weaknesses or deficiencies.\nHowever, while test transactions provide valuable insights into the system's functionality, they may not always be the MOST conclusive audit procedure on their own.
