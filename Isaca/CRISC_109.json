This addresses the violation of the clear desk policy by offering a solution that ensures sensitive documents are stored securely when not in use.\n\nOptions A and C are not the best immediate responses. Securely disposing of the documents (Option A) might not be necessary if the documents are still needed for work purposes, and requesting an exception to the clear desk policy (Option C) may not be the best course of action without exploring more secure storage options.\n\nOption D, providing the employee with refresher training, could be part of the solution but may not be the most immediate and practical step to address the violation. Recommending secure document storage is a proactive measure to prevent future policy violations and promote a secure working environment."}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"During an after-hours compliance review, a risk practitioner discovers sensitive documents on an employee’s desk in violation of company policy.
