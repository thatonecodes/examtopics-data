The vendor may be unable to restore critical data.\n\nReliability and effectiveness in data restoration are paramount when it comes to data backup services. If the vendor is unable to restore critical data when needed, it could result in significant operational disruptions, data loss, and potentially severe consequences for the organization.

If the vendor fails to restore data within the agreed-upon RTOs, it could disrupt business operations, cause financial losses, and damage customer trust.\n\nThe inability of the vendor to meet RTO requirements directly impacts the organization's ability to resume operations swiftly after a data loss event. If critical data cannot be restored within the specified RTO, it could lead to extended periods of downtime, impacting productivity and potentially resulting in financial penalties if service level agreements (SLAs) are not met.\n\nTherefore, the risk that the vendor may be unable to restore data by RTO requirements (option D) is indeed significant, as it directly affects the organization's ability to recover from data loss incidents and maintain business continuity.","timestamp":"1714969560.0","poster":"a84n","comment_id":"1207164","upvote_count":"2"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
