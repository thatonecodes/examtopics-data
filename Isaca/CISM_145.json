Impact of service interruption should be the greatest consideration when determining the recovery time objective (RTO) for an in-house critical application, database, or server. RTO is the amount of time within which a business process must be restored after a disaster or disruption, in order to avoid unacceptable consequences. The impact of service interruption will vary depending on the specific application, database, or server in question, and it can include financial loss, reputational damage, legal liability, and loss of customer trust. By understanding the impact of service interruption, the organization can set a realistic RTO that balances the cost of recovery with the potential impact of not recovering in time.","timestamp":"1690475880.0","poster":"Broesweelies","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"789903"},{"poster":"Ziggybooboo","comment_id":"747264","content":"D for me","timestamp":"1686917160.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"yottabyte","comment_id":"1177031","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD seems to be the apt choice.","timestamp":"1726720320.0"},{"comment_id":"1017498","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI have never been more nervous, disagreeing first time with the popular mandate and the popular winner of no-confidence vote, exam topics (haha...don't blacklist me man!).\n\nSenior management sets the direction for all information security activities, and is ultimately accountable for due diligence; senior management trumps all.","timestamp":"1711443960.0","poster":"CISSPST","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

RTO is the maximum allowable downtime that an organization can tolerate for a specific system or service before it has a significant negative impact on its operations.

To establish a minimum acceptable security baseline is the primary purpose of implementing information security standards. Standards provide a framework for achieving a set of security objectives and establish a common set of security controls and guidelines that organizations should implement to protect their information systems. They are designed to be a starting point for organizations to build their own security programs and help ensure that the security measures in place are adequate to protect the organization's sensitive information and assets. Standards provide a common language and a consistent approach to security, which helps organizations to understand their security risks, identify vulnerabilities, and implement appropriate controls to mitigate those risks.","upvote_count":"6"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is D: Standards define minimum security requirements tailored to a specific organization. An example could be the usage of TLS 1.2 or above or password complexity requirements.\n\nThe answer is NOT B, since step by step instructions are covered by procedures. Procedures are one level below standards and contain detailed instructions on how to perform certain tasks (e.g., like a manual).\n\nThe answer is NOT C, since security objectives are derived from business objectives (security as a supporting function for the business).

Validate the authenticity of the patch should be the first step in patch management procedures when receiving an emergency security patch. Before installing any patch, it is important to ensure that it is genuine and has been released by a trusted source. This step will help to prevent the installation of malicious software or unauthorized patches that could have negative consequences on the system. This step can be done by checking the software vendor's website or by contacting them directly to confirm the authenticity of the patch. After the authenticity of the patch is confirmed, then it is important to schedule patching based on the criticality and conduct comprehensive testing of the patch to ensure that it will not cause any issues on the system before installing it."}],"timestamp":"2023-01-27 19:43:00","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1674844980,"question_id":723,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/97001-exam-cism-topic-1-question-526-discussion/","exam_id":157,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"TosbCrUQuwL9mnSSyQbI","answer_description":"","question_id":724,"question_images":[],"exam_id":157,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"signature analysis.","B":"penetration testing.","A":"behavior analysis.","D":"data packet analysis."},"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1664104920,"timestamp":"2022-09-25 13:22:00","question_text":"The MOST effective tools for responding to new and advanced attacks are those that detect attacks based on:","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/83521-exam-cism-topic-1-question-527-discussion/","answers_community":["A (90%)","10%"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"678733","timestamp":"1664104920.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"702319","content":"Agreed","timestamp":"1666542420.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Ziggybooboo"}],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nI'd go with A","upvote_count":"8","poster":"k4d4v4r"},{"poster":"ATT5832","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731613140.0","comment_id":"1312307","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThink about Advanced Persistent Threats here.
