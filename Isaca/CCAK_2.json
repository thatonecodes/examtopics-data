A type 2 SOC report validates the operating effectiveness of controls whereas a type 1 SOC report validates the suitability of the design of the controls.**\n\nA Type 1 SOC report focuses on the suitability of the design of controls at a specific point in time. It assesses whether the controls are appropriately designed to achieve their objectives. In contrast, a Type 2 SOC report evaluates not only the design of the controls but also their operating effectiveness over a period of time. This means that a Type 2 report provides assurance that the controls functioned effectively throughout the specified period.","timestamp":"1741779540.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1387837"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCCAK Pg: 167\n Type 1: report on management¡¦s description of the service organization system and the suitability of the\ndesign of the controls to achieve the related control objectives included in the description as of a specified date.\nType 2: report on management¡¦s description of the service organization system and the suitability of the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives included in the\ndescription throughout a specified period.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"4f2a581","comment_id":"1258693","timestamp":"1722411480.0"},{"timestamp":"1707755820.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCCAK P# 167 There are two types of SOC 1 reports:\n• Type 1—A report on management’s description of the service organization system and the suitability of the design of the controls to achieve the related control objectives included in the description as of a specified date.\n• Type 2—A report on management’s description of the service organization system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives included in the description throughout a specified period.","poster":"sai_murthy","comment_id":"1148373"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1674085260.0","poster":"foley23","content":"Answer is A","comment_id":"780535"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","choices":{"A":"A type 2 SOC report validates the operating effectiveness of controls whereas a type 1 SOC report validates the suitability of the design of the controls.","B":"A type 2 SOC report validates the suitability of the design of the controls whereas a type 1 SOC report validates the operating effectiveness of controls.","C":"A type 1 SOC report provides an attestation whereas a type 2 SOC report offers a certification.","D":"There is no difference between a type 2 and type 1 SOC report."},"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/95914-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-103-discussion/","question_text":"Which best describes the difference between a type 1 and a type 2 SOC report?","answer_description":"","question_id":6,"timestamp":"2023-01-19 00:41:00","topic":"1","exam_id":153,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1674085260},{"id":"O76xG9upKRoGGye6jdAI","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1707756300,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133628-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-104-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer":"B","timestamp":"2024-02-12 17:45:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":7,"question_text":"You have been assigned the implementation of an ISMS, whose scope must cover both on premise and cloud infrastructure.

Within the CI/CD pipeline**\n\nIntegrating security tests within the CI/CD pipeline is crucial for ensuring that security checks are automated and occur at various stages of the development and deployment process. This approach allows for continuous security validation, ensuring that any vulnerabilities or issues are detected and addressed early in the development lifecycle. By embedding security into the CI/CD pipeline, teams can maintain the agility and speed of DevOps while ensuring that security is a fundamental component of the process.\n\nWhile security tests can also be performed in other places like a developer’s laptop or a CI/CD server, embedding them directly into the pipeline ensures that they are consistently applied across all builds and deployments, providing a more comprehensive and automated security posture.","timestamp":"1741779660.0","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"sai_murthy","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723474140.0","comment_id":"1148398","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBecause CI/CD pipelines offer an automated pathway into production, stricter access controls should be implemented for these systems, particularly build servers and code repositories.

In addition, the customer must be sure that any cloud usage does not jeopardize the organization’s compliance efforts.\n• CSP—The CSP is responsible for its own compliance requirements. A CSP also supports the customer by providing compliance details and any compliance certifications for the related service. This approach (i.e., compliance inheritance) helps the customer to include cloud services in its own compliance efforts.\n• CSP as a customer—A CSP may not be the sole provider of a cloud service.
