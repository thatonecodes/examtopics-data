Assess the business impact.\n\nBefore implementing any security measures or deciding to transfer the risk to a third party, the information security manager should first assess the business impact of the increased residual risk. Understanding the potential impact of the risk is important in order to prioritize and plan mitigation activities. Once the business impact is assessed, the organization can then make informed decisions about which security measures to implement, or whether to transfer the risk to a third party. Finally, it is important to communicate the information to senior management to ensure they are aware of the increased residual risk and can make informed decisions about how to manage it.","poster":"mad68","comment_id":"893124","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699543560.0"},{"timestamp":"1696809060.0","poster":"dark_3k03r","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe purpose of a business case is to aid in decision making (A)\n(b) it is not meant to represent stakeholders\n(c) it is not meant to provide a status update\n(d) due diligence is something that does go into a business case, but demonstration of it is not the goal.","comment_id":"865180"},{"timestamp":"1690291920.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"787819","content":"Selected Answer: A\nBUSINESS case is to show cost and benefit to decide purchasing","poster":"STUDYER2"},{"timestamp":"1689455400.0","comment_id":"777159","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Prospect57","content":"Selected Answer: D\nMy answer is D."},{"comment_id":"763186","poster":"MyKasala","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI guess C","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1688207820.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-01-01 13:37:00"},{"id":"Fp1PIXNNAThnWGk68JOn","unix_timestamp":1729511820,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ServerBrain","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
