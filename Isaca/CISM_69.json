A shorter time to closure indicates that the organization has a more efficient incident response process in place. It means that the incident was identified quickly, the appropriate actions were taken promptly and effectively, and the incident was resolved as soon as possible, minimizing the impact on the organization.

Separate security controls for applications, platforms, programs, and endpoints best describes the defense in depth strategy.\nDefense in depth strategy is a security approach that uses multiple layers of security controls to protect an organization's infrastructure. It is used to protect against various types of threats and vulnerabilities by creating multiple barriers that an attacker must bypass before reaching the target.\nIn this context, implementing separate security controls for applications, platforms, programs, and endpoints allows the organization to protect different aspects of its hybrid data infrastructure, which is composed of cloud and on-premises components. This approach can include different security solutions to provide different layers of protection, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, encryption, and access controls, among others. It can be used to protect the infrastructure, data, and applications, and help the organization to achieve a high level of security and compliance.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1673962080.0","poster":"Broesweelies","comment_id":"778956"},{"timestamp":"1672751400.0","poster":"MyKasala","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","comment_id":"764665"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"737894","content":"Selected Answer: A\ndepth strategy means A.","timestamp":"1670419320.0","poster":"aokisan","comments":[{"comment_id":"741794","content":"Disagree, B is layers of the onion, (defense in depth), ,ultiple different ways of protection","poster":"Ziggybooboo","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1670769960.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1671348420.0","comment_id":"748662","poster":"aokisan","comments":[{"poster":"fac161f","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725404760.0","comment_id":"1277864","content":"Your link supports answer B, which is best answer among the other options that reflects Defense in Depth in regard to layers."}],"upvote_count":"1","content":"https://www.buffalotech.com/blog-helpful-tips/defense-in-depth-a-comprehensive-strategy-for-evolving-cyberthreats\nDefense in depth is a holistic approach to cybersecurity. not onion."}]}]}],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An organization is in the process of adopting a hybrid data infrastructure, transferring all non-core applications to cloud service providers, and maintaining all core business functions in-house.
