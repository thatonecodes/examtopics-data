Additionally, without vendor support, the organization may struggle to obtain critical updates, security fixes, and technical assistance.

Traditionally, ROI goes beyond simple payback, or determining when the investment will pay for itself. It uses metrics such as net present value and the internal rate of return—which consider the value of money invested over time and the cost of the company's capital—to compare the cost of implementing an IT project with the financial benefits it provides. Depending on the project, those results can be operating-cost reductions, revenue growth, or both.

Certificates are used to bind a public key to a specific entity, and a certification authority's verification helps ensure the authenticity of the key.
