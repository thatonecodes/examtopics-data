Therefore, it is important to first evaluate the impact on the current disaster recovery capability and understand how prepared the organization is for a disaster or outage.\nIn the absence of a BIA, understanding the impact on the current disaster recovery capability is the first step towards improving the disaster recovery plan.

This could include something the user knows (like a password), something the user has (like a smartphone for receiving a verification code), or something the user is (like a fingerprint or facial recognition).
