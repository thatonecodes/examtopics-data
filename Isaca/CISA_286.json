SLAs define the agreed-upon levels of service, including performance expectations, availability targets, response times, and other key metrics. If SLAs are not established or are not properly monitored, there is a significant risk that the service provider may not deliver the expected level of service, leading to potential disruptions in IT resources.\nThe establishment and monitoring of SLAs are crucial for ensuring that the service provider meets the organization's objectives in terms of IT resource availability.","comment_id":"1069493","poster":"FAGFUR"},{"comment_id":"981250","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1727581380.0","comment_id":"1020402","content":"The absence of independent audit reports means that the organization does not have a reliable way to assess the performance and security of the third-party IT provider. Without these reports, it becomes difficult for the organization to verify that the provider is meeting its obligations, maintaining security standards, and delivering the promised IT services. This lack of transparency and accountability can lead to a higher risk of service disruptions or failures without the organization's knowledge, potentially impacting its objectives.\n\nWhile the other options (A, C, and D) also represent risks, the absence of independent audit reports can conceal a range of potential issues that could significantly disrupt IT services and, therefore, pose the greatest risk in this context."}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nthe primary concern of the IS auditor when an organization outsources a system to a cloud service provider should be ensuring the security and confidentiality of the organization's sensitive data.

This can provide benefits such as increased storage capacity, improved storage utilization, and easier management of storage resources. However, it is important for an IS auditor to confirm that redundancy is included in the storage architecture to ensure that the virtualized storage environment is resilient and can continue to function in the event of a hardware failure or other disruption.","poster":"Staanlee","upvote_count":"11"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1069498","poster":"FAGFUR","timestamp":"1731514560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhen an organization utilizes storage virtualization for key systems, the most important consideration for an IS auditor to confirm is whether redundancy is included in the storage architecture. Storage virtualization involves abstracting physical storage resources and presenting them as logical entities.
