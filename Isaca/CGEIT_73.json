Continuous monitoring.\n\nImplementing continuous monitoring is the best approach to address the trend of excessive exceptions to existing controls. Continuous monitoring involves real-time or near real-time monitoring of controls and processes to identify and address deviations or non-compliance promptly. By continuously monitoring the controls, the organization can detect and address issues early, reducing the need for exceptions and improving overall control effectiveness."},{"timestamp":"1664448660.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"454050","content":"why not B","poster":"WongY"}],"unix_timestamp":1632912660,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/63201-exam-cgeit-topic-1-question-97-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2021-09-29 12:51:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Independent audits","C":"A control library","D":"Risk awareness training","A":"Continuous monitoring"},"question_id":361,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Senior leadership is concerned about a recent trend of excessive exceptions to existing controls.

Interdependent systems.\n\nInterdependent systems are crucial to consider because ERP implementations often involve integrating various systems and processes across different departments or functions within an organization. If interdependencies between systems are overlooked, it can lead to significant disruptions in operations, data inconsistencies, and inefficiencies. This can result in costly delays, rework, and even failure of the ERP implementation project. Therefore, understanding and addressing the interdependencies between systems are essential to the success of an ERP implementation and can have the greatest impact on the enterprise if overlooked. While the other options (salvage value of legacy hardware, IT best practices, and vendor selection) are important factors to consider in the business case, they typically do not have as significant an impact on the enterprise as overlooking interdependent systems.","timestamp":"1726222200.0","comment_id":"1172524"},{"comment_id":"925512","content":"When developing a business case for an enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation, overlooking the interdependent systems would cause the GREATEST impact to the enterprise.\n\nC. Interdependent systems\n\nInterdependent systems refer to the various interconnected systems and processes within an organization that rely on or interact with the ERP system. These can include financial systems, supply chain management systems, customer relationship management systems, and more. When implementing an ERP system, it is crucial to consider the impact on these interdependent systems and ensure their seamless integration with the ERP solution.","timestamp":"1702762560.0","poster":"Frank1480","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1659755940.0","comment_id":"541479","upvote_count":"1","poster":"notwhatitsiems","content":"If we overlook the selection of our vendors, if we aren't specifying our security requirements, obtaining SOC reports/ getting other reports on the reputation, reliability and security of the vendor- we're introducing a whole world of risk into our organization. Off all the options, the vendor is the only external party, furthermore they're the only listed possible threat. If the relationship with our vendor deteriorates, the potential for harm to be done exponentially increases. There could be a compromise in our supply chain. We could be getting machines with stolen or illegitimate software- or even keyloggers or malware installed. ERP is vital to the organization meeting their objectives and if the external parties the organization chooses to do business with are not properly vetted, if assurance of their security cannot be ascertained, or if they renege on SLAs and fail to provide compensation, then the damage that can be done to the organization could be astronomical"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"473478","content":"C seems right","timestamp":"1651838100.0","poster":"John_Connor","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ramye","comments":[{"poster":"Ramye","timestamp":"1656982320.0","content":"I reread and understand the term interdependent systems.
