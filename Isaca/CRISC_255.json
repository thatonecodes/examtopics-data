Assessing loss expectancy.\n\nThe main reason for analyzing risk scenarios is to assess the loss expectancy associated with each scenario. This analysis helps organizations understand the potential impact and consequences of specific risks if they were to materialize. By quantifying the potential losses, organizations can prioritize their risk management efforts and allocate resources effectively to mitigate or manage the most critical risks.
