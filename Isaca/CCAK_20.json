Developing multiple lines of communication with the provider that provide visibility into upcoming changes to the product\n\nDeveloping multiple lines of communication with the cloud service provider is the most efficient way to stay informed about upcoming changes, allowing the customer organization to proactively assess and manage any potential impacts on compliance obligations. This approach ensures that the organization can plan and adapt to changes in a timely manner, adjusting their compliance strategies as needed.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D offer potential mitigations, they are more reactive and may involve significant costs or complexities. Establishing open and ongoing communication with the provider is a proactive strategy that helps the organization to continuously align its compliance efforts with the provider's product roadmap.","comment_id":"1410411"},{"poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: B\nP# 77 In general, cloud agreements require cloud customers to accept changes made by CSPs as they evolve their services. Those modifications can have drastic consequences for certain customers and must be monitored to ensure continuity of the customer’s operations. For example, the retirement of a feature might break a key functionality on which the customer depends, or it might impact user-facing controls.\nThe assessor should determine whether the cloud customer has an effective process in place to track and assess the impact of CSP changes in a timely way. The CSP agreement should be checked to determine whether customers are obliged to upgrade to the latest version of the service or if they can continue using the older version. If the cloud agreement allows the CSP to sunset any service within a set time, the customer may need to factor this risk into its own change plans.","comment_id":"1150631","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723672800.0"}],"question_id":96,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Requiring that the source code for the provider product be held in escrow with an independent third party","B":"Developing multiple lines of communication with the provider that provide visibility into upcoming changes to the product","C":"Maintaining a failover processing agreement with another provider offering a similar product","A":"Including a break clause in the provider processing contract to be activated in the event of significant product change"},"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":153},{"id":"8N77QkzhaUDsr5cTr1xo","topic":"1","question_id":97,"answers_community":["C (83%)","D (17%)"],"exam_id":153,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/102705-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-19-discussion/","choices":{"D":"The cloud provider fails to report a breach of customer personal data from an unsecured server, resulting in GDPR fines of 10 million euro.","A":"A hacker using a stolen administrator identity brings down the SaaS sales and marketing systems, resulting in the inability to process customer orders or manage customer relationships.","C":"A DDoS attack renders the customer's cloud inaccessible for 24 hours resulting in millions in lost sales.","B":"While the breach was reported in a timely manner to the CEO, the CFO and CISO blamed each other in public, resulting in a loss of public confidence that led the board to replace all three."},"timestamp":"2023-03-15 16:32:00","question_text":"Which of the following is an example of financial business impact?","answer":"C","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1678894320,"answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Risk appetite is the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives, and senior management is tasked with setting this threshold based on the organization's strategic goals, regulatory obligations, and overall risk management framework.

The audit logs are overwritten every 30 days, and all past audit trail is lost.\n\nThe greatest concern for the auditor should be the fact that audit logs are overwritten every 30 days, leading to the loss of past audit trails. This issue poses a significant risk to accountability, traceability, and compliance, as maintaining a historical record of events is crucial for forensic investigations, monitoring, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Without adequate retention of audit logs, the organization may be unable to detect or respond to security incidents effectively, and it could face challenges in demonstrating compliance during audits. \n\nWhile options A, B, and D present concerns, they do not pose as immediate and critical a risk as the complete loss of audit trails due to short retention periods.","comment_id":"1410414","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742999220.0","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"poster":"4f2a581","content":"Answer is C","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721979720.0","comment_id":"1255562"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nCCAK P# 197 Cloud infrastructures are rapidly evolving, and new concepts and technologies, such as serverless, are being adopted.

SOC 2\n\nSOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is most relevant for assurance over trust principles applicable to cloud security auditing. SOC 2 reports are specifically designed to address a service organization's controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. These trust service criteria are particularly applicable to cloud environments, where assurance regarding these principles is often necessary for users of the service.\n\nWhile ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 are important standards for information security management systems, they are not specifically focused on providing assurance over the trust principles in the context of cloud security auditing. SOC 1, on the other hand, is focused on controls over financial reporting, making it less relevant for cloud security audits."},{"comments":[{"poster":"4f2a581","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1255564","timestamp":"1721979900.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1721979960.0","poster":"4f2a581","comment_id":"1255566","upvote_count":"1","content":"No, Answer is C"}],"content":"Answer is D Actually"}],"timestamp":"1721979840.0","comment_id":"1255563","upvote_count":"1","poster":"4f2a581","content":"Answer is A"}],"choices":{"D":"SOC 1","A":"ISO 27002","C":"SOC 2","B":"ISO 27001"},"answer":"C","topic":"1","question_id":100,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1721979840,"exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/144554-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-192-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following standards is MOST relevant for assurance over trust principles applicable to cloud security auditing?","timestamp":"2024-07-26 09:44:00","isMC":true}],"exam":{"name":"CCAK","provider":"Isaca","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"id":153,"numberOfQuestions":258,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":20},"__N_SSP":true}
