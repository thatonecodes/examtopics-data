If we reduce residual risk, we cannot \"reallocate\" the budget, because the residual risk was achieved through internal controls (and hence the resource was spent).\n\nReduction in inherent risk however, would ensure that the resources earmarked for that particular risk mitigation could get \"reallocated\" to new security initiative because the former's inherent risk is reduced. Typical example I could think of is, turning off a specific module in a software application that was causing the risk, could reduce the inherent risk in that software itself to below acceptable risk levels of the organization.","comment_id":"859307","upvote_count":"1","poster":"jseeker"},{"timestamp":"1695852900.0","poster":"Koulyo","content":"Inherent risk can not be reduced. it either exists or not.","comment_id":"852519","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"821694","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1692976620.0"},{"timestamp":"1692543720.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree.","comment_id":"815571"},{"content":"I believe C is correct Residual Risk are the risks left after action is taken to reduce the Inherent risks.

It provides a comprehensive list of risks facing the organization and includes information such as the likelihood and impact of the risks, the current status of risk mitigation measures, and the ownership and accountability for each risk. Reviewing the risk register helps an organization to gain insight into the scope and severity of its risks, and to prioritize actions to manage those risks effectively.\n\nThe threat landscape, on the other hand, is a broader view of the types of threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the environment. While it is important to understand the threat landscape, the risk register provides a more detailed and focused view of the specific risks that the organization faces and the steps that are being taken to manage those risks.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"john_boogieman"}],"choices":{"A":"Threat landscape","D":"Risk register","B":"Risk metrics","C":"Risk appetite"}},{"id":"ibDPDmq3apA8d6UJWvAk","topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"K5000ism","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
