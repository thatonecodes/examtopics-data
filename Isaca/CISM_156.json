The role of the security manager is to ensure that appropriate controls are included in the contract.

However, the MOST important consideration may vary depending on the specific context and requirements of the organization. \n\nThat being said, if we have to choose the option that is generally considered crucial in such a scenario, it would be:\n\nA. The conversion has been approved by the information security team.\n\nObtaining approval from the information security team ensures that the migration process aligns with the organization's security policies and standards. The security team assesses the potential risks and mitigations associated with moving sensitive data to the cloud, and their approval indicates that the necessary security measures have been implemented or planned. This helps in minimizing the chances of data breaches or unauthorized access during and after the migration.","poster":"koala_lay","timestamp":"1695206580.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"oluchecpoint","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Data encryption is used in the cloud hosting solution.\n\nData encryption ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains protected and unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys. While the other options are also important in the context of cloud migration, such as approval from the information security team, a right to audit clause in the contract, and input from data owners, data encryption is the fundamental security measure that safeguards sensitive information from potential breaches or data leaks in a cloud environment. It forms a critical layer of security for data at rest and in transit in the cloud, and it should be a top priority when moving sensitive data to the cloud.","comment_id":"1002258","timestamp":"1694158560.0"},{"poster":"richck102","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1688015040.0","content":"D.

Information security governance is the process of establishing and maintaining a framework that ensures an organization's information security practices and measures are aligned with its overall business goals and objectives. While reducing risk to an acceptable level is an important aspect of information security governance, the ultimate aim is to ensure that security measures support and enhance the organization's broader business objectives.
