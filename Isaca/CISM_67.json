Penetration testing\n\nAmong the options provided, penetration testing is the most practical and direct method for identifying security control gaps on an application server. Penetration testing involves simulating cyber attacks against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities.

Here's why:\nProactive Approach: Threat modeling is a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating security risks. It involves systematically analyzing an application's design and architecture to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.\nEarly Detection: Threat models can uncover security control gaps early in the development or deployment process, allowing organizations to address issues before they become vulnerabilities.\nComprehensive Understanding: Threat models provide a comprehensive understanding of potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to the application server, helping organizations tailor their security controls to address these risks effectively.","poster":"ImTired","timestamp":"1711522140.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"oluchecpoint","timestamp":"1711393260.0","comment_id":"1017023","content":"Selected Answer: B\nPT involves simulating real-world attacks on an application server to identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.

Penetration testing is the most useful information for identifying security control gaps on an application server. Penetration testing is a proactive approach to identifying vulnerabilities in an application or system by simulating a real-world attack. It can identify security control gaps, configuration issues, and potential exploits that could be leveraged by attackers.

It provides a real-world assessment of the security posture of an application server and can help identify security control gaps that may not have been identified through other means.\n\nRisk assessments, threat models, and internal audit reports can also be useful in identifying security control gaps, but they tend to be more focused on identifying risks and compliance issues rather than actively testing the system to find vulnerabilities. Therefore, while they can be valuable tools in a comprehensive security assessment, they may not provide the same level of insight into security control gaps as penetration testing.
