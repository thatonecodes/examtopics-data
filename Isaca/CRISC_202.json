However, they may not have the authority or expertise to establish cybersecurity controls across the entire organization.\n\nThe security management function, on the other hand, is responsible for the overall cybersecurity posture of the organization, including the development and implementation of controls that address risks across the enterprise. Therefore, while the risk owner has an important role to play in cybersecurity, they are not typically the primary party responsible for ensuring effective cybersecurity controls are established.","poster":"naifitno","comments":[{"timestamp":"1696637220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"863371","poster":"Koulyo","content":"q is on accountability and not responsibility."}],"timestamp":"1693927500.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"830132"},{"poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"822777","timestamp":"1693065660.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree.","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"aki","timestamp":"1692955680.0","content":"why not A?","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"821422"}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-02-25 12:28:00","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1677324480,"question_id":1007,"answers_community":["C (60%)","A (40%)"]},{"id":"HPmlR0CQkWfc3PpdWbqD","choices":{"C":"Risk response","D":"Risk tolerance","B":"Risk magnitude","A":"Risk appetite"},"isMC":true,"answer":"B","timestamp":"2021-02-16 03:37:00","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"858757","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727866380.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B."},{"poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1723394940.0","comment_id":"805536","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree."},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689814920.0","comment_id":"528103","poster":"Raj1510","content":"Heat map , is impact vs frequency which represent the risk magnitude .
