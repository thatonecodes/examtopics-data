In the context of exam questions, it also seems to be a risk mitigation approach. Risk avoidance in this scenario is only for the risk of flooding, which is not a too standard case.","comment_id":"660812","upvote_count":"9","timestamp":"1662440340.0"},{"upvote_count":"8","poster":"ObaidMan","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe approach that has been adopted in this scenario is D. Risk avoidance.\n\nRisk avoidance involves taking actions to eliminate or avoid the risk altogether. In this case, the decision to move data center operations to another facility on higher ground is a proactive measure to avoid the potential risk of flooding near the current data center location. By relocating the data center to a safer location, the organization is actively avoiding the risk associated with potential flooding.","comment_id":"922403","timestamp":"1686675180.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nwe are avoid the place to have data center","comment_id":"1364771","timestamp":"1741069680.0","poster":"rangaraj"},{"comment_id":"1330834","poster":"roxannebadenhorst","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nRisk avoidance involves eliminating the risk entirely by deciding not to engage in the activity or exposure that gives rise to the risk. In this case, moving the data center to higher ground is a proactive measure to avoid the risk of flooding altogether.\n\nWhy not the others?\nA. Risk reduction: Risk reduction involves implementing controls to minimize the likelihood or impact of a risk. For example, building flood barriers or enhancing drainage systems would be risk reduction. Moving the data center eliminates the risk entirely rather than reducing it.\n\nB. Risk acceptance: Risk acceptance means recognizing a risk and choosing to live with it without taking action. In this case, management is taking decisive action to address the risk, not accepting it.\n\nC. Risk transfer: Risk transfer involves shifting the financial consequences of a risk to a third party, such as purchasing flood insurance. Moving the data center does not involve transferring the risk to another party.","timestamp":"1734963480.0"},{"timestamp":"1733912940.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1324971","poster":"Eiad1100","content":"Selected Answer: D\nRisk avoidance involves taking actions to completely eliminate a risk by avoiding the activities or circumstances that create it.
