Perform a business impact analysis (BIA) should be done next.\n\nBefore migrating the IT infrastructure of the acquired company to the parent company's IT infrastructure, it is important to perform a business impact analysis (BIA) to assess the impact on the business operations of both companies. A BIA helps to identify critical business processes, applications, and data that are essential for the continued operation of the business. This analysis will help to ensure that the IT infrastructure migration is performed in a way that minimizes disruption to the business operations of both companies.\n\nOnce the BIA is completed, the results can be used to conduct a gap analysis to identify any gaps in the IT infrastructure and processes that need to be addressed before the migration takes place. An update to the enterprise architecture (EA) may also be necessary, depending on the results of the BIA and gap analysis. Finally, a communication plan can be developed to support the merger, but this should be done after the BIA and gap analysis have been completed.","timestamp":"1692098580.0","comment_id":"809575","poster":"Frank1480"},{"comments":[{"poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"1","content":"B.
