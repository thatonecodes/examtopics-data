An increase in control vulnerabilities\nWhen uncontrolled changes are made to the control environment, the greatest concern is the potential increase in control vulnerabilities. Uncontrolled changes can introduce new weaknesses, gaps, or flaws in the control structure that may be exploited by threat actors. This can lead to a higher likelihood of control failures and security breaches.\n\nWhile options B (an increase in inherent risk), C (a decrease in control layering effectiveness), and D (an increase in the level of residual risk) are also relevant considerations, control vulnerabilities are typically the most immediate and significant concern when changes to the control environment are not properly managed or controlled.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723913880.0"},{"comment_id":"859559","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer should be D. Your inherent risk stays the same unless you start new business activities. It is the risk that exists without controls. The controls modify the inherent risk to give you residual risk. If there is a control in place, modifications to the control could impact the amount of risk that is being mitigated which would result in a change in residual risk.","timestamp":"1712121960.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree.","timestamp":"1708625940.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"818202"},{"comment_id":"811274","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708132560.0","content":"should be D","poster":"Julianleehk"}],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1618847040,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following is of GREATEST concern when uncontrolled changes are made to the control environment?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/50486-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-633-discussion/","answers_community":["D (80%)","A (20%)"]},{"id":"mirMjKcNuAarJZIJncqE","question_id":1044,"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104934-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-634-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-04-03 07:29:00","choices":{"B":"Budget allocated to the BYOD program security controls","D":"Number of users who have signed a BYOD acceptable use policy","C":"Number of devices enrolled in the BYOD program","A":"Number of incidents originating from BYOD devices"},"answer":"A","topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"exam_id":160,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"859561","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1727933340.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following key risk indicators (KRIs) is MOST effective for monitoring risk related to a bring your own device (BYOD) program?","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1680499740},{"id":"dZL8MYdbQNe6jIqL9sjn","discussion":[{"poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"996412","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Build a risk profile for management review.\n\nThe primary benefit of maintaining an up-to-date risk register is to build a risk profile for management review. A risk register is a tool that helps an organization document and track its identified risks, including their likelihood, impact, and mitigating controls. By maintaining an up-to-date risk register, an organization can have a comprehensive view of its risk landscape, which is essential for informed decision-making and risk management. It helps management understand the nature and extent of risks facing the organization, prioritize risk mitigation efforts, and allocate resources effectively. While uniform controls and risk distribution are important considerations, they are not the primary purpose of a risk register.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725225120.0"},{"poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","comment_id":"859564","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712122320.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104935-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-635-discussion/","exam_id":160,"choices":{"B":"build a risk profile for management review","D":"implement uniform controls for common risk scenarios","C":"quantify the organization's risk appetite","A":"ensure business unit risk uniformly distributed"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1680499920,"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-04-03 07:32:00","question_id":1045,"question_images":[],"question_text":"The PRIMARY benefit of maintaining an up-to-date risk register is that it helps to:"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"name":"CRISC","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Isaca","id":160,"numberOfQuestions":1422,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":209},"__N_SSP":true}
