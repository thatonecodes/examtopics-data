Therefore, while underutilization of the new server is a valid concern, it may not be the greatest concern compared to other factors such as maintenance coordination in the context of consolidating applications onto a new server.","comment_id":"1207287"},{"comment_id":"1195354","timestamp":"1728890460.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSystem maintenance to ensure compatibility is needed","upvote_count":"1","poster":"joehong"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhen consolidating several applications onto a new server, the greatest concern is the risk that the new server will not be fully utilized after migration (C). This is because underutilization of the new server means that the investment in hardware is not being maximized, leading to inefficiencies in resource usage and potentially higher costs in the long run.","poster":"mdh717","comment_id":"1189340","timestamp":"1728046920.0"},{"timestamp":"1724426040.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"ChatGpt: C. The new server will not be fully utilized after migration.\n\nConsolidating applications from multiple servers onto a single new server can lead to underutilization of resources if the new server is not properly configured or if the applications do not have consistent resource demands.

When employees are better educated about phishing and other social engineering attacks through security awareness training, they are more likely to recognize suspicious emails and report them to the appropriate authorities. This demonstrates that the security awareness program is effectively educating employees and empowering them to take proactive measures to protect the organization against cyber threats. On the other hand, a decrease in the number of malware outbreaks could indicate improved security measures overall but might not necessarily reflect the effectiveness of the security awareness program specifically. Therefore, an increase in reported phishing emails is typically a stronger indicator of the program's effectiveness."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"ChatGPT: B. A decrease in the number of malware outbreaks.\n\nWhile all the options could be positive signs, a decrease in the number of malware outbreaks directly reflects the impact of improved security awareness among employees. It suggests that employees are becoming more vigilant and proactive in identifying and avoiding potential security threats, which is a primary objective of security awareness training programs. Therefore, a reduction in malware outbreaks is a strong indicator of the effectiveness of the security awareness program in improving overall security posture.","comments":[{"content":"I am not sure about option B.

However, before addressing the BCP directly, the auditor should first assess whether the business impact analysis (BIA) is up to date. The BIA identifies critical business functions, dependencies, and potential impacts of disruptions, which forms the foundation for the BCP. Given that the organization recently closed a production plant, it's important to understand how this change impacts the organization's structure and operations. Therefore, verifying the currency and accuracy of the BIA is the initial step in assessing the organization's readiness to address the closure of the plant and any other potential disruptions.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732626960.0"}],"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1716722160,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/141288-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1398-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":""},{"id":"Jynns0VFYH6LJh9BYVPB","unix_timestamp":1708710780,"timestamp":"2024-02-23 18:53:00","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following would be of GREATEST concern to an IS auditor assessing the organizational risk associated with fraud?","question_id":345,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption A","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1280928","timestamp":"1725890220.0","poster":"PurpleParrot"},{"poster":"RS66","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Proper access controls are crucial in preventing unauthorized access to financial data and systems, which could be exploited by individuals intending to commit fraud. Inconsistent reviews may result in outdated user access permissions, potentially allowing unauthorized users to manipulate financial data or perform fraudulent activities without detection. This could lead to financial losses, regulatory compliance issues, and damage to the organization's reputation.

The organization does not require employees to take mandatory leave.\n\nThis practice, known as \"mandatory leave\" or \"forced vacation,\" is a preventive control measure commonly used to mitigate the risk of fraud. Requiring employees to take time off allows for their work to be scrutinized by others in their absence, making it more difficult for fraudulent activities to go undetected.
