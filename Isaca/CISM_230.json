Conducting a tabletop exercise\n\nConducting a tabletop exercise is generally considered the best way to determine the effectiveness of an incident response plan. Tabletop exercises simulate real-world incidents in a controlled environment, allowing organizations to assess how well their incident response plan works in practice. During a tabletop exercise, participants can identify weaknesses in the plan, test the communication and coordination among team members, and identify areas for improvement. This hands-on approach provides valuable insights and helps organizations refine their incident response plan to ensure it is effective when a real incident occurs.","poster":"oluchecpoint","comment_id":"1004531","timestamp":"1694418360.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"982220","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AaronS1990","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgreed, this must be D","timestamp":"1692164700.0"},{"timestamp":"1691742540.0","poster":"Ewunia","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nfor me D","comment_id":"978455"},{"timestamp":"1691586720.0","poster":"Aleksandra1987","content":"D for sure","comment_id":"976671","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"975050","poster":"paul1394","comments":[{"comment_id":"1006448","content":"Well explained.
