Ensuring that key controls are embedded in the processes\n\nBy embedding key controls directly into IT processes, organizations can:\n\nAutomate compliance: Many controls can be automated, reducing the risk of human error.\nProactive enforcement: Controls can be designed to prevent non-compliant actions, rather than just detecting them after the fact.\nContinuous monitoring: Embedded controls can be monitored continuously to identify and address potential issues early on.\nWhile training, resource allocation, and risk management are important, they are more focused on preventing and mitigating risks rather than enforcing compliance directly.

Ensuring that key controls are embedded in the processes\n\nEmbedding key controls directly into IT processes is a proactive and preventative approach to ensure compliance with information security policies. This means that security measures and requirements are integrated into the processes themselves, making it difficult for the processes to deviate from the established policies. By doing this, you reduce the likelihood of non-compliance and security breaches. While the other options (providing policy training, allocating resources, and identifying risks) are important, they are complementary measures and may not be as effective as embedding controls within the processes themselves.","timestamp":"1709706420.0","comment_id":"1000159","poster":"oluchecpoint"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1708612680.0","comment_id":"987438","poster":"Hugo1717","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A.
