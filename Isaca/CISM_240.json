Update the detection patterns on the web application firewall.\n\nBy updating the detection patterns on the web application firewall, you can enhance its ability to recognize and block the specific patterns associated with the SQL injection attack. This proactive measure allows the WAF to better identify and prevent similar attack patterns in the future, providing a more robust defense against SQL injection attacks.\n\nWhile options like blocking the IPs (Option D) or reconfiguring the web application firewall to block the attack (Option B) can be part of the response strategy, updating the detection patterns is a more precise and focused approach to mitigating the specific type of attack. It allows for a targeted response without disrupting legitimate traffic.","timestamp":"1721821500.0"},{"comment_id":"1113752","timestamp":"1720095960.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf Waf was able to detect, it is easy to switch into prevent.

However, it may not be effective if the attackers are using multiple IP addresses or if they are using techniques such as IP spoofing.\n\nUpdating the detection patterns on the web application firewall (option C) is often the best approach because it allows the firewall to better identify and block SQL injection attacks. By updating the detection patterns, the firewall can recognize the specific patterns or signatures associated with SQL injection attacks and take appropriate action to block or mitigate them. This approach is generally more flexible and adaptable to new attack techniques compared to simply blocking IP addresses or reconfiguring the firewall.","comment_id":"1052669","upvote_count":"1","poster":"koala_lay","timestamp":"1713949080.0"},{"timestamp":"1713594900.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

When a web application firewall (WAF) detects an SQL injection attack, it is important to take appropriate measures to contain and mitigate the attack.\nIn summary, updating the detection patterns on the web application firewall is the best way to contain an SQL injection attack that has been detected. It enhances the WAF's ability to identify and block the attack, providing immediate containment and reducing the risk of further exploitation.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1043138","timestamp":"1713071820.0"},{"comments":[],"poster":"CISSPST","timestamp":"1711190280.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe WAF detected the SQL injection attack but was obviously unable to prevent it.

RCA at this stage is aimed at understanding how the threat entered and escalated within the system, to ensure complete removal. The urgency is on addressing the incident and securing the environment.\n\nDuring PIR, the emphasis shifts to a broader analysis and reflection. Here, RCA is revisited or expanded upon with the benefit of hindsight, more data, and a less pressured environment compared to the active incident response. This review aims to refine the incident response process, improve security postures, and ensure better preparedness for future incidents.\n\nThe distinction here is not so much about when RCA is performed, as it is critical at multiple stages, but rather about the depth and breadth of analysis.","timestamp":"1731736620.0","comment_id":"1212225","upvote_count":"1","poster":"helg420"}],"timestamp":"1709841540.0","content":"Isn't root cause essential in eradication phase?","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1001814","poster":"iacini"}],"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"provider":"Isaca","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"CISM","numberOfQuestions":1247,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":157,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":240},"__N_SSP":true}
