Monitoring key access control performance indicators.\n\nThe best approach to provide an early warning that network access of terminated employees is not being revoked in accordance with the service level agreement (SLA) is \"A. Monitoring key access control performance indicators.\" By monitoring key access control performance indicators, such as access revocation timeliness, organizations can identify any delays or issues in revoking access for terminated employees. This approach allows for proactive detection and remediation of access control violations.\n\nUpdating multi-factor authentication (option B) and analyzing access control logs for suspicious activity (option C) are important security practices, but they may not directly address the specific concern of monitoring terminated employee access. Revising the service level agreement (SLA) (option D) might be necessary if SLA terms need adjustment, but it doesn't provide a direct early warning mechanism for access control violations."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A.

Controls that are directly applicable and tailored to the process have a higher likelihood of effectively mitigating the associated risk.\n\nWhile the other factors (comparison against best practice, regulatory compliance requirements, cost-benefit analysis) are also important considerations, they should be evaluated in the context of how well they align with the business process's unique characteristics and risk profile.

The control should be designed to address those risks and be tailored to the unique requirements and characteristics of that process. Therefore, the control's relevance to the business process is crucial in ensuring that the control effectively mitigates the risks it is intended to address.\n\nWhile cost-benefit analysis is also an important consideration, it should not be the only factor considered when selecting a control.
