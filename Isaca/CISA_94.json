Maintenance of hardware and software compatibility:\nThe GREATEST concern for the IS auditor when reviewing a reciprocal disaster recovery agreement should be the maintenance of hardware and software compatibility between the two organizations. Ensuring that the systems, applications, and infrastructure of the two organizations are compatible is crucial for the agreement to work effectively in the event of a disaster. If the hardware and software are not compatible, it can prevent the successful failover and recovery of critical systems, rendering the entire agreement ineffective.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1252694","poster":"seeta","timestamp":"1721591940.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1721591940,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","question_id":466,"choices":{"A":"Right to terminate the agreement","C":"Frequency of system testing","D":"Maintenance of hardware and software compatibility","B":"Differences in IT policies and procedures"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/144360-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1624-discussion/","exam_id":156,"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"rPsRreKofHqY8DCNaHSF","answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (57%)","A (43%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/144139-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1625-discussion/","question_text":"As part of control self-assessment (CSA) activities in the finance department, an IS auditor identified that some of the controls were not tested and documented properly.
