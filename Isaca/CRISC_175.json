Relevant risk scenarios that do not appear in the generic list may not be assessed\n\nWhile using an industry-based generic list can help to start the risk management process, it might miss risks that are specific to the organization's unique context, operations, or environment. If those specific risks are not included in the generic list, they may not be assessed at all, which would leave the organization exposed to unidentified and unmanaged risks. Hence, the biggest concern with this approach would be the potential overlooking of relevant risk scenarios unique to the organization.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1199248","poster":"8e1c45b","timestamp":"1729441260.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Did you pass the exam?"}],"comment_id":"963916"},{"timestamp":"1691353620.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"800340","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree 'D'."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"760886","poster":"Suchib","content":"Its D, all risk need to be identified for consideration.","timestamp":"1688027520.0"},{"timestamp":"1679313720.0","content":"D makes sense","poster":"johnwalters","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"674015"},{"comment_id":"524551","timestamp":"1657930260.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Raj1510","content":"I will go with D"},{"content":"I would have picked D.

Accept\n\nAccepting the risk is often the most appropriate response when the cost of implementing controls to mitigate the risk is greater than the potential loss from the risk itself. In this case, it would not be cost-effective to spend more on controls than the expected loss due to the risk. Risk acceptance means that the organization acknowledges the risk and decides to bear any potential losses or impacts without taking further action to control or mitigate the risk."},{"poster":"Bertolini","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\nCan you avoid \"a critical, proprietary business function\"?

Transfer\n\nIf the annualized cost of control (the cost of implementing and maintaining the control over a year) is higher than the annual loss expectancy (the financial impact the organization would experience if the risk occurred over the course of a year), then it might not be cost-effective to mitigate the risk directly. Instead, it may be more efficient to transfer the risk, which could involve buying insurance or outsourcing the risky operation to another entity.

Cultivate long-term behavioral change\n\nThe primary goal of an IT risk awareness program should be to cultivate long-term behavioral change among employees and other participants. This will ensure that they understand and adhere to the organization's risk management practices and policies on an ongoing basis, reducing the overall risk to the organization's IT environment.
