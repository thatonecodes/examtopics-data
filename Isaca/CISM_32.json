As far as the technical part, that's all IT. \n\nIf the wording said \"initiating the removal of the terminated employees\" then HR would be correct. But this is about the removal of actual access.

However, the MOST critical function is still information security. Information security is responsible for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information, and the removal of system access for terminated employees is a critical step in maintaining the security of this information.\n\nInformation security must ensure that all necessary steps are taken to remove the terminated employee's access to sensitive information, including revoking all user accounts, disabling access to systems and applications, and removing any network access privileges. Help desk and legal functions may also be involved in the process, but their role is secondary to that of information security in ensuring the security of sensitive information.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1691011200.0","poster":"ccKane"}],"exam_id":157,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/97704-exam-cism-topic-1-question-114-discussion/"},{"id":"xtbAH4BjBei6zkdSsTtV","question_text":"Which of the following BEST helps to ensure the effective execution of an organization's disaster recovery plan (DRP)?","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1184337","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe question asks for effective execution, so if the DR team created the process steps, they will be best in position to execute it.
