Involving security personnel in the procurement process allows the organization to identify and address potential security risks early on, before a contract is signed. This helps ensure that security requirements are included in the contract and that the third-party vendor is aware of and committed to meeting the organization's security standards. By having security involved in the procurement process, the organization can also ensure that the third-party vendor has adequate security controls in place to protect sensitive information and critical assets.
