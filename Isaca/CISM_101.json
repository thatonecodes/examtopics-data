Identifying unacceptable risk levels.\n\nExplanation: When preventive controls to mitigate risk are not feasible, the most important action for the information security manager is to identify unacceptable risk levels.\n\nHere's why this option is the most important:\n\nA. Identifying unacceptable risk levels: In situations where preventive controls are not feasible, it's important to assess the potential risks that remain and determine if they are at an unacceptable level for the organization. Identifying unacceptable risk levels helps prioritize resources for appropriate risk treatment strategies, which could include alternative controls, risk acceptance, risk avoidance, or risk transfer.\nD.

Identifying unacceptable risk levels.\n\nIn situations where preventive controls cannot adequately mitigate the identified risks, it is crucial for the information security manager to identify and understand the unacceptable risk levels. This involves assessing the potential impact and likelihood of the risks materializing and determining whether they exceed the organization's risk tolerance or acceptable levels of risk. By identifying unacceptable risk levels, the information security manager can focus on implementing appropriate risk management strategies, such as risk acceptance, risk transfer, or risk mitigation through other means.","comment_id":"896512","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mad68"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713113760.0","poster":"Abhey","comment_id":"870347","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen preventive controls to appropriately mitigate risk are not feasible, the MOST important action for the information security manager is to identify unacceptable risk levels.
