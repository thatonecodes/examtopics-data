This reduces the potential exposure in the event of a data breach because even if the data is compromised, it no longer contains direct identifiers that could be used to re-identify individuals. De-identification can be implemented in such a way that traceability is maintained, often through pseudonymization, where data can still be re-associated with the original individuals under specific controlled circumstances (e.g., with a key stored separately).","comment_id":"1281549"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1178638","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf there is a potential exposure the de-identified data will pose less of a privacy risk.","poster":"ARaghunanan","timestamp":"1710963120.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"Require a digital signature.","C":"Use a unique hashing algorithm.","A":"Encrypt the data at rest.","B":"De-identify the data."},"exam_id":154,"unix_timestamp":1710963120,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/136761-exam-cdpse-topic-1-question-57-discussion/"},{"id":"Aye04xqGTEuUKAKmjntO","choices":{"B":"Knowledge-based credential authentication","D":"Biometric authentication","C":"Multi-factor authentication","A":"Possession factor authentication"},"answer":"C","question_text":"Which authentication practice is being used when an organization requires a photo on a government-issued identification card to validate an in-person credit card purchase?","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"exam_id":154,"timestamp":"2023-08-14 22:42:00","question_id":194,"unix_timestamp":1692045720,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/118114-exam-cdpse-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
