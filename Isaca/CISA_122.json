It underpins the CASB’s ability to provide visibility, enforce risk-based policies, and protect the organization’s cloud environment effectively. Without proper classification, the CASB cannot prioritize its security measures, potentially leaving critical services vulnerable or over-restricting benign ones. While central user management, resilient processes, and periodic recertification contribute to overall security, they are either supplementary to or outside the CASB’s primary role.
