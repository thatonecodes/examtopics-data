Risk acceptance means that no action is taken relative to a particular risk; loss is accepted if it occurs. If an enterprise adopts a risk acceptance, it should carefully consider who can accept the risk. Risk should be accepted only by senior management in relationship with senior management and the board. There are two alternatives to the acceptance strategy, passive and active.\n✑ Passive acceptance means that enterprise has made no plan to avoid or mitigate the risk but willing to accept the consequences of the risk.\nActive acceptance is the second strategy and might include developing contingency plans and reserves to deal with risks.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nA, B, C: These all are used to deal with opportunities or positive risks, and not with negative risks.","isMC":true},{"id":"RxRVbIQH8apmFI616blD","topic":"1","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/54139-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-720-discussion/","timestamp":"2021-06-01 22:13:00","answer_ET":"A","question_id":1133,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"The information security budget must be justified.","A":"The risk environment is subject to change.","D":"New system vulnerabilities emerge at frequent intervals.","C":"Emerging risk must be continuously reported to management."},"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"exam_id":160,"unix_timestamp":1622578380,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1654114380.0","content":"This is correct.

The risk environment is subject to change.\n\nThe primary reason to perform ongoing risk assessments is that the risk environment is subject to change. Risk is not static; it evolves over time due to various factors such as changes in technology, business operations, external threats, regulations, and emerging vulnerabilities. Regular risk assessments help organizations stay up-to-date with these changes and ensure that their risk management strategies remain effective and aligned with the current state of the organization.","poster":"Staanlee","timestamp":"1725401400.0","comment_id":"997994"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"865587","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1712674080.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A."}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following is the PRIMARY reason to perform ongoing risk assessments?"},{"id":"AJiEWMOIX0vuainmG3nA","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/75636-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-721-discussion/","answers_community":["D (56%)","B (44%)"],"choices":{"C":"To identify dependencies for reporting risk","A":"To provide consistent and clear terminology","D":"To enable consistent data on risk to be obtained","B":"To allow for proper review of risk tolerance"},"discussion":[{"poster":"faed87a","timestamp":"1742404740.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nthe answer is D the key word is \" aggregated \"\n\nAggregation of IT risk means gathering risk data from multiple sources and standardizing it to provide a holistic view.
