Identification of appropriate controls\n\nThe most important benefit of implementing a data classification program is the identification of appropriate controls. Data classification involves categorizing data based on its sensitivity, criticality, and regulatory requirements. Once data is classified, organizations can determine the level of protection required for each category and implement controls accordingly. This ensures that security measures, access controls, encryption, and other protective measures are applied proportionally to the value and sensitivity of the data.","comment_id":"1112260","timestamp":"1719948240.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"K5000ism"}],"unix_timestamp":1704230640,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"UiJN8UrUnVZ58rW25gpC","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/130149-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1543-discussion/","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"Risk management practices are audited on an annual basis.","A":"The number of incidents has decreased over time.","B":"Risk management practices are incorporated into business processes.","C":"Industry benchmarking is performed on an annual basis."},"topic":"1","answer":"B","exam_id":160,"question_id":564,"timestamp":"2024-01-02 22:28:00","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1704230880,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719948480.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1112261","poster":"K5000ism","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
