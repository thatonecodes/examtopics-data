If these compensating controls are present, the overall control environment may still be considered effective despite the shortcomings of certain controls.\n\nWhile accepting residual risk, having a control mitigation plan, or having effective risk management might be part of a larger risk management strategy, none of them inherently ensure an effective control environment when existing controls are found to be inadequate.
