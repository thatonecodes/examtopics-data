The SIEM is decentralized.\n\nThe greatest concern when reviewing an organization's security information and event management (SIEM) solution would be if the SIEM is decentralized (Option D). A decentralized SIEM could lead to fragmented data, incomplete visibility, and difficulties in effectively monitoring and responding to security incidents. A centralized SIEM allows for consistent monitoring, analysis, and response across the organization's entire infrastructure, enhancing security and reducing blind spots.","poster":"lsiau76","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"886823","timestamp":"1682984460.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"007Georgeo","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
