The assessment provides an in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of these processes, helping stakeholders understand how well the provider's security practices align with industry standards and best practices. This understanding helps organizations make informed decisions about the security posture and reliability of the cloud services they intend to use. While the assessment may touch on security posture and control effectiveness, its primary focus is on evaluating process maturity and identifying areas for improvement.","timestamp":"1742999760.0","comment_id":"1410424","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1150886","timestamp":"1723710360.0","poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: C\nP# 376 The CSA STAR Certification is a rigorous third-party independent assessment of the security of a CSP, leveraging the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 management system standard with the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix.

Reporting tools are reliable and based on defined objectives.\n\nIn continuous auditing, it is crucial for a third-party auditor to verify that reporting tools are reliable and based on defined objectives. Reliable reporting tools ensure that data is accurately captured, processed, and presented in a manner that aligns with the audit's goals. This verification helps maintain the integrity of the audit process by ensuring that conclusions and insights drawn from the audit are based on accurate and relevant information.\n\nWhile compliance verification (option B) and the configuration of assessment tools (option C) are important aspects of cloud audits, ensuring the reliability of reporting tools is foundational to the continuous auditing process.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\n\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the cloud service model that recommends building guardrails for developers and DevOps teams. In an IaaS environment, users have significant control over the infrastructure, including virtual machines, storage, and networks. This level of control requires careful management to prevent misconfigurations and ensure security best practices are followed. \n\nBuilding guardrails involves setting up automated policies and controls that guide developers and DevOps teams in deploying resources securely and efficiently within the IaaS environment. These guardrails help prevent errors, enforce compliance with security standards, and optimize resource usage without constraining the flexibility needed for innovation and development. \n\nIn contrast, PaaS and SaaS models abstract much of the infrastructure management, reducing the need for such guardrails, while SecaaS focuses on delivering security solutions through the cloud.","timestamp":"1742999880.0","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nP# 28 PaaS governance policies should function like guardrails—allow enough freedom to innovate, but make sure that certain security requirements are always met.\nP# 351 Automation is used to improve overall security operations unrelated to development. Guardrails, for example, are one form of automation that can remediate misconfigurations in cloud deployments. Many organizations are rapidly integrating automation into their incident response playbooks. Although not all of these are directly DevSecOps, they typically involve leveraging the same automation tools and technologies used by traditional DevOps, but in the security context.","comment_id":"1150893","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723711080.0","poster":"sai_murthy"}],"answer":"C","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-02-15 11:38:00","choices":{"D":"Software as a Service (SaaS)]","A":"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)","C":"Platform as a Service (PaaS)","B":"Security as a Service (SecaaS)"},"unix_timestamp":1707993480,"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (50%)","A (50%)"],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following cloud service models recommends building guardrails for developers and DevOps?","exam_id":153,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133946-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-201-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":153,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Isaca","name":"CCAK","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":258},"currentPage":22},"__N_SSP":true}
