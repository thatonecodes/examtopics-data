Defense in depth.\n\nDefense in depth is a security strategy that involves layering multiple security controls at different stages of an attack to provide redundancy and make it more difficult for attackers to succeed. This strategy is often compared to peeling an onion, as each layer of defense must be breached before the attacker can reach the core asset.\n\nHere's why the other options are not as effective:\n\n A. Increased security awareness: While security awareness is important, it is not a standalone strategy for implementing an effective operational security posture.
