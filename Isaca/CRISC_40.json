Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the outcome of a risk scenario and can be impacted by it. By identifying stakeholders for each IT risk scenario, a risk practitioner can ensure that all relevant parties are aware of the risk and are able to contribute to the management of that risk. This enables enterprise-wide risk management, as it ensures that all stakeholders are aware of and engaged in the risk management process. Other reasons, such as identifying key risk indicators (KRIs), enabling a comprehensive view of risk, and establishing control ownership, may also be important considerations, but ensuring enterprise-wide risk management is the most important reason for identifying stakeholders for each IT risk scenario."},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Jco","comment_id":"723716","timestamp":"1700581680.0","content":"Should be D: control ownership"}],"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"To enable a comprehensive view of risk","B":"To identity key risk indicators (KRIs)","A":"To ensure enterprise-wide risk management","D":"To establish control ownership"},"unix_timestamp":1669045680,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_id":199,"timestamp":"2022-11-21 16:48:00","answers_community":["C (75%)","A (25%)"]},{"id":"Pmt87kgnDCbeP1D6iLzS","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2020-05-26 18:23:00","exam_id":160,"question_id":200,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following control detects problem before it can occur?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","content":"Detective - at the moment of occuring, not before, But preventive do not allow problem to occur, so problem detected (and fixed) before occuring","comment_id":"122703","timestamp":"1703854800.0","poster":"Stanislav_crisc"},{"poster":"Olorin","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1325816","timestamp":"1734030000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIts preventive: Before the risk occurs.
