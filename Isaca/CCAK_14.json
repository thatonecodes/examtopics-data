Change in network traffic routing rules\n\nA critical element of blue-green deployment is the ability to switch network traffic between the two environments (blue and green) smoothly. In blue-green deployments, two identical production environments are maintained: one active (blue) and one idle (green). When a new version of the software is ready to be released, it is deployed to the idle environment (green). The network routing rules are then adjusted to direct traffic from the active environment (blue) to the updated idle environment (green). This enables testing of the new version with real users and provides a rollback option if issues arise, ensuring minimal disruption. Therefore, changing network traffic routing rules is essential for facilitating a blue-green deployment test.","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1388064","timestamp":"1741809540.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1298922","timestamp":"1729107720.0","poster":"339dfab","upvote_count":"1","content":"C. page 349. CCAK Study Guide\n8.3.3 Managed/Blue-Green Deployments\n..If the new code passess all required tests, the load balancer sends all the traffic to the green servers, the blue servers are retired, and the green becomes the new blue.\nIf errors are discovered, the load balancers are pointed back to the old blue until a new patched version is available.\n\nHence DNS routing through record updates is a common approach to blue/green deployments. DNS is used as a mechanism for switching traffic from the blue environment to the green and vice versa when rollback is necessary."}],"timestamp":"2024-02-14 21:51:00","answer_description":"","exam_id":153,"answer":"C","question_id":66,"isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"Maintenance of one production region to serve clients","C":"Change in network traffic routing rules","B":"Running of compliance and unit tests in parallel","A":"Testing of code in development before migration to production environment"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133889-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-161-discussion/","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1707943860},{"id":"PrzZuB4XnDUUtoMln3x8","unix_timestamp":1707944280,"choices":{"C":"at the end of the development cycle.","A":"in all development steps.","D":"after go-live.","B":"at the beginning of the development cycle."},"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. in all development steps.\n\nDevSecOps emphasizes the integration of security practices throughout the entire software development life cycle. By embedding security into every phase of development—from planning and coding to testing and deployment—organizations can identify and mitigate security risks early and continuously. This approach helps ensure that security is a fundamental part of the development process, rather than an afterthought, leading to more secure software and reducing vulnerabilities that might be more costly to address later.","comment_id":"1388066","timestamp":"1741810140.0"}],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"DevSecOps aims to integrate security tools and processes directly into the software development life cycle and should be done:","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":67,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133890-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-162-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-02-14 21:58:00","exam_id":153},{"id":"ZCE25GYq8vcCL9XaHEPC","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe best recommendation to reduce the provider's burden would be:\n\nD.
