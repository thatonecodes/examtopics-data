Vulnerability\n\nThe situation described, where user IDs and passwords are documented in procedure manuals for use by part-time employees, is best described as a vulnerability. A vulnerability is a weakness in a system, process, or organization that could be exploited by a threat to cause harm. In this case, the practice of documenting user credentials in manuals represents a weakness in the organization's information security practices. If these manuals were to fall into the wrong hands or be accessed by unauthorized individuals, it could potentially lead to security breaches or unauthorized access to systems and data.\n\nWhile it is a vulnerability, it also poses a security risk (A) because it exposes the organization to the potential for unauthorized access and data breaches. However, the most accurate term to describe the initial issue is \"vulnerability.\"","timestamp":"1728974040.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Policy violation\n\nDocumenting user IDs and passwords in procedure manuals is a clear violation of most organization's security policies. These policies typically prohibit the sharing or documentation of passwords due to the inherent security risks involved. In general, each user should have unique login credentials and passwords should be kept confidential. The situation also represents a serious security vulnerability and a risk, but fundamentally it is a policy violation.","comment_id":"963785","poster":"01010100","timestamp":"1722001320.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Buzzkill_555","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPoor password management is a vulnerability.
