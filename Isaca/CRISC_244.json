Protecting IT assets is one possible goal as well as ensuring infrastructure and systems availability. However, these should be put in the perspective of achieving an organization’s objectives.

Help ensure objectives are met.\n\nThe primary goal of a risk management program is to help ensure that an organization's objectives are met while effectively managing and mitigating risks. While safeguarding corporate assets and preventing operational losses are important aspects of risk management, they are ultimately in service of the broader goal, which is to support the achievement of the organization's objectives. A well-structured risk management program aims to balance risk and reward, allowing the organization to pursue its goals while minimizing the potential negative impacts of risks."},{"timestamp":"1713204420.0","comment_id":"871196","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt is C.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL"},{"content":"with the majority C","poster":"Koulyo","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"860499","timestamp":"1712190480.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC, objectives are achieved","timestamp":"1704269820.0","comment_id":"764316","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Suchib"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"578827","content":"Agree with C.
