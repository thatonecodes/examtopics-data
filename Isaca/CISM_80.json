The incident response plan is a pre-established set of procedures and processes that are put in place to help organizations respond quickly and effectively to security incidents. It should be activated as soon as an incident is detected, in order to ensure that the incident is contained, investigated and resolved in an efficient and effective manner.\n\nOnce the incident response plan is invoked, the information security manager should then determine the needs and requirements of each audience.
