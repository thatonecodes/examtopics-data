This is the collaborative idea.\nThe culture of an organization can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of its risk management efforts. A risk-aware culture that prioritizes risk management and encourages open communication can help to ensure that risks are properly identified, assessed, and addressed. In contrast, a culture that downplays the importance of risk management or is resistant to change may impede risk management efforts and increase the organization's exposure to risk.\n\nWhile the expertise of the risk manager is important, it is only one component of effective risk management. A skilled risk manager can help to identify and assess risks, develop risk mitigation strategies, and monitor risk management activities. However, without a supportive culture, even the most skilled risk manager may struggle to effectively manage risk. A culture that values risk management and encourages collaboration can help to ensure that the organization's risk management efforts are successful over the long term.","timestamp":"1708530660.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"816773"},{"comment_id":"328276","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Khy","timestamp":"1649112840.0","content":"why not regulatory?"},{"content":"why not A?","poster":"Khy","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1649112780.0","comment_id":"328275"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Board of director's expertise","A":"The risk manager's expertise","D":"The organization's culture","B":"Regulatory requirements"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/49109-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-406-discussion/","answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"UJVFohY2vpCuIu6bdjGp","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1116339","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe results of a gap analysis: This is the most comprehensive measure of risk management maturity.

The level of residual risk reflects the effectiveness of an organization's risk management efforts, as well as its ability to identify and assess risks, develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies, and implement effective controls. A lower level of residual risk indicates that the organization has a more mature risk management program, while a higher level of residual risk indicates that the organization may have gaps or deficiencies in its risk management program.\n\nWhile IT alignment to business objectives is important, it is not necessarily the best measurement of an organization's risk management maturity level.
