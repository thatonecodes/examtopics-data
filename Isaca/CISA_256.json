This means that if sensitive information, such as passwords, is sent in clear text (unencrypted) within the packets, an attacker can intercept and view this information without the firewall detecting or preventing it. This is a significant security weakness because it doesn't protect against eavesdropping or interception of sensitive data within the packets themselves.","poster":"SuperMax"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe packet filtering type determines whether to allow packets to pass through to the internal network by referring to packet headers (information such as procotr, source and destination addresses, and port numbers).\n\nIn other words, in the packet filtering type, access permission/denial is determined based on header information alone. Therefore, as long as the header information clears the access permission definition (policy), it is possible to enter the internal network even if there is unauthorized data in it.","comment_id":"1175615","timestamp":"1726547100.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Swallows"},{"poster":"3008","comment_id":"979645","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\n: where an attacker sends packets with a forged source IP \n 2 번 찬성address to bypass the firewall’s rules and gain access to the network.","timestamp":"1707788340.0"},{"comment_id":"958010","timestamp":"1705812960.0","poster":"JONESKA","content":"Option A is not correct as packet level firewalls do not typically involve deciphering the signature information of packets.\nOption B is out, Packet level firewalls do not perform password authentication or encryption.\nOption D is out, While this may be a concern from a network security perspective, it is not a specific weakness of a packet level firewall.

Attribute sampling.\n\nAttribute sampling is a sampling method used to determine whether a certain attribute (in this case, compliance with the system capturing visitor identification document numbers and photos) exists or does not exist within a population. It is often used for compliance testing to assess whether a control or process is operating effectively and consistently. In this case, the auditor can select a sample of entries from the physical access log system and check whether the required attributes (identification document numbers and visitor photos) are present for each visitor in the sample. This method allows the auditor to determine if the system is effectively capturing this critical information for compliance purposes.","comment_id":"1124886","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Attribute sampling\n\nAttribute sampling is a sampling method used to assess the presence or absence of a certain attribute or characteristic within a population. In this case, the auditor is interested in verifying whether the system effectively captures visitor identification document numbers and photos. Attribute sampling would allow the auditor to select a sample of records and check whether these attributes are correctly recorded in the system.
