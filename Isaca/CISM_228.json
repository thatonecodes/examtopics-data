The primary reason for this is that you need to look at the keywords \"business unit\" and \"does not have the budget\". This is not to say the company doesn't have the budget. It is stating that a part of the company doesn't have the money. So the business unit needs to create the logic and buy-in to get that funding and that is exactly what a business case is designed to do.\n\nRationale:\n(B) Accepting non-compliance is not an acceptable answer as the fines will get bigger as a repeat offender until the survivability of the company is at risk. If that doesn't do it, reputational damage will. If worst comes to worst criminal charges are always a possibility and no one ever wants to go to jail. So option B is a terrible idea.\n(C) Lawyers aren't going to give you the budget and if an audit is doing its thing they'll spot this issue on their own. Don't complicate things, just build the business case to fix it.\n(D) Look at option B as to why this is never going to be an acceptable option.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1674558780.0","comment_id":"786445","upvote_count":"3","content":"the answer has to be C.
