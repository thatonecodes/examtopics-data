Data inconsistency\n\nRedundant data in an inventory system can lead to data inconsistency, which is the greatest concern among the options provided. This is because if the same piece of data is stored in multiple places, any updates or changes might not be reflected everywhere, leading to discrepancies in the data. This could lead to errors in reporting, decision-making, and overall operations. Other options like unnecessary data storage usage, poor access control, and unnecessary costs of program changes, while also concerns, do not pose as immediate and significant an operational risk as data inconsistency.","timestamp":"1722009300.0","comment_id":"963930","poster":"01010100","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"963929","upvote_count":"1","poster":"01010100","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

RTOs define the maximum acceptable time a process or system can be down before causing significant impacts to the business. If RTOs are not aligned with business needs, it can lead to extended downtime, loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction, and potential operational disruptions during a disaster or incident.\n\nWhile the other options (A, B, and C) could also represent deficiencies in the BCP, the misalignment of RTOs with business requirements has the potential for more serious consequences as it directly impacts the organization's ability to recover critical functions within an acceptable timeframe.

Recovery time objectives (RTOs) do not meet business requirements\n\nRecovery Time Objective (RTO) is the target time you set for the recovery of your IT and business activities after a disaster has struck. The goal is to recover processes before the negative impact of a break becomes critical. If the RTOs don't meet business requirements, it can lead to significant business disruption and financial loss.
