Reviewing system functionalities associated with business processes.\n\nThis method involves closely examining how system functionalities align with and support the business processes they are intended to facilitate. By reviewing these functionalities in the context of the business processes, it becomes easier to identify controls that may no longer be necessary or relevant. This could be due to changes in business processes, technological advancements, or the elimination of the risks that the controls were initially designed to mitigate.
