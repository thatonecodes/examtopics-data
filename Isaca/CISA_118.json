Life cycle cost-benefit analysis directly supports this by assessing both financial and nonfinancial benefits (e.g., operational efficiency, strategic alignment) over the entire project lifespan.\nPortfolio management requires prioritizing investments based on \"strategic value, return on investment (ROI), and risk\"1.

Low-priority jobs should be scheduled only when resources are available to avoid contention with critical operations.\nResource Allocation: High-priority tasks (e.g., financial batch processing, critical system updates) must be prioritized for system resources, while low-priority jobs (e.g., routine reports) should be deferred to periods of lower demand1.
