This visual comparison helps management understand the relative severity of different risks in both contexts.\n(2) Holistic View: A risk assessment on the IaaS provider (option C) focuses solely on the external provider's risks, without directly comparing them to internal risks. Option B, on the other hand, includes both internal and external risk scenarios on the same chart, offering a holistic view.\n(3) Decision-Making: Management can make more informed decisions when they see how risks compare in terms of both likelihood and impact. This approach supports strategic decision-making by clearly showing which environment (IaaS or internal) presents higher or lower risks.\n\nGPT3.5 said C.
