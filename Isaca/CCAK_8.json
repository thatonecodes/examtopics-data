Data classification risk**\n\nData classification risk is the responsibility of the cloud customer in all cloud service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). The customer must determine how to classify their data based on its sensitivity, regulatory requirements, and business value. This classification informs how data should be handled, protected, and where it can be stored, regardless of the underlying cloud service model being used. The cloud provider typically does not have the context or understanding of the customer's data to make these classification decisions.","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741785060.0","comment_id":"1387883"},{"comment_id":"1149219","timestamp":"1723552200.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCCAK Page 48","upvote_count":"2","poster":"sai_murthy"},{"content":"Answer \"D\" refer page 36 CCAK Study Guide.","poster":"MJORGER","comment_id":"1005806","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1710258180.0"}],"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1694526180,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":""},{"id":"LOq5pebXSYIVowQUAJPw","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1298379","timestamp":"1729014960.0","poster":"339dfab","content":"Page 64 of CCAK Study Guide\nA CSP may not be the sole provider of a cloud service.

These contracts are typically used in situations where services are offered to a large number of users, such as online services, and the terms are standardized. The phrase “You automatically consent to these terms by using or logging into the service to which they pertain” indicates that the user consents to the terms simply by using the service, which is characteristic of a contract of adhesion."},{"poster":"SAM6789","content":"p.75 CCAK guide","timestamp":"1730702820.0","comment_id":"889154","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":153,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-04 06:47:00","answer":"B"},{"id":"cGognyK88PkqqCPIOmlj","answer_ET":"C","question_id":39,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is a detective control that may be identified in a Software as a Service (SaaS) service provider?","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1681545180,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (67%)","B (33%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741785780.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\n**C. Privileged access monitoring**\n\nPrivileged access monitoring is a detective control because it involves observing and logging the activities of users with elevated privileges to detect any unauthorized or suspicious actions. This control helps in identifying potential security breaches or policy violations by monitoring access patterns and generating alerts when anomalies are detected. While network segmentation (A) and data encryption (D) are preventive controls designed to protect resources, and incident management (B) is a corrective control aimed at addressing and resolving incidents, privileged access monitoring focuses on detecting issues as they occur.","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1387892"},{"comments":[{"poster":"339dfab","timestamp":"1729016040.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"I agree.
