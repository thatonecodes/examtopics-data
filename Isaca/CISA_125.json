If the last change is present, it indicates that the log is being updated in a timely manner, suggesting that the change management process is capturing changes as they occur. While this doesn’t prove that every single change throughout the log’s history is recorded—since earlier entries could still have omissions—it provides a practical starting point. Confirming the latest change is logged offers some evidence that the process is functioning and current, which is a stronger indicator of completeness than reliance on statements alone."},{"comment_id":"1315757","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732184040.0","content":"B.
