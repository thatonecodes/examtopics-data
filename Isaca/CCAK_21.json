Control self-assessment (CSA)\n\nControl self-assessment (CSA) is the most important mechanism to ensure that effective cloud application controls are maintained within an organization. CSA involves the organization’s own management and staff assessing the effectiveness of their internal controls and risk management processes. This proactive approach allows for the identification and mitigation of control weaknesses before they lead to significant issues. \n\nCSAs empower employees to take responsibility for the controls within their areas, promoting a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. By regularly conducting CSAs, organizations can ensure that controls remain relevant and effective in dynamic cloud environments. \n\nWhile exception reporting, third-party vendor involvement, and internal reviews are valuable components of a comprehensive control strategy, CSA offers a structured process for ongoing evaluation and enhancement of control effectiveness."},{"timestamp":"1733688180.0","comment_id":"1226872","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe responsibility for ensuring the quality, security, and compliance of a cloud application typically falls under the purview of the application team internal review.The application team is primarily responsible for conducting internal reviews of the cloud application they develop.

Incident management and response policies and procedures\n\nWhen performing audits related to the organizational incident management process, it is essential to request the cloud service provider's incident management and response policies and procedures. These documents provide detailed information on how the provider identifies, manages, and responds to incidents, which is crucial for understanding their preparedness and effectiveness in handling security breaches or disruptions. By reviewing these policies and procedures, the auditor can assess whether the provider has appropriate measures in place to detect, respond to, and recover from incidents, and whether these measures align with the organization's requirements and expectations.","timestamp":"1742999520.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723675380.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCCAK P#334 Incident Response, Notification and Remediation:\n• Provide the service provider’s incident management and response policy and procedures.\n• Provide the organization’s incident monitoring procedure, which should include both internal and service provider incidents.","comment_id":"1150656","poster":"sai_murthy"}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"When performing audits in relation to the organizational incident management process, what should be requested from the cloud service provider?","unix_timestamp":1707957780},{"id":"rMUkEpwEKefQ74dc9cgl","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-02-15 01:47:00","question_id":104,"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer":"B","exam_id":153,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133920-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-196-discussion/","question_text":"What should be the control audit frequency for an organization’s business continuity management and operational resilience strategy?","unix_timestamp":1707958020,"topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Annually","A":"Quarterly","D":"Biannually","C":"Monthly"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1410422","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1742999580.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Annually\n\nThe control audit frequency for an organization’s business continuity management and operational resilience strategy should typically be conducted annually. An annual audit allows the organization to systematically review and assess the effectiveness of its business continuity plans and operational resilience measures, ensuring they remain aligned with current risks, business objectives, and regulatory requirements. This frequency is generally sufficient to identify any changes needed due to evolving threats, business processes, or external factors while also providing enough time to implement improvements. \n\nMore frequent audits, like monthly or quarterly, might be excessive unless there are specific risks or regulatory requirements necessitating such a schedule. Conversely, biannual audits might not provide adequate oversight to ensure the strategy remains effective and up-to-date."},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1150659","poster":"sai_murthy","timestamp":"1723675620.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBCR-01 Audit Guidelines"}]},{"id":"vajR5JHdZa5DpfCHzWpk","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1410423","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Additional monitoring\n\nWhen scripts are running in the background with minimal human oversight, additional monitoring is the most relevant control for identifying cases of misuse. Effective monitoring allows for the continuous observation of script activity, enabling the detection of anomalous behavior or unauthorized actions in real-time. By implementing logging and alerting mechanisms, organizations can quickly identify and respond to potential misuse or errors that occur during script execution.\n\nWhile additional manual testing and increased regression testing can help ensure that scripts function correctly before they are deployed, they are not as effective for ongoing detection of misuse. Segregation of duties is important for reducing the risk of unauthorized actions by ensuring that no single individual has control over all aspects of a process, but it does not directly address the need for real-time detection of misuse in running scripts.","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1742999700.0"},{"poster":"sai_murthy","timestamp":"1723710060.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nP# 357 Because CI/CD pipelines offer an automated pathway into production, stricter access controls should be implemented for these systems, particularly build servers and code repositories.
