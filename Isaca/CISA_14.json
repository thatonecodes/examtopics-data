Encryption of the data stored on the device\n\nThe best preventive control to protect the confidentiality of data on a corporate smartphone in the event it is lost is to encrypt the data stored on the device. Encryption ensures that even if the device falls into the wrong hands, the data remains unreadable without the proper decryption key. This is a fundamental security measure for protecting data at rest on mobile devices and is considered a strong preventive control for maintaining data confidentiality.\n\nWhile options B (Remote data wipe program), C (Password for device authentication), and D (Biometric authentication for the device) are also important security measures, they are typically used in conjunction with encryption rather than as standalone preventive controls for data confidentiality.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"SuperMax"}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Biometric authentication for the device","C":"Password for device authentication","A":"Encryption of the data stored on the device","B":"Remote data wipe program"},"topic":"1","question_images":[],"exam_id":156,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/122009-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1057-discussion/","answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-10-01 08:38:00","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST preventive control to protect the confidentiality of data on a corporate smartphone in the event it is lost?","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_id":66,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1696142280},{"id":"vEsjAqB8OllRNHP259Gd","answer_ET":"D","question_id":67,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1679417280,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1123038","poster":"acf4e9a","timestamp":"1721009100.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI believe option A would already cover option D.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1070006","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe MOST important element to include in an IS audit report is the level of unmitigated risk along with business impact.
