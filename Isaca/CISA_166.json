Data ownership helps ensure that individuals or departments are responsible for managing and protecting specific datasets according to their classification. However, without a clear understanding of the data classification levels, it may be challenging to assign ownership accurately and determine the appropriate level of protection for each dataset. Therefore, understanding the data classification levels is the foundational step in implementing a data classification program.","poster":"Swallows","timestamp":"1733631540.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1726606440.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ijahbee","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt's through the Data Owners you get to interview and understand the data classification levels","comment_id":"1176104"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nData classification involves categorizing data into various levels based on its sensitivity and the impact to the organization if it were compromised.
