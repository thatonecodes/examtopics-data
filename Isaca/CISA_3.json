In agile development, the focus is on delivering a working product incrementally and iteratively, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation. This approach contrasts with waterfall development, which typically involves a sequential process with extensive upfront documentation.\nThe Agile Manifesto, a foundational document for agile development, explicitly states, \"Working software over comprehensive documentation,\" emphasizing the importance of delivering a functional product rather than relying heavily on extensive documentation.\nAgile values individuals and interactions, customer collaboration, and responding to change over rigid processes, tools, contract negotiation, and following a plan."},{"timestamp":"1723134600.0","poster":"PurpleParrot","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1262611","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe GREATEST advantage of agile development over waterfall development is:\n\nA.
