Educating employees on what needs to be kept confidential.\n\nEducation and awareness are key in preventing data breaches or unintentional exposure of sensitive information. When employees are well-informed about what constitutes sensitive data and the importance of keeping it confidential, they are more likely to be vigilant and careful in their social media interactions. This proactive approach not only helps in preventing breaches but also fosters a culture of security awareness within the organization. While DLP solutions, NDAs, and punitive actions are also important, they are more reactive and don't necessarily address the root cause of potential data exposure, which is often a lack of awareness or understanding.","comment_id":"1086623","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1057177","timestamp":"1714423320.0","poster":"hassansh111","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer Should be D"}],"timestamp":"2023-10-29 23:42:00","exam_id":160,"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/124917-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1435-discussion/","topic":"1","question_text":"In an organization that allows employee use of social media accounts for work purposes, which of the following is the BEST way to protect company sensitive information from being exposed?"},{"id":"yGbPPv04e5c06aKTfEpB","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":454,"question_images":[],"answer":"D","choices":{"C":"Provide each region with adequate funding.","D":"Allow each region to adapt the plan to its local requirements","A":"Obtain the approval of each regional head.","B":"Engage an external auditor in each region before deployment."},"unix_timestamp":1703976660,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-12-30 23:51:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1110109","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719780660.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
