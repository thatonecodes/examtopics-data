The organization gains assurance it can recover from a disaster.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the primary objective of disaster recovery testing is to provide assurance that the organization can recover its operations after a disruptive event. This assurance helps stakeholders have confidence in the organization's resilience and continuity plans.\n\nHere's a brief breakdown of the other options:\n\n A. All business-critical systems are successfully tested: While it's important to test business-critical systems, merely testing them doesn't ensure that they can be restored to an operational state after a disaster.\n\n B. Errors are discovered in the disaster recovery process: Identifying errors is indeed a valuable outcome of testing, but it's not the primary objective from a business standpoint.\n\n C. All critical data is recovered within recovery time objectives (RTOs): Meeting the RTO is important, but it's a technical metric. The broader business objective is to ensure overall recovery and continuity.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728058560.0","comment_id":"1024983","poster":"01010100"},{"content":"D.
