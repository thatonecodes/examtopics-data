Require the steering committee to review exception requests\n\nThe best approach for governing noncompliance with security requirements is to require the steering committee to review exception requests. The steering committee typically consists of senior executives who have the authority to set strategic direction and allocate resources for risk management initiatives. By involving the steering committee in the review of exception requests, the organization ensures that decisions regarding noncompliance are made at a high level of governance, taking into account strategic objectives, risk tolerance, and potential impacts on the organization. While options A, B, and D may also play a role in governing noncompliance, involving the steering committee provides the highest level of oversight and ensures alignment with organizational priorities.","comment_id":"1144124","timestamp":"1723089180.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Basing mandatory review and exception approvals on inherent risk (option D) does not take into account the effectiveness of implemented controls or the actual level of risk present in the organization.\n\nBy considering residual risk, the organization can prioritize its efforts, allocate resources effectively, and focus on addressing noncompliance with security requirements in a manner that aligns with its risk management strategy.","comment_id":"924293","timestamp":"1702658460.0","poster":"wello","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"mad68","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Assigning information asset ownership\n\nAssigning information asset ownership is the most important aspect of ensuring that information stored by an organization is protected appropriately. When information assets have clearly defined owners, individuals or teams are accountable for their protection, including implementing security measures, monitoring for threats, and ensuring compliance with policies and regulations. This accountability fosters a sense of responsibility and promotes proactive management of information security risks.
