Mobile device testing program\n\nThe best way to address the security risks associated with a recently implemented bring your own device (BYOD) strategy is to establish a mobile device testing program (Option A). Such a program involves testing and evaluating the security posture of various types of mobile devices that employees bring into the organization's environment. This helps identify vulnerabilities, security gaps, and potential risks associated with those devices. By conducting thorough testing, the organization can implement appropriate security controls and measures to mitigate the identified risks and ensure a secure BYOD environment.","timestamp":"1708325520.0"},{"timestamp":"1701870840.0","comment_id":"916203","poster":"mibg83","content":"Selected Answer: A\nawareness program its not enough","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1690021740.0","comment_id":"784284","poster":"Eric0223","content":"can t bear the stype of this CISA questions. this results in confusion, i hope i could leverage such great advanced understanding to achieve more in REAL exam and social network.","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"id":"HscB5onUZ0xNDs1fzgak","question_id":252,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"C":"Defines the conditions under which documents containing sensitive information may be transmitted","B":"Ensures documents are handled in accordance with the sensitivity of information they contain","A":"Classifies documents to correctly reflect the level of sensitivity of information they contain","D":"Classifies documents in accordance with industry standards and best practices"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2024-05-19 02:09:00","exam_id":156,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725635880.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"PurpleParrot","comment_id":"1279667","content":"Selected Answer: A\nData owners classify and security admins ensure"},{"timestamp":"1722846600.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Such access could be exploited by malicious actors or could result in inadvertent security lapses, especially if proper controls, logging, and monitoring are not in place.\n\nIt is NOT D because monitoring incoming malicious traffic is typically the role of other systems like IDS/IPS, firewalls, or antivirus solutions.
