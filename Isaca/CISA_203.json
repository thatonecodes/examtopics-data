It helps determine what systems, networks, applications, or assets will be included in the test and specifies the goals and targets of the assessment. Additionally, defining the scope ensures that the penetration test focuses on areas of highest risk or concern to the organization, aligns with business objectives, and meets regulatory requirements.\nOnce the testing scope is established, the organization can proceed with obtaining management consent for the testing (Option C). Management consent is essential to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the planned activities, potential impacts, and expected outcomes of the penetration test.
