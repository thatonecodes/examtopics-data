Palm reader and PIN is the most effective physical access control for preventing unauthorized access to a data center. It leverages biometric authentication’s uniqueness and a PIN’s knowledge requirement, providing a robust two-factor system that is difficult to bypass. The CISA Official Review Manual supports this in \"5.3.16 Biometrics,\" noting that biometrics offer \"a high level of assurance\" (p. 401), and in \"5.3.2 Authentication,\" where multifactor methods are recommended for enhanced security (p. 379). In contrast, badge access and cipher locks are single-factor and less secure, while smart card and physical key, though multifactor, rely on physical items that can be compromised.","poster":"46080f2"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"C","choices":{"D":"Cipher locks","A":"Badge access","B":"Smart card and physical key","C":"Palm reader and PIN"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_id":521,"question_text":"Which of the following physical access controls would MOST effectively prevent unauthorized access to a data center?","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1741935180,"question_images":[]},{"id":"rOdgp6ArcqdJYVwyVspb","isMC":true,"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"Extended project scope beyond the design phase","A":"Lack of stakeholder agreement on business requirements","B":"Additional budget required for project implementation","C":"Lack of a post-implementation review"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"What would be an IS auditor's GREATEST concern when conducting an internal audit of a project to implement a customer relationship management (CRM) system?","question_id":522,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":156,"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1743240900,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1743240900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nStakeholder alignment on requirements is foundational.

If a project's risk surpasses the defined tolerance, it indicates a failure to adhere to the enterprise's risk management framework, exposing the organization to unacceptable exposures. While qualitative business value (Option B) may lack quantification, it is not inherently a control failure.
