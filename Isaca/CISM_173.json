Perform a business risk assessment of the email filtering system.\n\nThe best way to identify the risk associated with a social engineering attack is to perform a business risk assessment of the email filtering system. Social engineering attacks often target email systems as a means to trick users into disclosing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. By assessing the effectiveness of the email filtering system and its ability to detect and prevent social engineering attacks, organizations can identify potential risks and implement appropriate mitigation measures. Options A, B, and D may provide valuable insights into security measures but are not specifically focused on identifying the risk associated with social engineering attacks."},{"poster":"oluchecpoint","comment_id":"1003040","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1694248920.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nConducting regular security awareness training and testing can help organizations gauge their employees' susceptibility to social engineering attacks and provide an opportunity to reinforce best practices and correct any weaknesses in their security posture.
