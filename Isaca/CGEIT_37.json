Regulatory requirements\n\nBefore making a decision to anonymize personal data in enterprise systems, the IT steering committee should consider regulatory requirements as the most important factor. Compliance with data protection and privacy regulations is crucial for any organization handling personal data.\n\nRegulatory requirements dictate how personal data should be handled, stored, and processed. Implementing a policy to anonymize personal data may be required by certain regulations to ensure compliance and avoid legal consequences such as fines or lawsuits.\n\nWhile sustainability costs, potential implementation barriers, and business impact analysis results are important considerations, regulatory requirements should take precedence as they establish the legal framework within which the organization must operate regarding personal data handling."}],"timestamp":"2024-03-08 15:19:00","unix_timestamp":1709907540,"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"A business is considering a policy to anonymize personal data in enterprise systems.

Cost-benefit analysis\n\nWhen determining optimal IT service levels, the primary consideration should be a cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis involves evaluating the costs associated with providing various service levels against the benefits gained from those service levels.\n\nBy conducting a cost-benefit analysis, the IT manager can assess the costs of maintaining different service levels, including the resources required, technology investments, personnel, and operational expenses. Additionally, they can evaluate the benefits derived from these service levels, such as improved productivity, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage.\n\nConsidering cost-benefit analysis as the primary consideration allows the IT manager to make informed decisions about allocating resources effectively to achieve the desired service levels while optimizing the use of available resources and maximizing the return on investment. This approach ensures that IT services are aligned with the organization's strategic objectives and financial constraints."}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":155,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_text":"An IT manager is trying to determine optimal IT service levels.
