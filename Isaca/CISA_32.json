Data classification involves categorizing data based on its sensitivity, importance, and regulatory requirements. It helps determine the appropriate level of security controls, access restrictions, and other measures needed to protect the data.\nUnderstanding the classification of data is crucial because it guides decisions on where and how the data should be stored, the level of encryption required, and the security measures that need to be in place. Different types of data may have different security and compliance requirements, and this should be assessed before making decisions about cloud storage.","comment_id":"1070430","timestamp":"1731592680.0"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":156,"question_text":"Which of the following should be the FIRST consideration when deciding whether data should be moved to a cloud provider for storage?","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1699970280,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":156,"choices":{"C":"Data storage costs","B":"Vendor cloud certification","D":"Service level agreements (SLAs)","A":"Data classification"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/126101-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1138-discussion/","topic":"1","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-11-14 14:58:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A"},{"id":"Ri1MjMmosoNsWQO2DcwE","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":157,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":156,"choices":{"B":"Tabletop exercise","C":"Full operational test","D":"Post-implementation review","A":"Stress test"},"timestamp":"2023-11-14 15:00:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731592800.0","comment_id":"1070433","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe most cost-effective way to determine the effectiveness of a business continuity plan (BCP) is a tabletop exercise. In a tabletop exercise, participants discuss and simulate various disaster scenarios in a non-disruptive and controlled environment. It involves key stakeholders going through the plan, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and discussing how they would respond to specific events.\nTabletop exercises are generally less resource-intensive and less disruptive than full operational tests or stress tests. They provide an opportunity to validate and improve the plan without the need for extensive downtime or resource allocation. This makes them a cost-effective method for assessing the BCP's effectiveness.","poster":"FAGFUR","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST cost-effective way to determine the effectiveness of a business continuity plan (BCP)?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/126102-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1139-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1699970400,"isMC":true},{"id":"iFoDmzZoICGaRGMijTgk","timestamp":"2022-09-10 02:19:00","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"An organization's security policy mandates that all new employees must receive appropriate security awareness training.
