A decrease in achievement of service level agreements (SLAs).\n\nThe most relevant observation to escalate to senior management in this scenario would be \"D. A decrease in achievement of service level agreements (SLAs).\" Given that the web-based service provider has a low risk appetite for system outages, a decrease in achieving service level agreements suggests that the provider's ability to maintain the desired level of service reliability and availability is diminishing. This directly aligns with the risk appetite for low system outages and might indicate potential issues that require senior management attention.\n\nWhile the other observations (increase in attempted DDoS attacks, increase in attempted website phishing attacks, decrease in remediated web security vulnerabilities) are all important and relevant to online security, they might not have as direct an impact on the organization's risk appetite for system outages as a decrease in SLA achievement would.","timestamp":"1724707980.0"},{"comment_id":"919429","upvote_count":"3","poster":"mraiyan","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI was thinking of \"A\" as it is directly mapped to service outage; but I read the question carefully and asked myself what the upper management cares about !.
