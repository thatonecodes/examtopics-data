Failure to test the disaster recovery plan (DRP) is the most likely cause of key team members not knowing exactly what steps should be taken to recover critical data backups following a major flood in the data center. Testing a disaster recovery plan (DRP) helps to ensure that the plan is effective and that all team members are familiar with their roles and responsibilities in the event of a disaster. By failing to test the DRP, an organization may not have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to recover critical data backups, leading to confusion and delays in the recovery process. Other causes, such as a lack of well-documented business impact analysis (BIA) or significant changes in management personnel, may also contribute to the situation, but failure to test the DRP is the most likely cause. Lack of annual updates to the DRP is not directly related to the situation described.","comment_id":"766054","timestamp":"1688494980.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"754626","content":"In my opinion, B sounds more appropriate.","timestamp":"1687561320.0","poster":"VICKWORKZ","upvote_count":"1"}],"choices":{"A":"Failure to test the disaster recovery plan (DRP)","C":"Significant changes in management personnel","D":"Lack of annual updates to the disaster recovery plan (DRP)","B":"Lack of well-documented business impact analysis (BIA)"}}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":1422,"name":"CRISC","id":160,"isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Isaca","isBeta":false},"currentPage":68},"__N_SSP":true}
