Incidents can escalate into disasters needing proper response\n\nIntegrating incident response with business continuity recognizes that some incidents, if not properly managed, can escalate into larger-scale disasters that affect the organization's overall operations. By having an integrated approach, an organization can ensure a coordinated and effective response to incidents, helping to prevent them from becoming full-blown disasters and minimizing their impact on business continuity. This approach aims to detect, respond to, and mitigate incidents at an early stage, reducing the likelihood of them evolving into larger-scale disasters.","poster":"oluchecpoint","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1725685200.0"},{"poster":"richck102","comment_id":"936109","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719551400.0","content":"A.

Apply a risk-based approach is the MOST important when designing security controls.

A risk-based approach ensures that security controls are tailored to the specific needs of the organization and aligned with its business objectives. While preventive controls are important, they may not be sufficient to address all security risks. It is also important to consider detective and corrective controls to detect and respond to security incidents.

Screening prospective employees is the MOST effective method of preventing deliberate internal security breaches. This is because a thorough screening process can help to identify potential security risks before they are hired, such as a history of malicious or unethical behavior. Additionally, by conducting background checks, verifying credentials, and checking references, an organization can gain a better understanding of a candidate's qualifications and trustworthiness, which can help to reduce the risk of an internal security breach.
