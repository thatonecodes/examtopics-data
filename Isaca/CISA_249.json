Unauthorized alterations to the DRP could lead to ineffective responses during emergencies, potentially resulting in extended downtime, data loss, or financial losses for the organization. By classifying the DRP as confidential, access to the plan can be restricted to authorized personnel who are responsible for its maintenance, implementation, and testing. This helps ensure the integrity and reliability of the plan, reducing the risk of unauthorized alterations that could compromise its effectiveness.","timestamp":"1732524240.0"},{"comment_id":"902343","poster":"Pakawat","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB:To Protect Sensitive Data leakage","timestamp":"1700460480.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1684555680,"topic":"1","question_id":1242,"answer":"B","choices":{"D":"Protect the plan from unauthorized alteration.","B":"Reduce the risk of data leakage that could lead to an attack.","A":"Ensure compliance with the data classification policy.","C":"Comply with business continuity best practice."}},{"id":"7uXBFeLtp25rCZXLvOa1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/81033-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-775-discussion/","choices":{"B":"System administration","A":"Emergency support","D":"Database administration","C":"IT operator"},"timestamp":"2022-09-07 23:33:00","answer_ET":"A","question_id":1243,"discussion":[{"content":"Mustn't be SA and DBA.Answer is A","comment_id":"1286152","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726723020.0","poster":"blues_lee"},{"comment_id":"803730","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn a role-based environment with an IT segregation of duties policy, an application developer (Option A) may be assigned the role of emergency support.

By continuously monitoring user behavior and identifying deviations from normal patterns, organizations can detect potential insider threats and unauthorized data transfers more effectively than relying solely on static rules or signatures.\n\nWhile implementing data loss prevention (DLP) software (option D) is an important measure for preventing and detecting data exfiltration, it primarily focuses on enforcing policies and controls to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's network.
