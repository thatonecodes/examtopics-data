The CISA Official Review Manual underscores that audits are risk-based and control-focused. Chapter 1: Information System Auditing Process (Page 23) outlines the purpose of audits as evaluating controls and ensuring business objectives are met while mitigating risks (Page 24). Among the options, Option B—ensuring that items identified in the risk assessment have been addressed—directly ties to this purpose. It encompasses verifying that specific risks (e.g., security, compliance, operational) associated with the third-party provider have been mitigated, which is broader and more critical than monitoring SLAs (Option A), confirming a monitoring process (Option C), or assigning a manager (Option D).","timestamp":"1741881540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"46080f2","comment_id":"1390267"}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-03-13 16:59:00","question_text":"When performing an audit of a third-party provider, it is MOST important to ensure:","question_images":[],"exam_id":156,"unix_timestamp":1741881540,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":516},{"id":"c1axNjEXTX0MZuOL5i28","exam_id":156,"question_text":"Which of the following findings is the GREATEST concern when reviewing a disaster recovery plan (DRP) with high availability requirements?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/169017-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1716-discussion/","question_id":517,"timestamp":"2025-03-13 17:04:00","topic":"1","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1741881840,"choices":{"C":"Recovery time objectives (RTOs) are not defined.","D":"Responsibilities are not defined for the recovery team.","A":"Annual tabletop testing is not required.","B":"Vendor contact information is not reviewed."},"isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1390331","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn a high availability context, time is the critical factor. Option C directly jeopardizes the ability to ensure rapid recovery by leaving the recovery timeframe ambiguous. Option D, while serious, is secondary—if RTOs are undefined, even well-assigned responsibilities might not achieve the necessary speed. Standards and auditing practices (e.g., CISA Review Manual, NIST) emphasize RTOs as a cornerstone of DRP effectiveness, reinforcing that their absence is a glaring deficiency.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"46080f2","timestamp":"1741881840.0"}],"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"NnYteM2G99ND6eV99S9k","exam_id":156,"question_text":"An IS auditor is reviewing the contract for a customer relationship management (CRM) system containing personal identifiable information (PII) hosted by a third party.

The CISA Review Manual underscores this in Chapter 5, Section 5.3.10: \"Contracts with external parties should include provisions for security and privacy, including confidentiality agreements\" (Page 392). Without these terms, there’s no contractual assurance of data protection, exposing the organization to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks. While a right-to-audit clause (A) is critical for oversight, its absence is less severe if confidentiality obligations exist, as it’s a means to enforce rather than define protection. SLAs (B) and availability requirements (C) are operational concerns, not directly tied to PII security.","timestamp":"1741882140.0","poster":"46080f2","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1390399"},{"poster":"Enig","comment_id":"1310651","timestamp":"1731422400.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"A. Right-to-audit clause\n\nThe absence of a right-to-audit clause would be the greatest concern in this scenario. This clause allows the organization to review and verify the third party’s compliance with security, privacy, and data protection requirements, especially important for a CRM system that contains personally identifiable information (PII). Without a right-to-audit clause, the organization may have limited ability to assess whether the third party is adequately protecting PII, which could increase risks related to data breaches and regulatory non-compliance.\n\nWhile SLAs, availability requirements, and confidentiality terms are also important, the right-to-audit clause is critical for ensuring ongoing compliance and accountability."},{"timestamp":"1729438920.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the correct answer. We care about the PII and the confidentiality terms which covers what is whos responsibility, to what level it needs to be protected and other things.

Without this, the client would have no way to verify that the vendor is properly securing the sensitive personal identifiable information (PII) as required.\n\nConfidentiality terms prohibit the vendor from disclosing data but don’t give the client the right to audit the vendor’s practices.\n\nTherefore, the absence of a right-to-audit clause would be the most concerning for an IS auditor reviewing this contract, as it removes the client’s ability to verify the vendor’s security and compliance through an audit.
