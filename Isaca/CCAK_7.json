This involves understanding the security, compliance, and operational capabilities of the services to ensure they meet the organization's requirements and risk tolerance. By assessing the specific features, organizations can identify potential risks and implement appropriate controls to mitigate them.\n\nWhile verifying policy alignment (option B) is important, it is part of a broader evaluation of the service features. Evaluating only the provider's general maturity (option A) or services with the same security features (option D) does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the risks associated with the specific services being utilized.","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"timestamp":"1729011780.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"339dfab","content":"Response is C.

Reputation-based trust**\n\nReputation-based trust is a category of trust in cloud computing that relies on the perceived reliability and track record of a cloud service provider. It is built over time through consistent performance, positive feedback, and reviews from customers and industry experts. Organizations often consider a provider's reputation as an indicator of their ability to securely and reliably deliver cloud services.","comment_id":"1387880","timestamp":"1741784640.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nPage 38 - Reputation-based trust","comment_id":"1132127","poster":"vsgsds","timestamp":"1721940540.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1710257160.0","comment_id":"1005796","poster":"MJORGER","content":"Answeri is \"A\".

CSP can direct all customers’ inquiries to the information in the CSA STAR registry.\n\nThe CSA STAR registry is a publicly accessible platform that provides detailed information about the security controls and certifications of cloud service providers. By directing customers to this registry, the CSP can efficiently offer comprehensive security information, thus minimizing the need to individually address each inquiry or request for proposal (RFP). This approach streamlines the process and effectively reduces the CSP's workload.","timestamp":"1741530000.0","comment_id":"1371554","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"timestamp":"1741020000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCSA STAR program allows organizations to be more transparent and reduce the number of security questionnaires they must provide for individual customers.

Penetration testing**\n\nCloud users often cede direct control over penetration testing when using public cloud services. This is because the cloud service provider (CSP) typically manages the underlying infrastructure, and conducting penetration tests could potentially impact other tenants sharing the same resources. Public cloud providers generally have strict policies and require explicit permission before any penetration testing can be conducted to ensure compliance with their terms of service and to avoid service disruptions. \n\nWhile users might also rely on the CSP for security patching (option C) and may use CSP-provided encryption services (option B), they typically maintain more control over anti-malware solutions (option A) within their own environments.","timestamp":"1741784700.0","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1387881"},{"timestamp":"1729012620.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Response is D.

Shared responsibility**\n\nIn a cloud migration context, the responsibility for defining and setting applicable controls is typically shared between the cloud customer and the cloud provider. This is known as the shared responsibility model, where the cloud provider is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure and services they offer, while the customer is responsible for securing the applications, data, and configurations they manage within the cloud environment. The specific division of responsibilities can vary depending on the cloud service model being used (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and the terms of the service agreement.","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nShouldnt it be B, a shared responsibility.
