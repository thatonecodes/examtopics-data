Reassess the risk on a regular basis.\n\nOnce a risk has been accepted, it is essential to periodically reassess the risk. This is because the risk environment and context can change over time, and what might have been an acceptable risk at one point may no longer be acceptable in the future. Regular reassessment allows organizations to stay informed about the current status of accepted risks and make adjustments as necessary.

Compliance with regulations can help reduce risk, but baselines should first and foremost be proportionate to the risks the organization faces. This means that the baselines should be tailored to the specific risks and threats that the organization is most likely to encounter, rather than simply aiming to meet a minimum standard set by a regulation.

For example, if the industry regulation demands that you protect confidentiality of data with encryption that has at least 2048-bit long encryption keys, then your security baselines have to reflect that with stating what encryption algorithms must be used at minimum. Otherwise you're breaking the regulatory requirements. Therefore, A would be a correct answer.\n\nOn the other hand, if the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements is actually acceptable to the business, then baselines can also reflect that. In that case the answer should be B.\n\nInterested in hearing other opinions. Maybe I'm just overthinking it..."},{"content":"B. The baselines are proportionate to risk.\nSecurity measures should be balanced and aligned with the specific risks faced by an organization. This approach allows for a more efficient allocation of resources and helps avoid overburdening systems with unnecessary security configurations or neglecting critical security measures that are relevant to the organization's risk profile. Therefore, ensuring that security measures are proportionate to the risk is a key principle in effective cybersecurity.","comment_id":"1000361","timestamp":"1709718600.0","poster":"oluchecpoint","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Agamennore","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBaselines aligned with risk","timestamp":"1709031480.0","comment_id":"991313"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702982520.0","poster":"Jae_kes","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
