However, the **reconciliation of key calculations** is generally considered **more crucial**. This is because it directly verifies the accuracy of the calculations performed by the macros. While version history can provide information about the changes made to the spreadsheet over time, it does not necessarily ensure the accuracy of the current calculations. Therefore, an IS auditor should prioritize reviewing the reconciliation of key calculations.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1701082080.0","poster":"3008","comment_id":"1081424"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1694412360.0","poster":"BA27","comment_id":"1004484","content":"B.

To achieve this, the CSA program must be well-designed and implemented with a clear focus on the organization's business processes, risks, and control objectives. Among the options provided, the most important aspect for an effective control self-assessment program is understanding the business process (option D).\nOption A: Determining the scope of the assessment is important, but it is not the most important factor in an effective CSA program.
