Percentage of system availability.\n\nWhen outsourcing a data center, one of the most critical aspects to measure and manage is the availability of systems. This is especially important because data centers are responsible for hosting critical applications and services. System availability directly impacts business operations and customer satisfaction. Therefore, establishing a key performance indicator (KPI) related to the percentage of system availability in the service level agreement (SLA) helps ensure that the outsourcing provider is held accountable for maintaining high levels of uptime and reliability.\n\nWhile other KPIs like response time and the number of key systems hosted are important, system availability is typically the top priority in data center outsourcing agreements because it directly reflects the provider's ability to meet the organization's needs.","poster":"Staanlee","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725407640.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree with B.","comment_id":"865739","timestamp":"1712686920.0","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"529855","poster":"Raj1510","upvote_count":"4","content":"Prefer B","timestamp":"1674392280.0"},{"comment_id":"381983","timestamp":"1655222760.0","poster":"BeeSz","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Agreed","poster":"ARAMiS","comment_id":"384120","timestamp":"1655463360.0"},{"timestamp":"1672738320.0","poster":"MusMus","upvote_count":"1","content":"if system availability is ensured, there shouldn't be any downtime, not one that the client's aware of or impacted by.","comment_id":"515559"}],"content":"Would C - \" Average response time to resolve system incidents\" be better here since it would not only cover data availability but other data management issues as well?"}]},{"id":"U3iviyD6trt4vLKJUpQf","unix_timestamp":1617462000,"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (67%)","B (17%)","A (17%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":1150,"exam_id":160,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2021-04-03 17:00:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/48952-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-737-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A trusted third party service provider has determined that the risk of a client's systems being hacked is low.

Perform an independent audit of the third party: This might be useful in certain circumstances, but it doesn't directly address the risk in question related to the client's systems being hacked.\n\n B.

Perform their own risk assessment.\n\nWhile it's valuable to receive input and assessments from third-party service providers, organizations should not solely rely on the assessments made by these providers, even if they are trusted. Performing their own risk assessment allows the client to have an independent evaluation of the risks that are specific to their environment, data, and operations. This approach ensures that the client has a comprehensive understanding of the risks they face and can make informed decisions about risk acceptance, mitigation, or additional controls based on their own unique context and risk tolerance.","timestamp":"1725408120.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWith third parties, you cannot just jump to an external audit.
