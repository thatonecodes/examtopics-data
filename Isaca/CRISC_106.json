This is an effective method for addressing concerns related to the use of PII in a test database, as it helps protect the privacy of individuals while still allowing organizations to use the data for testing and analysis.\n\nWhile other options such as Privacy Impact Assessments (A), Consent to collect (B), and Data use agreements (C) are important considerations for managing and protecting personal information, they may not directly address the concern of PII in a test database as effectively as data anonymization does. Consent, assessments, and agreements are more focused on managing the legal and ethical aspects of data use, but they may not provide the same level of privacy protection as anonymization when it comes to test databases."}],"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"An organization is concerned with the use of personally identifiable information (PII) in a test database.
