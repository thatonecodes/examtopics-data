Execute an independent review of the service provider.\n\nConducting an independent review allows the organization to directly assess the service provider’s controls and risk management practices. This can compensate for the lack of a third-party attestation report and ensure that the organization has an accurate understanding of the risk associated with continuing to use this service provider. While verifying exceptions, implementing additional controls, and approving an exception with documentation are also valid actions, they should ideally follow or be informed by the results of the independent review. This approach ensures that any decision is based on a thorough understanding of the current risk profile of the service provider.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717386780.0","poster":"Kennethlim79"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nagree D","poster":"krishccie","comment_id":"1020532","timestamp":"1711700700.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"D.

Threat intelligence.\n\nThreat intelligence involves the collection, evaluation, and analysis of information about existing and emerging threats. This process is specifically designed to provide insights into the threat landscape, helping organizations understand the nature, capabilities, intentions, and actions of potential adversaries. It enables the identification of potential threats, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and helps in making informed decisions to enhance security posture. While risk assessment, threat modeling, and vulnerability scanning are valuable for understanding and managing risks, threat intelligence is more focused on the continuous gathering and analysis of information specifically about threats.","poster":"Kennethlim79","timestamp":"1733205240.0","comment_id":"1086636","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1023457","poster":"eblue","timestamp":"1727904000.0","content":"D.

Here's why:\n\nAlignment with Business Operations (Option B) is crucial because risk management must be tailored to how the organization functions. A policy framework that is perfectly aligned with the business structure ensures that risk management is embedded into daily operations, decisions, and workflows. This makes it practical and easier to implement, resulting in more effective risk mitigation and control. If the policy is not aligned with business needs, even if stakeholders approve it, it may remain ineffective in practice.\n\nStakeholder Approval (Option C) is definitely important for securing support, but having stakeholder approval alone does not guarantee that the policy will be practical, relevant, or actionable.
