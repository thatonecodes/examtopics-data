The risk register is a tool used for tracking identified risks and their status, including what decision has been made regarding each risk.

It also serves as a reference point for any related risk treatment or mitigation activities that may become necessary later.

Assess the impact of the regulation would be the next step after senior management has accepted the risk of noncompliance with a new regulation.
