Decision tree analysis\n\nDecision tree analysis is a tool that helps in selecting appropriate risk responses by evaluating various possible outcomes of a risk and the potential impact of different response strategies. It allows you to assess the probabilities and consequences associated with each response and make informed decisions about which risk response to implement. This is a valuable technique in risk management and helps in making decisions based on a quantitative analysis of the risks and their potential consequences.","timestamp":"1728790320.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1042235"}],"answer":"C","exam_id":160,"answer_ET":"C","question_id":736,"choices":{"A":"Project network diagrams","B":"Cause-and-effect analysis","C":"Decision tree analysis","D":"Delphi Technique"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"You are the project manager of a project in Bluewell Inc.

The tool can be used to measure probability, impact, and risk exposure and how the selected risk response can affect the probability and/or impact of the selected risk event. It helps to form a balanced image of the risks and opportunities connected with each possible course of action. This makes them mostly useful for choosing between different strategies, projects, or investment opportunities particularly when the resources are limited. A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: Project network diagrams help the project manager and stakeholders visualize the flow of the project work, but they are not used as a part of risk response planning.\nB: Cause-and-effect analysis is used for exposing risk factors and not an effective one in risk response planning. This analysis involves the use of predictive or diagnostic analytical tool for exploring the root causes or factors that contribute to positive or negative effects or outcomes.\nD: Delphi technique is used for risk analysis, i.e., for identifying the most probable risks. Delphi is a group of experts who used to rate independently the business risk of an organization. Each expert analyzes the risk independently and then prioritizes the risk, and the result is combined into a consensus.","topic":"1","question_images":[]},{"id":"25N6h8leFlyj1VoFb0ig","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"Risk cannot be removed completely from the enterprise; it can only be reduced to a level that an organization is willing to accept. Risk management programs are hence designed to accomplish the task of reducing risks.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: Depending on the risk preference of an enterprise, it may or may not choose to pursue risk mitigation to the point at which benefit equals or exceeds the expense. Hence this is not the primary objective of designing the risk management program.\nC: Reducing risk to a level too small to measure is not practical and is often cost-prohibitive.\nD: Reducing risks to a specific return ignores the qualitative aspects of the risk which should also be considered.","unix_timestamp":1622478600,"timestamp":"2021-05-31 18:30:00","answer":"A","choices":{"C":"To reduce the risk to a level that is too small to be measurable","A":"To reduce the risk to a level that the enterprise is willing to accept","B":"To reduce the risk to the point at which the benefit exceeds the expense","D":"To reduce the risk to a rate of return that equals the current cost of capital"},"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/53962-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-267-discussion/","question_id":737,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732991400.0","content":"I think this is correct.

It reduces the likelihood but does not guarantee the risk will not occur. The only way to ensure or guarantee a risk will not occur is to avoid the risk entirely.
