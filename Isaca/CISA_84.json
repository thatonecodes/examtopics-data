Option D, which states that estimates of business benefits are backed by similar previously completed projects, aligns closely with this goal. By referencing past projects with similar scopes, objectives, and implementations, organizations can more accurately estimate the potential benefits that the current project might bring. This approach enhances the credibility and reliability of benefit estimates, which is essential for effective benefits realization management.
