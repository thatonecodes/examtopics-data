Exploiting a risk event provides opportunities for positive impact on a project. Assigning more talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion is an example of exploit response.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA, C: Mitigation and avoidance risk response is used in case of negative risk events, and not in positive risk events.
