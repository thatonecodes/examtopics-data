This can increase productivity and reduce costs, but it also introduces significant security risks. Therefore, it is essential for the information security manager to ensure that appropriate security controls are in place to protect the organization's data and systems.\n\nOne of the most important security controls for BYOD is to apply security controls to each device when joining the network. This can include requirements for strong passwords, encryption of data in transit and at rest, and installation of security software such as mobile device management (MDM) software. By applying these security controls, the information security manager can help to ensure that the devices accessing the organization's resources are secure and that the organization's data is protected.","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"826939","comments":[{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","content":"this is a chatgpt answer, not the right answer","comment_id":"949972","timestamp":"1720800060.0"},{"comment_id":"921747","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718227380.0","poster":"DASH_v","content":"You need resource to implement controls for that the first step is to get senior management buy-in by ensuring they understand the risk.

Promoting the information security mission within the enterprise is the MOST effective way to change the security culture and behavior of staff. When staff members understand the importance of information security and are committed to the mission, they are more likely to engage in security best practices and report security incidents. Promotion of information security can be done through security awareness campaigns, regular training sessions, and other communication initiatives.

This classification then dictates how the information should be handled, shared, and protected. The consequences for mishandling or disclosing information may vary based on its security classification. For example, mishandling highly classified information may result in more severe consequences than mishandling information with a lower classification.\n\nWhile labeling information can contribute to enhancing the likelihood of people handling information securely (option C), it doesn't necessarily reduce the need to identify baseline controls for each classification (option A) or reduce the number and type of countermeasures required (option B).
