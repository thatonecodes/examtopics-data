Education can be a preventative measure, but in the case of identified threats, it's typically more urgent to deploy specific countermeasures, modify the technical architecture, or apply additional controls. Staff and partners should be educated on these changes, but this step alone may not efficiently mitigate the risks associated with the new threats."}],"upvote_count":"1","content":"In the scenario where you have identified new threats and found that existing controls are not efficient in mitigating these risks, here are three steps you could take to address the situation:\n\nB. Deployment of a threat-specific countermeasure: Implementing threat-specific countermeasures is an effective strategy to address the new risks. These countermeasures are tailored to the specific threats, and they can be more efficient in mitigating the risks compared to general controls.\n\nC. Modify the technical architecture: Sometimes, the existing technical architecture may need modifications to better address new threats. This can involve making changes to your network, systems, or infrastructure to enhance security and resilience against the identified risks.\n\nD. Apply more controls: In some cases, adding more controls to your security framework may be necessary. These additional controls can complement existing measures and provide a layered defense against the new threats. It's important to choose controls that are relevant to the specific risks you've identified.","timestamp":"1728703200.0","poster":"SuperMax"},{"content":"BCD.\nEducation of staff or business partners: While education might not be a direct solution to modifying controls, it's an important step to enhance the overall security posture of the enterprise.

Educated employees are better equipped to recognize potential threats and follow security best practices.","poster":"eblue","comment_id":"989272","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724510400.0"},{"timestamp":"1723396920.0","content":"Selected Answer: BCD\nIt should be BCD.","comment_id":"978838","poster":"mih","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"363995","poster":"Prashil","timestamp":"1653265020.0","content":"dont agree with the answers."},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1719844080.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Volose","comment_id":"940057","content":"Applying controls too general when you have Deployment of a threat-specific countermeasure"}],"content":"I would argue that modifying the existing architecture can complicate the situation worse than applying more controls.","poster":"Rooks","timestamp":"1635780420.0","comment_id":"210561","upvote_count":"3"}],"exam_id":160,"answers_community":["BCD (50%)","ABC (50%)"],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1604244420,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04284/0016800002.png"],"timestamp":"2020-11-01 16:27:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/35609-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-238-discussion/","isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_text":"You are the project manager of your enterprise.
