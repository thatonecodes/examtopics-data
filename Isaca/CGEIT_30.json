Identify changes in enterprise goals.\n\nUpdating an IT strategic plan should always begin with understanding any changes in the enterprise goals. The IT strategy needs to align closely with the overall objectives and direction of the organization. Once these changes are identified, the IT team can then proceed to review IT performance objectives, evaluate capabilities and resources, and revise the enterprise architecture accordingly. However, without knowing the changes in enterprise goals, it would be challenging to ensure that the IT strategy remains aligned with the organization's direction and priorities.","comment_id":"1168199","timestamp":"1725721560.0"},{"poster":"Sathish5","comment_id":"1113263","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1720047300.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe FIRST step in updating an IT strategic plan should be to identify changes in enterprise goals (Option A).

The assumption is made that we've already identified the change in organization strategy.

Increased cost to mitigate deficiencies.\n\nBy delaying the control review until after implementation, any deficiencies or issues identified during the review will likely require more resources, time, and effort to rectify. It's generally more cost-effective and efficient to address control issues during the planning or early stages of a project rather than after it has been implemented. Timely identification and mitigation of deficiencies can help prevent costly rework and ensure that the system meets the required standards and compliance requirements."}],"question_text":"An enterprise's internal audit group has scheduled a control review of a payroll system project but has been told to wait until the system is implemented.
