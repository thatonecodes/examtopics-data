This is explicitly highlighted in the CISA materials:\nCISA Study Guide (Chapter 6):\n\"The risk of a change having an adverse impact should be reviewed, and a rollback plan should be available to back out of changes in case that becomes necessary. There should be a process by which you can back out completely and restore the system to its previous state.
