In this case, the organization may need to reassess its risk tolerance, which refers to the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept.\n\nRisk tolerance may need to be adjusted to either accommodate the increased risk associated with the longer recovery times or to prompt the organization to take corrective actions to bring recovery times back within acceptable limits. This adjustment in risk tolerance is the most likely change to occur in this situation because it directly relates to the organization's ability to manage and accept the risks associated with its IT applications and recovery processes."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723997100.0","comment_id":"813362","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"706047","content":"A Itâ€™s risk tolerance.
