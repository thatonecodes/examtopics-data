The cloud provider fails to report a breach of customer personal data from an unsecured server, resulting in GDPR fines of 10 million euros.\n\nCompliance business impact refers to the consequences that arise from failing to adhere to laws, regulations, or standards. In this case, the failure to report a data breach results in fines under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a compliance-related issue. The other options describe operational impacts or reputational impacts but do not directly relate to compliance violations.","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1150602","upvote_count":"2","poster":"sai_murthy","timestamp":"1723669500.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nP# 238 The ultimate impact of any incident that can affect the organization can be classified into four categories: financial, operational, compliance and reputational. \nP# 239 Compliance impacts result from not acting in accordance with applicable laws and regulations."}],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-02-15 00:05:00","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133912-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-184-discussion/"},{"id":"qF3Sj5U75ohNCnbtkBfV","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1410407","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhen evaluating the effectiveness of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments from a compliance perspective, an assessor should most notably review:\n\nB.

Likewise, the controls need to verify that the policy is effectively implemented. So, policies and controls are directly implemented in the system in a (semi) automated fashion.\nFrom the cloud compliance program perspective, most of the evaluation on the suitability of policy to effectively manage the risk and align with the governance goal is done via the analysis of audit trails (e.g., logs). \nLogging of activities takes place alongside the development, delivery and integration pipelines to determine who has done what, who has approved what, when something has been tested, when a certain change has occurred, etc. The logs are not the only evidence the assessor will rely upon, but their role is much more central than before.","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1718966220.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ats20","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen evaluating the effectiveness of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments from a compliance perspective, an assessor should review SOC reports.

Audit the effectiveness of the cloud provider’s supplier management program.\n\nWhen auditing a cloud service provider, it's important to ensure that the provider's suppliers (often referred to as \"subservice organizations\") are also effectively managed and compliant with relevant standards and requirements. By auditing the effectiveness of the cloud provider's supplier management program, the auditor can assess how well the cloud provider manages its relationships with suppliers, including how it ensures that those suppliers meet necessary compliance and security standards. This approach allows the auditor to evaluate the risks associated with the supply chain without needing to directly audit each individual supplier.","timestamp":"1742998980.0"},{"comment_id":"1150618","poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: C\nP# 63 If the CSP outsources parts of its infrastructure, operations or maintenance, these third parties may not satisfy or support the requirements that the CSP is contracted to provide to cloud customers. An organization needs to evaluate how the CSP enforces compliance and check if the CSP flows its own requirements down to third parties. Having regular discussions with the CSPs on supply chain contractual requirements and activities through risk/KPI reports helps to identify risks that need mitigation. If the requirements are not being levied on the supply chain, then the threat to the customer increases. This threat increases as an organization uses more CSP services, and it is dependent on individual CSPs and their supply chain policies.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723671720.0"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":153},{"id":"vYWjubYAPiMMouPL2Z9K","question_id":94,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"The cloud service provider","A":"The external auditor","B":"The client organization","D":"The cloud service provider’s suppliers"},"unix_timestamp":1742998980,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1742998980.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

While cloud service providers manage the infrastructure and offer various services, it is up to the client organization to evaluate how these services align with their specific business needs, compliance requirements, and risk tolerance. This involves conducting due diligence on the cloud service provider's security controls, understanding shared responsibility models, and assessing how cloud services integrate into their overall risk management strategy.","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1410409","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2025-03-26 15:23:00","topic":"1","answer":"B","question_text":"Who is responsible for identifying and assessing the risk associated with using cloud services?","question_images":[],"exam_id":153,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/169874-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-187-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"BAJ5d1Fw6mlqRJaWIWWl","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is KEY to an auditor’s evaluation of the completeness of an organization’s cloud compliance obligations?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133914-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-188-discussion/","answers_community":["C (50%)","D (50%)"],"question_id":95,"timestamp":"2024-02-15 00:48:00","choices":{"B":"A view of recent data breaches across the organization’s service providers","A":"Understanding the organization’s risk appetite and risk tolerance","D":"Understanding the organization’s business and operating environment","C":"A view of obligations within contractual agreements with service providers"},"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1707954480,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":153,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1410410","timestamp":"1742999040.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Understanding the organization’s business and operating environment\n\nUnderstanding the organization’s business and operating environment is key to evaluating the completeness of its cloud compliance obligations. This involves gaining insights into the organization's industry, regulatory landscape, business processes, and how it utilizes cloud services. By understanding these factors, an auditor can more accurately assess which compliance requirements are applicable and ensure that all relevant obligations are identified and addressed. This holistic view enables the auditor to evaluate the organization's compliance posture against the backdrop of its specific operational context, ensuring that obligations are not overlooked. While risk appetite, data breaches, and contractual agreements are important elements, they are all contextualized within the broader understanding of the organization's environment."},{"poster":"4f2a581","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721979060.0","content":"The Answer is D","comment_id":"1255551"},{"comment_id":"1150622","timestamp":"1707954480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: C\nP# 202 Supply chain agreements (e.g., SLAs) between providers and customers should incorporate provisions or terms for the following: • References to detailed supporting and relevant business processes and technical measures implemented to enable effective governance, risk management, assurance, and legal, statutory and regulatory compliance obligations associated with all affected business relationships"}]}],"exam":{"name":"CCAK","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":258,"provider":"Isaca","isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true,"id":153,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":19},"__N_SSP":true}
