IDS can be more effective in identifying zero-day exploits because they rely on detecting abnormal patterns or behaviors that may indicate the presence of an attack, even if the specific exploit is unknown.

User behavior analytics\n\nUser behavior analytics is the best option for facilitating the detection of zero-day exploits. Zero-day exploits are vulnerabilities that are not known to the vendor or to the general public and therefore have not yet been patched. They can be difficult to detect because they are not detected by traditional security controls. User behavior analytics involves analyzing user activity in order to identify unusual or suspicious behavior that may indicate an attempted zero-day exploit. Options A, C, and D may also help to detect zero-day exploits, but they are not as effective as user behavior analytics.","comment_id":"764250","timestamp":"1688356680.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"The answer is B","upvote_count":"2","poster":"MOHAMMADSALTI","timestamp":"1688147400.0","comment_id":"762911"},{"poster":"Staanlee","content":"Selected Answer: B\nZero-day exploits tend to be very difficult to detect.
