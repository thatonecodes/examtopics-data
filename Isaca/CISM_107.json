Testers approach the system as an external entity, similar to a potential attacker who doesn't have insider knowledge. This helps identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that might be exploited by real attackers.

Black-box testing is conducted with no prior knowledge of the system under test, simulating the perspective of an external attacker. This approach provides a realistic assessment of an organization's security posture and identifies vulnerabilities that might not be uncovered through other testing methods.
