This approach limits lateral movement for potential attackers and contains the damage if a breach occurs. It can involve techniques such as network segmentation, VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), and strict access controls.","timestamp":"1711946940.0","comment_id":"1022004","poster":"oluchecpoint","comments":[{"poster":"CISSPST","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1104309","comments":[{"content":"As a pentester, I can confidently say that you are wrong on this one.
