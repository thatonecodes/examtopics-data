Deploying a security information and event management system (SIEM) would have BEST provided timely identification of this incident. SIEM systems collect and analyze log data from various security devices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and servers, and can identify and alert on suspicious or anomalous activity. In this scenario, a SIEM would have been able to detect the changes to the firewall and potentially the data exfiltration, and alert the security team in real-time or near real-time.","poster":"Broesweelies"},{"poster":"Josef4CISM","content":"I selected B, because a SIEMs detection capability is heavily dependent on the data sources.

It can detect anomalies, suspicious activities, and security events that may indicate a security incident. In the described scenario, a SIEM could have identified the unauthorized changes to the firewall rules and raised alerts for further investigation.\n\nWhile data loss prevention (DLP) suites (option A) focus on preventing unauthorized data exfiltration, an intrusion prevention system (IPS) (option B) is designed to block or detect and respond to known and unknown threats.
