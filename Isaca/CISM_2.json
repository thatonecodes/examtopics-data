MTD refers to the maximum amount of time a system or service can be offline or unavailable before it starts negatively impacting the organization's operations or causing significant financial loss. By determining the MTD, organizations can prioritize their recovery efforts and allocate resources accordingly to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity. The other parameters mentioned, such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Allowable Interruption Window (AIW), and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), are also important considerations but may not be as directly related to designing the overall disaster recovery strategy.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1713072960.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711277820.0","comment_id":"1015614","content":"D.

Identify the risk owner.\nRisk ownership is critical because the risk owner is responsible for deciding how to manage the risk. This individual or entity is accountable for taking appropriate actions, whether that involves accepting, mitigating, transferring, or avoiding the risk. Without identifying the risk owner, it's difficult to move forward with risk treatment or monitoring.\n While prioritizing risks is important, the next step after risk evaluation should be identifying the risk owner.

This prioritization helps in deciding which risks should be addressed first and how to allocate resources for risk treatment. After prioritizing the risks, you can then proceed to identify controls for risk mitigation, identify the risk owner, and establish a plan to monitor the risks.","poster":"oluchecpoint","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":157}],"exam":{"provider":"Isaca","name":"CISM","id":157,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":1247,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":2},"__N_SSP":true}
