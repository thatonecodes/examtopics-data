This principle helps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information by limiting access to those who have a legitimate need for it. The policy is typically implemented through the use of user authentication, access controls, and information classification, and is intended to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of sensitive information."},{"poster":"oluchecpoint","comment_id":"1003789","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Providing a basis for implementing a need-to-know policy\n\nThe greatest benefit of information asset classification among the options listed is providing a basis for implementing a need-to-know policy. Information asset classification involves categorizing and labeling data based on its sensitivity, importance, and confidentiality. This classification is crucial for implementing access controls and defining who should have access to specific types of information. The need-to-know principle ensures that individuals only have access to information necessary for their job roles, which helps enhance security and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.","timestamp":"1725954300.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"947748","upvote_count":"1","content":"C.
