The ability to audit the third-party supplier's IT systems and processes\n\nHaving the ability to conduct audits on the third-party supplier's IT systems and processes allows the information security manager to directly assess and verify compliance with the organization’s specific information security requirements. This direct approach enables the organization to pinpoint areas of concern, ask specific questions, and receive immediate clarification or evidence of compliance that aligns with their unique requirements, rather than relying solely on general industry standards.
