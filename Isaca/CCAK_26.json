A working version of the solution is used to capture and refine user requirements.\n\nThis approach is characteristic of agile methodologies, which prioritize iterative development and continuous feedback. In agile practices, deploying a working version of the software early in the process allows teams to gather real-time user feedback and make necessary adjustments to meet user needs more effectively. This iterative process contrasts with traditional development methods, which often rely on extensive upfront requirements gathering. Agile's focus on collaboration and flexibility makes it well-suited for deploying complex solutions like ERP systems in a SaaS environment.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1411050","poster":"Auditor2020"}],"choices":{"A":"A working version of the solution is used to capture and refine user requirements.","D":"Developers are drawn from both the customer and SaaS vendor organizations.","B":"Testing of the various SaaS solution modules is completed prior to the main release.","C":"Requirements are signed off by the product owner prior to solution design."},"exam_id":153,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2025-03-27 22:15:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_id":128,"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1743110100,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/169995-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-218-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST indicator of the use of agile techniques to deploy an enterprise resource planning (ERP) Software as a Service (SaaS) solution for an organization?"},{"id":"0wVn9GFMjQqGHbnr0Hsn","question_images":[],"exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/149746-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-219-discussion/","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Exposure from the cloud supply chain","D":"Reliance on the shared responsibility model","C":"Increasing customer demand","B":"Decreasing risk appetite"},"question_text":"Which of the following factors would PRIMARILY drive the decision to increase the frequency of the audit process to validate the security posture of a cloud service provider on an ongoing basis?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1743110280.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe primary factor that would drive the decision to increase the frequency of auditing a cloud service provider's security posture is:\n\nA. Exposure from the cloud supply chain\n\nThe exposure from the cloud supply chain is a significant risk factor, as it involves various third-party vendors and services that may affect the overall security of the cloud service. If there are heightened risks or vulnerabilities associated with the supply chain, it would necessitate more frequent audits to ensure that the cloud service provider maintains a robust security posture. This approach helps in identifying and mitigating risks that could potentially impact the client's data and operations.","comment_id":"1411052"},{"poster":"339dfab","content":"B. \nPage 320 of the CCAK Study Guide\n6.8.2 Continuous Auditing and Continuous Assurance\n...In general the fact that a certain control can be expressed as SQO or SLO impacts the way in which such a control can be audited and ultimately the possible frequency of the checks.\nOf course, the frequency is not just impacted by possible technical limitations, but also by the risk appetite, the compliance requirements and the budget of the organization...","timestamp":"1729259220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1299701"}],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"question_id":129,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-10-18 15:47:00","unix_timestamp":1729259220,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"kyRltRBGkGQyyHX6o4PF","question_images":[],"exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/90413-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-22-discussion/","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Asking the organization’s cloud administrator to immediately close the gap by updating the configuration settings and making the object storage bucket private and hence inaccessible from the Internet","D":"Informing the organization’s internal audit manager immediately about the gap","A":"Highlighting the gap to the audit sponsor at the sponsor’s earliest possible availability","C":"Documenting the finding in the audit report and sharing the gap with the relevant stakeholders"},"question_text":"While performing the audit, the auditor found that an object storage bucket containing PII could be accessed by anyone on the Internet.

Asking the organization’s cloud administrator to immediately close the gap by updating the configuration settings and making the object storage bucket private and hence inaccessible from the Internet.\n\nThis action directly addresses the security risk, protecting the sensitive data from unauthorized access.

Regardless of whether the issue is resolved at the time or whether it is in scope, the auditor would communicate this issue to the client.
