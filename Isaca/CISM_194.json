To provide assurance that information assets are provided a level of protection proportionate to their inherent risk.\n\nThe primary objective of an information security governance framework is to provide assurance that information assets are provided a level of protection proportionate to their inherent risk. This means that the framework should establish a clear set of policies, processes, and controls that are designed to ensure that information assets are protected in a manner that is commensurate with their level of risk. The framework should be designed to provide an appropriate balance between risk and cost, taking into account the value of the assets, the likelihood of a security breach, and the potential consequences of such a breach. By ensuring that information assets are protected in a manner that is proportionate to their inherent risk, the governance framework helps to ensure that the organization's information security objectives are met in a comprehensive and cost-effective manner.","upvote_count":"10","poster":"Broesweelies"},{"comment_id":"1205231","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMost closely aligned with Option A.
