Communication channels are paths of communication with stakeholders in a project. The number of communication channels shows the complexity of a project's communication and can be derived through the formula shown below:\nTotal Number of Communication Channels = n (n-1)/2\nwhere n is the number of stakeholders.\nHence, a project having five stakeholders will have ten communication channels. Putting the value of the number of stakeholders in the formula will provide the number of communication channels. Putting the value of the number of stakeholders in the formula will provide the number of communication channels:\nNumber of communication channel = (n (n-1)) / 2\n= (28 (28-1)) / 2\n= (28 x 27) / 2\n= 756 / 2\n= 378","answer":"C","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Why such questions are included in CRISC.

Exploiting.\n\nExploiting is a risk response strategy where the project manager takes advantage of an opportunity to maximize the positive impact on the project's objectives. In this case, Shawn identified an opportunity to complete the project more cost-effectively by implementing new software and training, which would save the project nearly $65,000.

Exploit response is one of the strategies to negate risks or threats that appear in a project. This strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized. Exploiting a risk event provides opportunities for positive impact on a project. Assigning more talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion is an example of exploit response.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: To avoid a risk means to evade it altogether, eliminate the cause of the risk event, or change the project plan to protect the project objectives from the risk event.\nB: Accepting is a risk response that is appropriate for positive or negative risk events. It does not pursue the risk, but documents the event and allows the risk to happen. Often acceptance is used for low probability and low impact risk events.\nD: Enhancing is a positive risk response that aims to increase the probability and/or impact of the risk event.","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_id":717},{"id":"aRZwfmgGipnTiYksfWI8","question_text":"Mike is the project manager of the NNP Project for his organization.

The purpose of establishing risk thresholds is:\n\nD. It helps to identify those risks for which specific responses are needed.\n\nThis option is the most accurate because risk thresholds are essentially criteria that determine how much risk is acceptable before action needs to be taken. When a project's risk exposure is below the threshold, the risk might be accepted or monitored with minimal action. However, if the risk exposure exceeds the threshold, it triggers the need for a planned response. This helps in prioritizing risks and efficiently allocating resources to manage them.\nOption B is not correct because It is a warning sign that a risk event is going to happen - Risk thresholds are not warning signs of a risk event, but rather predefined points at which an action must be taken in response to a risk. They are more about preparedness and response planning than predicting when a risk event will occur.","comment_id":"1115386","timestamp":"1720285380.0"},{"comment_id":"688229","content":"Agreed.
