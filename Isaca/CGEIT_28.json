Contract management\n\nContract management is the aspect of IT governance that best addresses the potential intellectual property implications of a cloud service provider having a database in another country.\n\nWhen a cloud service provider hosts a database in another country, there are significant legal and regulatory considerations, including intellectual property laws and data sovereignty issues.
