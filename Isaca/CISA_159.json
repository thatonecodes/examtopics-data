Restoration speed"},{"timestamp":"1734540540.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nthe most critical consideration is restoration speed. In the event of a disaster or failure, the ability to quickly restore data and resume operations ensures minimal downtime and business continuity, which is a top priority for organizations.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1328621","poster":"1Naa"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Swallows","timestamp":"1733618820.0","comment_id":"1226434","content":"Selected Answer: B\nStandardization ensures consistency and compatibility across the various data center facilities. It simplifies management, reduces complexity, and streamlines operations. When backup devices and media are standardized, it facilitates seamless data replication, backup, and recovery processes across multiple locations. This uniformity enhances efficiency and reliability in data management practices."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nStandardization ensures that all data centers use the same hardware and software for backups. This makes managing and maintaining the backup systems much easier, as there is only one type of system to support. It also ensures that backups can be restored at any data center, regardless of where they were originally taken, which is crucial for disaster recovery. The issue pertains to multiple offsite facilities, not heavy storage issues.","comment_id":"1159622","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1724663160.0","poster":"dan08"},{"poster":"Rachy","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1125013","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBack up media capacity - Storage","timestamp":"1721217360.0"},{"content":"It is not C - backup media capacity?","timestamp":"1709835900.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1001735","poster":"AB1237"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/115394-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-324-discussion/","answer":"B","question_text":"An organization uses multiple offsite data center facilities.

It is important to identify the root cause of the noncompliance to prevent it from happening in the future.\n\nIf the noncompliance is due to a lack of training or understanding of the procedures, the auditor may recommend additional training or clarification of the procedures. If the noncompliance is due to a lack of resources or conflicting priorities, the auditor may recommend changes to the production schedule or resource allocation.
