If the organization has not reviewed its encryption standards in light of advancements in quantum computing, it could leave sensitive data vulnerable to attacks once quantum computers become more powerful and practical.","poster":"Joloms","comment_id":"1144314","timestamp":"1723101480.0"},{"comment_id":"1107493","timestamp":"1719548760.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nQuantum computers have the potential to break widely used encryption algorithms, making it crucial for organizations to adapt their encryption standards accordingly.Learnt this from cissp","poster":"JBAnalyst"},{"content":"why the answer is a","upvote_count":"1","comments":[],"comment_id":"1097822","timestamp":"1718496420.0","poster":"Chiubilly"}],"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"fsc3FDujnkzpkWDmxJYJ","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":160,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-02-08 10:07:00","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1707383220,"choices":{"B":"Engaging sponsorship by senior management","A":"Including input from risk and business unit management","C":"Utilizing data and resources internal to the organization","D":"Developing in collaboration with internal audit"},"discussion":[{"content":"All of the options provided are important for developing effective key risk indicators (KRIs), but in terms of prioritization, one stands out as the MOST important:\n\nB.

DPIAs help organizations identify and mitigate risks associated with the processing of personal data, ensuring that privacy considerations are taken into account from the outset of any new project or process.\n\nWhile other options, such as tokenization, personal data certifications, and data retention guidelines, are also important aspects of data protection, conducting regular DPIAs is a proactive and systematic approach to assess and manage risks related to personal data processing.

Personal data attributed to a specific data subject is tokenized.\n\nHere's why tokenization is the most effective in this context:\n\nEnhanced Data Security: Tokenization involves replacing sensitive personal data with unique identification symbols (tokens) that retain all the essential information about the data without compromising its security. This process significantly reduces the risk of data breaches because the tokens do not carry meaningful data on their own and are useless to unauthorized users if intercepted.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Abbey2"},{"comment_id":"1106110","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719406800.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgreed.

He has identified a risk that has a low probability of happening, but the impact of the risk event could save the project and the organization with a significant amount of capital. Ben assigns Laura to the risk event and instructs her to research the time, cost, and method to improve the probability of the positive risk event. Ben then communicates the risk event and response to management. What risk response has been used here?","answer_description":"Enhance is a risk response to improve the conditions to ensure the risk event occurs. Risk enhancement raises the probability of an opportunity to take place by focusing on the trigger conditions of the opportunity and optimizing the chances. Identifying and maximizing input drivers of these positive-impact risks may raise the probability of their occurrence.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: Transference is a strategy to mitigate negative risks or threats. In this strategy, consequences and the ownership of a risk is transferred to a third party. This strategy does not eliminate the risk but transfers responsibility of managing the risk to another party. Insurance is an example of transference.\nC: Exploit response is one of the strategies to negate risks or threats that appear in a project. This strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized. Exploiting a risk event provides opportunities for positive impact on a project. Assigning more talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion is an example of exploit response.\nD: Sharing happens through partnerships, joint ventures, and teaming agreements. Sharing response is where two or more entities share a positive risk. Teaming agreements are good example of sharing the reward that comes from the risk of the opportunity.","exam_id":160,"question_id":639,"choices":{"C":"Exploit","D":"Sharing","A":"Transference","B":"Enhance"},"timestamp":"2020-08-23 04:18:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1598149080,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/29314-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-166-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"164047","content":"Enhance is not a Risk response option.\nThe scenario represents \"risk event could save the project and the organization with a significant amount of capital.\" and hence the right answer should be EXPLOIT.","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1614053880.0","poster":"maheshexam"},{"content":"From: CRISC Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control All-in-One Exam Guide, Second Edition\n\nEnhance may be a response to a positive risk such as a project coming in under budget.
