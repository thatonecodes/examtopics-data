Implementing multi-factor authentication.\n\nImplementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security measure that can significantly reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access to a network, especially for remote network access scenarios. MFA requires users to provide two or more forms of authentication before granting access, adding an extra layer of security beyond a simple username and password. This increased security reduces the likelihood of successful remote network access by unauthorized individuals and, as a result, is likely to lead to a lower likelihood rating for associated risk scenarios."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"877403","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A.","timestamp":"1713800280.0"}],"choices":{"B":"Updating the organizational policy for remote access","D":"Updating remote desktop software","A":"Implementing multi-factor authentication","C":"Creating metrics to track remote connections"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107000-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-954-discussion/","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following management actions will MOST likely change the likelihood rating of a risk scenario related to remote network access?","answer":"A"},{"id":"mkPoV8jrwkMHHdKvDdp4","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Legal representation of the business","A":"IT risk practitioner","C":"Third-party security team","B":"The relationship owner"},"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-22 17:39:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107003-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-955-discussion/","question_id":1378,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"An organization has completed a risk assessment of one of its service providers.
