Need-to-know basis.\n\nApplying the \"need-to-know\" basis principle ensures that access to personal and sensitive data is strictly limited to individuals who require that information to perform their job functions. This principle is central to data privacy as it minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches by ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to specific sets of data. By designing the user access model around roles that are defined based on the specific data access needs of each role, the organization can effectively safeguard personal data, maintain privacy, and comply with applicable data protection regulations.","timestamp":"1726496580.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2023-08-12 08:10:00","exam_id":154},{"id":"wJ4Bg5gI5xXxIJ2u7lXT","question_text":"Which of the following is the PRIMARY benefit of implementing policies and procedures for system hardening?","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":154,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/131175-exam-cdpse-topic-1-question-60-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_id":197,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSystem hardening involves configuring systems to reduce vulnerabilities by removing unnecessary services, applications, and open ports, and applying security configurations to minimize attack surfaces.
