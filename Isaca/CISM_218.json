A change management process can include patch management to fix the vulnerabilities introduced. Version control is part of change management. Access control is used to reduce the likelihood of a threat (an attacker gaining access to a critical system) rather than mitigate a vulnerability (the critical system itself need not have any vulnerability).","timestamp":"1705204200.0"},{"timestamp":"1704943560.0","poster":"richck102","comment_id":"948574","content":"B.

When the incident reaches a pre-defined threshold (RTO, RPO, SDO...), it is escalated to BCP which then focusses on the continuity of operations at acceptable level using minimum resources.
