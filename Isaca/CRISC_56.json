It ensures that all areas of the organization are aware of risks and potential consequences, and that risk management is considered when making decisions. This can lead to a more proactive approach to managing risks, better decision-making, and ultimately, better business outcomes.\n\nEstablishing a common view of enterprise risk is also important, as it ensures that everyone in the organization understands what is meant by risk and how it should be managed. This can help to reduce misunderstandings and ensure that risk management is consistent across the organization.\n\nOverall, while both benefits are important, integrating risk management into the organization is typically considered the greatest benefit of implementing an ERM program, as it can have a more significant impact on the organization's overall performance and success.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"821492","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1692961440.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree.","comment_id":"815404","timestamp":"1692536160.0","poster":"john_boogieman"}],"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/100081-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1266-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-02-20 15:56:00","question_id":279,"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is the GREATEST benefit of implementing an enterprise risk management (ERM) program?"},{"id":"uMlk64tMgG0cJXytVnN4","question_id":280,"unix_timestamp":1680041040,"exam_id":160,"topic":"1","question_text":"When confirming whether implemented controls are operating effectively, which of the following is MOST important to review?","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104284-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1267-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Results of risk assessments","C":"Number of emergency change requests","D":"Results of benchmarking studies","A":"Maturity model"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-03-29 00:04:00","answer":"B","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
