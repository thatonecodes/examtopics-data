Processes to measure the performance of business-critical transactions.\n\nWhile all the options listed are important aspects to consider when auditing a QMS, ensuring that the processes to measure the performance of business-critical transactions are working effectively is essential. This is because the primary goal of a QMS is to ensure that the organization's processes are efficient, effective, and consistently meeting quality standards, especially for critical business operations. Therefore, reviewing and validating the performance measurement processes related to these critical transactions is crucial to determine whether the QMS is achieving its intended objectives.","poster":"SuperMax"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"I'm thinking, B.","timestamp":"1690378380.0","poster":"ItsBananass","comment_id":"963774"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1690082280.0","poster":"JONESKA","comment_id":"960044","content":"Should be B.

The application programming interfaces (APIs) are adequately secured.\n\nWhen assessing the security of a new cloud-based IT application linked with an organization's existing technology, the most important concern for an IS (Information Systems) auditor is to confirm that the application programming interfaces (APIs) are adequately secured. APIs play a critical role in connecting different components of a system and often act as gateways for data and functionality. Insecure APIs can pose a significant security risk, potentially allowing unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security vulnerabilities.","comment_id":"1020363"},{"poster":"ItsBananass","upvote_count":"2","content":"I'm going with C.","timestamp":"1722001200.0","comment_id":"963783"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/116508-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-965-discussion/","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1690378800,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is MOST important for an IS auditor to confirm when assessing the security of a new cloud-based IT application that is linked with the organization’s existing technology?","exam_id":156},{"id":"WD8LdEMteyl75qzM0ups","question_id":1405,"exam_id":156,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721648460.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.","comment_id":"1128684","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Rachy"},{"timestamp":"1717578600.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThreats and vulnerabilities change over time and KRI maintenance ensures that KRIs continue to effectively capture these changes.\nThe risk environment is highly dynamic as the enterprise’s internal and external environments are constantly changing.

They help organizations monitor and assess the evolving risk landscape. By using KRIs, IS auditors can identify shifts in risk levels and take proactive measures to mitigate those risks before they escalate. KRIs provide a way to monitor and track risk in real-time or at regular intervals, making it easier to assess whether risk is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable.\n\nWhile the other options (A, B, and D) are important considerations in risk management and auditing, the primary purpose of KRIs is to provide insight into the changing nature of risks, allowing organizations to respond effectively.","comment_id":"1020364","poster":"SuperMax"},{"timestamp":"1695267540.0","comment_id":"845553","content":"D.
