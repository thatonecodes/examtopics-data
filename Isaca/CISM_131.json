Disaster recovery plans are critical to address system disruptions due to security events or natural disasters. Periodic testing can verify that the plan actually works. On the other hand, the percentage of unresolved high-risk audit issues is a less reliable metric because it is also affected if the issue is fixed before the audit is completed. Also, the frequency of system software updates, while it may help strengthen security controls, is not directly relevant to assessing resiliency.\n\nB.
