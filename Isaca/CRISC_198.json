Answer: B\nSorry, 'B', reason:\nResidual risk is the level of risk that remains after controls have been implemented to mitigate inherent risk.

Identify an owner for the new control.\n\nThe best course of action for the risk practitioner in this scenario is to \"B.

This ensures accountability and responsibility for the control's implementation and ongoing management.\n\nWhile the other options (communicating the decision to the risk owner, modifying the action plan in the risk register, seeking approval from the previous action plan manager) may also have relevance in certain contexts, identifying an owner for the new control is the immediate and essential step to ensure that the control is properly managed and integrated into the risk mitigation efforts.","comment_id":"991127","timestamp":"1724716680.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718029740.0","comment_id":"920131","poster":"mraiyan","content":"Selected Answer: A\nShould be \"A\", the risk owner selects the controls, any change/modification of the control should be approved by him/her"},{"poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"858090","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree with A as the best course of action.","timestamp":"1711987860.0"},{"comment_id":"817206","timestamp":"1708551960.0","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"content":"B is also important","poster":"Julianleehk","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712649000.0","comment_id":"865350"}],"comment_id":"806954","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707784980.0","content":"should be A","poster":"Julianleehk"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1705243320.0","comment_id":"775526","content":"C for me","poster":"Ziggybooboo"}]}],"exam":{"id":160,"provider":"Isaca","isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"CRISC","numberOfQuestions":1422,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":198},"__N_SSP":true}
