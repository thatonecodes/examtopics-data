IT capability and performance measures.\n\nIT capability and performance measures are the most important aspect to address in a risk self-assessment to identify improvement opportunities for current IT services. By evaluating IT capability and performance measures, the enterprise can assess the current state of its IT services, identify any gaps or weaknesses, and determine opportunities for improvement. This assessment can include factors such as service availability, reliability, responsiveness, security controls, compliance with policies and regulations, customer satisfaction, and other relevant performance indicators.\n\nThe other options are also important, but they are not as important as IT capability and performance measures.\n\nMapping of business objectives to IT risk is important for aligning IT risk management with the business objectives. However, it does not directly address the improvement opportunities for current IT services.","comment_id":"928163","upvote_count":"2","poster":"yihwen","timestamp":"1687237500.0"}],"answers_community":["A (67%)","B (33%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/112660-exam-cgeit-topic-1-question-445-discussion/","exam_id":155,"question_id":293},{"id":"XMZg0UJ9pB1Ctw4b2qzE","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1726025280.0","comment_id":"1170812","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
