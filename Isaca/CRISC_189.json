Risk factors might not be relevant to the organization.\n\nThe greatest concern when using a generic set of IT risk scenarios for risk analysis is that the risk factors might not be relevant to the organization. Generic risk scenarios are typically designed to cover a broad range of potential risks that could apply to various types of organizations. However, the specific risks an organization faces can vary based on its industry, operations, technology stack, and unique circumstances.\n\nUsing generic scenarios might result in overlooking or downplaying risks that are specific to the organization's environment. To conduct effective risk analysis, it's crucial to tailor the scenarios to the organization's context to ensure that the relevant risks are identified and appropriately assessed."},{"poster":"mraiyan","timestamp":"1717926420.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"919150","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree \"C'.

APT attacks are designed to remain undetected for long periods, and they often leave subtle signs of their presence in the network logs. Automated log monitoring can help identify these signs by analyzing network logs for unusual patterns of activity or behavior.

Implementing automated log monitoring.\n\nThe best control to detect an advanced persistent threat (APT) is to implement automated log monitoring. Advanced persistent threats are sophisticated and often stealthy attacks that aim to maintain a persistent presence within a network over an extended period of time. These attacks can be challenging to detect using traditional security measures alone.\n\nAutomated log monitoring involves continuously analyzing and correlating system logs, network traffic, and other relevant data sources for unusual or suspicious activities. This control can help identify indicators of compromise, abnormal behavior, or patterns consistent with APTs, making it an effective measure for early detection and response.","comment_id":"991052","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724707020.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717929120.0","comment_id":"919188","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBetween \"C\" and \"D\" going with \"D\", SIEM can detect some signs of APT attacks \nAntivirus/FW could detect some types but they are not designed to do so","poster":"mraiyan"},{"comment_id":"855596","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1711800840.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGoing with D.
