Risk owners should typically be individuals with the appropriate level of authority and decision-making power to manage and address the risks effectively.

This is because the risk owner is responsible for identifying and managing risks, while the control owner is responsible for implementing and maintaining controls to mitigate those risks. If the risk owner and control owner are not the same person, it can be difficult to ensure that the controls are appropriate and effective in mitigating the identified risks, and that there is accountability for their implementation and effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, while the risk owner does not necessarily have to be the owner of the control, it is important to ensure that there is coordination and accountability between the two roles to effectively manage and mitigate risks.","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1692980940.0"},{"poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"798785","timestamp":"1691228520.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nTo ensure accountability, the risk owner must be an individual, not a department or organization.
