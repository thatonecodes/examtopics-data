Percentage of projects with developed controls on scope creep\nThis KPI is directly related to the effectiveness of risk management practices within projects, as scope creep is a common risk in project management. By monitoring the percentage of projects that have developed controls to manage scope creep, the organization can gauge how well risk management practices are integrated into the PMO's processes.
