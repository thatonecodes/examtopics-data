Quicker end user acceptance.\n\nAn advantage of using the agile software development methodology over the waterfall methodology is that it typically leads to quicker end user acceptance.\n\nIn agile development, the software is developed iteratively in smaller increments, allowing for continuous user feedback and involvement throughout the development process.

Here’s why:\n\nMobile device risks: Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, represent significant security risks because they are more susceptible to being lost, stolen, or hacked. These devices can access sensitive company data and, if not properly secured, can introduce vulnerabilities. Having provisions for managing the security of mobile devices is crucial to maintaining the integrity of an organization’s information security framework.\n\nSecurity control gaps: If the policy does not address mobile devices, it could create a significant gap in the organization's security posture, leaving critical data exposed. This omission could lead to breaches, unauthorized access, or data loss.","comment_id":"1332194","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Swallows","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhile the frequency of reviewing the information security policy (option B) is important for ensuring its relevance and alignment with evolving threats and organizational changes, it is secondary to the fundamental issue of having the policy approved by the appropriate authority (option D).","timestamp":"1720330740.0","comment_id":"1243707","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1203675","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer D\nit's important for the IS auditor to ensure that the information security policy has been approved by the appropriate senior management authority, whoever that may be in the organization.","timestamp":"1714327560.0","poster":"a84n","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Eric0223","comment_id":"790182","content":"i woudl take C if this role indeed existed in org. policy owners equals to CAE","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674871980.0"}]},{"id":"U872UKFTtueT3kYChIW0","question_id":910,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733658660.0","poster":"Swallows","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhile security awareness training for mobile users (option D) is important for educating employees about security best practices and potential risks associated with mobile devices, it may not provide the same level of control and protection as MDM.
