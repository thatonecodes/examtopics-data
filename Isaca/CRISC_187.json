Scanning the Internet to search for unauthorized usage.\n\nThe best way to mitigate the risk associated with fraudulent use of an enterprise's brand on Internet sites is to scan the Internet to search for unauthorized usage. This approach involves actively monitoring online platforms and websites to identify instances where the enterprise's brand is being used fraudulently or without authorization. By identifying such instances early, the organization can take appropriate actions to address the unauthorized usage and protect its brand reputation.\n\nWhile the other options (utilizing data loss prevention technology, monitoring the enterprise's use of the Internet, developing training and awareness campaigns) might be relevant for other aspects of risk management, scanning the Internet specifically addresses the risk of fraudulent brand use by proactively identifying and addressing instances as they arise.","timestamp":"1724544480.0","comment_id":"989565"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis one is difficult as you have two different perspectives - external to the company and internal to the company. The training and awareness does not specifically call out either, nor does the question. Agree scanning takes care of a symptom or the actual fraud, but training and awareness help reduce the vulnerability.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1711794780.0","comment_id":"855490"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOk, new approach, fraudulent use in the sense of 'phishing', for example if it would be 'd'.\nDeveloping training and awareness campaigns would be the best way to mitigate the risk associated with fraudulent use of an enterprise's brand on internet sites. By training employees and raising awareness among stakeholders, the organization can reduce the likelihood of individuals falling victim to these types of fraudulent sites. Scanning the internet to search for unauthorized usage may help identify instances of fraudulent activity, but it does not address the underlying vulnerability that allows these sites to succeed in the first place. Therefore, the best approach is to proactively educate employees and stakeholders to recognize fraudulent sites and take appropriate action to mitigate the risk.","comment_id":"817068","timestamp":"1708543980.0","poster":"john_boogieman"},{"timestamp":"1707433920.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"802646","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt is 'B'.

The enterprise's capacity to absorb loss.\n\nAn element of the risk appetite of an organization should include the enterprise's capacity to absorb loss. Risk appetite refers to the level of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. This includes an understanding of the organization's financial strength, resources, and ability to withstand and recover from potential losses.\n\nWhile the other options (effectiveness of compensating controls, amount of inherent risk, residual risk affected by preventive controls) are relevant aspects of risk management, they are not typically considered elements of risk appetite. Risk appetite focuses on the organization's overall tolerance for risk, considering factors such as financial resilience and the impact of potential losses on its operations and goals.","timestamp":"1724544720.0"},{"timestamp":"1715110260.0","comment_id":"891654","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"894115","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715355060.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"894117","timestamp":"1715355120.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"also i passed the exam","upvote_count":"2"}],"poster":"[Removed]","content":"correction - i think this is to trick us to think risk capacity vs risk appetite.
