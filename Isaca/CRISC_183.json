Aggregate risk approaching the tolerance threshold\n\nWhen risk owners frequently approve exceptions to the information security policy, it implies that multiple risks are being accepted. The accumulation of all these accepted risks can lead to an aggregate risk level that approaches or even exceeds the organization's risk tolerance threshold. This aggregate risk can be higher than what the organization can manage or absorb, potentially leading to serious consequences.","timestamp":"1725628020.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Vulnerabilities are not being mitigated.\n\nThe risk practitioner's greatest concern should be that vulnerabilities are not being mitigated despite the high number of exceptions to the information security policy. Approving a high number of exceptions can indicate that security controls and policies are being bypassed, potentially leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed. This could lead to a situation where the organization's systems and data are exposed to risks that could have been prevented or minimized through proper adherence to security policies.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724538840.0","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"989523"},{"comment_id":"891412","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is a concern whereas C is why A is probably happening","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715088420.0","poster":"[Removed]"},{"timestamp":"1712354400.0","comment_id":"862504","poster":"Koulyo","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA: approving exceptions means they are accepting risks.

Their aggregate could be near or exceed the risk tolerance threshold. We are so used to overthinking these questions, I think this one is actually easier than we are making it out to be. C seems plausible as an alternative, as does B, which makes me want to go with A as the more \"basic\" answer.","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1711624500.0"},{"poster":"john_boogieman","comments":[{"timestamp":"1708542060.0","comment_id":"817029","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"sorry, 'B' reason:\nIf risk owners have approved a high number of exceptions to the information security policy, the risk practitioner's greatest concern should be that vulnerabilities are not being effectively mitigated. This is because exceptions to security policies often create gaps in the security posture of the organization, and can leave the organization exposed to potential threats and attacks.\n\nIf risk owners are frequently approving exceptions, it may indicate that the security policies are too rigid or not practical for the organization's operations. However, this is still not as great a concern as the potential for unmitigated vulnerabilities.","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"801526","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe key is if 'there are a high number of exceptions' to bypass the policy, the root cause is that it is not understood, it is not effective and it does not allow risk management or protect the organization, so it should be reviewed.

You would have to review the exception list. \n\nHaving a large number of exceptions, to the extent that it is a problem, implies that policy (as an administrative control) is not having the intended impact on risk. Too many exceptions = too little control = too much risk. \n\nI think B is the best answer because too many exceptions to security controls (such as policy) lead to a reduced mitigating impact on vulnerabilities (defined as 'weaknesses in security'). D one, but not the only, cause for B. A is one, but not the only, outcome from B. \n\nThe most complete/important answer is therefore B.","timestamp":"1704821280.0"},{"timestamp":"1696291620.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ebucluc","comment_id":"685125","content":"Correct, echo C"},{"comment_id":"664625","timestamp":"1694266260.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"huze","content":"think the answer is C.
