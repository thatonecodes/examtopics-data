This involves identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities to the organization's critical systems and data, evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of these threats, and determining appropriate risk mitigation strategies.\nThe risk assessment process should involve all relevant stakeholders, including IT staff, business leaders, and other key personnel. The assessment should consider a range of potential threats, including natural disasters, cyber attacks, power outages, and other disruptions.\nOnce the risks have been identified and assessed, the organization can develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies, including backup and recovery procedures, redundant systems and data storage, and other measures to minimize the impact of a disaster","comment_id":"979720","poster":"3008","timestamp":"1691897520.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"ItsBananass","timestamp":"1689785580.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"I think It's C.","comment_id":"956832"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"obtaining replacement supplies","B":"identifying application control requirements","A":"negotiating contracts with disaster planning consultants","D":"assessing and quantifying risk"},"unix_timestamp":1689785580,"answer_description":"","answer":"C","exam_id":156,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/115783-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-854-discussion/","topic":"1"},{"id":"0Ifo28vq1N5rOcW2PLwF","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1205707","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer C\nBoth options C and D can be considered inherent risks in an application container infrastructure. However, the shared kernel (option C) is typically a more significant concern because it directly exposes the underlying operating system to potential vulnerabilities. While the host operating system (option D) also poses inherent risks, it is typically managed separately from the containerized applications and may have its own security measures in place. Therefore, the shared kernel presents a more immediate and critical risk factor.","timestamp":"1730571780.0","poster":"a84n","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1711526940.0","comment_id":"1018524","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Shared kernel\n\nThe use of a shared kernel is an inherent risk in application container infrastructure. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, which means they can potentially access and impact the kernel and other containers running on the same host.

Maintenance patches and the latest enhancement upgrades are missing.\n\nThe performance and reliability problems in a job scheduling tool are most likely to be affected by missing maintenance patches and the latest enhancement upgrades. Regular updates and patches are essential to fix known issues, improve performance, and enhance reliability in software applications. Without these updates, the tool may become unstable, less efficient, and more susceptible to security vulnerabilities. Option C is the most likely reason for the problems, as the other options are less directly related to the technical performance and reliability of the tool.","poster":"SuperMax"}],"answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-09-28 07:51:00","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121635-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-856-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":1313,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"rFsP2MZG9kKqPsoMlSKv","answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/98881-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-858-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"During a project assessment, an IS auditor finds that business owners have been removed from the project initiation phase.

Inadequate deliverables\n\nWhen business owners are removed from the project initiation phase, it can lead to a lack of alignment between the project's objectives and the actual needs of the business. This misalignment can result in inadequate deliverables, as the project may not address the essential requirements and objectives of the organization. Without the involvement of business owners, there is a higher risk that the project may produce outputs that do not meet the business's needs, which can be a significant concern for the organization. While incomplete requirements (A), unclear benefits (C), and unrealistic milestones (D) are also important concerns, inadequate deliverables can have a more direct and immediate impact on the project's success and its ability to deliver value to the organization.","poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711527000.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis should be A","timestamp":"1699309620.0","poster":"BabaP","comment_id":"890990"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1676169900,"answer":"A","question_id":1314,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-02-12 03:45:00","choices":{"A":"Incomplete requirements","C":"Unclear benefits","B":"Inadequate deliverables","D":"Unrealistic milestones"}},{"id":"024hb0H2hKI3vj3dp7q3","question_text":"When a data center is attempting to restore computing facilities at an alternative site following a disaster, which of the following should be restored FIRST?","answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Data backups","D":"Applications","C":"Decision support system","A":"Operating system"},"exam_id":156,"unix_timestamp":1689785820,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1128510","upvote_count":"5","poster":"KAP2HURUF","timestamp":"1721636820.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGiven these considerations, the first component to restore should be A.

Therefore, restoring data backups is often the first step in disaster recovery. This ensures that important data is available for use as soon as possible.\nOperating system (A): Once data is restored, the next priority is to bring up the operating system. The operating system is necessary to run applications and provide a platform for other services.\nApplications (D): After the operating system is in place, applications can be restored. This includes essential business applications that the organization relies on to function.\nDecision support system (C): Decision support systems, while important, are typically of lower priority compared to data, operating systems, and essential applications.
