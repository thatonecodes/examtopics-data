Several business cases are found to be based on a misdiagnosed problem. This option represents a fundamental flaw in the IT business planning process, as an accurate problem diagnosis is the cornerstone of effective business cases (supported by page 184 and page 176). Unlike the other options, which involve process or alignment issues that can potentially be corrected later, a misdiagnosed problem invalidates the entire rationale for IT initiatives, leading to significant resource waste and failure to meet business objectives. The systemic nature of \"several business cases\" further elevates its criticality.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1315897","timestamp":"1732206300.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"pLulu","content":"C. Business case development is completed before strategic initiatives are finalized.\n\nThis is the greatest concern because business cases should align with the organization's strategic initiatives.

Programmed edit checks (Option A) meet these criteria most effectively. They prevent invalid data from entering the system, include reasonableness checks as a subset, and leverage automation for reliability. The manual supports this in Section 3.4.1, stating that input validation routines like edit checks ensure data accuracy and completeness, aligning with the preventive control objective in Section 1.4.3.\nWhile reasonableness checks (B) are valuable, their scope is limited compared to edit checks. Manual methods (C and D) are less effective due to their reactive nature and susceptibility to human error.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST control to ensure data entered into a calculation program is accurate?","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"exam_id":156,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"sWxZSYCtDowtZYPVcYHw","unix_timestamp":1741880040,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":156,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Downloading a file from an enterprise file share","B":"Viewing a hypertext markup language (HTML) document","C":"Uploading a file onto an internal server","D":"Opening an email attachment from an external account"},"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Which of the following user actions poses the GREATEST risk for inadvertently introducing malware into a local network?","question_id":513,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/169013-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1712-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741880040.0","comment_id":"1389932","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe manual consistently highlights email attachments as a significant threat. In 5.11.4 Malware (page 508), it explicitly identifies them as a “common vector,” and real-world examples like ransomware (5.11.5 Ransomware, page 511) often originate this way.

By actively demonstrating that network internal controls can be breached, it provides the strongest evidence of inadequacy, directly countering the challenge that no serious incidents have occurred. This aligns with the CISA Manual’s emphasis on penetration testing as a practical, evidence-based approach to assess control effectiveness (CISA Manual, p. 514).","timestamp":"1741881060.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"46080f2","comment_id":"1390161"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1741881060,"question_id":514,"topic":"1","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/169014-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1713-discussion/","question_images":[],"exam_id":156,"question_text":"An IS audit report highlighting inadequate network internal controls is challenged because no serious incident has ever occurred.
