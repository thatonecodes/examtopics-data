Using field-level encryption with a vendor-supplied key.\n\nThe best option to reduce the risk associated with a sensitive data breach in this scenario is to use \"C. Using field-level encryption with a vendor-supplied key.\" Field-level encryption involves encrypting specific fields of sensitive data before they are stored or transmitted, and the encryption key is typically managed by the vendor. This approach ensures that even if the vendor experiences a data breach, the sensitive data remains encrypted and unreadable without the proper decryption key. This can significantly reduce the impact of a data breach and protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information.\n\nOptions A (engaging a third party to validate operational controls), B (using the same cloud vendor as a competitor), and D (ensuring the vendor does not know the encryption key) are also important considerations for risk management, but they may not provide the same level of protection against a data breach as field-level encryption with proper key management."},{"comment_id":"892112","timestamp":"1715169360.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC, A is too specific to operational controls.

The question seems to be mixing up risk and impact in some ways. \"BEST reduce the risk associated with such a data breach\" - such a data breach is an unauthorized individual with access to the data.

However, there are still controls that can be implemented to mitigate the risk associated with the data breach.\n\nIn the scenario presented, if the vendor refuses to accept liability for a sensitive data breach, one of the best controls to reduce the risk associated with the breach would be to engage a third party to validate the vendor's operational controls. This would help ensure that the vendor has implemented appropriate security controls to protect the data and would provide an independent assessment of the vendor's security posture.\n\nWhile ensuring the vendor does not know the encryption key could also be a useful control in preventing unauthorized access to the data, this control would not be effective in mitigating the risk associated with a data breach that has already occurred.","comments":[{"content":"how did you assume that the data breach already occurred? it's not mentioned clearly in the question that there is a data breach in that case we can hide the encryption key so that we can have the satisfaction that there will be no data breach.","poster":"Yahealborini","comment_id":"902075","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716133500.0"}],"comment_id":"818191","upvote_count":"2","poster":"john_boogieman"},{"comment_id":"810653","content":"should be D","poster":"Julianleehk","timestamp":"1708087680.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"785938","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe risk or impact of a data breach (already produced) is reduced if the data is encrypted and the keys are unknown to the provider.","timestamp":"1706051280.0"},{"comment_id":"742472","content":"Option A only provide assurance based on point in time assessment by a third party but does not reduce the risk of data breach.
