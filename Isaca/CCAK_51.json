Proper return or destruction mechanisms are essential to prevent unauthorized access, data leaks, or retention beyond the agreed-upon period, which can lead to privacy breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations. Therefore, ensuring that the provider has clear, secure, and compliant procedures for returning or destroying data is paramount for safeguarding customer privacy.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1729166580.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1197216","poster":"Ola213","content":"I think the answer is D, as data privacy would be compromised in the event of network intrusion.

Also, due to the customer’s limited visibility of the environment, the customer’s command to delete the data might be inadequate.

Point-in-time assurance provides a snapshot of compliance at a specific moment, while continuous monitoring enables real-time oversight of compliance status and can quickly identify any deviations or issues as they occur. This combination allows an organization to maintain a proactive stance, addressing compliance requirements dynamically and adjusting to changes in the cloud environment.

Absence of effective change control**\n\nEffective change control processes are crucial for managing configurations in a cloud environment. Without proper change control, unauthorized or incorrect changes can be made to cloud resources, leading to misconfigurations. These misconfigurations can result in security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, or operational disruptions. Ensuring robust change control helps maintain the integrity of cloud configurations and reduces the risk of errors. Using multiple cloud service providers, new cloud computing techniques, and traditional change process mechanisms can contribute to complexity, but the absence of effective change control is a direct cause of misconfiguration."},{"timestamp":"1723471140.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCCC-03–Quality Testing—Quality change control and testing are established for application misconfigurations affecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the systems and services.
