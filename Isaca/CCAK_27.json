Shared responsibility model\n\nIn cloud environments, the shared responsibility model delineates the division of responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the customer. This model is a fundamental shift from traditional IT environments, where the organization typically has full control over its infrastructure and data. In the cloud, responsibilities for security, compliance, and risk management are shared, requiring a different approach to managing and mitigating risks."}],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"BxspyHbIMPll4KP48j5e","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn planning the scope and objectives of a cloud audit, the effect of:\n\nB. Applicable statutory requirements\n\nshould generally have priority. Statutory requirements are legal obligations that an organization must comply with, and failing to meet these can result in legal penalties, fines, and other consequences. Therefore, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations is critical when conducting a cloud audit. While corporate standards, industry good practices, and organizational policies are important, statutory requirements typically take precedence because of their mandatory nature and potential legal implications.","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1743112800.0","comment_id":"1411060","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","answer_description":"","question_id":133,"timestamp":"2025-03-27 23:00:00","exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/169999-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-222-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"question_text":"The effect of which of the following should have priority in planning the scope and objectives of a cloud audit?","choices":{"A":"Applicable corporate standards","B":"Applicable statutory requirements","D":"Organizational policies and procedures","C":"Applicable industry good practices"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1743112800,"topic":"1"},{"id":"jUkGCzsT3RRRvaGH7qxi","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (50%)","A (50%)"],"question_id":134,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1411061","timestamp":"1743112920.0","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe report type that typically includes prescriptive remediation recommendations along with details and action steps is:\n\nB.

While internal reports may also include recommendations, audit reports are more formalized and structured to provide actionable steps for remediation."},{"poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: A\nP# 289 There are three kinds of reports: internal, limited and public. An internal report will cover the prescriptive remediation recommendations with details and action steps (if there are findings).

The audit trails are available for 3-4 days and are typically overwritten as soon as the disk reaches its capacity.\n\nThis observation would be of the greatest concern because audit trails are essential for detecting and investigating security incidents, ensuring compliance, and maintaining accountability. If audit trails are only available for a very short period and are overwritten quickly, it severely limits the ability to perform effective audits, conduct forensic analysis, and meet compliance requirements. This could hinder the organization's ability to respond to incidents or demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations, posing significant risks to security and compliance.","timestamp":"1743112920.0","comment_id":"1411062"}],"answer":"B","exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170000-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-224-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1743112920,"question_text":"When auditing a Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud service provider, which of the following observations would be of GREATEST concern to the auditor?","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-03-27 23:02:00"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"name":"CCAK","provider":"Isaca","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":258,"isImplemented":true,"id":153,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":27},"__N_SSP":true}
