Percentage of processes recovered within the recovery time and point objectives.\n\nThis KPI directly assesses the success of the disaster recovery test by measuring the percentage of critical business processes that were successfully recovered within the predefined recovery time and point objectives. Meeting these objectives is crucial for ensuring that the organization can resume its operations within an acceptable timeframe and with minimal data loss in the event of a disaster.\n\nWhile other metrics, such as the number of issues resolved or the identification and resolution of job failures, are important aspects of the testing process, they are more specific and may not provide a comprehensive measure of the overall effectiveness of the disaster recovery test. The percentage of processes recovered within the defined objectives gives a broader and more holistic view of the test's success in meeting recovery goals.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717603500.0","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1088700"},{"comment_id":"885110","content":"Selected Answer: B\nClearly B.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698669420.0","poster":"CbtL"},{"comment_id":"874375","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1697702340.0","content":"Selected Answer B","poster":"CC11"},{"timestamp":"1692538980.0","poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"815470","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe BEST key performance indicator (KPI) to measure the effectiveness of a disaster recovery test of critical business processes is the percentage of processes recovered within the recovery time and point objectives.\n\nThis KPI directly measures the ability of the disaster recovery plan to restore critical business processes within the time and point objectives that have been established. If the percentage of processes recovered is high, it indicates that the disaster recovery plan is effective and can be relied upon in the event of an actual disaster.\n\nWhile the number of issues and action items resolved during the recovery test is also an important KPI to consider, it does not provide as direct a measure of the effectiveness of the disaster recovery plan."}],"unix_timestamp":1676907780,"answer_description":"","answer":"B","timestamp":"2023-02-20 16:43:00","exam_id":160},{"id":"APYa1fQM1FPtG6r3ydUT","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-20 16:45:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/100088-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1288-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","exam_id":160,"unix_timestamp":1676907900,"question_text":"Which of the following is the PRIMARY objective of establishing an organization’s risk tolerance and appetite?","question_id":302,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
