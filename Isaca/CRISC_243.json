Risk owner\n\nThe risk owner is responsible for overseeing the control environment and ensuring that the controls put in place to mitigate identified risks are effective. This includes monitoring the controls' performance, assessing their adequacy, and taking corrective actions if needed. While security monitoring operations and system owners play crucial roles in implementing and maintaining controls, the ultimate accountability for control effectiveness often rests with the risk owner, as they have a vested interest in managing the associated risks. Data owners, on the other hand, may be responsible for specific data-related controls but not necessarily the entire control environment.","poster":"Staanlee","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713203940.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree with A.","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"871188"},{"comment_id":"863719","content":"Selected Answer: A\nkey word ' accountable'.

Therefore, the business unit is responsible for managing the risks associated with the applications they use.\n\nWhen a high-risk vulnerability is identified in an application, it is the responsibility of the business unit to assess the potential impact of the vulnerability on their operations, customers, and overall business objectives. Based on this assessment, the business unit should prioritize and allocate resources to remediate the vulnerability.\n\nThe IT department can support the business unit in identifying and remediating vulnerabilities, but they do not have the knowledge or expertise to determine the business impact of a vulnerability.

Trends in IT resource usage.\n\nTrends in IT resource usage are a key indicator of IT capacity. By monitoring how IT resources are being utilized over time, management can gain insights into whether the organization's IT capacity is sufficient to meet its needs. If resource usage trends consistently indicate high levels of utilization, it may be an indicator that additional IT capacity is needed to support the organization's operations effectively.\n\nWhile increased resource availability is important, it doesn't provide the same level of feedback on IT capacity as trends in resource usage. Trends in IT maintenance costs may provide insights into the efficiency of resource utilization but may not directly measure capacity. An increased number of incidents may be related to capacity issues but is more indicative of operational challenges and may not provide a direct measure of IT capacity."},{"comment_id":"871195","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713204300.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt is A."},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Koulyo","content":"convinced with A","timestamp":"1712190540.0","comment_id":"860501"},{"comment_id":"790139","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nEffective risk indicators should include trend information (3.15.1 risk selection 7th CRISC manual).","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1706404140.0"},{"poster":"Raj1510","comments":[{"poster":"Ceecil1959","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"But D, incident may not related to capacity.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1681241520.0","comment_id":"584390","poster":"Ceecil1959","upvote_count":"1","content":"I was sure that it was not D: incidents, and their answers are normally incorrect.
