These tools help monitor and manage the allocation of resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth to ensure that they are utilized optimally to meet the organization's needs while avoiding over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources. The goal is to ensure that the IT infrastructure operates efficiently, performs well, and meets the demands of users and applications without unnecessary waste or bottlenecks. While the other options (B, C, and D) can be related to capacity management to some extent, they are not the primary focus of capacity management tools."}],"poster":"3008","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCapacity management is the process of ensuring that IT resources, including hardware, software, and personnel, are utilized efficiently to meet current and future business needs. The primary objective of capacity management is to ensure that the IT infrastructure can meet the current and future demands of the business while minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency.","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Pakawat","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA: Available resources are used efficiently and effectively","comment_id":"908354","timestamp":"1716874740.0"},{"content":"A is correct answers","poster":"kertyce","timestamp":"1707708780.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"805929"},{"timestamp":"1702996860.0","comment_id":"749925","content":"Answer A thx","poster":"blarzz58","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1671460860,"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_id":1346},{"id":"grGUOT9S8RPd9Plmr3dO","question_text":"Which of the following should be the FIRST step in managing the impact of a recently discovered zero-day attack?","answers_community":["B (80%)","C (20%)"],"timestamp":"2022-09-25 15:52:00","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1664113920,"choices":{"B":"Identifying vulnerable assets","D":"Assessing the impact of vulnerabilities","C":"Evaluating the likelihood of attack","A":"Estimating potential damage"},"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"poster":"Deeplaxmi","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"678864","content":"yes, Knowing the vulnerable asset is imp, then only one can find out which assets might have faced the damage and thence the potential impact/ loss.","timestamp":"1664113920.0"},{"timestamp":"1743794580.0","comment_id":"1487200","content":"Selected Answer: B\nZero-day attack exploits a security vulnerability that is not yet known or patched.

Cluster sampling\n\nCluster sampling is a method of sampling where the population is divided into clusters or groups, and then a random sample of clusters is selected for further analysis. Within each selected cluster, all individuals or a subset of individuals are included in the study. This approach is particularly effective when you want to identify groups with similar behavior or characteristics because it naturally groups individuals who are geographically or demographically close together.
