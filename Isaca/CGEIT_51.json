This could be due to a number of factors, such as changes in the business requirements, changes in the user environment, or simply a misunderstanding of the software's capabilities.\n\nOption D, Review help desk logs, is the better first step because it will provide a more accurate picture of the problems that users are having with the software. Once the specific problems have been identified, then it can be determined whether or not UAT was completed successfully.\n\nIn addition, reviewing the help desk logs will help to identify the root causes of the problems.
