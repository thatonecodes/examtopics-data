Conducting a post-implementation review to determine lessons learned.\n\nConducting a post-implementation review is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the re-engineered business process and identifying any risks that may have emerged or not been adequately addressed during the re-engineering process. This review allows the organization to learn from its experiences, identify areas for improvement, and adjust risk management strategies accordingly. It helps in refining future re-engineering efforts and ensures that risks are managed properly in the long term. While the other options may also be important components of risk management, conducting a post-implementation review is the best approach to ensure that risks are managed properly after a business process has been re-engineered.","upvote_count":"3"}],"choices":{"B":"Reporting key performance indicators (KPIs) for core processes","C":"Conducting a post-implementation review to determine lessons learned","D":"Establishing escalation procedures for anomaly events","A":"Reassessing control effectiveness of the process"}},{"id":"PvHaWm3cbnvHsLouvqlT","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":160,"question_id":622,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Business process owner","D":"Risk practitioner","A":"Application owner","B":"Senior management"},"timestamp":"2024-08-30 20:24:00","discussion":[{"poster":"Sara98","timestamp":"1725042240.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
