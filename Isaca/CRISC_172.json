Evaluate alternative controls\n\nIf preventive controls can't be implemented due to technological limitations, the first step should be to evaluate alternative controls. These could include detective or corrective controls. You want to identify another way to reduce the risk, and then potentially consider redefining business processes, upgrading technology, or defining a new monitoring process. But the first step should be to see if there's another way to control the risk."}],"answer":"B"},{"id":"BSDSBF9n2nigCyDpH7h6","choices":{"A":"Monitor key risk indicators (KRIs)","C":"Conduct a gap analysis","D":"Interview the risk owner","B":"Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1611472020.0","content":"A - KRIs is the correct answer.

Monitor key risk indicators (KRIs)\n\nThe best way to identify changes in the risk profile of an organization is to monitor key risk indicators (KRIs). KRIs are specific metrics or data points that are directly linked to the organization's risks. By tracking these indicators, you can gain insight into how the risk landscape is evolving and whether new risks are emerging or existing risks are changing in severity. Monitoring KRIs allows for a proactive approach to risk management, enabling the organization to take appropriate actions to mitigate risks as they evolve.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1690384140.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Monitor key risk indicators (KRIs)\n\nKey Risk Indicators (KRIs) are designed specifically to monitor changes in the risk profile of an organization. They are a set of quantifiable measures used by organizations to monitor how risks change over time. They serve as an early warning system for problematic conditions that could harm the organization, allowing management to take action before damages occur. Other options, while important in a risk management program, are not as directly linked to identifying changes in the organization's risk profile.","poster":"01010100","comment_id":"963868","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1685928420.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mraiyan","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGoing with \"A\", monitoring KRIs is more effective, comprehensive and objective to identify changes of risk in the environment.","comment_id":"914998"},{"content":"should be A","poster":"Julianleehk","comment_id":"876134","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1682043600.0"},{"content":"Some times KRI’s don’t capture an event that changes the risk profile.
