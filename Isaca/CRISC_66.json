Internal audit reports are typically conducted by a specialized and independent team that assesses the effectiveness of controls across various areas of the organization. These reports are based on a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of controls, and they typically provide detailed findings, including the scope of deficiencies, their potential impact, and recommendations for remediation.

By clearly defining control activities and documenting them in policies and procedures, organizations can better mitigate key risks relating to financial reporting, compliance, operations etc.\n\nWhile well documented controls can also facilitate auditing and testing, support control monitoring efforts, and potentially improve control operation, these are secondary benefits. The core underlying purpose is to actively control risk exposures based on the organization's assessment of risks and acceptable levels.","poster":"Kennethlim79","comment_id":"1086524","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717372920.0"},{"comment_id":"897414","content":"Selected Answer: D\n\"...

By having clear, documented procedures, employees can understand what is expected of them and can follow a consistent approach to control operations. This can help to reduce the risk of errors or omissions and increase the likelihood that controls will operate effectively.\n\nWhile the creation and documentation of control procedures can help manage risk, the primary purpose is to increase the likelihood of effective control operation. By increasing the effectiveness of control operations, an organization can reduce the risk of negative outcomes and better achieve its objectives.","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1692541080.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"2023-02-20 17:18:00","question_id":328,"answer":"D"},{"id":"U6zGNHHiJl6DBfaj4w2L","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107984-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1314-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-04-30 14:42:00","question_text":"Of the following, who should be PRIMARILY responsible for performing user entitlement reviews?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730299320.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with C.
