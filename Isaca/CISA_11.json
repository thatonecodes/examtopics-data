Data virtualization is an approach that allows organizations to access and query data from multiple sources, including different data warehouses, without physically moving the data. It provides a logical layer that abstracts the underlying physical data storage, enabling users to query and analyze data as if it were stored in a single location.\nThis approach helps in avoiding the need for extensive data movement, reducing the workload associated with extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data between warehouses. It promotes a more agile and efficient data integration strategy, allowing organizations to access and analyze data across multiple sources in real-time."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Data virtualization\n\nData virtualization is the best option among the choices for integrating multiple data warehouses while reducing the workload required for moving data between them. Data virtualization allows you to create a logical layer that abstracts the physical locations and formats of data, making it easier to access and query data from multiple sources without the need for extensive data movement or transformation. This approach can significantly reduce the workload and complexity associated with traditional Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes, real-time data mirroring, or streaming data integration.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1696093980.0","comment_id":"1021738"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Real-time data mirroring","D":"Streaming data integration","B":"Data virtualization","A":"Extract, transform, and load"},"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121934-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1043-discussion/","question_id":51,"isMC":true,"exam_id":156},{"id":"aJ7DcZWWyoU65YVNF7RE","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107545-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1044-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Compensating","D":"Preventive","C":"Corrective","A":"Detective"},"topic":"1","exam_id":156,"answers_community":["D (55%)","A (45%)"],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-04-26 09:59:00","unix_timestamp":1682495940,"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A confidential file was sent to a legal entity, and hashing was used on the file.

Preventive controls are designed to stop an incident or violation from occurring. In this case, hashing is used to ensure the integrity of the file by generating a hash value (a fixed-size string of characters) based on the content of the file. If the file is altered in any way, the hash value will change, indicating potential tampering.\nThe use of hashing in this context is a preventive measure to help prevent unauthorized changes to the confidential file and maintain its integrity during transmission or storage."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is answer.
