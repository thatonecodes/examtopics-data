This provides a structured framework for evaluating cloud security, ensuring that all necessary controls are considered and that the organization meets industry best practices. Established standards, such as ISO/IEC 27017 for cloud-specific controls or the Cloud Security Alliance's Cloud Controls Matrix, are designed to address the unique challenges of cloud environments and can provide clear guidance on responsibilities and security measures. This approach helps the organization systematically assess its cloud security posture and guides the implementation of appropriate controls."}],"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"An organization is in the initial phases of cloud adoption.
