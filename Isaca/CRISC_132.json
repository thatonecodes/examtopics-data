Overriding these controls during any phase of the SDLC, including user testing, can lead to significant risks such as unauthorized access, manipulation of data, and lack of accountability.

Overriding these controls during user testing phases could potentially lead to unauthorized or inappropriate actions being taken, increasing the risk of fraud, errors, or data breaches. Therefore, a risk practitioner would be particularly concerned if segregation of duties controls were compromised during any phase of the SDLC, as it could introduce significant risks to the development process and the resulting system","poster":"Baddest"}]},{"id":"0Dv1ag1dIFG3W6x7RlS9","question_id":657,"choices":{"D":"Decrease in budget allocated for risk mitigation activities","A":"Organizational restructuring","C":"Outsourcing of in-house software development","B":"Increase in penalties for unauthorized data disclosure"},"answer_images":[],"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/137025-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1709-discussion/","answers_community":["B (75%)","D (25%)"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1711236660,"timestamp":"2024-03-24 00:31:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729658700.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nrisk tolerance = The level of risk taking acceptable to achieve a specific objective or manage a category of risk - therefore, if there are greater penalties for data disclosure, then this is most likely to cause senior management to lower the tolerance level.","comment_id":"1200475","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Callumhindmarsh"},{"comment_id":"1181213","timestamp":"1727127060.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Decrease in budget allocated for risk mitigation activities.\n\nA decrease in the budget allocated for risk mitigation activities could lead senior management to lower the risk tolerance level. With fewer resources available for addressing and mitigating risks, senior management may opt to reduce risk tolerance to avoid the potential financial and operational impacts associated with higher-risk activities. This decision could involve scaling back on certain projects, initiatives, or business activities that carry higher inherent risks.","poster":"Baddest"}],"exam_id":160,"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following would MOST likely cause senior management to lower the risk tolerance level?","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"2mZNK0vUbJ5YtpUqaZjc","timestamp":"2023-11-26 15:06:00","topic":"1","question_text":"You are the project manager of HGT project.

Following are the tasks that are involved in articulating risk:\n✑ Communicate risk analysis results.\n✑ Report risk management activities and the state of compliance.\n✑ Interpret independent risk assessment findings.\n✑ Identify business opportunities.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: Risk mitigation attempts to reduce the probability of a risk event and its impacts to an acceptable level. Risk mitigation can utilize various forms of control carefully integrated together.
