Business agility involves more than IT and IT security, if the product delivered by the business is rock solid and better than competitors then IT and IT security may aid to that achievement but not solely the main responsibility for business agility. A maturity model will provide the current state and the future state we want to get to by the process of continuious improvement which is governance.","timestamp":"1727379960.0","poster":"yottabyte","comment_id":"1183637"},{"comment_id":"1018199","timestamp":"1711496700.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"A Business Agility\n Business Agility is a people-centred, organisation-wide capability that enables a business to deliver value to a world characterised by ever-increasing volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.","poster":"wickhaarry"},{"poster":"oluchecpoint","comment_id":"1003680","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption C","timestamp":"1710052080.0"},{"comment_id":"945237","upvote_count":"1","poster":"richck102","timestamp":"1704606180.0","content":"C.

Improved risk management.\n\nOne of the desired outcomes of information security governance is improved risk management. Effective information security governance helps organizations to better understand and manage the risks that they face, and to implement appropriate controls and procedures to mitigate those risks. This helps to ensure that the organization's information assets are protected, and that the organization is better positioned to respond to security incidents. Other outcomes of information security governance, such as penetration testing, a maturity model, and business agility, may be important as well, but they are not as directly related to the goal of improved risk management."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/97473-exam-cism-topic-1-question-731-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is a desired outcome of information security governance?"},{"id":"Fdb8mkhujMUKstHsIqrt","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis is the most critical aspect because it ensures that decision-makers and relevant teams are aware of the risks, can make informed decisions, and take proactive steps to mitigate those risks.
