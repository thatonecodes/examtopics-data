Key risk indicators (KRIs) are most effective for communicating forward-looking trends within security reporting. KRIs are metrics that measure potential risks and help organizations to anticipate and respond to future security threats.

Key risk indicators (KRI) focus on forward-looking trends in security reporting, they are indicators that focus on predictive or leading factors. KPIs on the other hand are retrospective in nature, meaning they provide insights into how well an organization has performed in the past or is currently performing.

You should not change your security requirements right away, if you cannot implement the related measure efficiently. Instead, it would be wise to first look for the cause (e.g., why the DLP software is not working)? If nothing helps and you cannot implement measures as requirements state, then you might want to consider changing requirements (e.g., maybe requirements were wrongly set / identified).
