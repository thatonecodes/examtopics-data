Qualitative analysis\n\nQualitative analysis is most likely to be used to assess plausible risk scenarios that could result in reputational risk to the enterprise. This method involves evaluating risks based on their qualitative attributes, such as likelihood, impact, and potential consequences. It often involves expert judgment, brainstorming sessions, and scenario analysis to identify and assess risks that could impact the organization's reputation.

Review information classification procedures.\n\nReviewing information classification procedures should be the FIRST step for a new Chief Information Officer (CIO) to ensure effective governance of information assets. Information classification procedures help determine the sensitivity and importance of various types of information within the organization. By understanding how information is classified, the CIO can assess the current state of governance, identify potential gaps or weaknesses, and establish a foundation for managing and protecting information assets effectively.\n\nOnce the information classification procedures are reviewed and understood, the CIO can then proceed to perform other tasks such as performing an information gap analysis, evaluating information access methods, and quantifying the business value of information assets.
