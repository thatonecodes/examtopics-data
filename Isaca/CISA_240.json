Validate the low-risk entity ratings and apply professional judgment.\n\nThe IS audit manager should validate the risk ratings first, rather than immediately challenging or acting upon them. By validating the risk ratings, the IS audit manager ensures that the ratings are accurate and are based on comprehensive and current information. Once these risk ratings are validated, the audit manager can then use their professional judgment to determine the appropriate level of audit attention that should be given to these entities.","poster":"Broesweelies","timestamp":"1722343440.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1690721040,"choices":{"C":"Conduct limited-scope audits of low-risk business entities.","D":"Validate the low-risk entity ratings and apply professional judgment.","A":"Outsource low-risk audits to external audit service providers.","B":"Challenge the risk rating and include the low-risk entities in the plan."},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"During audit planning, the IS audit manager is considering whether to budget for audits of entities regarded by the business as having low risk.
