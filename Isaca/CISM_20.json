Multiple and redundant paths. Because DDoS attacks aim to flood and overwhelm systems or networks with traffic from many sources. The best defense is to have resilience and redundancy built into your network architecture. Multiple and redundant paths (like through CDNs, load balancers, and geographically dispersed servers) help absorb or reroute malicious traffic, keeping services up.\n\nRegarding D.Well-configured routers and firewalls. This is an expected basic line of defense, especially with access control lists (ACLs) or rate-limiting. But they can be also overwhelmed in large-scale DDoS attacks without the redundancy and capacity offered by option B."},{"comment_id":"1387591","timestamp":"1741718880.0","poster":"eshah","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBest way is to have multiple and redundant path for mitigating DDOS"},{"comment_id":"1336984","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt can be a well-defense layered strategy","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736144400.0","poster":"mdmdmd"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nProperly configured routers and firewalls can filter out malicious traffic and help mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1288161","timestamp":"1727101560.0","poster":"Raj91188"},{"timestamp":"1724700480.0","poster":"Infosecnerd","upvote_count":"3","content":"D: Well-configured routers and firewalls are the best defense against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
