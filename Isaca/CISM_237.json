Inability to determine short-term impact.\nThe temporary deactivation of a critical monitoring process due to the acceptance of an operational risk poses a significant concern for the information security manager. In this case, the information security manager may be unable to determine the immediate impact of the situation.\nMonitoring processes play a crucial role in identifying and responding to security incidents, vulnerabilities, or abnormal activities in a timely manner. By temporarily deactivating a critical monitoring process, the organization may lose visibility into potential security threats, breaches, or risks. This lack of visibility can hinder the ability to detect and respond to security incidents promptly, potentially leading to prolonged security breaches or increased damages.","poster":"koala_lay","comment_id":"1043183","timestamp":"1713079560.0"},{"timestamp":"1712094780.0","poster":"wickhaarry","upvote_count":"3","content":"D.
