The former - merely supporting - function in the development of the general KPIs of the organization is certainly the weaker threat to his independence than a current development of KPIs for the assessment of the internal audit team with his current, current activity as Lead Auditor, obviously within the same organization, i.e. his own team. In B.'s case, I see no compelling connection between his former support for the general organizational KPIs and the risk-related KPIs that are now recommended.

Developing KPIs to measure the internal audit team.\n\nIndependence is one of the most important qualities of an auditor, and it is essential to ensure that the auditor can carry out his or her responsibilities without any bias or undue influence. When an employee moves from one department to another, there is a potential risk that their previous role may influence their current role and create a conflict of interest. In this case, the employee helped develop the KPIs that are now being used by the organization, and these KPIs are being used to measure the effectiveness of the internal audit team.
