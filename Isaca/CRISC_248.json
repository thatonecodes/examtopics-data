A list of unencrypted databases which contain sensitive data.\n\nWhen assessing the risk impact of not having encryption in place for IT application databases, the most important information would be to identify which databases contain sensitive data and are currently unencrypted. This information helps in understanding the scope and magnitude of the risk. Knowing which specific databases are affected allows for a more targeted risk assessment and risk management efforts.
