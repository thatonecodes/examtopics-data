SLAs are formal agreements that outline the expected level of service between a service provider and a customer.

Service level agreements (SLAs) are the best indicator that an organization has implemented IT performance requirements, as they clearly define the level of service that the IT department is expected to provide to the business.

Obtain an objective view of process gaps and systemic errors.\n\nThe primary reason to have the risk management process reviewed by a third party is to obtain an objective and impartial assessment of the process. Third-party reviews are valuable because they can identify process gaps, weaknesses, and systemic errors that may not be apparent to internal stakeholders. These reviews often involve experts who bring an external perspective and can provide insights that help improve the risk management process.\n\nWhile ensuring the risk profile is defined and communicated, validating the threat management process, and obtaining an objective assessment of the control environment are important aspects of risk management, the primary focus of a third-party review is to identify and address process gaps and errors to enhance the overall effectiveness of the risk management process.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1005190"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1713199020.0","comment_id":"871105","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is D","comments":[{"poster":"CbtL","content":"Or, you know, A, since I picked A.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713199080.0","comment_id":"871107"}]},{"poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"811160","timestamp":"1708121880.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree."}],"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"exam_id":160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/99476-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-781-discussion/","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"nmebRlUOeqNvA0uRiQUh","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree it is D","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"871112","timestamp":"1729010640.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"D","exam_id":160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/106277-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-782-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-15 18:44:00","question_id":1198,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Assess the goals and culture of the organization.","A":"Conduct a high-level risk assessment based on the nature of business.","B":"Collect data of past incidents and lessons learned.","C":"Identify the risk appetite of the organization."},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1681577040,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Which of the following activities should be performed FIRST when establishing IT risk management processes?","answer_description":""},{"id":"rIliDSHnWEOi8Bfp4xfC","question_id":1199,"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/106278-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-783-discussion/","answer":"C","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729010760.0","comment_id":"871114"}],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1681577160,"question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST way to validate whether controls to reduce user device vulnerabilities have been implemented according to management's action plan?","timestamp":"2023-04-15 18:46:00","exam_id":160,"question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Survey device owners.","D":"Require annual end user policy acceptance.","C":"Re-scan the user environment.","B":"Review awareness training assessment results."},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true},{"id":"ZNenczK7FeLamDwglkwd","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/106280-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-784-discussion/","question_id":1200,"unix_timestamp":1681577280,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-04-15 18:48:00","exam_id":160,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer":"B","question_text":"An organization moved its payroll system to a Software as a Service (SaaS) application.

Understand data flows.\n\nWhen addressing the situation where a new data privacy regulation stipulates that data can only be processed within the country where it is collected, the first step should be to understand the data flows within the organization. This involves mapping out how data moves through the organization, where it is collected, how it is processed, and where it is stored.\n\nUnderstanding data flows is crucial because it allows the organization to identify any potential violations of the regulation and assess the impact on its systems and processes. It also helps in determining whether the organization is compliant with the regulation and what changes may be necessary to ensure compliance. This understanding forms the basis for making informed decisions and taking appropriate actions, such as analyzing data protection methods, implementing access controls, and considering right-to-audit clauses, to address the compliance requirements effectively.","comment_id":"1005195","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.
