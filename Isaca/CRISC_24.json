When the risk is lower than the tolerance level, you don't take \"no action.\" \"Take no action\" is not a risk response. The action you are taking is risk acceptance. But risk acceptance is not one of the possible answers. The next step after that would be to enter the risk into the risk register so that it could periodically be evaluated. What is a \"low risk\" today may become a \"high risk\" later due to changing landscape (threats). So the best answer for this question is update the risk register.","poster":"Anon530"},{"poster":"Rooks","content":"Even if no action is needed sbouldn't ne registered in the risk register?","timestamp":"1697914260.0","upvote_count":"5","comments":[{"comment_id":"272275","timestamp":"1705785000.0","content":"Unless this Risk is already in the risk register... the question is worded poorly to me...","poster":"JohnnyBravo79","upvote_count":"2"}],"comment_id":"203869"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn ISACA CRISC QnA Database, 'Reviewing Study Task Practice: Risk Treatment/Risk Response Options | Set 1' questionnaires. \nThere is a Question 2 of which the justification of 'No Action' is explained as the following, \n'Taking no action is an example of risk acceptance.
