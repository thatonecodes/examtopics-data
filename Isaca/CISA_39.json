Continuously monitoring IT control operations and reporting any abnormal or exceptional cases.\n\nInternal IS auditors are primarily responsible for evaluating and monitoring the effectiveness of IT controls within an organization. This involves regularly reviewing and assessing the operation of these controls, identifying any anomalies or exceptions, and reporting on them to management. While validating IT control effectiveness (Option D) is an important aspect of their role, continuous monitoring and reporting of issues take precedence in ensuring that IT controls are functioning as intended. Option A (providing independent assurance to the public) is typically the responsibility of external auditors, not internal auditors. Option C (designing and deploying IT controls) is typically the responsibility of IT and security teams, not auditors.","timestamp":"1712028480.0"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (70%)","B (30%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/108673-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1170-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-05-07 10:17:00","choices":{"C":"Designing and deploying IT controls as part of normal operations","A":"Providing independent assurance to the public over IT controls implemented by the organization","B":"Continuously monitoring IT control operations and reporting any abnormal or exceptional cases","D":"Validating IT control effectiveness after implementation across the organization"},"question_text":"Which of the following is the PRIMARY responsibility of an internal IS auditor regarding IT controls?","question_id":192,"exam_id":156,"question_images":[],"answer":"D"},{"id":"SjLZQPxyGmDQaC1TpaYI","topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen reviewing the IT asset disposal process, an IS auditor should be most concerned with the data stored on the asset.
