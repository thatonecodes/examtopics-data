Sufficient time has elapsed since implementation to provide evidence of control operation. This ensures the auditor can review tangible evidence of how the controls perform over time, which is essential for validating their effectiveness. Completion (Option A) and progress updates (Option B) are preliminary steps, but they don’t guarantee operational success. Similarly, regulatory timelines (Option D) are secondary to the auditor’s need for evidence-based assurance.

This option suggests that the corrective actions are being implemented as planned and that there is evidence of progress toward addressing the identified audit issues. By ensuring that the implementation is on track, the auditor can schedule follow-up at a suitable time to verify completion and effectiveness. While other options may also provide relevant information, such as sufficient time elapsed since implementation to provide evidence of control operation (option C), progress updates indicating implementation progress offer more specific guidance on the timing of follow-up activities. Option C focuses on the passage of time rather than active progress toward resolution.","comment_id":"1221561","poster":"Swallows","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717070520.0","comments":[]}],"timestamp":"2024-05-30 14:02:00","exam_id":156,"answer":"C","answers_community":["C (75%)","B (25%)"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1717070520,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Regulators have announced a timeline for an inspection visit.","B":"Progress updates indicate that the implementation of agreed actions is on track.","A":"Business management has completed the implementation of agreed actions on schedule.","C":"Sufficient time has elapsed since implementation to provide evidence of control operation."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/141597-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1510-discussion/","question_id":427,"isMC":true},{"id":"28fo69vigVOc7E6x1gSH","choices":{"B":"Service level agreements (SLAs) may not be achievable.","C":"Service provider controls may not be in place.","D":"Service provider policies may not be properly documented.","A":"Roles and responsibilities may not be understood."},"question_text":"An IS auditor finds that management has signed a contract with a new application service provider but did not obtain third-party audit reports as part of the due diligence process.
