Monitor transaction logs.\n\nMonitoring transaction logs is a practical and effective way to oversee and review the activities within the legacy application. This allows for the detection of any inappropriate or unauthorized actions that might occur due to the lack of enforced separation of duties. By regularly reviewing these logs, the organization can identify unusual or conflicting transactions, which is crucial when the application itself cannot enforce the necessary controls. While establishing delegated authorities, periodically validating user entitlements, and developing user access policies are important, they do not directly address the issue of enforcement in the same way as active monitoring of transaction logs.","comment_id":"1086651","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733206500.0","poster":"Kennethlim79"},{"poster":"krishccie","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1020146","timestamp":"1727546640.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nlog analysis"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1726103040.0","poster":"HS2804","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSeems ok too.

Comparing the actual process with the documented process.\n\nThis method involves a thorough review of how the access management process is actually being carried out in comparison to how it is documented and supposed to work. This comparison can reveal discrepancies between the intended procedures and the real-world implementation, identifying areas where the process may not be followed correctly or effectively. It's a comprehensive approach that not only checks for compliance but also evaluates the practical application and efficiency of the access management policies and procedures in the organization.","comment_id":"1086652","timestamp":"1717388160.0","poster":"Kennethlim79"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncompliance","comment_id":"1020143","timestamp":"1711655640.0","poster":"krishccie","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714608900.0","comment_id":"1060195","content":"No. It should be C.

Risk that exceeds risk appetite.\n\nRisks that exceed the organization's risk appetite are the most critical, as they surpass the level of risk the organization has determined it is willing to accept. Addressing these risks is essential to bring them within acceptable limits and to maintain the organization's overall risk exposure at a manageable level. While untreated risks, risks with high likelihood, and those with high inherent risk are also important, the primary focus should be on ensuring that all risks are within the organization's defined risk appetite, as this aligns risk management with the organization's strategic objectives and tolerance for risk.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1086654","poster":"Kennethlim79","timestamp":"1717388280.0"},{"poster":"krishccie","comment_id":"1020135","timestamp":"1711654680.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD it is"}],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following should be given the HIGHEST priority when developing a response plan for risk assessment results?","timestamp":"2023-09-28 19:38:00","answer_description":"","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Risk that has been untreated","C":"Items with a high inherent risk","B":"Items with the highest likelihood of occurrence","D":"Risk that exceeds risk appetite"},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":505,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121728-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1485-discussion/","exam_id":160,"unix_timestamp":1695922680}],"exam":{"provider":"Isaca","isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"id":160,"name":"CRISC","numberOfQuestions":1422},"currentPage":101},"__N_SSP":true}
