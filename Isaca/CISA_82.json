This is because it involves a proactive approach to identifying, documenting, and addressing gaps or issues in the organization's compliance posture. By doing so, the organization can ensure that it is not only aware of its compliance status but is also taking steps to remediate any deficiencies. This ongoing process of assessment and remediation demonstrates a commitment to compliance and continuous improvement, which are key indicators of an effective compliance program.","timestamp":"1714717800.0","poster":"KAP2HURUF"},{"poster":"hermfrancis","upvote_count":"4","content":"For IS auditor, A\nFor Management, B....\nAnother controversial and irresponsible question for ISACA","comment_id":"1189692","timestamp":"1712300520.0","comments":[{"poster":"PurpleParrot","content":"exactly....i don't even know what the question seeks.","timestamp":"1728546240.0","comment_id":"1295473","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1718259300.0","poster":"46080f2","upvote_count":"1","content":"I can only agree with that.

By analyzing these logs, an organization can identify potential security threats associated with a virtualization technique proposed by the vendor of a popular virtual machine (VM) system. Hypervisor logs record various activities such as virtual machine creation, deletion, resource allocation, network traffic, and system configuration changes. Analyzing these logs allows organizations to detect unauthorized access, unusual behaviors, and potential security vulnerabilities within the virtualized environment, enabling them to take proactive measures to mitigate security risks. While risk assessment (option C) is important for identifying and prioritizing security threats, hypervisor logs provide real-time data that directly relates to the operation of the virtualization technique and can reveal specific security issues within the VM system."},{"timestamp":"1715017500.0","poster":"a84n","comment_id":"1207496","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect Answer is C\noption D may not proactively identify potential security threats associated with a proposed virtualization technique."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFor ISACA's logic about the questions, D should be the answer because C is not only for VM environments.","timestamp":"1712301060.0","comment_id":"1189696","poster":"hermfrancis"}],"answers_community":["C (56%)","D (44%)"],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-04-05 09:11:00","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1712301060,"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/137949-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1492-discussion/","answer_description":"","exam_id":156,"choices":{"D":"Hypervisor logs","B":"Functional specifications","A":"Architecture design","C":"Risk assessment"},"question_text":"Which of the following BEST enables an organization to identify potential security threats associated with a virtualization technique proposed by the vendor of a popular virtual machine (VM) system?","topic":"1","answer":"C","question_id":409},{"id":"Io0ZORWM4uVV0ZYV0W9z","answer_ET":"B","question_id":410,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/143265-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1493-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","exam_id":156,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. prepare a follow-up audit report reiterating the recommendation.","poster":"RS66","comment_id":"1265609","timestamp":"1723630680.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1720085940.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Swallows","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA follow-up audit report documents and details any recommendations made during the initial audit that were not implemented.\nThe auditor can clearly state why the recommendations were not implemented and what was done instead, helping management understand the nature of the problem.","comment_id":"1241940"}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"prepare a follow-up audit report reiterating the recommendation.","C":"escalate the issue to senior management.","A":"modify the audit opinion based on the new information available.","D":"conclude that the residual risk is beyond tolerable levels of risk."},"timestamp":"2024-07-04 11:39:00","question_text":"During a follow-up audit, an IS auditor finds that the auditee has updated virus scanner definitions without adopting the original audit recommendation to increase the frequency of using the scanner.
