Ownership of an audit finding has not been assigned\n\nNot assigning ownership to an audit finding can lead to a lack of accountability for resolving the issue. When ownership is not clearly defined, it becomes less likely that the issue will be addressed in a timely and effective manner. Other options listed, while potentially concerning, do not hold the same immediate implications for the risk management process and the ongoing security of the organization. Hence, this should be of most concern for the risk practitioner.","comment_id":"969280"},{"comment_id":"916750","poster":"mraiyan","content":"Why we dropped \"B\" and \"D\", they are mapped to data center risk profile.

Failure to assign ownership of an audit finding can result in a lack of accountability, which can lead to delayed or incomplete corrective actions. This can result in the persistence of identified risks, and the organization may remain exposed to potential threats.\n\nWhile the communication of audit findings to senior management is also important, it is not as critical as assigning ownership of the findings. Communication of audit findings to senior management is essential for keeping management informed about risks and deficiencies, so they can make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the internal audit department to ensure that audit findings are assigned to an accountable owner who can implement corrective actions and manage the risk effectively.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"john_boogieman"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1708985400.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"816976","timestamp":"1708539300.0","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree."},{"comment_id":"764994","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1704311640.0","poster":"Boubou480","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Relevant scenarios ensure that they align with the actual environment, processes, and threats the organization faces. Realistic scenarios ensure that they are plausible and can be used for meaningful risk assessments and mitigation planning.
