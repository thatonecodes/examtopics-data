Project planning phase is the BEST time to identify risk associated with major projects to determine a mitigation plan. During the project planning phase, project managers can identify potential risks and develop a risk management plan to mitigate or eliminate those risks. By identifying risks early in the project, project managers can take steps to address them before they become more difficult and expensive to manage. This can help ensure that the project stays on track and that the desired outcomes are achieved.\nDuring the project initiation phase (option D), the project has not yet been fully defined, making it difficult to identify risks in detail."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nSome CRISC questions or CRISC itself seems to be done by a drunk monkey.\nThe earliest phase of the SDLC posed by ISACA is 'initiation' and this should be the answer.

It's a relatively straightforward action that can significantly enhance system security by addressing known vulnerabilities. This action doesn't require extensive resources and can be done in a targeted manner. While conducting a business impact analysis (BIA) is important for understanding the potential impact of security incidents, it might not directly address the need to secure systems with limited resources. A BIA focuses on understanding the potential consequences of various incidents rather than the immediate actions needed to secure systems.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723438860.0","comment_id":"979126"},{"poster":"krishccie","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBIA to prioritize and highlight loss to senior management and have them accept the risk of no resources","comment_id":"956111","timestamp":"1721355180.0"},{"timestamp":"1713876840.0","comment_id":"878371","upvote_count":"2","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGoing with D.

Perform a vulnerability analysis is a risk practitioner's BEST recommendation to address an organization's need to secure multiple systems with limited IT resources. A vulnerability analysis is an assessment of potential vulnerabilities within an organization's systems, and can help identify areas that require immediate attention. By performing a vulnerability analysis, an organization can prioritize its security efforts and focus on the most critical vulnerabilities first. This can help maximize the effectiveness of limited IT resources.","timestamp":"1712017800.0"},{"comment_id":"850988","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Broesweelies","content":"Selected Answer: C\nlimited resources?
