However, of the options provided, the most likely final action before completing the design of an IT governance system is selecting an implementation method.\n\nSelecting an implementation method involves determining how the IT governance system will be put into practice, including considerations such as project timelines, resource allocation, and change management. This step is typically done after the key design decisions have been made, such as determining the IT governance framework to be used, defining roles and responsibilities, and identifying key performance indicators.\n\nWhile resolving inherent priority conflicts and determining a sourcing model are important steps in designing an IT governance system, they are typically done earlier in the design process, before selecting an implementation method.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFinal Step 4 of design 'Conclude Design' has a step \"resolve inherent priority conflicts' which may arise from step 2 and 3 due to factors considered.","comment_id":"791600","timestamp":"1690624500.0","poster":"Sunil_Pict221"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"763028","timestamp":"1688175480.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"767124","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1688592720.0","poster":"Amit3","content":"Sorry, Ans A is correct"}],"poster":"Amit3","content":"Ans A\nAns B is correct\nFigure 7.2 Governance System Design Flow, Page47, COBIT 2019 Framework Introduction and Methodology"},{"comment_id":"758079","content":"A.
