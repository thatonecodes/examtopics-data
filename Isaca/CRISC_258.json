Risk appetite\n\nThe MOST important consideration for senior management when developing a risk response strategy should be the organization's risk appetite. Risk appetite defines the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept or tolerate in pursuit of its objectives. It sets the boundaries for risk-taking and guides decision-making regarding which risks to accept, mitigate, transfer, or avoid.\n\nSenior management needs to align the risk response strategy with the organization's risk appetite to ensure that risk-taking is consistent with its overall goals and values. The risk response strategy should be designed to keep risk exposures within acceptable limits defined by the risk appetite.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1009447","timestamp":"1726533000.0","poster":"Staanlee"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716712560.0","comment_id":"907213","poster":"mynk29","content":"A risk response strategy could mean one of the four responses- accept, transfer, avoid and mitigate.
