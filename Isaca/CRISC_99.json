Reduced impact of a data breach.\n\nInsurance coverage is a form of risk transfer, where the financial impact of a data breach is mitigated by transferring some of the potential costs to the insurance provider. This means that in the event of a data breach, the insurance can cover certain expenses, thus reducing the financial burden on the organization. However, it's important to note that insurance does not reduce the likelihood of a data breach occurring, nor does it remove the scenario from further analysis. While it may affect the organization's tolerance of the risk by mitigating financial impacts, the underlying risk of a data breach still exists and requires ongoing management."},{"poster":"Cclantic","comment_id":"1039594","timestamp":"1728570720.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nYes, it's a.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA it is","comment_id":"1020187","timestamp":"1727551140.0","poster":"krishccie"},{"timestamp":"1726102440.0","poster":"HS2804","comment_id":"1005280","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nReduced impact.
