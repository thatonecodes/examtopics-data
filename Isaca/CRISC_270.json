Data loss prevention (DLP) tools.\n\nData loss prevention tools are designed to monitor, detect, and prevent the unauthorized transfer or exposure of sensitive data. When using a SaaS application, sensitive organizational data is often stored and processed in the cloud, and DLP tools can help ensure that this data remains secure. These tools can identify and block attempts to share sensitive information outside of the organization or take other actions to protect against data breaches."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nHorrible question. Just horrible. I would have to go with the logic that DLP is protecting. You aren't going to be collecting a lot of logs from a SaaS solution. The other two assessments might help you understand the situation with the SaaS provider better, but are not protecting you.","timestamp":"1713602040.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1742765580.0","comment_id":"1406599","upvote_count":"1","poster":"faed87a","content":"While collecting logs directly from a SaaS solution may not be feasible, it is also not an effective approach. Typically, SaaS providers do not grant access to their internal logs for independent analysis. Therefore, the key action is to ensure that the SaaS provider is utilizing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution and properly maintaining logs on their side. From your end, this ensures that log data is managed effectively without direct access to the SaaS provider's logs. Thus, the most appropriate answer in this case is DLP"}],"comment_id":"875412","poster":"CbtL"},{"timestamp":"1712079780.0","comment_id":"859191","upvote_count":"2","content":"D is best option in my opinion:\nD. Data loss prevention (DLP) tools are the best option for protecting an organization against breaches when using a software as a service (SaaS) application. DLP tools are designed to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's network, which can help prevent data breaches that could occur as a result of using a SaaS application. SIEM solutions, CSA, and DPIA are all useful tools in their own right, but they are not specifically designed to protect against SaaS-related breaches.","poster":"Koulyo"},{"content":"Answer is D: DLP.
