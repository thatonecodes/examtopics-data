Laws related to data privacy, data transfer, and cybersecurity can vary significantly between countries. Failing to comply with local laws can result in legal consequences, financial penalties, and damage to the organization's reputation. Therefore, it is crucial for multinational organizations to have a thorough understanding of local laws and establish appropriate measures to comply with them when centralizing their information security administration.","timestamp":"1711009320.0"},{"timestamp":"1709906700.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1002431","poster":"oluchecpoint","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Violation of local law\n\nThe greatest risk of centralized information security administration within a multinational organization is the potential violation of local laws and regulations. When a multinational organization centralizes its information security administration, it may implement global security policies and practices that do not align with or comply with the specific legal requirements in each country or region where the organization operates. This can lead to legal issues, fines, and penalties, which can be much more significant and damaging than the other risks listed.\n\nWhile the other options (A. Slower turnaround, B.

Violation of local law.\n\nCentralized information security administration involves consolidating the management and control of information security functions and activities into a centralized entity or team within the organization. While there are benefits to centralization, such as improved coordination, consistency, and efficiency, it also poses certain risks, particularly in a multinational context.\n\nOne significant risk is the potential violation of local laws and regulations.
