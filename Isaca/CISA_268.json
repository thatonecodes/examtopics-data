The auditor has a personal relationship with an end user.\n\nAuditor independence is a critical aspect of the auditing process to ensure that auditors can provide unbiased and objective opinions about the financial statements and other matters they are auditing. In this context, a personal relationship between the auditor and an end user (client personnel) can raise concerns about independence because it may compromise the auditor's ability to remain impartial and objective when evaluating the client's financial information. Such a relationship can create the perception that the auditor may not be able to provide an unbiased assessment of the client's financial statements or internal controls. Therefore, option D is the scenario that should raise a concern about auditor independence.","poster":"SuperMax"},{"comment_id":"968744","poster":"starzuu","timestamp":"1690867260.0","content":"yeap it must be B","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"891105","upvote_count":"1","poster":"BabaP","content":"shouldn't this be B?","timestamp":"1683423120.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/108665-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-886-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_images":[]},{"id":"rtfunjNvTP5sUAKUUOkO","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST way for an IS auditor to determine whether an organization’s disaster recovery plan (DRP) is current?","question_id":1338,"choices":{"A":"Review critical system documentation and related recovery time objectives (RTOs).","B":"Verify the DRP identifies appropriate staff with up-to-date contact details.","D":"Verify the DRP is periodically tested.","C":"Ensure all staff is trained on business continuity."},"timestamp":"2022-12-15 12:45:00","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/91669-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-887-discussion/","exam_id":156,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1671104700,"answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1019393","upvote_count":"2","poster":"SuperMax","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe BEST way for an IS auditor to determine whether an organization's disaster recovery plan (DRP) is current is option D: Verify the DRP is periodically tested.\n\nWhile all of the options mentioned are important aspects of assessing the effectiveness and currency of a disaster recovery plan (DRP), periodic testing is crucial.\n\nA. Reviewing critical system documentation and related recovery time objectives (RTOs) is essential, but it doesn't guarantee that the DRP is current. The documentation may be accurate, but it might not have been tested or updated recently.\nB. Verifying that the DRP identifies appropriate staff with up-to-date contact details is important for communication during a disaster, but it alone doesn't ensure the effectiveness of the entire plan.\nC. Ensuring that all staff is trained on business continuity is vital for the execution of the DRP, but it doesn't directly address the currency of the plan itself.\n\nTherefore, option D is the best way for an IS auditor to determine whether an organization's DRP is current and capable of serving its intended purpose.","timestamp":"1727495760.0"},{"content":"Can't it be B?","poster":"gomboragchaa","comment_id":"746012","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1702640700.0"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"isMC":true},{"id":"XhdR2kWwqnGHVruWS6a2","unix_timestamp":1671357600,"answer_description":"","exam_id":156,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":1339,"question_text":"When planning an audit, it is acceptable for an IS auditor to rely on a third-party provider’s external audit report on service level management when the:","answer":"A","choices":{"C":"report was released within the last 12 months","A":"scope and methodology meet audit requirements","B":"service provider is independently certified and accredited","D":"report confirms that service levels were not violated"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-12-18 11:00:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1133261","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA should be","upvote_count":"2","poster":"takuanism","timestamp":"1722071040.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen planning an audit, it is acceptable for an IS auditor to rely on a third-party provider’s external audit report on service level management when the scope and methodology meet audit requirements","timestamp":"1707823020.0","poster":"3008","comments":[{"poster":"SuperMax","content":"When planning an audit, it is acceptable for an IS auditor to rely on a third-party provider's external audit report on service level management when the:\n\nA. scope and methodology meet audit requirements\n\nExplanation:\nA. The most critical factor when relying on a third-party audit report is ensuring that the scope and methodology of that report align with the audit requirements of the IS auditor. If the scope and methodology of the third-party audit report match the auditor's needs, it can provide valuable information and assurance regarding service level management.

Conducting a data inventory and classification exercise helps identify the types of data that need to be protected and their sensitivity levels.
