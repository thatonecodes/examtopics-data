When objectives are transparent and easily comprehensible, they facilitate better understanding and buy-in from various stakeholders, including employees, management, and other relevant parties. Clarity in objectives helps ensure that everyone involved understands the goals and expectations related to information security, fostering a more cohesive and focused security culture within the organization.\n\nWhile the other options (regular reassessment and reporting, approval by the IT governance function, and identification using global security frameworks and standards) are important aspects of managing information security, clarity and understanding by stakeholders are foundational for successful implementation and support.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt's important to have the ability of evaluating your performance","poster":"Monkey2173","comment_id":"899776","timestamp":"1715926380.0"},{"poster":"richck102","comment_id":"897170","content":"C.

During code review, changes made to the code can be documented and tracked, providing an audit trail of the modifications. This helps in maintaining version control, identifying the author of changes, and ensuring accountability and transparency in the software development process.","poster":"mad68"},{"poster":"Abhey","comment_id":"877649","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAudit trails of changes to source code and object code are BEST tracked through code review.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1698009240.0"},{"timestamp":"1696895520.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe best answer is B: Code Review as it forces someone to review the previous code and the new code to make a judgment call as to whether to approve the change or not.\n\nRationale:\nA.
