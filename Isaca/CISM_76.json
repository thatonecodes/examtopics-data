A risk heat map is a visual representation of the organization's current risk posture, which allows the board of directors to quickly and easily understand the overall level of risk, as well as the areas of greatest concern. It can be used to highlight the most critical risks the organization is facing, including the likelihood and potential impact of each risk. The heat map can be used to communicate the current risk posture of the organization and the effectiveness of implemented controls. The board of directors can then make informed decisions on where to allocate resources to mitigate the most critical risks. While gap analysis results, risk register, threat assessment results can also be useful, a heat map is a more visually appealing and effective way to present the information to the board of directors.","upvote_count":"6","poster":"Broesweelies"},{"timestamp":"1732180980.0","comment_id":"1214779","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"afb4b17","upvote_count":"1","content":"B gives too much details.

Sure it's not efficient... but it's not about being efficient. It's about assuring the customer that everything is good.
