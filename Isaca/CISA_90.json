I understand D as an extra control. But if there are still no procedures in place that explain how something is supposed to be done or how to correctly do things you are just adding a control without informing anyone how to conduct the work.

By implementing dual-control for emergency access accounts, it ensures that no single administrator can make changes without the approval of another authorized individual.

Some patches required rollback.\n\nThe reason being, the need for rollbacks when applying patches indicates problems in several ways:\n\nUnexpected problems: The need for rollbacks usually indicates that the application of a patch caused unexpected problems or system instability. This can affect security and system availability.\n\nLack of testing or risk management: The need for rollbacks suggests that the patch was not pre-tested or risk management was not performed properly. If proper testing and evaluation were not performed before applying a patch, future patch applications will be less reliable.\n\nReduced operational efficiency: The need for rollbacks can increase system operation downtime and workload, reducing the operational efficiency of the organization.\n\nThese factors make the need for rollbacks the most concerning outcome for the security and stability of an organization's endpoint computers."}],"choices":{"D":"Patching is performed manually for some systems.","B":"Patch implementation took longer than expected.","C":"Rollbacks were required for some patches.","A":"Patching is performed every three months."},"question_id":449,"timestamp":"2024-07-18 12:18:00","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following findings would be of GREATEST concern when evaluating an organization's endpoint computer patch management process?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"exam_id":156,"answer":"C","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/144096-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1580-discussion/"},{"id":"tekccXcYJz9CJMz3Tzwi","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728548940.0","comment_id":"1295488","poster":"PurpleParrot","content":"this is the same question 13 but with different final answer"},{"timestamp":"1721502600.0","content":"The most effective use of an IS auditor's time during the evaluation of controls for a major application development project would be to review and evaluate: B. acceptance testing.
