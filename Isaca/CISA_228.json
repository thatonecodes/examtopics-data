The network device inventory is incomplete is a concern, it is not as critical as the absence of penetration testing for the following reasons:\nA (No Network Penetration Tests):\nThis is a direct security control failure, leaving the organization blind to vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.\nWithout penetration testing, serious issues like open ports, weak passwords, and unpatched systems may go undetected.\nPenetration testing actively validates the security posture, which is crucial for identifying real-world attack vectors.\nD (Incomplete Network Device Inventory):\nThis is a secondary control failure, affecting asset management and risk visibility.\nWhile important, an inventory issue is less immediately exploitable than untested security vulnerabilities.\nPenetration testing can still uncover vulnerable devices, even if the inventory is incomplete.","timestamp":"1739585100.0","comment_id":"1356686"},{"poster":"1Naa","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1327728","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe absence of a properly approved network firewall policy poses a significant risk because it indicates a lack of formal oversight, accountability, and governance.

Therefore, it should be ranked as the highest risk in the audit report.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729873860.0"},{"comment_id":"1199067","upvote_count":"1","poster":"5b56aae","timestamp":"1729418520.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI'd pick A"},{"timestamp":"1728216480.0","poster":"Swallows","comment_id":"1190380","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe highest risk of a security attack on an organization is failure to conduct penetration testing."},{"poster":"Tef_corp","content":"By not performing penetration tests, the organization is leaving itself blind to potential security weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors.

The network firewall policy has not been approved by the information security officer.\n\nThe fact that the network's firewall policy has not been approved by the information security officer indicates a lack of control and governance over the network's security settings. This can result in greater vulnerability to attacks and a greater likelihood of security breaches. The lack of approval of the firewall policy can indicate that the security rules have not been established properly and the established security standards are not being followed. This represents a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of network data.\n\nIt is important to note that the risk classification may vary depending on the context and the specific circumstances of the audited organization. Therefore, it is recommended that the IS auditor perform a full evaluation of the findings and consider other relevant factors before finalizing the highest risk classification.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"CISAGuate22","timestamp":"1703392620.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe approval of the network firewall policy by the information security officer is crucial for ensuring that the organization's network security measures align with established standards, guidelines, and best practices.
