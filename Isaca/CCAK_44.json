Cloud service provider\n\nIn all three cloud deployment models—Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)—the cloud service provider is responsible for maintaining and patching the underlying infrastructure, which includes the hypervisor layer.

The hypervisor layer is the layer that provides virtualization capabilities to the cloud infrastructure, and it is typically managed by the cloud service provider. Patching the hypervisor layer is critical to ensure the security and stability of the cloud infrastructure, and it is the responsibility of the cloud service provider to perform this task.\n\nWhile the customer does have some responsibility in terms of securing their own applications and data, the patching of the hypervisor layer falls under the responsibility of the cloud service provider. This is because the hypervisor layer is a shared resource that is used by multiple customers in the cloud environment, and any vulnerabilities in this layer could potentially affect all customers.","poster":"survivalkit","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"860358"},{"comment_id":"707639","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1667110260.0","poster":"PCTAN","content":"Should be C"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/86660-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-64-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"id":153,"isBeta":false,"name":"CCAK","numberOfQuestions":258,"provider":"Isaca"},"currentPage":44},"__N_SSP":true}
