CSA programs involve individuals within the business unit assessing and testing their own controls, which can lead to the identification of risks and control weaknesses at an early stage. The involvement of internal audit provides an independent and objective validation of the self-assessment results.\nEarly detection of risks allows for timely corrective actions, enhancing the organization's ability to prevent or mitigate potential issues before they escalate.
