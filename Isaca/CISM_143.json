Reducing organizational security risk should be the primary goal of an information security manager when designing information security policies. This is because the primary purpose of information security policies is to protect the organization and its assets from potential threats and risks. By reducing organizational security risk, the organization is better protected and less likely to experience security incidents that can cause damage to the organization, its reputation and its customers. While minimizing cost and improving protection of information are important considerations, they should not take precedence over reducing risk as it is the ultimate goal of the information security policies. Achieving organizational objectives should be considered as well as it will help to align the security policies with the overall goals of the organization.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1702854420.0","content":"stop relying much on ChatGPT.","poster":"Evedzy","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1099313"}],"comment_id":"789881"},{"poster":"AlexJacobson","upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1706132820.0","comment_id":"1131151","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI'd say it's D for two reasons:\n\n1) ISACA tends to emphasize that the whole point of security is to support the business and business goals and objectives.\n\n2) Security risk is actually reduced through security controls, not policies.

Perform periodic security assessments of the contractors' activities would provide the best assurance that the third party's contract programmers comply with the organization's security policies. This is because security assessments involve a thorough review of the contractors' activities, including their development processes, tools and methodologies, as well as the security controls they have implemented. This will allow the organization to identify any potential vulnerabilities or noncompliance issues and address them proactively. While the other options such as conducting periodic vulnerability scans, requiring annual signed agreements, and including penalties for noncompliance in the contracting agreement, are also important and can help to ensure compliance, they are not as comprehensive as security assessments, and may not provide the same level of assurance.","timestamp":"1674843360.0"}],"choices":{"A":"Perform periodic security assessments of the contractors' activities.","D":"Include penalties for noncompliance in the contracting agreement.","B":"Conduct periodic vulnerability scans of the application.","C":"Require annual signed agreements of adherence to security policies."},"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1674843360,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (57%)","C (43%)"],"isMC":true,"question_id":712},{"id":"p5LoPtGDl87uv8l8xcxz","question_id":713,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-09-25 13:02:00","choices":{"B":"Making decisions on security priorities","A":"Monitoring information security resources","C":"Enforcing regulatory and policy compliance","D":"Evaluating information security metrics"},"answer":"B","isMC":true,"question_text":"How does an organization's information security steering committee facilitate the achievement of information security program objectives?","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1690474920.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB it is boys!","poster":"Broesweelies","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"789889"},{"poster":"1899f17","comment_id":"1219271","content":"B.
