This approach is more efficient in terms of storage space and bandwidth usage since it only captures changes since the last backup. Incremental backups also offer faster restoration times compared to differential and full backups since they involve restoring the last full backup and then applying the incremental changes.

Differential backups store all changes since the last full backup, which can be quicker than a full backup but slower than incremental backups and may require more storage space over time. Full backups are comprehensive but can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for high volumes of data with frequent changes.
