For instance, they might fall victim to phishing attacks, mishandle sensitive data, use insecure communication channels, or neglect other critical security practices.\n\nLack of security awareness training can lead to a wide range of risks, including data leakage through multiple vectors beyond just unencrypted devices. Employees who are unaware of security best practices are more likely to make mistakes that can compromise data security, regardless of whether their desktops are encrypted.\n\nGiven this perspective, Option C: Security awareness training is not provided to staff could indeed be considered the greatest risk, as it affects the overall security behavior and practices of the entire organization, potentially leading to data leakage in numerous ways.","poster":"Vima234"},{"timestamp":"1721525580.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nB. Desktop encryption is not required. The decision to not encrypt desktops can also pose significant security risks, but it does not immediately increase the risk of a data breach compared to the ability to work remotely. Encryption is an important security measure, but remote work management may have a greater impact when balancing security measures with the flexibility of remote work.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1252112","poster":"Swallows"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI say A\nB would be correct if it was a laptop instead of a desktop.

There is no requirement for desktops to be encrypted.\n\nNot requiring desktops to be encrypted can pose a significant risk because if a laptop or desktop computer is lost or stolen, the data stored on it can be easily accessed by unauthorized individuals. Encryption helps protect the data even if the physical device falls into the wrong hands. Without encryption, sensitive information could be exposed, potentially leading to data leakage, data breaches, and compliance violations.\n\nWhile the other options also present security risks, such as remote work without proper security measures (Option A), lack of security awareness training (Option C), and outdated security policies (Option D), not encrypting desktops can have more immediate and direct consequences in terms of data leakage.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1019364"},{"timestamp":"1684010640.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct, security awareness training can educate staff about the risks of data leakage and how to prevent it.

It involves assessing the severity and potential impact of incidents and determining which ones require immediate attention and which can be addressed later.
