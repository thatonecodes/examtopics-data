The acceptable variation relative to the achievement of an objective is termed as risk tolerance. In other words, risk tolerance is the acceptable deviation from the level set by the risk appetite and business objectives.\nRisk tolerance is defined at the enterprise level by the board and clearly communicated to all stakeholders. A process should be in place to review and approve any exceptions to such standards.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA, C: Risk appetite level is not relevant in triggering of risk response process. Risk appetite is the amount of risk a company or other entity is willing to accept in pursuit of its mission. This is the responsibility of the board to decide risk appetite of an enterprise. When considering the risk appetite levels for the enterprise, the following two major factors should be taken into account:\n✑ The enterprise's objective capacity to absorb loss, e.g., financial loss, reputation damage, etc.\n✑ The culture towards risk taking-cautious or aggressive. In other words, the amount of loss the enterprise wants to accept in pursue of its objective fulfillment.\nD: Risk response process is triggered when the risk level increases the risk tolerance level of the enterprise, and not when it just equates the risk tolerance level.","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/142297-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-54-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-06-10 21:15:00","answer_images":[],"question_id":946,"exam_id":160,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1410318","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf Risk goes over the Risk appetite you still have the tolerance level to consider, if it's below the tolerance level then you might consider whether to accept it or mitigate, but if the risk level goes over the tolerance you definitely have to act.","poster":"LDR2409","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742986260.0"},{"poster":"maki.banassios4013","comment_id":"1301961","content":"the correct answer is A. \nIn risk management, the risk appetite refers to the amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. When the risk level exceeds this appetite, it acts as a trigger for initiating the risk response process. This is because exceeding the risk appetite indicates that the organization is facing a level of risk that it is not comfortable with, necessitating immediate action to mitigate or manage that risk.\nOn the other hand, risk tolerance refers to the acceptable variation in performance relative to the achievement of objectives. While it is important, the primary trigger for risk response is typically when risks exceed the organization's appetite for risk, prompting a need for a response strategy to bring the risk back within acceptable limits","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1729672380.0"},{"poster":"6yrd7fcv97","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1228067","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDisagree with the stated answer.

Clearly define the project scope.\n\nThe best mitigating control to reduce the risk introduced when conducting penetration tests is to clearly define the project scope. Defining the scope of the penetration test involves specifying the systems, networks, and assets that are authorized for testing and those that should be off-limits.

Residual risk is within the organizational risk appetite.\n\nThe best indication of an effective risk management program is when the residual risk (the risk that remains after applying controls) is within the organizational risk appetite. An effective risk management program ensures that the organization's risk-taking aligns with its risk tolerance and strategic objectives. Keeping the residual risk within the established risk appetite demonstrates that risks are being identified, assessed, and managed in a way that supports the organization's overall goals and tolerances."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nShould be \"C\", this is the core objective of risk management.
