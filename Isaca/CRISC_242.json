Effectiveness of risk response options\n\nThe best criterion for selecting a risk response is the effectiveness of the available response options. When choosing how to address a specific risk, organizations should consider which response will most effectively reduce or mitigate the risk to an acceptable level. This involves evaluating the potential impact of each response option, its feasibility, and its ability to address the specific risk scenario.\n\nWhile alignment with industry standards and the importance of IT risk within the enterprise are relevant factors, the primary consideration should always be how well a particular response option will manage the risk effectively. The capability to implement the response is also crucial but typically comes after determining the effectiveness of the response itself.","timestamp":"1726093980.0","comment_id":"1005207"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A.","timestamp":"1713202320.0","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"871166"}],"question_id":1207,"topic":"1","question_text":"The BEST criteria when selecting a risk response is the:","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/106289-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-790-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1681579920,"answer_description":""},{"id":"umsLWVsbjRlWJMzN2tsH","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729014720.0","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree with A.","comment_id":"871181","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"risk levels","B":"risk capacity","D":"risk budgets","A":"risk appetite"},"unix_timestamp":1681581120,"topic":"1","question_id":1208,"question_text":"The BEST indication that risk management is effective is when risk has been reduced to meet:","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-15 19:52:00","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/106292-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-791-discussion/","exam_id":160,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"B0RTsUutmAqihWJo5qjs","choices":{"B":"Duplicate resources may be used to manage risk registers.","C":"Standardization of risk management practices may be difficult to enforce.","D":"Risk analysis may be inconsistent due to non-uniform impact and likelihood scales.","A":"Aggregated risk may exceed the enterprise's risk appetite and tolerance."},"timestamp":"2021-06-24 21:03:00","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Not sure how a decentralized risk register by itself would make the aggregated total risk exceed the appetite or tolerance when if fact it should just be the same total risk had it been consolidated.
