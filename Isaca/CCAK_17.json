Identify applicable laws and regulations to the organization.**\n\nUnderstanding the legal and regulatory environment is crucial before making any decisions regarding cloud migration. Different jurisdictions and industries have specific compliance requirements, data protection laws, and regulations that could significantly impact the organization's cloud strategy. Identifying these laws and regulations early ensures that the organization is aware of the constraints and obligations it must adhere to, which can then inform subsequent decisions such as selecting a deployment model, choosing a control framework, and identifying cloud service providers. This step helps prevent compliance issues and ensures that the migration strategy aligns with legal requirements.","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCCAK P# 129 Having a clear understanding of external requirements that should be contemplated in the cloud controls program is critical. Influential sources of external requirements are commonly based on key factors associated with the organization, such as industry sector, geographic location and size. Although, in some cases, these laws and regulations may be cloud-specific, they usually apply more broadly, regardless of the type of technology in use. Within the cloud operating environment, there is a high degree of complexity, because varying laws and regulations may apply within different countries, states and localities.","comment_id":"1150571","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723665720.0"}],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-02-14 23:02:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":153,"question_text":"Which of the following should be performed FIRST when an organization is considering a migration to the cloud?","question_id":81,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133905-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-175-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1707948120,"question_images":[]},{"id":"jQAU8ARhRI7YliriE1Ls","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133907-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-176-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1707949740,"exam_id":153,"timestamp":"2024-02-14 23:29:00","choices":{"A":"The as-is and to-be enterprise architecture (EA)","D":"Understanding the customer risk profile","B":"Using a standardized control framework","C":"The experience gained over the years"},"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following enables auditors to conduct gap analyses of what a cloud service provider offers versus what the customer requires?","question_id":82,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe most appropriate choice for enabling auditors to conduct gap analyses of what a cloud service provider offers versus what the customer requires is:\n\n**B. Using a standardized control framework**\n\nUsing a standardized control framework allows auditors to systematically evaluate the cloud service provider's offerings against a set of predefined controls and requirements. Frameworks such as ISO 27001, NIST, or COBIT provide a comprehensive set of criteria that can be used to assess the adequacy of the provider's controls relative to the customer's needs. This approach enables the identification of gaps in areas such as security, compliance, and data protection, facilitating a clear comparison and helping to determine if the provider meets the customer's requirements.","timestamp":"1742664360.0","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1401988"},{"poster":"sai_murthy","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCCAK P# 141 Using a standardized control framework has many benefits, including the following:\n• It anchors the implementation of security controls into a well-known reference system and language recognized by many practitioners across an industry.\n• It supports auditors’ efforts to assess an information system based on a well-defined set of controls, enabling the following actions:\no Comparisons of cloud security features across different time periods or different cloud services\no Gap analyses of what a CSP offers versus what the customer requires\no Benchmarking of competing cloud services (e.g., in the context of procurement)\n• It enables the building of trusted certifications schemes by ensuring that information systems are assessed with a comparable set of criteria.","timestamp":"1723667340.0","comment_id":"1150584"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"ml5duG8y2OJWYmUzxGCk","timestamp":"2024-02-14 23:31:00","choices":{"A":"Risk management team","D":"Cloud infrastructure team","C":"Internal audit team","B":"DevOps team"},"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133908-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-177-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1707949860,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1742664420.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1401989","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe most appropriate choice for mitigating risks related to development and operations practices in a public cloud on a daily basis is:\n\n**B.

DevOps practices integrate development, IT operations, and security, facilitating continuous monitoring, automation, and quick responses to potential issues. By embedding risk management into their daily processes, the DevOps team can ensure that security, compliance, and operational efficiency are maintained throughout the software development lifecycle.
