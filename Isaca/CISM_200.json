Testing response scenarios.\n\nTesting response scenarios (B) is the most important factor in increasing the effectiveness of incident responders.

This can help to ensure that incident responders are prepared and capable of responding quickly and effectively in the event of a security incident.\n\nIntegrating staff with the IT department (A) may help to ensure that incident responders have the necessary technical skills, but it is not the most important factor in increasing their effectiveness. Communicating with the management team (C) is important for keeping the management informed about incidents and their impact, but it is not the primary factor in increasing the effectiveness of incident responders.

Conduct a risk assessment.\n\nThe information security manager's first course of action should be to conduct a risk assessment to understand the potential security risks and implications associated with the use of smartphones and tablet computers with enabled web cameras in violation of the policy. This assessment will help identify the specific security risks, assess their likelihood and impact, and determine appropriate mitigation measures.
