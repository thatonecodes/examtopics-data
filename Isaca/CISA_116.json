If accounts payable staff can modify vendor banking information, it creates a risk of collusion or fraudulent transactions without detection. \nPrivilege Creep and Authorization: The manual highlights the importance of enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP). Granting unnecessary access to sensitive functions (e.g., vendor bank details) violates POLP and increases the attack surface.\nRisk of Fraud: Uncontrolled access to vendor banking details directly enables financial misappropriation.
