Code reviews help ensure that changes to the critical financial application are thoroughly examined for quality, security, and compliance before being promoted to production. This practice can catch potential issues early in the development process and prevent them from reaching the production environment. While other options such as performing periodic audits, performing regression tests, and exporting change logs are important, a code review is particularly effective for ensuring the quality and security of the actual code being deployed.","poster":"FAGFUR","timestamp":"1699937160.0","comment_id":"1069992","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-11-14 05:46:00","unix_timestamp":1699937160,"question_id":61,"exam_id":156,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"D":"Exporting change logs to a secure server","A":"Performing periodic audits","B":"Implementing a change management code review","C":"Performing regression tests"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/126028-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1052-discussion/"},{"id":"iYzXn8iW47vd1gxxkRbo","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1295228","poster":"PurpleParrot","timestamp":"1728492720.0","content":"the question focuses on the BEST recommendation NOT the first step.

This could potentially be problematic because if the SLA commits to a shorter RPO but the DRP expects a longer RPO, there is a risk that the data recovery might not meet the organization's actual needs if the backups and recovery processes are not aligned. Essentially, the data might not be recoverable to the point expected if the backups do not meet the shorter RPO requirement.\n\nRecovery Time Objective (RTO) Longer than in DRP (B): If the RTO in the SLA is longer than the RTO in the DRP, the organization might still be able to meet its DRP objectives if the provider’s RTO is longer.

The RTO is a critical parameter that defines the maximum tolerable downtime for a system after a disruption. If the RTO in the SLA is longer than what is specified in the DRP, it may indicate a misalignment between the agreed-upon service levels and the organization's expectations for recovery time.

If the RTO in the SLA is longer than what is documented in the disaster recovery plan, it means that in the event of a disaster, the third-party provider may not be able to meet the bank’s required downtime limits.

The RPO is the maximum amount of data loss that an organization can tolerate, and it is usually defined in the disaster recovery plan. If the RPO in the SLA is shorter than what is documented in the disaster recovery plan, it means that the bank may not be able to recover all of its data if a disaster occurs.\n\nFor example, if the disaster recovery plan states that the RPO is four hours, but the SLA with the third-party provider has an RPO of two hours, it means that the bank may lose some data if a disaster occurs before the two-hour mark. This could result in financial losses or regulatory compliance issues, especially if the lost data includes critical information such as customer transactions or personal data.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"where the recovery time objective (RTO) has a longer duration than documented in the disaster recovery plan, is also a concern, but it is not as critical as option C.
