Least privilege\n\nBy implementing the principle of least privilege, organizations can minimize the risk associated with unnecessary entitlements (Recertification, user access). Users are only granted the permissions required for their specific roles and responsibilities, reducing the likelihood of intentional or unintentional harmful actions.\n\nWhile the other options (B. Application monitoring, C. Separation of duty, and D.

Data governance\n\nData governance involves the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data in an organization.

Ensure segregation of duties are implemented within key systems or processes.\n\nSegregation of duties (SoD) is a fundamental internal control measure that involves dividing tasks and responsibilities among different individuals or teams to reduce the risk of fraud and errors.
