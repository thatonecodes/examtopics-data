Those agreements are a major foundation of governance and assurance, because they provide controls on the relationship with the CSP. Cloud agreements or contracts usually consist of service terms (SLA, acceptable use policy, technical support) and legal terms (jurisdiction, dispute handling, remedies). Those terms are the foundation of the shared responsibility model, which is usually not described directly in the contract. In general, cloud providers rely on unified service and do not negotiate their contracts for every customer request. However, large organizations probably will be able to get more changes, and smaller providers probably will demonstrate more flexibility. \n\nSee section 1.4.13 for more information about contracts as a governance tool.","comment_id":"1196185"}],"question_id":241,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/138771-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-83-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_text":"To support customer’s verification of the CSP claims regarding their responsibilities according to the shared responsibility model, which of the following tools and techniques is appropriate?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":153,"timestamp":"2024-04-15 21:26:00","choices":{"D":"Security assessment","A":"Contractual agreement","B":"Internal audit","C":"External audit"}},{"id":"Q2D4csk0MNKLap8KF3f6","question_id":242,"timestamp":"2023-01-30 01:45:00","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","exam_id":153,"choices":{"A":"Internal policies and technical standards","C":"Applicable laws and regulations","D":"Risk appetite and budget constraints","B":"Risk scoring criteria"},"unix_timestamp":1675039500,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/97172-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-84-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following has the MOST substantial impact on how aggressive or conservative the cloud approach of an organization will be?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"10","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBased on the risk appetite and budget an org can decide whether they can be aggressive or conservative (Page 119), budget constraints gets discussed in page 50","poster":"KarthikeyanTK","comment_id":"792212","timestamp":"1675039500.0"},{"timestamp":"1741728480.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Risk appetite and budget constraints\n\nThe risk appetite of an organization defines how much risk it is willing to take to achieve its objectives, which directly influences how aggressively or conservatively it approaches cloud adoption. Budget constraints also play a crucial role, as they determine the level of investment the organization can make in cloud technologies. Together, these factors have the most substantial impact on the organization's cloud strategy.","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1387655","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1258236","content":"Answer is D","poster":"4f2a581","timestamp":"1722345180.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707746400.0","poster":"sai_murthy","comment_id":"1148166","content":"the organization risk appetite and budget constraints have a substantial impact on how aggressive or conservative its cloud approach is, which type of cloud services it uses, and for which type of data and business applications.

Conduct an architectural assessment.\n\nStarting with an architectural assessment allows the auditor to gain a comprehensive understanding of the DevOps pipeline's overall design and structure. This step helps identify how security is integrated into the pipeline, understand the flow of data, and recognize any potential vulnerabilities at a high level. Once the architecture is understood, the auditor can focus on specific areas such as security gates, CI/CD pipeline audit logs, and separation of development and production pipelines.","poster":"Auditor2020"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","exam_id":153,"question_id":243,"unix_timestamp":1674487920,"timestamp":"2023-01-23 16:32:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"XzCfK1ecKTQIPZ7f2nU3","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Initiation --> Execution --> Monitoring and Controlling","B":"Deploy --> Monitor --> Audit","D":"Preparation --> Execution --> Peer Review and Publication","A":"Plan --> Develop --> Release"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741729020.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) mapping methodology typically involves the following phases:\n\nD.
