Quantitative measurements are used for key risk indicators (KRIs).\n\nUsing quantitative measurements for KRIs allows for precise, objective, and consistent tracking of risk levels over time. Quantitative data can be easily compared and analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and changes in risk exposure. This approach provides clear, measurable insights that are essential for effective risk management and decision-making.
