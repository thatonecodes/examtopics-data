This process helps verify that the backup and recovery strategy is effective and that the organization can rely on the cloud provider's services for disaster recovery purposes.\nWhile regular backups to a cloud service provider offer an essential component of a disaster recovery strategy, periodic on-site restoration provides a critical validation step to confirm that the backup copies are usable and that the organization can recover its VMs as needed.
