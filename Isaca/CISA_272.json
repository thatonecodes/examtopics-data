Without monitoring current utilization, it is challenging to make informed decisions about scaling, resource allocation, and future capacity needs.

This is because they need to inspect network traffic in real-time, which involves analyzing packets and looking for patterns or anomalies. In busy networks, this can lead to performance degradation and resource utilization concerns.
