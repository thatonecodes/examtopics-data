This includes its risk management objectives, which are influenced by its risk appetite. Risk appetite defines the level of risk the organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives.\n\nRisk Management: Policies are a fundamental part of an organization's risk management framework. They provide guidelines and rules for how risks should be identified, assessed, treated, and monitored. Risk appetite sets the boundaries for what is considered acceptable risk within these policies.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"997940"},{"comment_id":"864967","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A.","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712602860.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-04-08 21:01:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/105618-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-690-discussion/","question_id":1101,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1680980460,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":160},{"id":"l7OVUnTbLLqIyghzchce","unix_timestamp":1595767860,"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"C","choices":{"C":"Continuous monitoring","A":"Ad hoc reporting","B":"Predictive analytics","D":"Control self-assessment"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":160,"question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST method for assessing control effectiveness?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/26692-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-691-discussion/","question_id":1102,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"9","poster":"NeilKK","comment_id":"144115","timestamp":"1627303860.0","content":"The answer should be C.","comments":[{"comment_id":"162638","content":"I agree","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1629513780.0","poster":"CL888"}]},{"timestamp":"1731059100.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe BEST method for assessing control effectiveness among the options provided is C. Continuous monitoring.\n\nContinuous monitoring involves the ongoing and automated assessment of controls and their effectiveness. It allows for real-time or near-real-time monitoring of systems, processes, and security controls to identify and respond to issues as they occur. This proactive and dynamic approach is generally more effective than ad hoc reporting, predictive analytics, or control self-assessment, as it provides a continuous feedback loop to help organizations detect and address control weaknesses and risks in a timely manner.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1065504"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C.","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"864971","timestamp":"1712603100.0"},{"comment_id":"818354","upvote_count":"2","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1708632480.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree."},{"poster":"Ceecil1959","content":"B: seems correct if I go by this analysis\n\nHow do you measure effectiveness of control?\n4 Steps to Measure Controls' Effectiveness with Cyber Risk Quantification\n Identify current risk exposure.\n Map the control being considered to the FAIR Model.\n Perform a future state analysis, evaluating the effectiveness of the control.\n Compare the current state vs. future state to perform a cost-benefit analysis.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1682955000.0","poster":"Ceecil1959","comment_id":"595643","upvote_count":"3","content":"C is correct.

This is because a well-aligned corporate culture would prioritize implementing cost-effective risk management strategies that balance risk exposure with the costs of implementing controls. When control costs exceed risk exposure, it may indicate that the organization's risk management approach is not effectively aligned with its overall strategy, objectives, or values. This could lead to inefficient use of resources and potential negative impacts on the organization's performance."}],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1679294400},{"id":"PqCyJ6PMGCtZJND9GpNL","unix_timestamp":1680980880,"timestamp":"2023-04-08 21:08:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"864974","timestamp":"1728414480.0"}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"management.","D":"tolerance.","B":"analysis.","C":"culture."},"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":160,"question_id":1104,"question_text":"A management team is on an aggressive mission to launch a new product to penetrate new markets and overlooks IT risk factors, threats, and vulnerabilities.
