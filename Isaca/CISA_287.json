This can be done through methods such as shredding, incineration, or disintegration.

Physical destruction\n\nPhysical destruction is typically considered the most effective method of destroying sensitive data stored on electronic media. This involves physically damaging the storage medium, such as hard drives or solid-state drives, to the point where data recovery is practically impossible. Common methods of physical destruction include shredding, crushing, or incinerating the media.\n\nWhile other methods like random character overwrite (often called data wiping or secure erasure), degaussing, and low-level formatting can be effective to some extent, physical destruction ensures that the data cannot be recovered because the underlying storage media is physically destroyed. This is especially important for highly sensitive or classified information where there should be no chance of data recovery.","poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1695959640.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Agree on A, most effective","timestamp":"1688185740.0","poster":"hoho","comment_id":"939580"},{"comment_id":"908718","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA: Physical destruction.","timestamp":"1685288760.0","poster":"Pakawat"},{"comment_id":"891735","timestamp":"1683505680.0","poster":"BabaP","comments":[{"timestamp":"1721906460.0","poster":"cdee8f6","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1254956","content":"C: Degaussing is for magnetic media not for electronic media. so, A is the correct answer"}],"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think C"}],"answer":"A","exam_id":156,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/108712-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-991-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Random character overwrite","C":"Degaussing","A":"Physical destruction","D":"Low-level formatting"},"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1683505680,"isMC":true,"question_id":1433,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-08 02:28:00"},{"id":"bpWOKvJmF3EUzNZyqFLl","timestamp":"2023-11-13 18:19:00","unix_timestamp":1699895940,"question_text":"Which of the following BEST enables an organization to verify whether an encrypted message sent by a client has been altered?","question_images":[],"exam_id":156,"discussion":[{"poster":"FAGFUR","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA digital signature is a cryptographic technique that allows the recipient of a message to verify the authenticity and integrity of the message.
