Align with the risk appetite is the information security manager's best approach when selecting cost-effective controls needed to meet business objectives.\nThe risk appetite is the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in order to achieve its objectives. It is a key consideration when selecting controls, as it determines how much the organization is willing to invest in security.\nA security manager should align the controls with the risk appetite by considering the potential impact of a security incident on the organization and the likelihood of it occurring. This approach allows the security manager to select cost-effective controls that are appropriate for the organization's specific needs and budget, while also ensuring that the organization's assets and operations are protected. This approach also allows the organization to prioritize the most critical risks and allocate resources accordingly, ensuring that the most important risks are addressed first.","timestamp":"1689593400.0","poster":"Broesweelies","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"778958"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nRisk appetite - Company at different maturity level have different risk appetite and have different view on spending.

Assess the business objectives of the processes\n\nWhen an organization seeks to integrate information security into its human resource management processes, the first step should be to assess the business objectives of these processes. Understanding what the organization aims to achieve through its HR processes lays the foundation for identifying how information security can support, enhance, and protect these objectives. This strategic alignment ensures that subsequent steps, such as identifying information security risks, evaluating integration costs, and benchmarking against best practices, are focused and driven by the organization's core goals and needs.

This will help the organization understand the potential vulnerabilities and threats that need to be addressed, and will inform the development of an effective information security strategy for the processes. Once the risks have been identified, the organization can then move on to assessing business objectives, evaluating the cost of integration, and benchmarking with best practices to identify gaps.","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"exam_id":157,"answers_community":["B (79%)","A (21%)"],"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/95705-exam-cism-topic-1-question-189-discussion/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-01-17 14:40:00"},{"id":"ZX09fMlqib4XtRmhdbek","question_id":349,"answers_community":["B (77%)","C (15%)","8%"],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-10-07 16:07:00","unix_timestamp":1665151620,"isMC":true,"exam_id":157,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/84619-exam-cism-topic-1-question-19-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1727153640.0","poster":"AlexJacobson","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1085359","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI would also say B and then C.
