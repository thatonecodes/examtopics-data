Involving the business process owner in IT strategy\n\nMisalignment between IT and business can lead to various risks, including inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and miscommunication. Involving the business process owner in IT strategy is the best approach to mitigate this risk because:\n\nAlignment of Goals: The business process owner understands the specific goals and needs of their area. Involving them in IT strategy ensures that IT initiatives are aligned with these goals.\n\nClear Communication: It facilitates clear communication between IT and business stakeholders. When business process owners are actively engaged, they can articulate their requirements, which helps IT in tailoring solutions accordingly.\n\nImproved Understanding: Business process owners can gain a better understanding of IT capabilities and constraints. This can lead to more realistic expectations and a greater appreciation of the value that IT can provide.","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"997137"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C.","timestamp":"1712576100.0","comment_id":"864651","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Julianleehk","content":"should be C","timestamp":"1708316040.0","comment_id":"813736"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"786810","timestamp":"1706121720.0","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: C\nEffective risk management depends on knowledge of the goals and objectives of the organization, the best form of alignment of those indicated is to involve the business owner in the IT strategy."},{"content":"Everybody says C, but not a single person wrote any justification for it.","comment_id":"586015","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ceecil1959","timestamp":"1681508100.0"},{"timestamp":"1680781560.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nVote for C","poster":"fora","comment_id":"581783","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Raj1510","content":"support C","comment_id":"529581","timestamp":"1674359700.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"Should be C","comment_id":"513977","poster":"MusMus","timestamp":"1672478160.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1650399900.0","content":"I also agree it should be C","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"339136","poster":"Josh93"}],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1599090780,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/30427-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-670-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2020-09-03 01:53:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"D":"Establishing key risk indicators (KRIs)","A":"Introducing an established framework for IT architecture","B":"Establishing business key performance indicators (KPIs)","C":"Involving the business process owner in IT strategy"},"answer":"C","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following will BEST mitigate the risk associated with IT and business misalignment?"},{"id":"FPnTushu8JgajwFqlr2p","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":160,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Successive assessments have the same recurring vulnerabilities.\n\nWhen evaluating existing controls during a risk assessment, the greatest concern should be recurring vulnerabilities. This indicates that the controls in place are not effectively mitigating the identified risks. It suggests that there may be fundamental weaknesses in the control environment, and these vulnerabilities continue to pose a threat to the organization.\n\nRecurring vulnerabilities can be a sign of various issues, including control ineffectiveness, inadequate risk response planning, or insufficient monitoring and improvement of controls over time. Addressing these recurring vulnerabilities should be a top priority to enhance the organization's security posture and reduce the associated risks.

Review risk tolerance levels.\n\nWhen risk is found to be above the acceptable risk appetite, the best course of action is to review risk tolerance levels. This involves reassessing the organization's tolerance for the specific risk and determining whether the current risk appetite and thresholds are still appropriate.\n\nBefore executing the risk response plan or making significant changes to controls, it's essential to ensure that the risk tolerance levels are correctly defined and aligned with the organization's objectives and strategies.
