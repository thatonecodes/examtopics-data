These documents can offer valuable insights into the provider's security posture and controls, allowing the auditor to evaluate whether the provider's environment meets the necessary security and compliance requirements.

(CSPs consider on-premises audits a security risk, given that multiple on-premises audits by many customers would present logistical and security challenges.) Consequently, the assessor will need to evaluate other sources of data the customer used in its due diligence effort, such as third-party certification and attestations, self-assessments, white papers, technical documentation, etc.","poster":"sai_murthy","timestamp":"1723651260.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133876-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-157-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"As Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud service providers often do not allow the cloud service customers to perform on-premise audits, the BEST approach for the auditor should be to:","isMC":true,"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1707933660,"question_id":61,"exam_id":153,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"recommend that the customer not use the services provided by the provider.","B":"refrain from auditing the provider’s security controls due to lack of cooperation.","C":"escalate the lack of support from the provider to the regulatory authority.","A":"use other sources of available data for evaluating the customer’s controls."}},{"id":"v0WKZyM6cTIALDqXsrak","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-04 10:10:00","answers_community":["B (75%)","A (25%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1388052","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741808460.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe primary reason fieldwork audit papers are reviewed by an audit manager, even when the cloud auditor is highly experienced, is:\n\nB. Professional standards\n\nProfessional auditing standards, such as those from organizations like the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) or the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), require a review process to ensure the quality and consistency of audit work. These standards mandate that an independent review is conducted to verify that the audit has been performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and to ensure that all findings are adequately supported and documented.

By documenting and reporting the issue, the auditor ensures that relevant stakeholders are informed, and appropriate actions can be taken to address the weakness. This approach maintains transparency and allows the organization to assess the risk and determine the necessary steps to mitigate it. It's essential to adhere to the defined scope of the audit, but reporting observed weaknesses outside of the scope can help improve overall security and risk management.","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1388053"},{"timestamp":"1723660320.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCCAK P#89 The scope of a cloud platform security assessment depends on the CSPs and cloud services that support and deliver the technology target of the audit.
