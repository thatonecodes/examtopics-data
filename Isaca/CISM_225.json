Maximum tolerable outage (MTO)\n\nThe Maximum Tolerable Outage (MTO) is a key metric in a business continuity plan (BCP) that represents the maximum amount of time an organization can tolerate its operations being disrupted or unavailable before it incurs significant damage or loss. It is essentially the threshold beyond which the organization's ability to function is compromised to an unacceptable degree. Measuring the MTO helps organizations determine how long they need to maintain operations at an alternative site, such as a disaster recovery or backup location, to ensure business continuity during an outage or disaster scenario.","poster":"oluchecpoint","timestamp":"1726027440.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1726249560.0","comments":[{"content":"Totally agree.

Your definition of MTO is completely wrong. \nAs luck would have it the answer is C.

This definition is word for word from ISACA’s glossary. \n\nPick up a book sometime and maybe stop trying to use AI to pass an exam for you. You spread misinformation and devalue input from people who actually know what they’re on about.

Risk tolerance and organizational objectives\n\nThe risk tolerance and organizational objectives play a critical role in determining how much emphasis and resources should be allocated to information security. If an organization has a low risk tolerance and values the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information assets, it is more likely to prioritize and invest in information security measures. Conversely, if the organization has a high risk tolerance and does not prioritize information security, it may not allocate sufficient resources or attention to this area.","timestamp":"1694405280.0"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (56%)","B (44%)"],"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Information security personnel","A":"Organizational structure and culture","B":"Risk tolerance and organizational objectives","D":"The desired state of the organization"},"question_text":"Which of the following has the GREATEST influence on the successful integration of information security within the business?","exam_id":157,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-09-11 06:08:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/120480-exam-cism-topic-1-question-889-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1694405280,"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","question_id":1125,"isMC":true}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Isaca","numberOfQuestions":1247,"id":157,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"CISM","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":225},"__N_SSP":true}
