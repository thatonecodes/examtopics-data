Changes in IT risk tolerance.\n\nIT risk tolerance is a fundamental aspect that dictates how an organization approaches and manages IT risks. Changes in IT risk tolerance can significantly influence organizational strategy, as they directly affect decision-making regarding IT investments, the adoption of new technologies, the allocation of resources for risk mitigation, and the overall approach to managing IT-related threats and opportunities.
