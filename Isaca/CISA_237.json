When a file’s contents are processed through a cryptographic algorithm, it produces a hash value—a unique numerical value that represents the contents of the file. This value is not an image of the file but rather a fixed-size string of characters that may include numbers and letters. The hash value changes significantly if the contents of the file are altered in any way, making it a reliable method for verifying data integrity.
