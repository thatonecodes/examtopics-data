Business needs are being met\n\nThe effectiveness of business continuity and disaster recovery plans is ultimately measured by whether they ensure that the organization's critical business functions and needs are met within the specified recovery time objectives (RTOs). While internal compliance, regulatory requirements, and risk management objectives are important considerations, the primary goal of these plans is to ensure that the organization can continue its essential operations in the face of a disaster or disruption. Therefore, the best indicator of effective testing is whether the organization's business needs are being met within the established RTOs."},{"timestamp":"1720322280.0","poster":"richck102","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
