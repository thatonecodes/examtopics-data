Applying formal change management procedures is the best way to mitigate this risk. These procedures typically require any proposed changes to the project's scope to be formally defined, reviewed, and approved before they are implemented, which helps prevent uncontrolled changes and keeps the project aligned with its original objectives."},{"comment_id":"914470","content":"Selected Answer: B\nApparently \"B\"","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717499940.0","poster":"mraiyan"},{"timestamp":"1709919660.0","poster":"snobilisk","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"833226","content":"Selected Answer: B\nObviously"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nSome give answers without having searched and contrasted the information. It's 'B', and it's not an opinion.\nhttps://www.isaca.org/resources/glossary#Scope%20creep\nScope creep can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented and controlled. Typically, the scope increase consists of either new products or new features of already approved products. Hence, the project team drifts away from its original purpose. Because of one's tendency to focus on only one dimension of a project, scope creep can also result in a project team overrunning its original budget and schedule. For example, scope creep can be a result of poor change control, lack of proper identification of what products and features are required to bring about the achievement of project objectives in the first place, or a weak project manager or executive sponsor.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1707244320.0","comment_id":"800113"},{"comment_id":"796740","content":"should be B","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Julianleehk","timestamp":"1706936040.0"},{"poster":"Suchib","timestamp":"1703834700.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"760720","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIts change management"},{"content":"#inexam 28/11","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"729016","timestamp":"1701170280.0","poster":"Jco"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Careful with Ceecil’s responses as he is often wrong… change management is correct here","timestamp":"1695075840.0","comment_id":"672768","poster":"Cornfuzeled"},{"content":"A is absolutely correct.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1679505420.0","comment_id":"573104","poster":"Ceecil1959"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sandie_P","content":"I would pick C","comment_id":"472446","timestamp":"1667549820.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Should be B","timestamp":"1644151260.0","poster":"Tsuresh","comment_id":"284808"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Answer should be B. apply change management procedures","comment_id":"230580","timestamp":"1638218220.0","poster":"neji"}],"exam_id":160,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"consult with senior management on a regular basis","C":"ensure extensive user involvement","B":"apply change management procedures","D":"deploy CASE tools in software development"}},{"id":"wAC1dccYqfkNwtOB4nOZ","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_id":842,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2021-03-20 22:08:00","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (86%)","14%"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/47830-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-442-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":160,"question_text":"As part of an overall IT risk management plan, an IT risk register BEST helps management:","answer":"C","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is C. understand the organizational risk profile.\n\nAn IT risk register is a comprehensive document that identifies, assesses, and prioritizes IT risks.

If the system works as intended, it should detect and block such attempts, thereby proving its effectiveness.\n\nA. While reviewing logs for unauthorized data transfers is an important activity for overall security, it does not proactively test the DLP control's ability to prevent loss of credit card data.\nB. Configuring the DLP control to block credit card numbers is a necessary setup step, but it doesn't ensure the effectiveness of the control. The effectiveness can only be ensured by testing.\nD.
