Obtaining buy-in from risk owners.\n\nThe main benefit of involving stakeholders, especially risk owners, in the selection of key risk indicators (KRIs) is to obtain their buy-in. Here's why this is important:\n\nOwnership and Accountability: When risk owners are actively involved in selecting KRIs, they have a sense of ownership and accountability for the risks being monitored. They are more likely to take the KRIs seriously and actively participate in managing and mitigating the associated risks.\n\nAlignment with Objectives: Involving stakeholders ensures that the selected KRIs align with the organization's objectives and the specific risks that matter most to the business units or departments. This alignment enhances the relevance and effectiveness of the KRIs."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"864935","timestamp":"1712601000.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt is C.","poster":"CbtL"},{"timestamp":"1707870420.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: C\n7th CRISC manual, 'KRI selecction' section, 'the risk practitioner should work with all stakeholders to ensure greater buy-in and ownership.'.","comment_id":"807955"},{"comment_id":"768255","timestamp":"1704605340.0","content":"C. \"When working with management to determine appropriate KRIs, the risk practitioner should work with all relevant stakeholders to ensure greater buy-in and ownership.\" - CRM 7th ed. , p 186","poster":"tdaren","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"529688","content":"agree with C","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Raj1510","timestamp":"1674375840.0"},{"timestamp":"1672480800.0","poster":"MusMus","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"514019","content":"C is the correct answer"},{"content":"Why not A?","timestamp":"1654894260.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1654894320.0","poster":"Veej","comment_id":"379278","content":"sorry I mean D"}],"comment_id":"379276","poster":"Veej"},{"content":"why it's not B?","comment_id":"318558","poster":"Khy","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"347079","timestamp":"1651417620.0","content":"Because treatment decision is already accepted.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"oguz_1523"}],"timestamp":"1648075260.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following is the MAIN benefit of involving stakeholders in the selection of key risk indicators (KRIs)?","answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2021-03-23 23:41:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Improving risk awareness","C":"Obtaining buy-in from risk owners","B":"Optimizing risk treatment decisions","A":"Leveraging existing metrics"},"answer_description":"","exam_id":160,"unix_timestamp":1616539260,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"wNPZJNHy9VtKCB3c2mNV","answer":"A","question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Identification of key risk indicators","D":"Quantitative impact of the risk","A":"Involvement of process owner","B":"Involvement of internal audit"},"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/51425-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-681-discussion/","topic":"1","question_id":1092,"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"exam_id":160,"timestamp":"2021-05-01 17:12:00","question_text":"Which of the following is MOST critical when designing controls?","unix_timestamp":1619881920,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1667322720.0","content":"Should be A.","comment_id":"347083","poster":"oguz_1523"},{"poster":"aselunar","comment_id":"373027","timestamp":"1670019000.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"Yes it should be A.
