These systems can be a source of data leakage or mishandling, and they may not be initially considered or adequately addressed when implementing a new data classification process.\nIt's crucial to include end-user computing systems in the scope of data classification to ensure that sensitive data is properly identified, classified, and protected, regardless of where it resides within the organization.
