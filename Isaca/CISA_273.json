While this type of analysis is valuable for identifying potential security issues arising from dependencies on external code, it may not provide comprehensive coverage of security issues specific to the custom code written for the website.\n\nPenetration testing, on the other hand, involves actively probing and testing the website's code, configuration, and overall security posture by simulating real-world attack scenarios. This type of testing is more likely to uncover vulnerabilities specific to the custom code and implementation of the website, making the penetration test report a better choice for reviewing the security of the website's code.","timestamp":"1714724520.0","comment_id":"1205993","poster":"a84n"},{"comments":[{"content":"While web application vulnerability reports (Option D) are valuable for assessing the security of a website, they primarily focus on testing the website in its deployed state and identifying vulnerabilities from an external perspective.

Penetration test report\n\nPenetration testing involves actively probing a system to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses, including those within the code of a web application. This type of testing simulates real-world attacks and provides valuable insights into potential security risks. A penetration test report would detail the findings, vulnerabilities discovered, and recommendations for remediation, making it an essential reference for an IS auditor assessing the security of a newly developed website.\n\nWhile the other options (A. Black box testing report, B. Static software composition analysis, and D. Web application vulnerability report) may also provide useful information, a penetration test report specifically focuses on assessing the security of the application in a real-world scenario, which is highly relevant for an IS auditor's security review.","poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1695884760.0"},{"comment_id":"887861","poster":"saado9","content":"Static software composition analysis","timestamp":"1683057960.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"choices":{"A":"Black box testing report","D":"Web application vulnerability report","B":"Static software composition analysis","C":"Penetration test report"},"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":156},{"id":"wP6SCCa3Gg2qWOsOKdhr","discussion":[{"content":"D.

Outsourced business processes are excluded from the scope of the BIA.\n\nThis is because outsourced processes can be vital to the functioning of an organization. Excluding them means not considering a potentially significant portion of the business operations, which can lead to a substantial gap in understanding the full impact of a disruption. In today's interconnected business world, the failure to include these outsourced processes could render the BIA incomplete and potentially jeopardize the entire continuity plan.","comment_id":"1112881","timestamp":"1720012560.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe MOST concerning observation for an IS auditor reviewing an organization's business impact analysis (BIA) practices would be:\n\nC. Resource dependencies for critical processes are not determined.\n\nD. Identifying recovery objectives without conducting risk assessments is a concern, but it's not as critical as failing to determine resource dependencies. Risk assessments help identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, which inform the establishment of recovery objectives. While this is important, understanding resource dependencies is fundamental to the BIA process as it helps identify critical components that must be protected and recovered to ensure business continuity.\n\nIn summary, option C is the most concerning because it represents a fundamental gap in the BIA process, potentially leading to an inadequate understanding of what resources are critical for the organization's operations and how they might be impacted during a disruption.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1019545","timestamp":"1711616880.0","poster":"SuperMax"},{"comment_id":"958648","content":"Should be D","upvote_count":"2","poster":"JONESKA","timestamp":"1705859340.0"}],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Resource dependencies for critical processes are not determined.","D":"Recovery objectives are identified without conducting risk assessments.","A":"A combination of questionnaires, workshops, and interviews is used.","B":"Outsourced business processes are excluded from the scope of the BIA."},"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/103386-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-917-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1679319960,"answer":"C","answers_community":["C (60%)","B (20%)","D (20%)"],"question_id":1362,"timestamp":"2023-03-20 14:46:00","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"exam_id":156,"question_text":"Which of the following observations should be of MOST concern to an IS auditor reviewing an organizationâ€™s business impact analysis (BIA) practices?"},{"id":"10N6vB3M7vCMr7RaxXLG","timestamp":"2022-12-18 22:52:00","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is a better answer","poster":"BabaP","timestamp":"1699330080.0","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"891115"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732598820.0","comment_id":"1218709","poster":"Swallows","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhile validation of rules by the business (Option C) is important for ensuring that data validation rules accurately reflect business requirements and expectations, industry standard business definitions (Option A) provide a broader and more foundational framework for establishing a baseline for measuring data quality.

Industry standard business definitions\n\nIndustry standard business definitions provide a common and widely accepted reference point for understanding and assessing data quality.

Configure resources to scale.\n\nThe best approach to enable an e-commerce website to handle unpredictable amounts of traffic is to configure resources to scale. This approach involves setting up your infrastructure in a way that allows you to dynamically allocate additional resources (such as servers, storage, and bandwidth) as traffic increases and de-allocate them when traffic decreases. This scalability can be achieved through various techniques like auto-scaling, load balancing, and cloud-based services.\n\nWhile the other options (A, B, and C) can certainly help improve the performance and efficiency of your website, they may not be as effective in handling sudden and unpredictable spikes in traffic.
