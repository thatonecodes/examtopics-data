Change management tickets do not contain specific documentation.\nChange management tickets do not contain specific documentation: While documentation is an important component of change management, the absence of specific documentation in change management tickets is not necessarily a significant risk in and of itself. The risk associated with this practice would depend on the nature of the documentation that is missing, and whether its absence could impact the ability of stakeholders to understand the change and its potential impacts.","poster":"SuperMax","comments":[{"timestamp":"1695278820.0","comment_id":"1012859","content":"In conclusion, of the four practices listed, the practice that presents the greatest risk is emergency code changes being promoted without user acceptance testing.

In such a scenario, it may be tempting to skip some of the steps in the change management process, such as user acceptance testing. However, if changes are implemented without adequate testing, there is a high risk of introducing errors or other unintended consequences that could negatively impact the organization.","timestamp":"1685164080.0","poster":"3008","comment_id":"907768","upvote_count":"2"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_id":1078},{"id":"y3EEI2AJHtrCVDSUGW58","isMC":true,"exam_id":156,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-07-26 12:24:00","answers_community":[],"answer":"C","question_id":1079,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"963595","timestamp":"1721989440.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Changwha","content":"C.
