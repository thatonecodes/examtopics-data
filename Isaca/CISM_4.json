It provides a foundation for developing appropriate response and recovery strategies, identifying necessary resources, and establishing priorities for recovery efforts. The results of the BIA guide the development of the DRP, making it a crucial initial step in the planning process.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1022020","poster":"oluchecpoint"}],"topic":"1","answer":"D"},{"id":"M3BHcDhx5slTE5E8LSUo","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":157,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1698126600,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/124543-exam-cism-topic-1-question-1012-discussion/","answers_community":["A (75%)","D (25%)"],"question_id":17,"choices":{"C":"Providing justification for an increase in the incident response plan budget","D":"Incorporating the results into information security awareness training materials","B":"Developing cost reports regarding the incident","A":"Providing input for updates to the incident response plan"},"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which of the following would be the MOST effective use of findings from a post-incident review?","timestamp":"2023-10-24 07:50:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Business impact analysis (BIA)\nA Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a systematic process that assesses and quantifies the potential impacts that various incidents or disruptions could have on an organization's critical business functions and processes. By conducting a BIA, organizations can identify and prioritize their key assets, vulnerabilities, and potential threats. This analysis allows them to understand the potential consequences of security incidents and make informed decisions about implementing security measures.","comment_id":"1055971","timestamp":"1714277280.0","poster":"koala_lay"}],"choices":{"A":"Vulnerability assessments","C":"Business impact analysis (BIA)","D":"Key performance indicators (KPIs)","B":"Key risk indicators (KRIs)"},"timestamp":"2023-10-24 07:53:00","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is MOST helpful in determining the realization of benefits from an information security program?","answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (83%)","C (17%)"]},{"id":"nsCV6kgNeKDHrIubhom0","topic":"1","question_id":20,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (86%)","14%"],"choices":{"D":"Monitor the application until it can be replaced.","B":"Recommend taking the application out of service.","C":"Implement compensating controls.","A":"Update the risk register."},"question_text":"During an internal compliance review, the review team discovers that a critical legacy application is unable to meet the organization's mandatory security requirements.

Update the risk register.\n\nUpdating the risk register is the initial action to document and track the identified risk associated with the critical legacy application. This involves recording the non-compliance with mandatory security requirements and assessing the potential impact and likelihood of the risk. Once the risk is documented, the organization can then proceed to determine the most appropriate risk treatment strategy.\n\nWhile options like recommending taking the application out of service (Option B), implementing compensating controls (Option C), and monitoring the application until it can be replaced (Option D) are potential risk treatment strategies, updating the risk register is the foundational step in the risk management process. It ensures that the organization has a clear record of the identified risk and can make informed decisions on how to address it.","timestamp":"1706126940.0","comment_id":"1131095"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
