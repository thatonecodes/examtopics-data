Risk appetite refers to the amount and type of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. When merging two organizations, it is important to reconcile these differences and develop a shared understanding of the risk appetite for the combined entity.\n\nDifferent taxonomies to categorize risk scenarios can also present a challenge, but can typically be reconciled through a mapping exercise to align the two taxonomies. In contrast, variances in organizational risk appetites may require a more fundamental shift in the way risks are identified, assessed, and managed, as well as potentially different risk tolerances.","comment_id":"815396"}],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following would present the GREATEST challenge for a risk practitioner during a merger of two organizations?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/100080-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1258-discussion/","exam_id":160,"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Variances between organizational risk appetites","A":"Disparate platforms for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) systems","D":"Different taxonomies to categorize risk scenarios","C":"Dissimilar organizational risk acceptance protocols"},"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"xo3dxj5VQpuyGOEIHXER","answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719153360.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
