Database backup and replication guidelines\n\nDatabase backup and replication guidelines are directly related to ensuring that data can be restored and systems can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. These guidelines provide critical information on how data is backed up, how frequently backups occur, and how data is replicated to ensure availability and resilience. Reviewing these guidelines helps the auditor assess the effectiveness of the organization's backup strategies and their preparedness to recover from incidents.\n\nWhile other options may also be relevant, such as incident management documentation and system backup documentation, the database backup and replication guidelines specifically focus on data continuity and resilience, which are central to business continuity management."},{"timestamp":"1723716720.0","comment_id":"1150971","poster":"sai_murthy","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCCK P# 339"}],"unix_timestamp":1707999120,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133968-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-225-discussion/","question_text":"In relation to testing business continuity management and operational resilience, an auditor should review which of the following database documentation?","isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"T8kcC1aiVy9gCU2R9KtR","unix_timestamp":1714303680,"isMC":true,"question_id":137,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/139716-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-226-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following can be used to determine whether access keys are stored in the source code or any other configuration files during development?","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":153,"choices":{"A":"Static code review","D":"Vulnerability scanning","B":"Dynamic code review","C":"Credential scanning"},"answer_ET":"A","answer":"C","answer_description":"","topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Credential scanning\n\nCredential scanning is a process used to automatically detect sensitive information, such as access keys, passwords, and other credentials, in source code, configuration files, and other artifacts during development. These tools are specifically designed to identify and flag instances where credentials may have been inadvertently included in files that should not contain them, helping to prevent security breaches and unauthorized access.\n\nWhile static code review (A) involves analyzing source code without executing it and can sometimes identify hardcoded credentials, credential scanning (C) is more specialized for this specific task. Dynamic code review (B) is not typically used for identifying stored credentials, as it involves analyzing the behavior of code during execution. Vulnerability scanning (D) is generally focused on identifying security vulnerabilities in deployed applications rather than checking for credentials in source code.","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1743113160.0","comment_id":"1411064"},{"content":"It is C.","poster":"339dfab","comment_id":"1299724","timestamp":"1729264560.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1259068","timestamp":"1722454200.0","poster":"4f2a581","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCCAK Pg:353\nStored Credentials/Secrets Scanning"},{"content":"Its C, credential Scanning .\n\nA frequently occurring problem in security is the storage of credentials such as passwords and access keys in source\ncode, or configuration or other files. This creates the risk that those credentials—which should never be shared—are\nexposed to people who do not have permission to access them. This could lead to the organization’s application or\ndata being vulnerable.

Which of the following controls is MOST appropriate for mitigating this risk?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Access restriction\n\nAccess restriction is the most appropriate control for mitigating risks associated with management planes in cloud environments. Management planes are critical components that allow administrators to manage and configure cloud services, and they typically have the capability to access and control the entire cloud environment. Therefore, implementing strict access controls is essential to ensure that only authorized personnel can access these planes, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.\n\nWhile regular audits (A), increased monitoring (B), and change management (C) are important practices for overall security and governance, access restriction directly addresses the risk by limiting who can interact with the management planes, thereby preventing unauthorized activities. Restricting access based on roles, implementing multi-factor authentication, and ensuring principle of least privilege are effective strategies for securing management planes.","timestamp":"1743113220.0","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1411065"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133969-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-227-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Access restriction","C":"Change management","B":"Increased monitoring","A":"Regular audits"}},{"id":"VSUsAgmewvCGQ4RbuXMa","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer":"A","discussion":[{"content":"A.

This report includes a detailed description of the service organization's system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of its controls.
