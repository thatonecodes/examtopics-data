However, the most valuable information would likely be the IT risk appetite statement.\n\nAn IT risk appetite statement outlines the level and type of risk that the organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. This statement helps to guide decision-making and prioritization of IT initiatives and investments, as well as provide a framework for risk management across the organization.\n\nHaving a clear understanding of the organization's IT risk appetite can help senior management to make informed decisions about resource allocation, budgeting, and strategic planning, and can provide a basis for communicating with stakeholders about risk management priorities.\n\nWhile the other risk-related information listed (risk mitigation plans, emerging IT risk scenarios, and key risk indicators) can also be valuable, they are more tactical in nature and may be better suited for ongoing risk management and monitoring rather than strategic planning.","comment_id":"858374"},{"poster":"Broesweelies","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\npretty obvious","comment_id":"851025","timestamp":"1727355660.0"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"yW9EwerfBQEN5piv2RRr","question_id":77,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729692660.0","comment_id":"878448","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree with A.","poster":"CbtL"}],"question_text":"What information related to a system vulnerability would be MOST useful to management in making an effective risk-based decision?","choices":{"B":"Availability of patches to mitigate the vulnerability","D":"Risk mitigation plans for the vulnerability","C":"Vulnerability scanning tools currently in place","A":"Consequences if the vulnerability is exploited"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":160,"answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107200-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1071-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1682259060,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-04-23 16:11:00"},{"id":"F8CVMS8momIo4w0sKq12","topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with C.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"878450","timestamp":"1729692720.0"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Business impact analysis (BIA)","D":"Historical trend analysis","A":"Fault tree analysis","B":"Root cause analysis"},"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107201-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1072-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-04-23 16:12:00","question_text":"Which of the following is MOST helpful to understand the consequences of an IT risk event?","unix_timestamp":1682259120,"exam_id":160,"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"question_id":78},{"id":"tywRIyG68G4b9NEnvRqe","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1682259180,"answer":"C","discussion":[{"comment_id":"878451","timestamp":"1729692780.0","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with C."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107202-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1073-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"An organization striving to be on the leading edge in regard to risk monitoring would MOST likely implement:","exam_id":160,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-23 16:13:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"a tool for monitoring critical activities and controls","D":"monitoring activities for all critical assets.","C":"real-time monitoring of risk events and control exceptions","B":"procedures to monitor the operation of controls"},"question_id":79},{"id":"m4jIKNHN44dwGUuZcaDQ","unix_timestamp":1669035840,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-11-21 14:04:00","answer":"B","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"878456","timestamp":"1729692840.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B first."},{"timestamp":"1724084040.0","comment_id":"814358","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree, first 'B'."},{"timestamp":"1716289440.0","comments":[{"poster":"Annyp","upvote_count":"2","content":"B is correct.
