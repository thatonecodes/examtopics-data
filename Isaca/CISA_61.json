This ensures that during the data transformation process, the policies governing the handling, protection, and access control of the data are maintained and enforced. By mapping classification controls to data sets, the organization can ensure that the integrity of data classification policies is preserved as the data undergoes transformation.","comment_id":"1207170","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730875320.0"},{"poster":"Sibsankar","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1152512","content":"Map data involves associating specific data classification labels or controls with the corresponding data sets, ensuring that the classification is maintained throughout the data transformation process.","timestamp":"1723886820.0"},{"timestamp":"1723886640.0","poster":"Sibsankar","content":"C is wrong , right answer is D","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1152510"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1104986","timestamp":"1719278880.0","poster":"KAP2HURUF","content":"Selected Answer: C\nImplementing classification labels in metadata during data creation (option C) is a proactive measure that embeds data classification directly into the data.

Here’s why:\n• Residual Risk represents the level of risk remaining after all mitigation efforts and controls have been applied. It directly shows the effectiveness of these risk management strategies in reducing the overall risk.\n• Mitigation Efforts and Control Effectiveness are important for understanding what measures are in place and how well they work. However, Residual Risk provides the final measure of the risk that still exists after these efforts, making it the most direct indicator of how much risk has been successfully reduced.","timestamp":"1721998140.0","poster":"1e71ed5","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1218769","poster":"Swallows","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhile both options C and D are relevant in assessing risk reduction, reviewing mitigation efforts (option C) offers a broader understanding of the proactive measures taken by the organization to mitigate security risks comprehensively.","timestamp":"1716706560.0"},{"comment_id":"1207172","timestamp":"1714970760.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"a84n","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C\nMitigation efforts refer to the actions taken to reduce or mitigate identified risks.\nwhile option D Control effectiveness refers to the extent to which implemented controls achieve their intended objectives."},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"MJORGER","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

When using third-party APIs in a hosted virtual environment, there is a risk that the APIs may have vulnerabilities or be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This can result in data breaches, loss of confidential information, and potential legal and reputational consequences for the organization.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D are also important risks to consider, data exfiltration poses the greatest threat as it directly impacts the security and integrity of the organization's data. It is crucial to assess the security measures, access controls, and data protection mechanisms in place when utilizing third-party APIs to mitigate the risk of data exfiltration."}],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-12-25 04:32:00","question_text":"Which of the following is the GREATEST risk when using application programming interfaces (APIS) in a third-party hosted virtual environment?","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/129306-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1336-discussion/","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1703475120,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Inability to test third-party APIs","A":"Data exfiltration","B":"Lack of accountability","D":"Lack of redundancy"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":303,"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"lN2SgcX5pEqciy2JFCPk","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST way for senior audit leadership to be engaged during the planning phase of an audit in order to improve audit quality?","answer":"C","answers_community":[],"question_id":304,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1219960","timestamp":"1732769160.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"I will go with D.
