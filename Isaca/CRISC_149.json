Risk assessment.\n\nRisk assessment is a process in which you identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, then analyze the likelihood and impact of these risks on the organization. This process often involves creating hypothetical scenarios to understand how different risks could potentially affect the organization's operations, assets, or objectives. It's a key component of a comprehensive risk management strategy.","timestamp":"1720292580.0"},{"timestamp":"1716807060.0","comment_id":"1081533","poster":"Kennethlim79","upvote_count":"1","content":"The correct answer is D.

Probability and Impact Matrix\n\nThis approach allows you to evaluate the likelihood of each risk event occurring (probability) and the effect it would have on the project if it does occur (impact). By using a Probability and Impact Matrix, you can prioritize risks based on their potential severity and likelihood, which helps in determining which risks need more immediate attention and mitigation strategies.\n\nHere's why this approach stands out:\nComprehensive Evaluation: It combines both the probability and impact of risks, providing a more complete picture.\nPrioritization: Helps in ranking risks so that the most significant ones are addressed first.\nVisual Representation: Offers a clear, visual way to understand and communicate risk levels to stakeholders.\nWhile the other options (interviews or meetings, determination of the true cost of the risk event, and root cause analysis) are also important in the risk management process, the Probability and Impact Matrix is particularly effective for assessing and prioritizing risks.","poster":"Joloms"}]},{"id":"LdvKqy6xGl4YCfGCHRvs","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":160,"question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST important objective of the information system control?","timestamp":"2025-01-29 01:56:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"uday1985","comment_id":"1348267","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1738112160.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nControl aid in attaining Business objectives"}],"question_id":743,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"The basic purpose of Information System control in an organization is to ensure that the business objectives are achieved and undesired risk events are detected and corrected.

Minimization of residual risk.\n\nResidual risk is the risk that remains after risk mitigation measures have been implemented. It is the difference between the inherent risk (the risk before any mitigation measures are taken) and the mitigated risk.\n\nAn effective risk mitigation method should minimize residual risk to an acceptable level. This means that the remaining risk should be low enough that it will not significantly impact the project's objectives.\n\nReducing the frequency of a threat, minimizing inherent risk, and reducing the impact of a threat are all important steps in risk mitigation, but they are not sufficient to ensure that the method is effective.

Minimization of residual risk\n\nWhen you opt for risk mitigation, you are primarily concerned with reducing the impact of a threat and minimizing the residual risk that remains after mitigation efforts. Residual risk is the risk that still exists after you have applied mitigation strategies. Therefore, ensuring that the risk mitigation method is effective means minimizing the residual risk to an acceptable level. Options A and C are related to the effectiveness of risk mitigation but do not cover the entire picture, as you should also consider the overall residual risk.
