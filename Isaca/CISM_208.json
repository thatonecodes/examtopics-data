The most important step in this process is to review the information security policy of the third-party service provider. This review helps to determine the provider's security posture and identify any potential security risks associated with their services. It ensures that the provider's policies, procedures, and controls align with the organization's own information security requirements and that the provider is committed to protecting sensitive data and systems. By reviewing the information security policy of the third-party provider, organizations can make informed decisions about their security arrangements and ensure that they are able to manage and mitigate risks effectively. This is why reviewing the information security policy of the third-party provider is the most important step in confirming their compliance with an organization's information security requirements."}],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1675532280,"isMC":true,"question_id":1036,"timestamp":"2023-02-04 18:38:00","question_images":[],"exam_id":157,"choices":{"B":"security metrics are included in the service level agreement (SLA).","A":"contract clauses comply with the organization's information security policy.","C":"the information security policy of the third-party service provider is reviewed.","D":"right to audit is included in the service level agreement (SLA)."},"topic":"1"},{"id":"rmTvaTiFadyWKnruWWeT","unix_timestamp":1689034920,"timestamp":"2023-07-11 02:22:00","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nNo need for ChatGPT analysis here...\"management support or management buy-in\" is almost always the correct answer for these types of CISM or CISSP questions. :-)","poster":"isaphiltrick","comment_id":"1251485","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721438880.0"},{"comments":[{"poster":"oluchecpoint","timestamp":"1694337540.0","comment_id":"1003869","upvote_count":"1","content":"Cultural behaviour start from the top(senior management)"}],"timestamp":"1694337480.0","poster":"oluchecpoint","comment_id":"1003867","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

By explicitly outlining information security requirements and expectations within contracts, organizations establish clear guidelines and obligations for third-party providers to adhere to. These clauses may cover aspects such as data protection, confidentiality, access controls, incident response procedures, and compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nWhile auditing the service delivery of third-party providers (Option B), providing information security training to third-party personnel (Option C), and requiring third parties to sign confidentiality agreements (Option D) are all important measures, including information security clauses within contracts establishes a formal agreement and legal framework that explicitly addresses information security concerns and responsibilities.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1136270"},{"comment_id":"1126942","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721411040.0","poster":"AlexJacobson","content":"Selected Answer: A\n\" are AWARE of information security requirements and expectations\".

Training helps build awareness, knowledge, and compliance with security policies and practices.\n\nRequiring third parties to sign confidentiality agreements (Option D) is relevant for protecting sensitive information but may not cover the breadth of information security requirements.
