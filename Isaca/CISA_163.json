Testing the incident response plan can provide valuable information about the effectiveness of the plan in responding to a disruption, but it does not necessarily indicate the completeness of the BCP, including the definition of critical processes. To identify gaps in the BCP, including undefined critical processes, the IS auditor should perform a comprehensive review of the BCP, including its objectives, strategies, and procedures. This review should also assess the BCP's alignment with the organization's risk management strategy and overall continuity goals, as well as its consistency with industry standards and best practices.","timestamp":"1722735960.0","poster":"zebree"}],"comment_id":"479114","content":"incident response plan !!!\nCan someone explain ?"}]},{"id":"5yjpmsyUwlN16Kiass2g","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-07-16 05:38:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nDuring the closing stages of a system development project, the User Acceptance Test (UAT) results are the MOST important consideration because they demonstrate that the system meets the business requirements and is functioning as intended.

It is about the best source for an urgent operational action and not about which is the best source to create the incident response plan. A Google search with operator 'site:isaca.org' and search term 'incident response plan' gives us an ISACA QAE compliant answer. An incident response plan has to be created according to different ‘incident response models’ depending on the industry. In other words, by the time the operational issue arises, the industry-related regulations have long been integrated into the incident response plan and the only thing left to do is to act accordingly. And the best source for this at the time of \"following a breach...\" is the incident response plan.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1717058160.0","comment_id":"1221464","poster":"46080f2"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1077197","poster":"kGiGa","content":"Who should know the maximum time?
