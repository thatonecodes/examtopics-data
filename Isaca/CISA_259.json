By doing so, it allows audit teams to allocate their limited resources to areas where the greatest risks exist. This helps ensure that the audit focuses on the most critical areas that have the potential for significant financial, operational, or compliance impact. While identifying key controls and understanding business processes are important aspects of a risk-based audit, the primary goal is to prioritize audit resources effectively based on the level of risk.","timestamp":"1727415060.0","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1018478"},{"poster":"3008","comment_id":"979694","timestamp":"1723513560.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\na risk-based audit methodology is a powerful tool for ensuring that audit resources are used effectively and efficiently.

Establish a contractual agreement with a second ISP to cover connection to the disaster recovery site.\n\nThe best way for the bank to minimize risk in this situation is to have redundancy in its internet connectivity to the disaster recovery site. Currently, both the primary and disaster recovery sites are supported by the same Internet service provider (ISP), which creates a single point of failure. If this ISP experiences an outage or other issues, it could disrupt both the primary and disaster recovery operations.\n\nBy establishing a contractual agreement with a second ISP to cover the connection to the disaster recovery site, the bank ensures that it has a backup internet connection. This redundancy reduces the risk of downtime or data loss in the event of a connectivity issue with the primary ISP. This approach enhances the bank's business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nBecause C: may help to reduce the risk of downtime due to network outages, but it does not address the issue of a single point of failure.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"007Georgeo","timestamp":"1684001280.0","comment_id":"896992"},{"timestamp":"1683399720.0","poster":"BabaP","comment_id":"890959","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is better"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Bisi3","content":"D.

Communicate the conflict of interest to the audit manager.\nIt is essential for auditors to be transparent about any potential conflicts of interest. By communicating this conflict to the audit manager, the auditor is taking the necessary step to disclose the situation.\nThe audit manager can assess the nature and extent of the conflict. They can determine whether the auditor's previous involvement in the BCP design poses a real or perceived bias in the audit process.\n\nThe audit manager, after evaluating the situation, can make an informed decision about how to proceed.

Determining the identification process for each factor and ensuring they are synchronized.\n\nMulti-factor authentication relies on the combination of multiple authentication factors to enhance security. It is crucial that these factors are synchronized and work seamlessly together to provide the intended security benefits. If the identification processes for each factor are not well-defined or are not synchronized properly, it can lead to vulnerabilities or authentication issues.\n\nWhile the other options are also important aspects of MFA design, such as reviewing physical controls and ensuring segregation of factors, ensuring synchronization of the identification processes is fundamental to the overall security and effectiveness of the MFA system. Option D, evaluating false rejection and false acceptance rates, is important for assessing the usability and reliability of the MFA system but is not as critical as ensuring the proper synchronization of factors.","comment_id":"1018489"},{"poster":"3008","comment_id":"979696","timestamp":"1691891940.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\ndetermining the identification process for each factor and ensuring they are synchronized is the most important factor to consider in evaluating the design effectiveness of multi-factor authentication","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"C.
