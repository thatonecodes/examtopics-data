Communicating the residual risk\n\nCommunicating the residual risk is likely to be effective in obtaining senior management commitment for an information security program. Residual risk refers to the level of risk that remains after security controls and mitigation measures have been implemented. By presenting information about residual risk, the information security manager can demonstrate the ongoing vulnerabilities and potential impact on the organization if additional measures are not taken.\n\nWhile presenting evidence of inherent risk is important for understanding the initial risk landscape, focusing on residual risk provides a more nuanced and current assessment. Senior management is often concerned with making informed decisions to manage and accept residual risks effectively. Therefore, option D is likely to be the most persuasive in obtaining senior management commitment to enhance the information security program.","poster":"maisarajarrah","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1704661380.0","comment_id":"1116161"},{"timestamp":"1695558960.0","comment_id":"1015761","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPresenting inherent risk makes sense when seeking funds, but for management's ongoing support/commitment IS needs to show evidence of alignment with business objectives, which in this case is by showing that residual risk is within acceptable levels. \n\nIf we cannot achieve acceptable risk levels for existing risks, then presenting inherent risks will raise more questions for management than provide answers to 'why should they invest in IS?\"","upvote_count":"5","poster":"CISSPST"},{"poster":"oluchecpoint","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694320560.0","comment_id":"1003685","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
