Data for the organization to assess progress\n\nThe MAIN outcome from monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) for a corporate security management program should be to provide data for the organization to assess its progress. Monitoring KPIs allows the organization to track the effectiveness of its security measures, identify areas that may need improvement, and make informed decisions to enhance security. While the other options (A, B, and D) can be important components of a security management program, they are not the primary outcome of monitoring KPIs.","timestamp":"1725802320.0","comment_id":"1002519"},{"poster":"richck102","content":"C.

Communication plan\n\nWhen creating an incident response plan, it's important to include a communication plan during the preparation phase of the plan's life cycle. A communication plan outlines how the organization will communicate during an incident, who will be responsible for communicating, and what information will be communicated to different stakeholders. This is important to ensure that all stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, and regulators, are informed and kept up-to-date on the incident and its impact.
