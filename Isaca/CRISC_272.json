Establish clear accountability for risk.\n\nEstablishing clear accountability for risk means defining roles and responsibilities for managing and mitigating risks throughout the organization. This includes identifying individuals or teams responsible for assessing, mitigating, and monitoring specific risks. When there is a clear understanding of who is accountable for each risk, it becomes easier to make informed decisions about risk treatment strategies. Accountability ensures that the right people are empowered to take actions to address risks effectively.","timestamp":"1726618500.0"},{"timestamp":"1716681900.0","poster":"mynk29","comment_id":"906944","upvote_count":"1","content":"D is close too.."},{"timestamp":"1713608400.0","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"875479"},{"comment_id":"859246","content":"going with A too","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712082480.0","poster":"Koulyo"},{"poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"792130","timestamp":"1706567580.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe risk owner has the responsibility of making the decision to respond to the identified risk, and to ensure accountability, the owner must be an individual."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Is it not option A?

The GREATEST concern when assessing the risk profile of an organization is when the risk profile was not updated after a recent incident. An incident can reveal previously unknown risks, highlight vulnerabilities that need to be addressed, and change the organization's risk landscape. Failure to update the risk profile after an incident can result in an inaccurate representation of the organization's risk profile, which can lead to ineffective risk management. While the other options can also be a concern when assessing the risk profile of an organization, they are not as critical as failure to update the risk profile after a recent incident. Historical loss data, the frequency of reviews, and the use of industry standards are important considerations, but they do not have the same impact on risk management as an incident that has not been reflected in the risk profile."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree 'B'.","comment_id":"812867","timestamp":"1723970820.0","poster":"john_boogieman"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"758401","timestamp":"1719479940.0","poster":"Suchib","content":"I also feel B is more valid, it covers the optionC as well"},{"poster":"Jco","content":"Shouldn't it be B: reviewed 2 years ago.","comment_id":"722569","timestamp":"1716197280.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":1360,"unix_timestamp":1668943680,"question_text":"Which of the following will be the GREATEST concern when assessing the risk profile of an organization?"}],"exam":{"name":"CRISC","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":1422,"id":160,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Isaca","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":272},"__N_SSP":true}
