Reassess whether the risk responses properly address known risks and vulnerabilities.\n\nThis reassessment is crucial as the shift from a cloud-based to an internally managed system fundamentally changes the risk landscape. New risks might emerge, and existing risks might evolve in nature and impact. The practitioner needs to ensure that the organization's risk responses are still appropriate and effective in this new context. This reassessment will inform subsequent actions, such as updating control test plans, the risk register, and financial control assessment processes, with a clear understanding of the new risks and vulnerabilities associated with the internal management of the financial system.","poster":"Abbey2","comment_id":"1121231","timestamp":"1720830420.0"},{"timestamp":"1720513860.0","poster":"ramy2277","content":"C.

This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access financial transactions. MFA typically involves a combination of something you know (like a password) and something you have (like a mobile device or a security token).\n\nWhile blockchain technology, integrated audit facilities, and audit trail logs are also important components of a secure financial system, multi-factor authentication directly addresses the challenge of verifying the identity of users during online transactions, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of financial transactions.","comment_id":"1092422","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718008500.0","poster":"SuperMax"}],"choices":{"D":"Implementing audit trail logs","C":"Deploying multi-factor authentication","B":"Developing an integrated audit facility","A":"Implementing blockchain technology"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following would BEST support the integrity of online financial transactions?"},{"id":"t9eijbwQHrg81eepdVvh","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1112254","poster":"K5000ism","timestamp":"1719947640.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
