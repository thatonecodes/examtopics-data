This is because the BIA is a critical component of an organization's business continuity process that assesses potential effects of an interruption to the organization's operations. The sooner the BIA is reviewed and updated to reflect the new operating model, the better prepared the organization will be to manage the transition and mitigate any potential risks or impacts. It's important to note that the BIA should continue to be reviewed and updated regularly as the organization evolves.","poster":"3008","timestamp":"1701685380.0"},{"timestamp":"1700888640.0","content":"B.

Responsibility of leadership for quality in audits\n\nThe most important element of quality control with respect to an audit engagement is the responsibility of leadership for quality in audits.
