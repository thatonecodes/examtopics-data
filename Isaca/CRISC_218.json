Implement network segregation.\n\nWhile all the options mentioned are important for cybersecurity, implementing network segregation is often considered the best approach for preventing cyber intrusion. Network segregation, also known as network segmentation, involves dividing an organization's network into smaller, isolated segments or zones. Each segment has limited access to other segments, reducing the attack surface and preventing lateral movement by cyber attackers.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee","timestamp":"1693693980.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"864911","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree it is D.","timestamp":"1680977280.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Koulyo","timestamp":"1680656700.0","content":"i think its D because By strengthening vulnerability remediation efforts, organizations can proactively identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by cyber attackers.","comment_id":"861656"},{"timestamp":"1676806500.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"886165","content":"I think is B","timestamp":"1682940660.0","poster":"Julianleehk"}],"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"814013","content":"should be D","poster":"Julianleehk"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nSegregation does not prevent intrusion, but rather minimizes the impact.","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1676333700.0","comment_id":"807945","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nVulnerabilities are the ones to be exploited for cyber intrusion","comment_id":"793894","timestamp":"1675156620.0","poster":"Boubou480"},{"comment_id":"586953","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOf possible answers D makes the most sense, as it is the widest.
