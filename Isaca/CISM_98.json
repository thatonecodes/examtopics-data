A classification policy identifies the different types of information that are used within an organization, specifies the appropriate controls to protect each type of information, and defines the handling and storage procedures. Encryption is typically applied to protect sensitive information. Without a classification policy, it can be challenging to identify which information requires encryption and which does not, leading to the improper application of encryption or the underprotection of sensitive information. Therefore, a classification policy is the most important consideration when considering the deployment of encryption software and systems organization-wide.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"866694","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe most important thing for an information security manager is to keep the business in mind and align the security strategy to the business.
