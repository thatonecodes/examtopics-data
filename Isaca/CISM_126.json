If you look at the initial cost, a cold site will be more expensive than a reciprocal agreement. However, when you look at the ongoing periodic costs, a cold site is less expensive. A cold site is often less expensive than a reciprocal agreement. This is because a cold site's periodic costs primarily include facility maintenance, which tends to be lower compared to the costs associated with maintaining an active reciprocal agreement. Reciprocal agreements may involve regular testing, coordination, communication, and sometimes the need to provide resources to the partner organization. These ongoing operational activities can incur costs that exceed the maintenance costs of a cold site, which remains largely dormant until needed. As such, the correct answer here is D.
