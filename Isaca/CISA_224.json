The separation of duties ensures that no single individual has the ability to both create and approve purchase orders and make payments.

This situation poses a risk of unauthorized or erroneous changes, and reporting the SoD violation can trigger corrective actions to mitigate this risk.\nAddressing the segregation of duties issue is a fundamental concern that needs immediate attention to enhance control and security.
