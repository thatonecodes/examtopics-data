Because escalation procedures are usually done alongside stakeholders and not just by the infosec manager. This is because the infosec manager may or may not be present. The infosec manager may or may not represent the interest of the business correctly. Even if he could do it well without eh business, if the manager leaves another manager may have a different process entirely. So this leads to inconsistency. Instead, the infosec manager alongside stakeholders should document it in an escalation procedure, and his predecessor/successor review and improve it. So it is instead preferred to have it in a documented process which is (A).\n\n(C.) chain of custody is how you enforce it, but not authorize it. Authorization is by the infosec manager by what has been defined in the escalation procedures.\n\n(D.) disaster recovery plan (DRP) relates to incidents and not necessarily security incidents.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"dark_3k03r","comment_id":"891056"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nEscalation procedures describe the steps that should be taken to manage and resolve security incidents, including when and how to involve external parties such as third-party support providers.
