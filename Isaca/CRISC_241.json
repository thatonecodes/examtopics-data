Time between when IT risk scenarios are identified and the enterprise's response.\nThe promptness of response after identifying IT risk scenarios is a strong indicator of the effectiveness of the IT risk management processes. It signifies how agile and proactive the organization is in addressing and mitigating risks.

Cost versus benefit of additional mitigating controls.\n\nThe most important consideration when determining whether to accept residual risk after security controls have been implemented on a critical system is the cost versus the benefit of adding additional mitigating controls. Residual risk represents the level of risk that remains after controls have been applied. It's essential to evaluate whether the cost of implementing additional controls to further reduce this residual risk is justified by the potential benefits and the criticality of the system.\n\nWhile factors like the cost of the information control system, the annualized loss expectancy (ALE), and the frequency of business impact are relevant, they should be considered in the context of whether the cost of additional controls is proportionate to the reduction in risk they provide. This cost-benefit analysis helps organizations make informed decisions about accepting or mitigating residual risk.","timestamp":"1726093800.0","comment_id":"1005205"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713202020.0","comment_id":"871160","poster":"CbtL"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnnualized loss expectancy (ALE) for the system can be a useful metric for assessing the overall risk profile of a critical system, but it is not as helpful as the cost versus benefit analysis in determining whether to accept residual risk or implement additional mitigating controls.
