In general, senior management makes policies, and the plebs below make plans and procedures. Therefore a business continuity plan is not necessarily senior management approved.\nFurthermore there is a passage in the review manual (4.15.11) regarding auditing business continuity. The passage does not really mention senior management, but it does mention plan testing and obtaining historical results of tests during an audit.","timestamp":"1695546120.0","upvote_count":"11","poster":"GenPatton","comment_id":"1015618"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D Thanks to P A S S 4 S U R E X A M S","timestamp":"1743238500.0","poster":"RichardJose","comment_id":"1411651"},{"poster":"Vinsystraining","timestamp":"1741674480.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1387304","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhen an IS auditor is reviewing an organization's Business Continuity Plan (BCP), the greatest concern should be the effectiveness and clarity of the recovery strategies and procedures.
