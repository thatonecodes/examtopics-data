User recertification.\n\nUser recertification is a process in which an organization regularly reviews and verifies the access rights and privileges of its users. This process helps ensure that users have only the access they need to perform their job functions, in line with the principle of least privilege. It involves checking and confirming that the access levels granted to users are still appropriate, and any unnecessary or excessive privileges are revoked. User recertification is a proactive and systematic approach to maintaining least privilege and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.","comment_id":"1010118","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"875378","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree with B.
