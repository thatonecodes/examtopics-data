In stratified random sampling, a larger population is divided into distinct subgroups, or strata, that share similar characteristics to study their appreciable differences. By dividing the population into strata that share similar characteristics, researchers can draw random samples from each group in proportion to their sizes in the overall population. This ensures that every subgroup is adequately represented, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the results.","poster":"macksonj","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"963568","poster":"Changwha","content":"B.

By examining the workflow, the IS auditor can identify where the breakdown occurred that led to the hard drives not being sent for destruction. This approach helps in understanding the root cause of the issue and ensures that similar problems can be prevented in the future. Simply sending the drives for destruction (option C) addresses the immediate problem but does not resolve the underlying process gaps. Escalating the finding to the asset owner for remediation (option D) is a valid step, but it primarily addresses the immediate issue rather than preventing future occurrences."},{"timestamp":"1720241940.0","comment_id":"1243186","comments":[{"poster":"Swallows","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720321500.0","comment_id":"1243667","content":"I agree with you.
