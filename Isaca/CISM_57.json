The question explicitly says that you have identified and confirmed the incident taking place giving you the initial phase of IR and asking \"what now?\". Well, the next step is to contain it and stop it from doing further damage and only then you inform the appropriate people.\n\nNote that question is quite vague when defining the incident - we don't know what type of incident it is (is it a ransomware, is someone breaking AUP by taking photos inside the secure environment, etc).
