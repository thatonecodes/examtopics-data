Data encryption.\n\nEncrypting data is a direct way to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. Even if a service provider's administrator gains access to the data, encryption ensures that the content remains unreadable and secure without the appropriate decryption keys. This measure protects the data at rest as well as in transit, providing a robust defense against unauthorized access, regardless of the internal controls or policies of the service provider.","poster":"Abbey2","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"C","isMC":true},{"id":"FWjSHNfZugcQH5DzyjMG","timestamp":"2020-09-18 19:42:00","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/31627-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-163-discussion/","choices":{"D":"Mitigation","B":"Transference","C":"Enhance","A":"Acceptance"},"question_text":"One of the risk events you've identified is classified as force majeure.
