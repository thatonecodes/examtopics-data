A security framework is a set of guidelines, standards, and best practices that organizations can use to establish and maintain a secure environment for their information systems and networks. There are many different security frameworks available, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the ISO 27001 standard, and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. Identifying the applicable security framework will help to provide a benchmark or reference point for evaluating the organization's current vulnerability management practices and identifying areas for improvement.","timestamp":"1672365840.0","comments":[{"poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1020388","content":"Identifying the applicable security framework is crucial because it provides a structured and standardized set of guidelines, controls, and best practices that the organization should follow in its vulnerability management processes.
