A risk register is a dynamic tool used to capture and track various risks faced by an organization. Failure to include significant changes in risk factors can result in outdated risk assessments and may lead to inadequate risk response planning. Keeping the risk register up to date with relevant and current risk information is crucial for effective risk management.","comment_id":"997124"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL","comments":[{"content":"any justification?","poster":"Koulyo","timestamp":"1712280240.0","comment_id":"861665","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"1712228400.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","comment_id":"860917"}]},{"id":"c13Wlen5DFBDWdtADFW5","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following would BEST help an enterprise prioritize risk scenarios?","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":1068,"exam_id":160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/105424-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-657-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"Staanlee","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"997125","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Placement on the risk map\n\nThe risk map is a visual representation of risks that takes into account their likelihood and impact. By placing risk scenarios on a risk map, you can effectively prioritize them based on their relative positions. Risks that are positioned in the high-likelihood, high-impact quadrant are typically of the highest priority and should be addressed first. This approach allows for a clear and visual understanding of which risks require immediate attention and which can be addressed later.","timestamp":"1725308220.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree it is D.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"863096","timestamp":"1712417220.0","poster":"CbtL"}],"choices":{"C":"Cost of risk mitigation","A":"Industry best practices","B":"Degree of variances in the risk","D":"Placement on the risk map"},"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2023-04-06 17:27:00","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1680794820,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"ieQEEpRcykhX4UtKbzGj","answer_ET":"B","exam_id":160,"question_id":1069,"timestamp":"2021-06-02 21:57:00","unix_timestamp":1622663820,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728228480.0","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOf the choices offered, agree with B.","comment_id":"863098","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1695593820.0","poster":"Ceecil1959","content":"Risk Map â€” a graphical depiction of a select number of a company's risks designed to illustrate the impact or significance of risks on one axis and the likelihood or frequency on the other.

These reports help identify the potential risks that may affect the organization's IT environment and provide insight into the types of controls that can be implemented to mitigate those risks.
