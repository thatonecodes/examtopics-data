Greater consistency across the organization:\n\nLikely correct. A top-down approach often involves centralized decision-making and enforcement of policies, which can lead to greater consistency in how IT policies are applied across the organization.\nThe most likely outcome of shifting to a top-down approach is greater consistency across the organization (Option A). However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of this shift will depend on how well the top-down approach is implemented and the quality of the policies that are developed and enforced.","timestamp":"1727495100.0","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1019383"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"A is the Answer top bottom facilitates consistency while bottom up will allow for easy easy risk identification and assessments","timestamp":"1706215080.0","comment_id":"788120","poster":"Joloms"},{"content":"I think A too.","poster":"Tsubasa1234","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1705125960.0","comment_id":"774156"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"question_id":1331,"unix_timestamp":1671459360,"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"C":"a more comprehensive risk assessment plan","A":"greater consistency across the organization","D":"a synthesis of existing operational policies","B":"greater adherence to best practices"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"An organization has shifted from a bottom-up approach to a top-down approach in the development of IT policies.

The media involved is preserved using imaging, and further analysis is performed on the image instead of the original.\n\nPreserving the original media through imaging is a fundamental practice in computer forensics. It ensures the integrity of the evidence by creating a bit-for-bit copy of the original media. This copy (the forensic image) can be analyzed and investigated without altering or damaging the original evidence. This approach helps maintain the chain of custody and ensures that the evidence is legally admissible in court because it proves the integrity and authenticity of the data collected during the investigation.\n\nOption A is not a good approach because securely deleting evidence can lead to the loss of crucial information and may not be legally acceptable.\n\nOption B is a reasonable practice but does not emphasize the importance of preserving the original media through imaging.\n\nOption D is also not a good approach because isolating the computer without proper imaging and evidence preservation can result in potential data loss or contamination.","poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1727495400.0","comment_id":"1019388","upvote_count":"4"}],"choices":{"D":"The computer suspected of storing the evidence is isolated, and the incident response team is contacted for investigation.","B":"The relevant data is extracted from system, firewall, and intrusion detection system (IDS) logs, then consolidated as evidence.","A":"The incident response team reviews and analyzes the evidence, and the evidence file is then securely deleted to avoid further damage.","C":"The media involved is preserved using imaging, and further analysis is performed on the image instead of the original."},"exam_id":156,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-09-28 05:50:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121623-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-883-discussion/","question_id":1334,"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST approach to help ensure evidence from a computer forensics investigation is legally admissible?","answer_description":"","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1695873000},{"id":"S6F1GRpXJeWYJRjFNeAP","choices":{"C":"the development function follows a robust process","D":"the development project is likely to achieve its objectives","A":"effective security requirements have been designed","B":"the development functionâ€™s processes are efficient"},"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1695153780,"question_id":1335,"question_text":"Evaluating application development projects against a defined maturity model enables an IS auditor to determine whether:","timestamp":"2023-09-19 22:03:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121011-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-884-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"poster":"SuperMax","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. the development function follows a robust process\n\nMaturity models, such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), are designed to assess the maturity and effectiveness of processes within an organization, including those related to software development. Evaluating a development project against a maturity model helps determine whether the development function is following a robust and well-defined process, which is a critical aspect of ensuring the success of the project.\n\nWhile the other options (A, B, and D) can also be important factors in evaluating development projects, they are not the primary focus of a maturity model assessment. Effective security requirements (A) may be assessed separately through security audits. The efficiency of development processes (B) can be evaluated, but it's not the primary goal of a maturity model assessment. Whether a development project is likely to achieve its objectives (D) depends on various factors, including project management, but is not the primary focus of a maturity model evaluation.","comment_id":"1019389","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1727495460.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"shiowbah","comments":[{"poster":"shiowbah","upvote_count":"1","content":"C. the development function follows a robust process","comment_id":"1068983","timestamp":"1731464160.0"}],"comment_id":"1011658","timestamp":"1726776180.0","content":"D. the development project is likely to achieve its objectives"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":156,"answer":"C"}],"exam":{"name":"CISA","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":1441,"provider":"Isaca","id":156,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":267},"__N_SSP":true}
