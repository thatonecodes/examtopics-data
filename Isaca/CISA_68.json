Around cooling units\nCooling units are critical components of data centers and IT facilities, and they can be prone to malfunctions or leaks, which could lead to environmental hazards such as overheating, water damage, or fire. Placing detectors around cooling units allows for early detection of any abnormalities or incidents, enabling prompt response and mitigation measures to prevent damage to IT equipment and data loss.","poster":"Akekaraj"},{"poster":"Swallows","comment_id":"1218928","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716719940.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nPlacing environmental detectors above the ceiling may result in delayed detection of heat, water leaks, or smoke, as these detectors may not have direct access to the areas where such incidents typically occur. Heat and smoke tend to rise, while water leaks can originate from overhead pipes or equipment. Placing detectors above the ceiling may lead to delayed or ineffective detection of these environmental hazards, increasing the risk of damage to IT infrastructure and assets.
