Ensuring that the new hardware meets established security standards is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems. It is essential to assess the security features and controls of the hardware to prevent potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors. While options A, C, and D are also important considerations, the security of the hardware should take precedence as it forms the foundation for a secure and reliable IT infrastructure.","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"The PRIMARY concern of an IS auditor in auditing the proposed acquisition of new computer hardware should be whether the new hardware meets established security standards. This is because security is a critical component in any information system and the hardware is an integral part of the system. Therefore, ensuring that the new hardware meets established security standards should be the top priority for an IS auditor. The other options (establishing a business case, including a visible audit trail, and meeting user requirements) are also important, but they are secondary to security concerns.","poster":"NDUBU","timestamp":"1682913720.0","comment_id":"885846","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"AWS56","comment_id":"668406","comments":[{"poster":"Zephaniah","timestamp":"1664123220.0","content":"remember IT must align with business objectives. so A","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"678995"}],"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1663101660.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB, bcos as an auditor- I will be less concerned if a business case has been established and more concerned if the h/w meets the security-standards"}],"exam_id":156},{"id":"hXNzJU2O5p9UwwENdShu","choices":{"A":"Ensure the open issues are retained in the audit results.","D":"Terminate the follow-up because open issues are not resolved.","C":"Evaluate the residual risk due to open issues.","B":"Recommend compensating controls for open issues."},"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","question_images":[],"exam_id":156,"unix_timestamp":1679535780,"question_id":1097,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/103626-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-60-discussion/","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-03-23 02:43:00","answers_community":["C (82%)","A (18%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1683077760.0","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"888056","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhen an auditee is unable to close all audit recommendations by the time of the follow-up audit, the IS auditor's best course of action is to evaluate the residual risk due to open issues.

Whether there is a complete inventory of end-user computing (EUC) spreadsheets. The IS auditor should verify next whether there is a complete inventory of EUC spreadsheets that are being used to generate key financial information. This is because an inventory is the first step to identify and assess the EUC applications that are critical, sensitive or material to the organization’s operations and reporting. An inventory can also help to determine the ownership, location, purpose, frequency of use and update, and dependencies of the EUC spreadsheets.
