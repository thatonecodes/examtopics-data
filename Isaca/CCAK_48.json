Programmers cannot make uncontrolled changes to the source code production version.\n\nThis option is acceptable to a cloud auditor because it indicates that there are controls in place to prevent unauthorized or uncontrolled changes to the production environment. Ensuring that programmers cannot make uncontrolled changes helps maintain the integrity, security, and stability of the production system. This control is essential for protecting against potential errors or malicious activities that could disrupt operations or compromise data.\n\nThe other options present potential issues:\n- A. Hosting development, test, and production environments on the same network can lead to security risks and lack of proper segregation.\n- B. Granting programmers permanent access to production software can increase the risk of unauthorized changes.\n- C. Allowing the Head of Development to approve changes to production without additional oversight may not provide sufficient checks and balances.","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1387512","timestamp":"1741707420.0"},{"poster":"f17907f","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1200187","content":"This question is weird, technically they are all acceptable except for B.","timestamp":"1729600740.0"}],"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"A":"Development, test and production are hosted in the same network environment.","C":"The Head of Development approves changes requested to production.","D":"Programmers cannot make uncontrolled changes to the source code production version.","B":"Programmers have permanent access to production software."},"unix_timestamp":1713789540,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"BlK8cBtBGpu7wHc2T69G","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/94245-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-8-discussion/","question_text":"Organizations maintain mappings between the different control frameworks they adopt to:","unix_timestamp":1673058840,"choices":{"B":"avoid duplication of work when assessing compliance.","A":"help identify controls with common assessment status.","D":"start a compliance assessment using latest assessment.","C":"help identify controls with different assessment status."},"question_id":237,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-01-07 03:34:00","exam_id":153,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. avoid duplication of work when assessing compliance.\n\nMapping between control frameworks allows organizations to identify where controls overlap or align across different standards. This helps streamline the compliance assessment process, making it more efficient by avoiding redundant evaluations of similar or equivalent controls across multiple frameworks. By understanding these relationships, organizations can reduce the effort and resources required to maintain compliance with multiple standards or regulations.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1741525500.0","comment_id":"1371078"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1730879820.0","content":"Avoid Duplication of work ...

The cloud service customer is responsible and accountable for compliance.\n\nIn cloud computing, the responsibility and accountability for compliance primarily lie with the cloud service customer. While the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for ensuring that their infrastructure and services comply with relevant standards and regulations, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that applications, data, and operations within the cloud environment comply with legal and regulatory requirements rests with the cloud customer.
