This helps safeguard the confidentiality of the information even if unauthorized access occurs. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties, it remains unreadable and secure.\n\nWhile options such as applying strong authentication to online accounts (option A), using secure encrypted transport layer (option C), and applying a masking policy to consumer data (option D) are important security practices, encrypting consumer data addresses the core concern of protecting the data itself from unauthorized access or disclosure.","comment_id":"1075466"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Since risk exposure is a measure of possible future loss which may result from an activity or occurrence.
