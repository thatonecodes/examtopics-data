Assign ownership of the risk response plan.\n\nAssigning ownership of the risk response plan is the most effective way to mitigate identified risk scenarios.

They are accountable for developing and implementing the necessary strategies and controls to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.\n\nWhile the other options (documenting risk tolerance, providing awareness in early detection of risk, and performing periodic audits) are important aspects of a comprehensive risk management strategy, they are not as direct or as immediately effective as assigning ownership of the risk response plan.

Assign ownership of the risk response plan.\n\nAssigning ownership of the risk response plan is the most effective way to mitigate identified risk scenarios. Here's why:\n\nAccountability: When a specific individual or team is assigned ownership of a risk response plan, they become accountable for its execution. This ensures that someone is responsible for taking the necessary actions to mitigate the risk.\n\nTimely Action: Ownership helps ensure that actions are taken promptly. Without clear ownership, there may be delays or confusion about who should address the risk.\n\nCoordination: Assigning ownership facilitates coordination and collaboration among relevant stakeholders. It ensures that all parties involved are aligned and working together to mitigate the risk.\n\nMonitoring and Reporting: The owner of the risk response plan is typically responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the controls and reporting on progress to relevant parties, including senior management and risk committees.","timestamp":"1725399660.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","timestamp":"1712659080.0","comment_id":"865429","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1706703300.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBecause assigning ownership of the risk response plan provides accountability and responsibility for mitigating the risk. By having a designated individual or team responsible for the risk response plan, the organization can ensure that the appropriate resources and actions are in place to effectively mitigate the risk. Assigning ownership also helps to ensure that the risk response plan is regularly reviewed and updated, and that the necessary steps are taken to implement it in a timely and effective manner. The other options (documenting the risk tolerance of the organization, providing awareness in early detection of risk, and performing periodic audits on identified risk areas) are also important components of risk management, but assigning ownership is the most effective way to ensure that the risk response plan is executed and monitored effectively.","poster":"Boubou480","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"794107"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704195240.0","comment_id":"763676","poster":"Suchib","content":"its definitely b."},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"agree with B","comment_id":"529736","poster":"Raj1510","timestamp":"1674380820.0"}],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1595827560,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"Perform periodic audits on identified risk areas.","C":"Provide awareness in early detection of risk.","B":"Assign ownership of the risk response plan.","A":"Document the risk tolerance of the organization."},"answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"SX0PIV14WsLKYJRoIxrb","question_text":"Management has required information security awareness training to reduce the risk associated with credential compromise.

Assuring the risk profile supports the IT objectives\n\nThe most important outcome of reviewing the risk management process is to ensure that the risk profile aligns with and supports the organization's IT objectives and broader business goals. Here's why this is the case:\n\nAlignment with Strategic Goals: Effective risk management should be closely aligned with an organization's strategic objectives. It ensures that risks are assessed and managed in a way that supports the achievement of those objectives.\n\nRisk-Informed Decision-Making: An aligned risk profile helps decision-makers understand the potential impact of risks on IT and business operations. It enables informed decision-making that considers risk factors.\n\nResource Allocation: By assuring alignment, organizations can allocate resources more effectively.

Risk ownership is assigned.\n\nThe most important characteristic of an effective risk management program is that risk ownership is assigned. Without clear ownership, it can be challenging to ensure that risks are adequately identified, assessed, and managed. When risk ownership is assigned, individuals or teams are accountable for managing specific risks, which includes developing and implementing risk response plans (Option A), defining key risk indicators (Option B), and mapping controls to key risk scenarios (Option D).","comment_id":"1065530","timestamp":"1731061080.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SuperMax"},{"poster":"01010100","comment_id":"1024934","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Here's why:\n\nFocus on Outcome: Restore failures directly impact an organization's ability to recover critical data and systems in the event of a disaster or data loss incident. Monitoring the number of failures provides insight into whether the backup process is achieving its primary objective: successful data recovery.\n\nIdentifying Issues: Recurring restore failures indicate persistent problems within the backup process. These issues could be related to backup jobs, media, infrastructure, or configuration. By tracking these failures, organizations can pinpoint where improvements or corrective actions are needed.\n\nRisk Mitigation: Reducing the number of restore failures helps mitigate the risk of data loss and system downtime. A lower number of failures indicates a more reliable backup process, which is crucial for business continuity and disaster recovery planning.","comment_id":"997993","timestamp":"1725401220.0","poster":"Staanlee","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1712664780.0","comment_id":"865482","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe question is looking at the number of each of the answers.

The number of backup recovery requests provides a more accurate measure of the backup process's effectiveness because it indicates how often the backup is being used and how well it is functioning. A high number of recovery requests could indicate that the backup process is being used regularly and that it is providing the necessary data in the event of a failure. On the other hand, a low number of recovery requests could indicate that the backup process is not being used frequently, which could be due to a lack of confidence in the backup or a lack of understanding of its purpose. The other KPIs, such as the number of resources to monitor backups, or the number of restoration monitoring reports, may provide useful information, but the number of backup recovery requests is the most effective indicator of the backup process's effectiveness.","poster":"Boubou480"},{"comment_id":"671707","poster":"Cornfuzeled","timestamp":"1694971680.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"C is correct imo.
