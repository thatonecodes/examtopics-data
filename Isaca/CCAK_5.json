This clarity is essential for effective monitoring, management, and enforcement of the SLA terms. While other aspects such as compensation (A), inclusion of operational matters (B), and availability requirements (C) are important, the primary focus should be on ensuring that the SLA is clear, precise, and capable of being measured objectively.

Unsuccessful access attempts being automatically logged for investigation\n\nWhile logging unsuccessful access attempts itself is more of a detective control, it becomes corrective when it leads to actions that address security issues. For example, if the logs indicate a pattern of failed access attempts, they can trigger an investigation and subsequent actions to correct or mitigate potential security vulnerabilities or incidents. This might involve adjusting security configurations, updating access controls, or providing additional training to users.
