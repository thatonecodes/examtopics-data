This involves assessing the organization's current practices and controls against the requirements of the new regulations to identify areas where the organization falls short of compliance. This analysis helps in understanding the extent of the changes required and serves as a foundation for planning the necessary adjustments, including engaging legal counsel, implementing compensating controls, and updating the risk profile.
