This is because it allows for modeling real-world entities and their interactions in a more natural and intuitive way through the use of objects, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. These features facilitate the management and manipulation of data that has intricate interdependencies, making the system more modular, scalable, and maintainable. Why not A.? While OOSD can improve code readability and maintainability, the initial coding effort might be higher compared to simpler procedural languages.","timestamp":"1717309500.0","poster":"46080f2","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709352420.0","poster":"akosigengen","content":"D. is the answer also.","comment_id":"1163910"},{"timestamp":"1683872700.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","poster":"Pakawat","comment_id":"895693"},{"timestamp":"1682749320.0","comment_id":"884080","content":"Selected Answer: D\nd is answer","poster":"3008","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"saado9","comment_id":"873016","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1681757880.0","content":"D is correct"}],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1681757880,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-17 20:58:00","answer":"D","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"3thkvmQJ5lton4ixsSnu","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":156,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1662393600,"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Business impact analysis (BIA)","B":"Risk control matrix","C":"Risk assessment","A":"Fieldwork"},"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/80383-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-249-discussion/","question_id":707,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"12","poster":"MunaM","timestamp":"1662405660.0","comment_id":"660493","content":"Answer should be C"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRisk assessment step involves identifying and evaluating risks to the organization's assets and operations.
