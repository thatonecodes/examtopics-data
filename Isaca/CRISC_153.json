Original cost to acquire \nDuring the risk assessment process, which occurs before an incident, it is indeed appropriate to use the asset value from the Asset Management System (AMS) for impact assessment. Hereâ€™s how this aligns with your points: \n- Pre-Incident Evaluation: Since risk assessments are performed proactively, the asset value in the AMS provides a useful reference point for estimating the potential financial impact of losing an asset. It helps establish the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) and assess the overall risk associated with various assets.\n-Budgeting and Resource Allocation: Using the asset value allows organizations to prioritize risks and allocate resources accordingly, understanding which assets pose the most significant financial exposure.\n-Historical Context: The asset value reflects historical investment and provides context for evaluating risks, especially if the value is regularly updated to account for depreciation or changes in market conditions.","comment_id":"1304283","poster":"somkiatr","timestamp":"1730173560.0"}],"answer_description":"The monetary value of the server should be based on the cost of its replacement. However, the financial impact to the enterprise may be much broader, based on the function that the server performs for the business and the value it brings to the enterprise.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB, C, D: Cost of software is not been counted because it can be restored from the back-up media. On the other hand' Ale for all risk related to the server does not represent the server's value. Lastly, the original cost may be significantly different from the current cost and, therefore, not relevant to this.","exam_id":160,"answers_community":[],"question_id":761},{"id":"abkzDCUXSEeUVEGkWK1F","timestamp":"2024-05-26 08:06:00","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/141270-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-316-discussion/","question_id":762,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732608360.0","content":"C.

If hiring the vendor is simply a means to better prepare the project to realize the savings (by improving project management practices), then it is more about exploiting the opportunity.
