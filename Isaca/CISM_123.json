Risk management is built into operational and strategic activities\n\nThe effectiveness of an information security governance framework will best be enhanced if risk management is built into operational and strategic activities. This means that the organization considers and manages information security risks as part of its day-to-day operations and decision-making processes. When risk management is integrated into organizational activities, it becomes a fundamental part of the organization's culture, and not just an isolated function. This allows the organization to more effectively identify, evaluate, and mitigate information security risks, and to align its information security efforts with its overall business goals and objectives.","timestamp":"1706210160.0"},{"comment_id":"772521","upvote_count":"2","poster":"MyKasala","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI guess D","timestamp":"1704978060.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1702880760.0","poster":"aokisan","content":"Selected Answer: B\naudit will enhance framework.","comment_id":"748631"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":157,"unix_timestamp":1671344760,"choices":{"C":"a culture of legal and regulatory compliance is promoted by management","D":"risk management is built into operational and strategic activities","A":"consultants review the information security governance framework","B":"IS auditors are empowered to evaluate governance activities"},"topic":"1"},{"id":"T5jOIKxwA3IfZ0bPQENR","choices":{"B":"Conduct a gap analysis","C":"Update the current risk register","D":"Revise the business continuity plan (BCP)","A":"Reassess management's risk appetite"},"question_id":615,"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":157,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1684002060,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/109176-exam-cism-topic-1-question-429-discussion/","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following should be an information security manager's FIRST course of action when developing an incident management and response plan?","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nRisk appetite defines desired state. \nThe question is about FIRST, A is the best answer.\nIf question is most IMPORTANT, then B is the answer","comment_id":"1167602","timestamp":"1725666600.0","poster":"xcjxcj","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1724837160.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Salilgen","comment_id":"1161557","content":"Selected Answer: B\nFrom AIO 2nd ed. pag. 414 \"Prior to the development of a security incident response plan, the security manager must determine the current state of the organizationâ€™s incident response capabilities, as well as the desired end state (for example, a completed security incident response plan with specific capabilities and characteristics).

Conduct a gap analysis\n\nConducting a gap analysis involves assessing the current state of your organization's security posture and identifying the gaps or weaknesses in your incident management and response capabilities. This analysis helps you understand where you are currently and where you need to be in terms of incident readiness. Once you have a clear understanding of these gaps, you can then proceed to address them by updating the risk register, revising the business continuity plan (BCP), and reassessing management's risk appetite as needed. However, identifying and addressing these gaps is a crucial starting point to ensure that your incident management and response plan is comprehensive and effective.","poster":"oluchecpoint","timestamp":"1709786760.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1001117"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe gap analysis helps identify the existing capabilities and the desired state of incident management and response within the organization","poster":"Agamennore","timestamp":"1708867860.0","comment_id":"989996"},{"poster":"AaronS1990","timestamp":"1707140820.0","content":"Surely he'd reasses the appetite and then do the gap analysis...","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"972967"},{"timestamp":"1703737380.0","content":"B.
