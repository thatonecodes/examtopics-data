Bottom-up approach\n\nWhen developing technical risk scenarios, especially for a specific system such as an ERP, a bottom-up approach is typically more effective. This approach begins at the technical or operational level and moves upward. It involves a detailed examination of the system components, interactions, vulnerabilities, and threats specific to that system. The bottom-up approach ensures that the unique technical intricacies and risks of the system are taken into consideration.\n\nIn contrast, a top-down approach begins at the strategic or high-level perspective and moves downward. It's more focused on broader organizational goals and strategies.\n\nA cause-and-effect diagram, while useful for understanding the relationship between different factors, isn't the primary tool for scenario development.\n\nThe Delphi technique is a forecasting method based on the results of multiple rounds of questionnaires sent to a panel of experts.
