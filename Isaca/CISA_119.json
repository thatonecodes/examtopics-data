This recommendation jeopardizes security by eliminating audit trails, risks non-compliance with regulatory requirements, and undermines the ability to monitor and improve IT service delivery - the very goal of the reengineering effort. The CISA Manual supports this conclusion with findings such as: \"Operational logging is crucial for monitoring system performance, detecting anomalies, and ensuring security\" (Page 4) and \"Disabling logs could lead to non-compliance with regulations and standards that require logging\" (Page 4). The other options, while carrying risks, do not pose the same level of immediate, direct threat to the IT environment’s integrity and compliance."}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Eliminate certain reports and key performance indicators (KPIs).","C":"Delegate business decisions to the chief risk officer (CRO).","B":"Adopt a service delivery model based on insights from peer organizations.","A":"Disable operational logging to enhance the processing speed and save storage."},"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-03-13 11:21:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_id":594,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/168988-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1789-discussion/","answer_description":""},{"id":"PTIxobeK2wjdwixuH9MC","timestamp":"2022-10-09 14:55:00","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":595,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/84855-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-179-discussion/","isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (80%)","C (20%)"],"answer":"D","question_text":"Reviewing project plans and status reports throughout the development life cycle will:","unix_timestamp":1665320100,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"eliminate the need to perform a risk assessment.","D":"facilitate the optimal use of resources over the life of the project.","C":"guarantee that the project will meet its intended deliverables.","B":"postpone documenting the project's progress until the final phase."},"answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer: D\nWhile Option C reviewing project plans and status reports can contribute to ensuring that the project meets its intended deliverables, it does not guarantee this outcome.\nOption D is the correct choice because ongoing review allows for adjustments to resource allocation, identification of potential issues, and timely resolution of challenges, ensuring that resources are utilized efficiently and effectively.","poster":"a84n","comment_id":"1202479","timestamp":"1729931700.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe goal of the project status report is to keep all parties informed of progress, mitigate problems before they occur, and ensure that the project will land within the specified time frame.","timestamp":"1728387060.0","comment_id":"1191553","poster":"Swallows"},{"timestamp":"1708287300.0","poster":"cidigi","comment_id":"984724","content":"C is rejected due to the word Guarantee.
