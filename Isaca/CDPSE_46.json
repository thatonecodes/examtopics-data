Encryption would make the packets unreadable, but not stop the use of a sniffer. IDS would be more effective in detecting the use of a sniffer, which could then be blocked. Segmentation is a good practice, but does not stop a sniffer. If it asked about what protects against the successful exploitation of a sniffer, then you could answer.","poster":"johnH123","timestamp":"1704032100.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1110631","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"821bbab","content":"Indeed, TLS protects against network sniffers.","timestamp":"1728387180.0","comment_id":"1294696"}]},{"comment_id":"731972","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt should be using encryption.
