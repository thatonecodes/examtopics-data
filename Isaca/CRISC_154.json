Importance of risk\nWhile all the options are relevant, the most important parameter for selecting an appropriate risk response is the importance of the risk. This is determined by its potential impact on project objectives and the likelihood of occurrence. High-priority risks (those with significant impact and likelihood) require more immediate and robust responses, regardless of cost or implementation complexity.\n\nA.

By considering the cost of response, it is decided whether or not benefits of applying response is greater than accepting the risk; and according to this analysis it is decided whether the certain response should be applied or not. For example, if risk transfer response is applied by using insurance, then cost would be the cost of insurance.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: This parameter is considered after analyzing the cost of response, which will further decide the level of sophistication of risk response. The enterprise's capability to implement the response means that if the risk management process is mature then the risk response is more\nC: This is one of the parameters that is considered but is not as important as considering cost of response. The importance of the risk is determined by the combination of likelihood and magnitude levels along with its position on the risk map.\nD: Efficiency of response can only be analyzed after applying the response.
