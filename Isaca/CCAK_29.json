Risk of reduced visibility and control\n\nIn a multi-cloud environment, an organization uses services from multiple cloud providers, which can result in reduced visibility and control over its data and resources. Managing and monitoring various services across different platforms can be challenging, increasing the complexity of maintaining consistent security policies, compliance measures, and overall governance. This can lead to potential gaps in security and oversight, making reduced visibility and control a specific risk associated with multi-cloud environments.","timestamp":"1743175320.0"},{"comment_id":"1299744","timestamp":"1729268700.0","poster":"339dfab","upvote_count":"1","content":"B is the right answer."}],"question_id":144,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1729268700,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Risk of supply chain visibility and validation","D":"Risk of unauthorized access to customer and business data","B":"Risk of reduced visibility and control","C":"Risk of service reliability and uptime"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/149754-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-233-discussion/","exam_id":153,"question_text":"Which of the following types of risk is associated specifically with the use of multi-cloud environments in an organization?"},{"id":"EFN2ZOEhf0jUSrUQsRBm","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Market share and geolocation are aspects PRIMARILY related to:","choices":{"B":"cloud perspective.","A":"business perspective.","D":"governance perspective.","C":"risk perspective."},"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/149755-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-234-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-10-18 18:38:00","topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_id":145,"discussion":[{"poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1411340","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743175380.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. business perspective.\n\nMarket share and geolocation are primarily related to the business perspective because they concern the strategic positioning and competitive aspects of a company's operations.
