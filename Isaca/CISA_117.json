This aligns with the cyclical nature of the risk management life cycle (identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring), which is depicted as iterative rather than phase-limited.\nOptions A, B, and C are phase-specific and inconsistent with the emphasis on continuous monitoring in the CISA framework.

Key reasons supporting this choice include: Continuous Monitoring: New risks may emerge at any stage (e.g., design, execution, closure), and existing risks may change in impact or likelihood. A one-time update during specific phases (Options A, B, or C) would fail to address dynamic risk environments. \nProactive Mitigation: Regular updates enable timely adjustments to risk responses, reducing the likelihood of project delays or failures.\n\nAlignment with Standards: Best practices, such as those outlined in frameworks like PMBOK or ISO 31000, emphasize that risk registers should be updated iteratively across all project phases.","poster":"46080f2","comment_id":"1366313","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741361460.0"}],"timestamp":"2025-03-07 16:31:00","choices":{"C":"At the end of each phase of the project","A":"During the design phase of the project","B":"During the planning phase of the project","D":"Throughout the lifetime of the project"},"question_id":585,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/157706-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1780-discussion/","exam_id":156,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"To ensure the effectiveness of project risk management, when should the project risk register be reviewed and updated?","answer":"D"}],"exam":{"provider":"Isaca","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"id":156,"name":"CISA","numberOfQuestions":1441,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":117},"__N_SSP":true}
