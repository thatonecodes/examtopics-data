Stakeholders should customize COBIT guidance to align with their specific enterprise needs, industry best practices, and organizational context. Customization allows organizations to derive the maximum benefit from COBIT by tailoring it to their specific governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) requirements. Option A is also partially correct, as customization can involve incorporating industry best practices when relevant. However, option B emphasizes the importance of aligning COBIT with an organization's specific needs. Option C, on the other hand, suggests rigidly following COBIT guidance without alterations, which may not be the best approach for all organizations.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1709863560.0"}],"answer_ET":"B"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":124,"name":"COBIT 2019","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":158,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Isaca"},"currentPage":2},"__N_SSP":true}
