When these KPIs are approved by stakeholders, they reflect the organization's strategic priorities and risk appetite.

A risk management framework will MOST effectively align IT controls with corporate risk tolerance. A risk management framework is a systematic and structured approach to managing risks that includes the development of policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate and manage risk. It provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to managing risks across the organization and enables the organization to align its risk management efforts with its overall corporate strategy and risk tolerance. A risk management framework can also provide a consistent approach to risk management across different business units and departments, helping to ensure that IT controls are aligned with the organization's overall risk tolerance. Benchmarks against industry leading practices, internal policies approved by stakeholders, and key performance indicators (KPIs) approved by stakeholders are all important components of a comprehensive risk management program, but they do not provide the same level of alignment with corporate risk tolerance as a risk management framework.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"858397","poster":"Koulyo","timestamp":"1712019360.0"},{"comment_id":"820339","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrection, reason:\nInternal policies approved by stakeholders establish the expectations and requirements for managing risk within an organization. These policies provide guidance on the appropriate controls to implement to manage risks, as well as the consequences of non-compliance.\n\nBy aligning IT controls with internal policies approved by stakeholders, IT functions can ensure that they are following the organization's risk management framework and that their controls are consistent with the organization's risk tolerance. This helps to ensure that the IT controls are focused on the most critical risks facing the organization and are appropriate for the organization's risk appetite.\n\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) approved by stakeholders can be a useful tool for monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of IT controls. However, KPIs alone may not be sufficient to align IT controls with corporate risk tolerance. KPIs are typically focused on specific metrics or goals and may not provide the broader context needed to ensure that IT controls are aligned with the organization's overall risk management framework.","timestamp":"1708769880.0","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1708345560.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree.","comment_id":"814055","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2023-02-19 13:26:00","exam_id":160,"answer_description":"","answer":"B","question_text":"Which of the following will MOST effectively align IT controls with corporate risk tolerance?","choices":{"C":"Key performance indicators (KPIs) approved by stakeholders","D":"Risk management framework","B":"Internal policies approved by stakeholders","A":"Benchmarks against industry leading practices"},"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (67%)","C (33%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/99928-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1042-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1676809560,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":48},{"id":"thrmPXmfGqK2EuJMxNaD","question_text":"Which of the following is MOST likely to be impacted as a result of a new policy which allows staff members to remotely connect to the organization's IT systems via personal or public computers?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C.
