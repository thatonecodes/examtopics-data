It correlates this log data and produces security alerts when actionable security-related activities are taking place. An organization without a SIEM may have little way of knowing whether security incidents such as break-ins are occurring. Similarly, an organization with a SIEM that is not well maintained may also have many blind spots and may be unaware of incidents occurring in its environment.\"","poster":"Jess20","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716762000.0","comment_id":"1081089"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716222840.0","content":"D.
