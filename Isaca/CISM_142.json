Risk assessment is the most important input to assist the information security steering committee in making a decision on whether to approve the implementation of a key control. This is because a risk assessment will provide the committee with a clear understanding of the potential risks and impacts that the key control is intended to address, as well as the potential costs and benefits of the proposed solution. This information is critical in determining whether the key control is a necessary and appropriate measure to address the identified risks, and whether the costs of implementation outweigh the benefits.","poster":"Broesweelies","timestamp":"1674842580.0","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"789867"},{"timestamp":"1728928140.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD, as business case includes A, B, C","comment_id":"1297764","poster":"ServerBrain"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1156199","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBelow from chatgpt\nQ: Business case is the most important input to assist the information security steering committee in making a decision on whether to approve the implementation of a key control\nA: The business case is indeed a critical input for the Information Security Steering Committee when deciding whether to approve the implementation of a key control. It helps the committee understand the rationale behind the proposed control, including its potential benefits, costs, and impact on the organization. The business case should clearly outline the problem or risk the control aims to address, the proposed solution, the expected outcomes, and how the control aligns with the organization's overall business objectives and risk management strategy. This information is essential for the committee to make an informed decision that balances security needs with business priorities.","poster":"xcjxcj","timestamp":"1708585800.0"},{"timestamp":"1694098260.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1001670","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption D","poster":"oluchecpoint"},{"poster":"AaronS1990","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSteering committee is more interested in the business' direction than it is Risk assessments.

This allows the committee to assess the business case alongside other factors, such as risk assessment, IT strategy, and security architecture, in order to make an informed decision.\n\nSo I think Option D"},{"poster":"Tsubasa1234","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD business case is most important. There are costs associated with implementing key controls, and management must approve them. Therefore, the business case submitted by the information security team is critical information to explain the balance of cost, return, and risk, and to convince management of its importance. However, the security architecture and risk assessment are also important information and must be provided along with the business case.\nWhile the C risk assessment is undoubtedly important information for implementing key controls, it is not necessarily the most important information for the Information Security Steering Committee to decide upon. In fact, the information the committee needs to make decisions depends on the purpose, authority, and scope for which the committee was established.","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1680815340.0","comment_id":"863323"},{"comment_id":"843215","poster":"CarlLimps","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Perform a business impact analysis (BIA) should be the first step that a global information security manager should take when informed that a new regulation with significant impact will go into effect soon. The BIA is an essential step in evaluating the impact of new regulations on the organization's operations and objectives. It will help to identify the specific areas of the organization that will be affected by the new regulation, and to assess the potential financial, operational and reputational risks associated with non-compliance. With this information, the information security manager can then develop a plan to ensure compliance with the new regulation, and to mitigate any risks associated with it.

Ambiguous severity criteria will have the most negative impact to the effectiveness of incident response processes. This is because having ambiguous severity criteria can lead to confusion and inconsistent decisions about how to prioritize and respond to different incidents. This can result in important incidents being overlooked or not receiving the appropriate level of attention and resources, while less critical incidents are given excessive attention. Clear and well-defined severity criteria are essential for effective incident response, as they provide a consistent framework for assessing the urgency and importance of different incidents and determining an appropriate response.","poster":"Broesweelies","upvote_count":"6"},{"poster":"richck102","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1719625440.0","comment_id":"937345","content":"C.

Performing a risk assessment\n\nPerforming a risk assessment would provide a newly appointed information security manager with the BEST view of the organization's existing security posture. A risk assessment involves identifying and evaluating potential risks and vulnerabilities within the organization's systems, processes, and assets. This process provides insight into the current state of security, helps prioritize security measures, and informs the development of a comprehensive security strategy. It often includes reviewing policies and procedures, but it goes beyond that by assessing the actual risks and vulnerabilities in the organization's environment.
