Stop-or-go sampling.\nIn stop-or-go sampling, the auditor examines each item in the sample sequentially. If an error is discovered at any point during the examination, the sampling process stops, and the auditor investigates further to determine the cause of the error and potentially take corrective action. In this method, the entire sample is deemed irregular if any errors are detected, regardless of the sample size or the proportion of errors within the sample.\n\nIn contrast, the other sampling methods mentioned have different characteristics:\nA. Discovery sampling involves examining items until a specific number of errors are found or until a predetermined amount of time or resources are expended.","timestamp":"1714972800.0"},{"comment_id":"1190493","poster":"MJORGER","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Discovery sampling\n\nDiscovery sampling is used when the auditor’s objective is to find at least one instance of an occurrence. In this method, if a single error is found, it’s assumed that there may be more errors in the population, and the entire sample is considered irregular. This method is often used when the expected error rate is very low, but the presence of even a single error is significant.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712420280.0"},{"comment_id":"1162588","timestamp":"1709212980.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bisibaby"},{"timestamp":"1708178580.0","comment_id":"1152583","poster":"Sibsankar","upvote_count":"1","content":"A is right.\nDiscovery sampling: This method is primarily used to detect fraud or other irregularities.

In the context of disbursing money to various banks, a digital signature provides strong assurance that the transaction is legitimate and has not been tampered with during transmission.\n\nWhen a digital signature is applied to a transaction, it indicates that the sender (in this case, the organization disbursing the money) has signed the transaction using their private key, thereby authenticating the sender's identity and ensuring that the transaction has not been altered. The recipient (the bank) can verify the digital signature using the sender's public key, confirming the authenticity and integrity of the transaction."},{"poster":"a84n","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNonrepudiation ensures that the sender of a message cannot deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message.","timestamp":"1714973580.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1207187"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1190501","timestamp":"1712421000.0","poster":"MJORGER","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Enterprise Architecture provides a holistic view of an organization's IT landscape, including its goals, objectives, processes, systems, and technology infrastructure. By analyzing the enterprise architecture, an IS auditor can assess how the planned IT budget aligns with the organization's strategic objectives. They can identify areas where the budget allocation supports or deviates from the goals and make recommendations for adjustments if necessary.\n\nWhile audit recommendations, risk assessment reports, and business impact analysis (BIA) are also valuable in the audit process, they are more focused on specific areas of audit scope rather than providing a comprehensive view of the IT budget alignment with the organization's goals and strategic objectives."}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1703485980,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is MOST helpful to an IS auditor reviewing the alignment of planned IT budget with the organization's goals and strategic objectives?","answer":"A","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Business impact analysis (BIA)","C":"Risk assessment report","B":"Audit recommendations","A":"Enterprise architecture (EA)"},"timestamp":"2023-12-25 07:33:00","question_id":310,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/129310-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1348-discussion/","exam_id":156}],"exam":{"name":"CISA","numberOfQuestions":1441,"isMCOnly":true,"id":156,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"provider":"Isaca","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":62},"__N_SSP":true}
