These exercises help test and validate the effectiveness of the incident response process in a controlled and collaborative environment. They allow participants to practice their roles, identify weaknesses or gaps in the process, and improve coordination among different teams. Furthermore, tabletop exercises provide an opportunity to refine and update the incident response plan based on the lessons learned during the simulation.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D are important aspects of maintaining an effective incident response process, tabletop exercises go beyond documentation updates, training, or reporting incidents. They provide a real-world simulation that can help identify and address issues that may not become apparent through other means. Therefore, option A is the most comprehensive and proactive approach to ensuring the effectiveness of the cybersecurity incident response process.","comment_id":"1018496","poster":"SuperMax"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121530-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-840-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST way for management to ensure the effectiveness of the cybersecurity incident response process?","unix_timestamp":1695793500,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Periodic update of incident response process documentation","C":"Periodic cybersecurity training for staff involved in incident response","D":"Periodic reporting of cybersecurity incidents to key stakeholders","A":"Periodic tabletop exercises involving key stakeholders"}},{"id":"RHZsmrZXe1rREKa168js","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","exam_id":156,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1683048600,"question_text":"When reviewing a project to replace multiple manual data entry systems with an artificial intelligence (Al) system, the IS auditor should be MOST concerned with the impact Al will have on:","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"task capacity output","D":"employee retention","B":"enterprise architecture (EA).","A":"future task updates."},"question_id":1299,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/108307-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-841-discussion/","answer":"B","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727415960.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. enterprise architecture (EA).\n Implementing AI systems can have significant implications for the overall enterprise architecture. AI systems often require integration with existing systems, data sources, and processes. Changes to the enterprise architecture may be necessary to accommodate the AI system's requirements.
