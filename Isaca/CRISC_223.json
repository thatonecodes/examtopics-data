Here's why:\n\nEstablishing a Starting Point: A baseline assessment provides an initial snapshot of the organization's current control environment. It helps in understanding where the organization stands in terms of control maturity. Without this baseline assessment, it's challenging to measure progress or identify areas for improvement.\n\nIdentifying Strengths and Weaknesses: The baseline assessment helps identify both the strengths and weaknesses of the control environment. It allows the organization to pinpoint areas where controls are effective and areas where improvements are needed.\n\nPrioritizing Improvement Efforts: Once the baseline assessment is complete, the organization can prioritize its efforts based on the findings. It can focus on improving controls in areas where maturity is low and allocate resources accordingly.","comment_id":"997952","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGoing with D.","timestamp":"1712637480.0","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"865277"},{"comment_id":"861627","poster":"Koulyo","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe FIRST step that an organization should take to assess the maturity of its internal control environment would be to conduct a baseline assessment.\n\nA baseline assessment involves conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the organization's current control environment, including the design and operation of its controls.
