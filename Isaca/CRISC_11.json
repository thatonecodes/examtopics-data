This consistency in understanding will enable the organization to prioritize and focus on the most significant risks that require attention, based on a clear understanding of the relative levels of risk across the organization. Assigning risk to the appropriate owners, allocating available resources, and expressing risk in quantifiable terms are also important benefits of using a consistent risk ranking methodology, but they all depend on having a clear understanding of the level of risk associated with each activity or process.","comment_id":"858394","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712018940.0","poster":"Koulyo"},{"comment_id":"814062","timestamp":"1708345920.0","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe most significant benefit of using a consistent risk ranking methodology across an organization is that it enables a clear understanding of risk levels.\n\nA consistent risk ranking methodology ensures that risks are evaluated and ranked using the same criteria and definitions across the organization, which promotes a common understanding of the relative significance of different risks.
