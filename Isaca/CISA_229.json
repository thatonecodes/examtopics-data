When you first roll out phishing training this number will drop fast, perhaps from a 20% click rate to less than 2% click rate for more basic phishing templates. Once you are at around 2-3% click rate you may need to start using more difficult / targeted phishing templates. Most phishing vendors support a tiered approach enabling you to use different categories of phishing difficulty. Remember, your goal is not a 0% click rate, as once you hit 2% or less click rate with basic, beginner level phishing lures, your first-time clickers are primarily new hires, and this is a training event for them."}],"unix_timestamp":1688745420,"answer":"C","exam_id":156,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"An organization conducted an exercise to test the security awareness level of users by sending an email offering a cash reward to those who click on a link embedded in the body of the email.
