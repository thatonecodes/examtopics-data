Data minimization involves limiting the collection and storage of personal information to only what is necessary for the intended purpose. When implementing APIs, it is crucial to ensure that only the minimum required data is exposed or queried, reducing the potential impact in case of a security breach or unauthorized access.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"FAGFUR"}],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":71,"answer_description":"","question_text":"To mitigate the risk of exposing data through application programming interface (API) queries, which of the following design considerations is MOST important?","exam_id":156,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/126033-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1061-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Data minimization","B":"Data integrity","A":"Data quality","D":"Data retention"},"answer":"C","topic":"1"},{"id":"2ravYtB4bqhUG1AeoxrP","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-10-01 08:42:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/122010-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1062-discussion/","answers_community":["A (38%)","C (38%)","B (25%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. It increases the likelihood of selecting material items from the population.\n\nMonetary unit sampling is a statistical sampling method used in auditing. This method involves treating each dollar (or other monetary unit) in a population of transactions as a separate sampling unit. The key advantage of this approach is that it inherently increases the likelihood of selecting higher-value items (which are often the most material) for testing. This is because larger transactions comprise more monetary units and thus have a higher probability of being selected in the sample.

One of its advantages is that it allows for the segregation and separate auditing of large-value items. This can be beneficial because large-value items may have a significant impact on financial statements and financial statements' overall accuracy and reliability. By segregating and auditing these large-value items separately, auditors can give special attention to high-risk areas and ensure they are accurately represented in the financial statements.","poster":"SuperMax"}],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"A":"large-value population items are segregated and audited separately.","D":"results are stated in terms of the frequency of items in error.","B":"it can easily be applied manually when computer resources are not available.","C":"it increases the likelihood of selecting material items from the population."},"question_text":"One advantage of monetary unit sampling is the fact that","unix_timestamp":1696142520,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":72,"topic":"1","exam_id":156},{"id":"Ho86VI63HjrU4TZ24EpG","choices":{"C":"Corrective","A":"Compensating","B":"Directive","D":"Detective"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"960304","timestamp":"1721728140.0","content":"agree with you","poster":"JONESKA"}],"poster":"Peter_CISA","comment_id":"872252","content":"Answer is C, because ISACA CISA Review Book section 1 said it","timestamp":"1713313920.0"},{"comment_id":"1022060","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt's a corrective control in ISMS (Information Security Management Systems).\n\nControls serve a security objective and modify either the likelihood of occurrence or the amount of damage done.\n\nA backup does not prevent the loss of data due to an attack or a technical failure.
