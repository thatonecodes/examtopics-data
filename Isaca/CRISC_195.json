Quantitative.\n\nThe most important attribute of a key risk indicator (KRI) is that it is \"D. Quantitative.\" Key risk indicators are metrics used to provide quantifiable information about the likelihood or magnitude of a potential risk. They should offer a numerical value that allows for objective assessment and comparison. Quantitative KRIs provide clear and measurable insights into the risk's status, which is crucial for effective risk management and decision-making.\n\nWhile the other attributes (repeatable, qualitative, automated) are relevant to the development and use of KRIs, being able to quantify risk through quantitative measures is fundamental for accurate risk assessment and analysis.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"991097","timestamp":"1708996440.0"},{"poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1696162020.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA , just A.","comment_id":"857875"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree.","comment_id":"817184","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1692645600.0","poster":"john_boogieman"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1658103660.0","content":"A is right answer","comment_id":"526248","poster":"Raj1510"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"A who answers these q'z my ninja","timestamp":"1657749540.0","poster":"VirginiaJessamine","comment_id":"523202"},{"poster":"Rajaji","comment_id":"407669","timestamp":"1642324980.0","content":"Answer is A - Page No 174 - CRISC Manual - Repeatableâ€”A KRI must be repeatable and able to be measured on a regular basis to show trends and patterns in activity and results.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"content":"What is R4-102?
