The number of reported security incidents.\n\nExplanation: The number of reported security incidents provides the best measurement of the effectiveness of a security awareness program. An effective security awareness program aims to educate employees and users about security best practices, policies, and procedures. When users are more aware of security risks and how to respond to them, they are more likely to report suspicious activities or potential security incidents.","timestamp":"1724306340.0","comment_id":"987126"},{"timestamp":"1718802240.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"karanvp","comment_id":"927512","content":"I think C is not a correct answer; C may be correct answer if ask to measure the effectiveness of Security Response Program.
