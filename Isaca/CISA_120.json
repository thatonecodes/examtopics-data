Management schedules an annual tabletop exercise. This is because testing directly assesses the DRP’s effectiveness, ensuring it can be executed successfully. The CISA Review Manual supports this in Section 4.16.5: “Testing… validates the contents of the IT DRP” (page 343), making it the strongest indicator of preparedness. While updating the plan (Option D) is a close contender, testing encompasses validation and can trigger updates, giving it precedence in assessing overall effectiveness.","timestamp":"1741862100.0"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/168990-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1792-discussion/","question_id":598,"answer":"C","exam_id":156,"answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"d37OgN9lH9zpgSObbAaV","question_text":"A post-implementation audit has been completed for the deployment of a sophisticated job scheduling tool.

The IT team accesses the scheduler admin panel via a generic account.
