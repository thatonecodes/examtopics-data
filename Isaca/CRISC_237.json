The organization's information security risk profile.\n\nThe MOST important topic to cover in a risk awareness training program for all staff is the organization's information security risk profile. This is critical because it provides employees with an understanding of the specific risks that the organization faces and the potential impact of those risks on the business. When employees are aware of these risks, they are better equipped to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to protect sensitive information and mitigate risks.\n\nWhile topics like roles and responsibilities, policy compliance, and incident reporting are also important, they are often covered in more specialized training sessions or materials. Understanding the organization's risk profile sets the foundation for all other risk-related knowledge and helps employees recognize their role in managing and mitigating risks effectively.","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"1001953","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"871036","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1713195180.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWholly agree it is B."},{"timestamp":"1712186820.0","comment_id":"860444","content":"oh yeah.

Assess gaps in IT risk management operations and strategic focus.\n\nThe PRIMARY objective for requiring an independent review of an organization's IT risk management process should be to assess gaps in IT risk management operations and strategic focus. Independent reviews are typically conducted to provide an objective evaluation of the effectiveness and maturity of an organization's risk management processes. This includes identifying areas where the organization may have operational deficiencies, strategic misalignment, or opportunities for improvement.\n\nWhile ensuring focus on mitigating potential risk, expressing risk in terms of business impact, and verifying implemented controls are important aspects of IT risk management, the primary objective of an independent review is to evaluate the overall state of the IT risk management process and identify areas for enhancement or correction.","comment_id":"1001961"},{"poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713196980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with C.","comment_id":"871058"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Koulyo","comment_id":"860439","timestamp":"1712186580.0","content":"C because: An independent review of an organization's IT risk management process involves a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of IT risk management practices, policies, and procedures.
