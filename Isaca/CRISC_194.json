A process to remove employee access during the exit interview is implemented.\n\nThe best method to ensure a terminated employee's access to IT systems is revoked upon departure from the organization is to \"B. Implement a process to remove employee access during the exit interview.\" This approach involves integrating the termination process with the IT access management process, ensuring that access is revoked as part of the formal exit procedures. By addressing access removal during the exit interview, you can promptly and reliably revoke access when an employee leaves the organization.\n\nWhile the other options (reconciling login attempts, HR system automatically revoking access, generating a list for reconciliation) can contribute to access management, they might not be as direct and effective as implementing a process during the exit interview to ensure that access removal is an integral part of the employee departure process.","comment_id":"991092","poster":"Staanlee"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702150680.0","comment_id":"919502","poster":"mraiyan","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhy \"C\" ? are we assuming that all systems are integrated with HR system ? or HR system is an authentication system for other systems (SSO).

Deriving scenarios from these policies ensures that the scenarios are relevant, aligned with the organization's goals, and based on recognized best practices.\n\nWhile the other options (gathering scenarios from senior management, benchmarking against industry peers, mapping scenarios to a recognized risk management framework) can provide valuable input, deriving scenarios from IT risk policies and standards directly ties the risk scenarios to the organization's specific IT risk management framework and ensures that they address the unique challenges and requirements of the organization's IT environment.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"991095"},{"timestamp":"1717955700.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree \"D\" referring to ISO 31000 or similar is better (even that some domains of the framework are not applicable in the organization) but the framework is globally recognized for all industries and comprehensive.

Map scenarios to a recognized risk management framework\n\nMapping scenarios to a recognized risk management framework is the best approach when creating a comprehensive set of IT risk scenarios. A risk management framework provides a structured and systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and managing IT risks. It helps ensure that all relevant risks are considered, and the scenarios are aligned with industry best practices and standards. Additionally, using a recognized framework helps promote a consistent approach to risk management across the organization.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"842534"},{"comment_id":"821114","timestamp":"1708827540.0","poster":"aki","content":"Selected Answer: B\nderiving scenarios from IT risk policies and standards can help ensure that the scenarios align with the organization's overall risk management framework and objectives. By using the organization's existing policies and standards as a foundation, the resulting scenarios will be tailored to the organization's unique risks and vulnerabilities.\n\nMapping scenarios to a recognized risk management framework (option D) is a good practice, but it may not capture all of the unique risks and vulnerabilities specific to the organization. The organization's own policies and standards should be the starting point for creating a comprehensive set of IT risk scenarios, and then these can be mapped to a recognized framework as needed.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"572742","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1679469480.0","content":"IT risk affects the entire business, not just IT policies","poster":"bltino"},{"timestamp":"1649370180.0","poster":"Khy","content":"why not b?","comment_id":"330748","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST approach to use when creating a comprehensive set of IT risk scenarios?","answers_community":["D (57%)","B (29%)","14%"],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/49554-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-560-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Benchmark scenarios against industry peers","B":"Derive scenarios from IT risk policies and standards","D":"Map scenarios to a recognized risk management framework","A":"Gather scenarios from senior management"},"unix_timestamp":1617834180,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-04-08 00:23:00"},{"id":"7ketfRAZ9A8AaugaSW7h","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-21 22:18:00","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"mraiyan","comment_id":"919525","content":"Selected Answer: D\nMake sense, but I could not understand what is meant by option \"C\"","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733774580.0"},{"timestamp":"1727783820.0","comment_id":"857868","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree it is D.","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":160,"topic":"1","question_id":968,"choices":{"B":"Number of incidents escalated to management","C":"Average time between changes and updating of escalation matrix","A":"Number of incidents lacking responses","D":"Average gap between actual and agreed response times"},"question_text":"Which of the following BEST measures the efficiency of an incident response process?","answer":"D","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1677014280,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/100317-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-561-discussion/","question_images":[]},{"id":"tyz6KrZ8UNLq2A3tmshQ","choices":{"C":"Denial of service (DoS) attacks","B":"Unauthorized data usage","A":"Combining incompatible duties","D":"Lack of technical expertise"},"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":160,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104719-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-562-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-04-01 13:59:00","question_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","comment_id":"857870","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727783940.0"}],"answer":"B","question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST common concern associated with outsourcing to a service provider?","unix_timestamp":1680350340,"question_id":969,"answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"vxgBXLaertVQlIaQwT9m","question_text":"An effective control environment is BEST indicated by controls that:","exam_id":160,"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"question_id":970,"topic":"1","answer":"B","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/29684-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-563-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1598505360,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"reduce the thresholds of key risk indicators (KRIs)","A":"minimize senior management's risk tolerance","B":"manage risk within the organization's risk appetite","C":"are cost-effective to implement"},"discussion":[{"content":"Answer should be B","timestamp":"1645946160.0","poster":"Parth9","upvote_count":"14","comment_id":"167296"},{"timestamp":"1663916400.0","content":"B.
