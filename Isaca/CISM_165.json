This is because it sets the foundation for the selection of a SaaS vendor that meets the organization's security needs and expectations. Without clear security requirements and processes, it may be difficult to determine the level of security that each vendor can provide, or to assess the suitability of each vendor for the organization's specific needs.

Looking at the scenario, the most logical sequence of things should be C, A, D, A.\n\nI guess if we're still in the process of selecting a vendor, that means nothing's really decided yet so first you figure out the security requirements and processes and based on that you start checking the vendors (through independent audit reports, so as objective as possible). Then when you understand all the risks with each vendor you propose mitigation.
