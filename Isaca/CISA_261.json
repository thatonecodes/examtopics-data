Following up on the status of all recommendations\nAccountability: It ensures that the organization's IT department is held accountable for addressing the identified issues and implementing the recommended solutions.\nRisk Management: By tracking the status of all recommendations, auditors can assess whether the identified risks have been mitigated or if they still pose a threat to the organization.\nCompliance: Many findings in IT audits may relate to compliance with regulatory requirements or industry standards. Ensuring that all recommendations have been addressed helps the organization maintain compliance.\nContinuous Improvement: It allows the organization to continuously improve its IT processes, security, and overall performance by addressing deficiencies and learning from past audits."},{"timestamp":"1689911220.0","comment_id":"958028","poster":"JONESKA","content":"Should be B.","upvote_count":"4"}],"answer_images":[],"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/98877-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-843-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"2ZHMLH7JjbwVD29I4w8M","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Maintaining a catalog of vulnerabilities that may impact mission-critical systems","A":"Outsourcing the threat and vulnerability management function to a third party","D":"Implementing security logging to enhance threat and vulnerability management","C":"Using a capability maturity model to identify a path to an optimized program"},"question_text":"An IS auditor finds ad hoc vulnerability scanning is in place with no clear alignment to the organization's wider security threat and vulnerability management program.

The ad hoc vulnerability scanning approach without clear alignment to the program could result in security vulnerabilities being overlooked or not addressed promptly, leaving the organization exposed to potential threats.\nThe BEST option to address this issue is to implement a capability maturity model (CMM) to identify a path to an optimized program. A capability maturity model provides a framework to assess an organization's current level of maturity in a particular area and identify opportunities for improvement. In this case, a CMM for security threat and vulnerability management would enable the organization to evaluate its current practices and identify areas for improvement, leading to the development of a more robust and effective program"}],"unix_timestamp":1701493380,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/127613-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-844-discussion/","answer_images":[]},{"id":"hugd5lHFIkF5GSCiizNc","question_id":1303,"exam_id":156,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following will BEST help detect software licensing issues in a networked environment where all software is purchased and loaded by IT?","timestamp":"2023-02-12 03:32:00","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/98878-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-845-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Comparing the software on each machine to the listing of software purchased","C":"Reviewing listings of software on each machine for known versions of unlicensed software","D":"Reviewing reports demonstrating that metering software is not being used to access per-seat software","B":"Comparing the number of individual software instances installed to the license inventory"},"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1676169120,"discussion":[{"poster":"3008","comments":[{"timestamp":"1727416380.0","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1018505","content":"B. Comparing the number of individual software instances installed to the license inventory.\n\nThis approach involves verifying that the number of software installations (instances) matches the number of licenses purchased. It directly assesses the compliance with the purchased licenses, making it an effective way to detect licensing issues. If there are more software instances installed than there are licenses purchased, it could indicate potential unlicensed software use, which is a licensing issue.\n\nWhile options A and C involve comparing the software on each machine to the purchased software list or checking for known versions of unlicensed software, they may not provide a complete picture of license compliance and can be time-consuming and error-prone.","poster":"SuperMax"}],"timestamp":"1723516920.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nComparing the number of individual software instances installed to the license inventory. This is because this method can help detect any discrepancies between the number of licenses purchased and the number of software installations, which can indicate potential overuse or underuse of licenses.

Use generalized audit software: Generalized audit software is specifically designed for auditing purposes and can help in extracting and analyzing data from databases efficiently. It allows for the extraction of data based on specific criteria, such as the 80 largest client balances.\n\nD. Leverage a random number generator: A random number generator can be used to select a random sample from the remaining client balances after extracting the 80 largest ones. This ensures that the sample is truly random and not biased.\nThis approach combines the use of specialized software for data extraction and analysis (option B) with a random number generator (option D) to ensure that the sample is both representative and random, as required for testing purposes.","timestamp":"1711526160.0","comment_id":"1018510","poster":"SuperMax"},{"timestamp":"1692008700.0","comment_id":"808362","upvote_count":"1","poster":"swmasinde","content":"B..........ITF checks for system processing"},{"poster":"kertyce","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect answer","comment_id":"805896","timestamp":"1691800440.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"798552","timestamp":"1691192700.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think B too.","poster":"Tsubasa1234"},{"comment_id":"729247","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1686820140.0","comment_id":"745979","upvote_count":"1","poster":"gomboragchaa","content":"Yeah, I would choose GAS too"}],"comment_id":"741097","content":"Dont blind trust all answers.\nAn integrated test facility (ITF) creates a fictitious entity in a database to process test transactions simultaneously with live input.
