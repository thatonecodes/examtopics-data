The BIA helps organizations understand the potential impact of various security incidents and threats on their business operations. It identifies critical assets, processes, and functions and assesses how their disruption could affect the organization's ability to achieve its objectives.\n\nBy demonstrating the potential financial, operational, and reputational risks associated with security incidents, a BIA can help stakeholders, including senior management and decision-makers, recognize the importance of investing in and supporting information security measures.
