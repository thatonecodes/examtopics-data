Conducting periodic system stress testing.\n\nExplanation:\n\nPeriodic system stress testing is crucial for assessing the performance, reliability, and resilience of business-critical applications in a cloud environment. Stress testing involves subjecting the applications to simulated high-demand scenarios or adverse conditions to identify potential weaknesses, bottlenecks, or failure points. By conducting stress tests regularly, the organization can proactively identify and address any issues that may impact the availability and performance of the applications, thereby enhancing their resiliency.","comment_id":"1181309","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711250940.0"},{"timestamp":"1699903620.0","poster":"FAGFUR","comment_id":"1069680","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNegotiating a service level agreement is the most crucial step for ensuring the resiliency of business-critical applications migrated to the cloud.

A well-defined SLA can provide legal guarantees and penalties for the provider if service levels are not met, which is essential for ensuring the reliability and resiliency of your applications. It serves as a contractual commitment to maintaining the required levels of availability and performance for your applications in the cloud.","timestamp":"1696083660.0"},{"timestamp":"1688195640.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"hoho","comment_id":"939698","content":"Why not A?

A standardized methodology provides structure, best practices, and ensures that the architecture aligns with industry standards and the organization's goals. Without a standard methodology, there is a higher risk of inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and potential security and compliance issues in the IT architecture.
