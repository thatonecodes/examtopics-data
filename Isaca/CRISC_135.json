Source information is consistently available.\n\nThe most important consideration when selecting key performance indicators (KPIs) for control monitoring is that the source information is consistently available. Reliable and consistent data availability ensures that KPIs can be tracked and monitored over time, providing accurate and actionable insights for effective control monitoring.","poster":"Staanlee","timestamp":"1722219900.0","comment_id":"1257202","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720342200.0","comment_id":"1243756","poster":"efe6fee","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI believe C\n\nKPIs should be SMART\n• Specific-based on a clearly understood goal; clear and concise\n• Measurable-able to be measured; quantifiable (objective), not subjective\n• Attainable-realistic; based on important goals and values\n• Relevant-directly related to a specific activity or goal\n• Timely-grounded in a specific time frame\n\nAdditionally, KPis should be:\n• Valuable to the business\n• Tied to a business function or service\n• Under the control of management\n• Quantitatively measured\n• Usable in different reporting periods (for consistency)"}],"topic":"1","question_text":"What is the MOST important consideration when selecting key performance indicators (KPIs) for control monitoring?","unix_timestamp":1720342200,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (67%)","C (33%)"],"question_id":671,"timestamp":"2024-07-07 10:50:00","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"A":"Source information is acquired at stable cost.","D":"Source information is consistently available.","C":"Source information is readily quantifiable.","B":"Source information is tailored by removing outliers."},"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/143496-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1757-discussion/","exam_id":160,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[]},{"id":"rCjqjkC8smPZ0FcV03F8","choices":{"B":"Lack of physical hardening","A":"IoT devices with hard-coded passwords","D":"Outdated out-of-the-box IoT firmware","C":"Lack of regulatory guidance regarding IoT"},"question_id":672,"unix_timestamp":1727273340,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/148073-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1761-discussion/","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-09-25 16:09:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1727273340.0","comment_id":"1289048","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nHard-coded passwords are considered the greatest risk because they are often difficult or impossible to change. If these passwords are compromised, they can provide an easy access point for attackers, exposing the entire system to potential security breaches.
