Exceeding the organization’s risk appetite is a high-level finding that encompasses multiple potential risks and indicates that the project may not be viable or sustainable within the organization’s tolerances. This would demand immediate attention and possibly a reevaluation of the project, making it a more pressing concern than operational issues like missing devices or financial control lapses.
