Maintain and review the classified data inventory.\n\nThe FIRST step in managing the risk associated with the leakage of confidential data is to \"B. Maintain and review the classified data inventory.\" This involves identifying and categorizing the types of confidential data that the organization handles. By maintaining an up-to-date inventory of classified data, the organization gains a clear understanding of what types of data need protection and the potential risks associated with their leakage. This inventory serves as a foundation for subsequent risk assessment and mitigation efforts.\n\nWhile the other options (conducting an awareness program, implementing mandatory encryption, defining and implementing a data classification policy) are important steps as well, they should come after establishing a clear understanding of the data that needs protection through the maintenance and review of a classified data inventory.","timestamp":"1724877840.0","comment_id":"992607","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Staanlee"},{"content":"There are automated controls to protect against data leakage. i guess systems cant be trained but can implement controls based on data classification policy.

Reviewing the implementation of the risk response.\n\nThe BEST way to ensure that identified risk scenarios are addressed is to \"D. Review the implementation of the risk response.\" After identifying risk scenarios, it's crucial to put effective risk response plans into action. However, the process doesn't stop there. Regularly reviewing and assessing the implementation of risk responses allows the organization to ensure that the intended actions are being carried out effectively and that the risk is being appropriately mitigated or managed. This ongoing review process helps to keep risks under control and ensures that any adjustments or improvements needed are identified and addressed promptly.\n\nWhile the other options (performing real-time monitoring of threats, creating a separate risk register for key business units, performing regular risk control self-assessments) are important activities, they are not as directly focused on tracking and validating the implementation of specific risk responses as option D is.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee","timestamp":"1724881800.0"},{"timestamp":"1712088120.0","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"859315","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree it is D.","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104915-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-622-discussion/","answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"Al9ZcPNcjRYXzW7SzYNE","exam_id":160,"question_text":"The MOST effective approach to prioritize risk scenarios is by:","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/100395-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-623-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-02-22 19:02:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"evaluating the cost of risk response","B":"soliciting input from risk management experts","A":"assessing impact to the strategic plan","C":"aligning with industry best practices"},"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1677088920,"question_id":1033,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A.","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1727899380.0","comment_id":"859317","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree.","comment_id":"818160","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724342520.0","poster":"john_boogieman"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer":"A"},{"id":"oQ82N2x9EHat0zyJl7Sf","topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following is the MAIN reason to continuously monitor IT-related risk?","timestamp":"2023-04-02 22:05:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1727899500.0","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"859318","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A."}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":160,"question_id":1034,"choices":{"D":"To update the risk register to reflect changes in levels of identified and new IT-related risk","A":"To ensure risk levels are within acceptable limits of the organization's risk appetite and risk tolerance","B":"To redefine the risk appetite and risk tolerance levels based on changes in risk factors","C":"To help identify root causes of incidents and recommend suitable long-term solutions"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1680465900,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104916-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-624-discussion/","answer_images":[]},{"id":"1ECumydg80xFUZgushVP","timestamp":"2020-07-10 18:57:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/25365-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-625-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":1035,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Perform a root cause analysis","B":"Conduct an immediate risk assessment","C":"Invoke the established incident response plan","D":"Inform internal audit"},"unix_timestamp":1594400220,"exam_id":160,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
