Observe the control enhancements in operation.\n\nThe best way for a risk practitioner to verify that management has addressed control issues identified during a previous external audit is to observe the control enhancements in operation. This direct approach allows the practitioner to assess whether the implemented changes are effective, functioning as intended, and mitigating the identified risks.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"846310","timestamp":"1726942680.0","poster":"Broesweelies"},{"comment_id":"819492","timestamp":"1724427180.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"john_boogieman"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":160,"answer":"C","topic":"1","answer_description":""},{"id":"PVYokAI85qBVRWExsHtY","question_text":"Which of the following is MOST important to have in place to ensure the effectiveness of risk and security metrics reporting?","topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Regularly scheduled audits.","D":"Incident management policy.","B":"Incident reporting procedures.","A":"Organizational reporting process."},"unix_timestamp":1641862320,"timestamp":"2022-01-11 01:52:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/69836-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-829-discussion/","answers_community":["C (60%)","A (40%)"],"exam_id":160,"answer":"C","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Organizational reporting process.\n\nFor risk and security metrics to be effectively reported and understood by stakeholders, it's crucial to have an established organizational reporting process. This process provides a structured and consistent manner to convey information, ensuring that key stakeholders receive relevant data in a timely and comprehensible manner, aiding in informed decision-making. While the other options are relevant to various aspects of risk management and security, they don't directly ensure the effectiveness of metrics reporting as the organizational reporting process does.","comment_id":"1039589","timestamp":"1728570060.0","poster":"01010100"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"A.

Hence it determines the nature of risk on a relative scale.\nSome of the qualitative methods of risk analysis are:\n✑ Scenario analysis- This is a forward-looking process that can reflect risk for a given point in time.\n✑ Risk Control Self -assessment (RCSA) - RCSA is used by enterprises (like banks) for the identification and evaluation of operational risk exposure. It is a logical first step and assumes that business owners and managers are closest to the issues and have the most expertise as to the source of the risk. RCSA is a constructive process in compelling business owners to contemplate, and then explain, the issues at hand with the added benefit of increasing their accountability.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: Subject matter experts can help the qualitative risk assessment, but by focusing on high-priority risks the project's performance can improve by addressing these risk events.\nB: Stakeholders should be involved throughout the project as situations within the project demand their input to risk identification and analysis.\nC: Qualitative analysis does use a fast approach of analyzing project risks, but it's not the best answer for this","question_id":1248,"answer":"D","exam_id":160,"question_text":"You work as a project manager for BlueWell Inc.

Percentage of failed restore tests.\n\nThe most appropriate key risk indicator (KRI) for backup media that is recycled monthly would be the percentage of failed restore tests. This KRI directly measures the effectiveness of the backup process because it indicates the proportion of backups that cannot be successfully restored when tested. A high percentage of failed restore tests would indicate a significant risk that critical data may not be recoverable in the event of a data loss incident, which is a key concern in backup and recovery operations.\n\nWhile the other options, such as the time required for backup restoration testing, the change in the size of data backed up, and the successful completion of backup operations, are important metrics in backup and recovery management, they do not provide a direct measure of the risk associated with the integrity and recoverability of the backed-up data.
