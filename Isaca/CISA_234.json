It produces a “negative” outcome (meaning that no threat has been observed), even though a threat exists.

If the detective control fails to detect incidents accurately (leading to increased false negatives), it undermines the ability to conduct effective root cause analysis because incidents are missed or not properly logged.\n\nTherefore, the deterioration of detective controls primarily impacts the accuracy and reliability of incident detection, resulting in an increased number of false negatives in security logs.
