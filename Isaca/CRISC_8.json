This process often includes assessing the potential impact and likelihood of risks. Through a risk assessment, an organization gains a detailed understanding of the specific risks it faces, their potential consequences, and the organization's current control environment. This information is crucial in determining the organization's overall risk appetite and tolerance.","comment_id":"978279","poster":"abhincarnation"},{"poster":"mynk29","timestamp":"1716543180.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\ntolerance and appetite translate to policies","comment_id":"905716"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree with D.

These policies help to establish the organization's risk tolerance, or the level of risk that the organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. By reviewing the organization's risk policies, one can gain a clear understanding of the organization's attitude towards risk and its risk appetite.\n\nWhile risk sharing strategies, risk assessments, and risk transfer agreements are all important components of an organization's risk management framework, they do not provide as clear an indication of the organization's risk tolerance as its risk policies. These other factors can be influenced by a range of internal and external factors and may not reflect the organization's true risk tolerance.","comment_id":"858435","timestamp":"1712022180.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"jseeker","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhile D is also correct, in the risk assessment report, you can see that in action.

Peak bandwidth usage.\n\nPeak bandwidth usage represents the maximum bandwidth consumed during a given period, and is an important metric to consider when defining an early-warning threshold for insufficient network bandwidth. This is because peak bandwidth usage is likely to occur during times of high network traffic, and can help to identify when the network is at risk of becoming overwhelmed.\n\nWhile average bandwidth usage and bandwidth used during business hours are also important factors to consider, they may not accurately reflect the peak usage that can occur during busy periods. Total bandwidth usage is also important to monitor, but it may not be as useful in defining an early-warning threshold, as it does not provide information about when the network is at risk of becoming overwhelmed."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI respectfully disagree with John. \n\nI would think that monitoring peak bandwidth is most important because if that is consistently higher, the staff would start experiencing slowness/latency accessing network resources.

Peak bandwidth usage may be a more dramatic representation of network usage, but it may not accurately reflect the amount of bandwidth that is required on a consistent basis.\n\nBy using average bandwidth usage, an organization can establish a baseline of expected usage and set an early-warning threshold that is appropriate for the network's capacity. If the average usage exceeds the threshold, it can indicate that the network may be approaching its capacity limit, and steps can be taken to address the issue before it causes a significant impact on network performance.","timestamp":"1724486640.0","comment_id":"820323","upvote_count":"2","poster":"john_boogieman"}],"question_text":"Which of the following is MOST helpful in defining an early-warning threshold associated with insufficient network bandwidth?","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/100644-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1032-discussion/","question_id":37,"answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1677233040,"choices":{"B":"Average bandwidth usage","C":"Total bandwidth usage","A":"Bandwidth used during business hours","D":"Peak bandwidth usage"},"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"r8aCQjQcbmAikr7Qi3Cw","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107144-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1033-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-04-23 12:14:00","exam_id":160,"answers_community":["A (50%)","D (50%)"],"topic":"1","answer":"A","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Identifying potential sources of risk","B":"Reviewing past audits","A":"Mapping threats to organizational objectives","C":"Analyzing key risk indicators (KRIs)"},"question_id":38,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1682244840,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nagree with D","timestamp":"1730529060.0","poster":"8e1c45b","comment_id":"1205290"},{"comment_id":"978281","timestamp":"1707635160.0","poster":"abhincarnation","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMapping threats to organizational objectives involves connecting specific threats or risks to the objectives and goals of the organization.
