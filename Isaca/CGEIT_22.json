Align with business risk management processes.\n\nAligning IT risk management with business risk management processes ensures that IT risks are understood within the broader context of organizational objectives and strategies. This alignment facilitates better communication and collaboration between IT and other business units, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of risks and their potential impact on the organization as a whole.\n\nBy integrating IT risk management with broader business risk management processes, organizations can prioritize risks more effectively, allocate resources efficiently, and make informed decisions that address both IT-specific concerns and broader business objectives.

IT risk is different from business risk due to it's inherent nature. It makes sense to align IT risk with business risk but not the process for resolving the risk. An example - business risk regarding opportunity loss due to lack of power to a facility may be resolved through processes involving manual workarounds (customer visits arranged, manual paperwork, etc). However, IT risk regarding lack of power to a facility can only be resolved through DRP.
