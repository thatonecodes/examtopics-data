It ensures that the content of the email has not been altered during transmission or tampered with in any way. The digital signature is generated using a private key that is unique to the sender and can only be decrypted using the corresponding public key. When the recipient receives the email, they can verify the digital signature using the sender's public key, which confirms that the email has not been modified since it was signed by the sender. This helps to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the email message.","poster":"koala_lay","comment_id":"1053593","timestamp":"1729847520.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"richck102","timestamp":"1729733700.0","comment_id":"1052407","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. verify to recipients the integrity of an email message."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/124502-exam-cism-topic-1-question-960-discussion/","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":157,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_text":"An email digital signature will:","unix_timestamp":1698111300,"choices":{"D":"prevent unauthorized modification of an email message.","A":"automatically correct unauthorized modification of an email message.","C":"protect the confidentiality of an email message.","B":"verify to recipients the integrity of an email message."},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","topic":"1"}],"exam":{"id":157,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"CISM","provider":"Isaca","numberOfQuestions":1247,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":241},"__N_SSP":true}
