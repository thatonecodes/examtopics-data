Security administrators. Security administrators are responsible for managing the access rights and privileges of users in an information system. They ensure that the user authorization tables are consistent with the approved authorization forms, which specify the roles and permissions of each user. Security administrators also monitor and audit the user activities and enforce the security policies and standards.\n\nSystem owners, database administrators (DBAs), and IT managers are not directly involved in the user authorization process, although they may have some roles and responsibilities related to the security of the system. System owners are accountable for the overall performance and functionality of the system, DBAs are in charge of the design and maintenance of the database, and IT managers oversee the IT resources and staff.","comment_id":"966862"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"740562","poster":"peelu","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSystem owners","timestamp":"1670631360.0"}],"answer":"B","choices":{"B":"System owners","C":"Database administrators (DBAs)","A":"Security administrators","D":"IT managers"},"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","exam_id":156,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-12-10 01:16:00","unix_timestamp":1670631360,"question_id":746,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (56%)","A (44%)"],"question_text":"Of the following, who are the MOST appropriate staff for ensuring the alignment of user authorization tables with approved authorization forms?"},{"id":"pQgpEp7qBeXkogF10bwb","choices":{"D":"Recovery scenarios","A":"Risk appetite","B":"Completeness of critical asset inventory","C":"Critical applications in the cloud"},"exam_id":156,"timestamp":"2023-05-26 14:13:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/110301-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-285-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (44%)","D (33%)","A (22%)"],"topic":"1","question_text":"As part of business continuity planning, which of the following is MOST important to assess when conducting a business impact analysis (BIA)?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1708860600.0","content":"B.
