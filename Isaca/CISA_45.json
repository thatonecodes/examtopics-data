While compliance with the organization's data policies may necessitate data classification, the ultimate goal is often to mitigate risks associated with data breaches, unauthorized access, or data loss.\n\nBy classifying data according to its level of sensitivity or importance, organizations can establish appropriate security controls, access restrictions, and encryption measures to protect against potential threats. This proactive approach to data protection helps organizations safeguard their valuable assets and maintain trust with stakeholders.","timestamp":"1714899300.0","poster":"a84n","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1206816"},{"timestamp":"1712040900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFrom CRM: \"Evaluate data classification practices for alignment with the organizationâ€™s policies and applicable external requirements.\", so I choose A.","comment_id":"1187895","upvote_count":"2","poster":"hermfrancis"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/137733-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1201-discussion/","answer":"C","exam_id":156,"answers_community":["C (60%)","A (40%)"],"timestamp":"2024-04-02 08:55:00","question_text":"What is the PRIMARY reason for an organization to classify the data stored on its internal networks?","answer_images":[]},{"id":"sISTnzJF5urV76qeZqb0","question_id":222,"question_text":"Effective separation of duties in an online environment can BEST be achieved by utilizing:","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/129314-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1203-discussion/","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-12-25 10:22:00","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1703496120,"isMC":true,"answer":"B","exam_id":156,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719300120.0","comment_id":"1105130","poster":"KAP2HURUF","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Access authorization tables can best achieve effective separation of duties in an online environment. Access authorization tables are typically used in system security to control and manage user access rights and privileges. By properly configuring access authorization tables, organizations can assign different levels of access to individuals based on their job roles and responsibilities. This helps enforce separation of duties by ensuring that individuals only have access to the systems and data necessary for performing their specific tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions or errors. While appropriate supervision, transaction logging, and written procedure manuals are also valuable controls, access authorization tables specifically focus on managing and enforcing separation of duties in online environments.","upvote_count":"2"}],"choices":{"A":"appropriate supervision.","C":"transaction logging.","B":"access authorization tables.","D":"written procedure manuals."}},{"id":"SBp6kGZw629fJA700IzY","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1181279","content":"Selected Answer: D\nContinuous auditing provides the greatest assurance that a middleware application that aggregates data from multiple sales transaction databases for forecasting is operating effectively.","poster":"Swallows","timestamp":"1727137020.0"},{"timestamp":"1721761440.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
