Crypto-shredding**\n\nCrypto-shredding involves encrypting data and then securely deleting the encryption keys, rendering the data unreadable and inaccessible. This method is particularly effective for cloud environments or systems where physical access to the storage media is not possible. It is efficient because it can be implemented quickly and does not require physical destruction of the media, making it suitable for environments with a large volume of data.\n\nWhile physical destruction (option D) is highly effective for ensuring data cannot be recovered, it is often less efficient due to the logistical challenges and costs associated with physically destroying hardware. Degaussing (option B) and multi-pass wipes (option C) are effective for certain types of media but may not be as efficient or feasible in all scenarios, particularly with modern SSDs or cloud storage.","timestamp":"1741780440.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nDestruction methods—Data destruction requirements will change after cloud adoption. Without access below the waterline, degaussing or physical destruction are not valid options, and multipass wipes may prove inefficient or ineffective. Cryptoshredding may be the best course of action, depending on the deployment model.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"vsgsds","timestamp":"1721884320.0","comment_id":"1131430"},{"timestamp":"1705559940.0","poster":"Vijay123456","comment_id":"954948","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPage 159 CCAK Study Guide"}],"answer_description":"","question_id":11,"unix_timestamp":1671714240,"choices":{"A":"Crypto-shredding","C":"Multi-pass wipes","B":"Degaussing","D":"Physical destruction"},"exam_id":153,"answer":"A","question_text":"Which of the following data destruction methods is the MOST effective and efficient?","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/92443-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-108-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-12-22 14:04:00","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[]},{"id":"s5ZvbygaaWP5xLgOT4ju","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","question_id":12,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Under GDPR, an organization should report a data breach within what time frame?","isMC":true,"exam_id":153,"unix_timestamp":1741780680,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1387849","timestamp":"1741780680.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nUnder the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an organization is required to report a data breach to the relevant supervisory authority within:\n\n**A. 72 hours**\n\nThe regulation mandates that the notification should be made \"without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it.\" If the notification is not made within this time frame, the organization must provide reasons for the delay.","poster":"Auditor2020"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/168919-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-109-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-03-12 12:58:00","choices":{"C":"1 week","B":"2 weeks","D":"48 hours","A":"72 hours"}},{"id":"EKHt0f7bW2gx5USk6AH2","question_text":"The PRIMARY objective of an audit initiation meeting with a cloud audit client is to:","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/161990-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-11-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741529820.0","comment_id":"1371551","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. discuss the scope of the cloud audit.\n\nThis meeting is typically held to ensure that both the auditor and the client have a clear understanding of the scope, objectives, and boundaries of the audit.
