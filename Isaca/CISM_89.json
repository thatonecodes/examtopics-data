The most important consideration when reviewing an information security strategy should be new business initiatives, as they can introduce new risks and threats that may need to be addressed by the existing security controls and processes. For example, the introduction of new technology, products, or services can bring new vulnerabilities and attack surfaces, and the information security strategy should be reviewed and updated to address these new risks. On the other hand, changes to the security budget, internal audit findings, and recent security incidents can certainly inform the review and update of the information security strategy, but new business initiatives should always be the most important consideration."},{"timestamp":"1728412080.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"e891cd1","comment_id":"1191762","content":"Option B ..New Business can bring new issues ..new polices..new culture..new SLA and all that boring stuff."},{"poster":"oluchecpoint","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption B","timestamp":"1722173220.0","comment_id":"1134221"},{"timestamp":"1721660220.0","comment_id":"1128885","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNew business initiatives create new business strategies, goals and objectives, which must be supported by infosec strategy.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AlexJacobson"},{"content":"D.

Scenario analysis\n\nScenario analysis is the best way to evaluate the impact of threat events on an organization's IT operations. Scenario analysis involves identifying potential threat events and simulating their impact on the organization's IT systems and processes.

Scenario analysis. The keywords are \"threat events\" and \"on organization's IT Operation\". This tells me that this is a very specific scenario.\n\nRationale:\n(A.) Risk assessment is incorrect cause this is too broad. It is used to identify the threats, probability, and impact. We already know the threat events and probability isn't a concern. So it's a lot of extra work when a scenario analysis will do.\n(B.) Penetration testing is incorrect cause it is primarily concerned with testing the control's effectiveness and confirming vulnerabilities. It's not designed to assess impacts. This is just a byproduct and the question asked for BEST.\n(D.) Controls review is designed to figure out it's effectiveness, but does nothing to assess impact which is one of the keywords \"evaluate the imapct\".","comment_id":"894506"},{"timestamp":"1682987940.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Risk assessment is the BEST way to evaluate the impact of threat events on an organization's IT operations. Risk assessment is a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks to an organization's assets, including IT systems and data. By conducting a risk assessment, an organization can identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of those threats, and develop strategies to mitigate or manage the risks. This allows an organization to make informed decisions about how to allocate resources to protect its IT operations and prioritize efforts to address the most significant risks.","comment_id":"886906","poster":"Abhey","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"A.
