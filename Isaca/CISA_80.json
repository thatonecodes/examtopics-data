It's often used when specific items are of interest or when there's a need to focus on high-risk areas, such as material transactions in a balance sheet or reviewing the functionality of a program. This method allows auditors to target specific areas or transactions they deem most important or risky, which aligns well with the objectives of the described reviews.","poster":"Swallows","timestamp":"1716981960.0"},{"comment_id":"1207467","upvote_count":"1","poster":"a84n","timestamp":"1715015460.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer: A & B\nFor reviewing the organization's balance sheet for material transactions: Variable sampling or discovery sampling.\nFor conducting an application review of the program that produced the balance sheet: Judgmental sampling."},{"poster":"Swallows","comment_id":"1189861","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712312580.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt is usually applied to tests of monetary or quantitative amounts and provides evidence of significant misstatements in stated amounts.
