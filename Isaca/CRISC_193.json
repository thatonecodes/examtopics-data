A change in risk appetite can result in changes to the key risk indicator (KRI) thresholds, as these thresholds are typically set based on the organization's tolerance for risk. Adjusting the KRI thresholds allows the organization to reflect the new risk appetite in its monitoring and reporting processes."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe inherent risk level is most likely to change as a result of a change in management's risk appetite. When management's risk appetite changes, it affects the organization's tolerance for risk, which may require adjusting the inherent risk level of a particular risk in the risk register. This is because inherent risk represents the level of risk that exists without any mitigating controls in place, and the level of inherent risk will determine the organization's overall risk exposure. Therefore, a change in risk appetite will likely impact the organization's tolerance for certain risks and may require adjustments to the inherent risk levels in the risk register.","comment_id":"822725","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1724685060.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":965,"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following elements of a risk register is MOST likely to change as a result of change in management's risk appetite?","choices":{"D":"Key risk indicator (KRI) thresholds","A":"Risk likelihood and impact","B":"Risk velocity","C":"Inherent risk"},"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":1422,"name":"CRISC","id":160,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"provider":"Isaca"},"currentPage":193},"__N_SSP":true}
