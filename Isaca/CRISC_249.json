Identifying controls during the design phase allows for a more integrated and efficient approach to security and risk management in the system's architecture and functionality.\n\nWhile technical specifications are indeed defined during the design phase, the primary reason for defining controls at this stage is to ensure that security and risk management are an integral part of the system's design and development process. This proactive approach helps prevent vulnerabilities and issues from arising later in the development lifecycle."},{"timestamp":"1713269460.0","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"871730","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C."},{"content":"Can I confirm which discussion exam topic should i be using as reference if im taking the COBIT 5 Implementation exam","comments":[],"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1655769480.0","poster":"Melty","comment_id":"386636"},{"poster":"ohamdan","comment_id":"385972","upvote_count":"3","content":"I think the correct answer is C. its more cost-effective to determine controls in the early design phase.","timestamp":"1655703420.0"}],"question_text":"Controls should be defined during the design phase of system development because:","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/55657-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-823-discussion/","exam_id":160,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2021-06-20 07:37:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":1241,"unix_timestamp":1624167420,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer":"C","choices":{"A":"technical specifications are defined during this phase.","B":"structured programming techniques require that controls be designed before coding begins.","C":"its more cost-effective to determine controls in the early design phase.","D":"structured analysis techniques exclude identification of controls."},"answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"uXoU2l9JWhV2VxwesUkC","timestamp":"2021-01-27 08:38:00","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":160,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"871732","timestamp":"1729080720.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt is A.","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree.","comment_id":"819484","timestamp":"1724426820.0"},{"content":"echo A","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"530935","timestamp":"1690152180.0","poster":"Raj1510"},{"comment_id":"413041","content":"A is the answer","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1674553800.0","poster":"Owaissyed"},{"timestamp":"1658900280.0","poster":"travdaman","comments":[{"content":"Yes KPI report performance ..
