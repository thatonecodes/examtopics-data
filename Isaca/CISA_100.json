Minimizing false-positive and false-negative alerts\n\nIn a risk-based incident response management program, minimizing false positives and false negatives is crucial. False positives can lead to wasted resources on non-critical events, while false negatives can result in missing actual threats, increasing risk to the organization. Effective incident response relies on accurate detection, so reducing these errors is essential to ensure that the program can promptly identify and respond to legitimate incidents. While monitoring low-risk events, testing the plan, and assigning roles are important, they are secondary to ensuring accurate alerting for risk-based prioritization."},{"poster":"blehbleh","comment_id":"1300547","timestamp":"1729438680.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis is B.
