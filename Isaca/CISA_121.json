The manual’s emphasis on least privilege in Section 5.3 (\"The principle of least privilege requires that users be granted only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions,\" p. 373) and its application to third parties in Section 2.9 (\"third-party access is restricted to only the systems and data necessary,\" p. 143) strongly supports Option B. This control minimizes risk proactively, aligning with cloud security responsibilities and vendor management best practices.","poster":"46080f2","timestamp":"1741862940.0","comment_id":"1388267"},{"poster":"blehbleh","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI am pretty sure A is the correct answer as it has an expiration time. Option C says they are deleted when work is completed which is a good idea and should be done but when work is completed is very arbitrary. B doesn’t make a lot of sense. Access is provided on a need to know basis. I mean, duh. Right, they shouldn’t just access all the time whenever. Which is why I lean toward A. Because it has an expiration date so it doesn’t necessarily matter if the work got completed. They can get granted access again without it extending too long. Hopefully that makes sense to anyone else who is struggling with the options given.","comment_id":"1298332","timestamp":"1729006740.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":156,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Access has been provided on a need-to-know basis.","A":"Administrator access is provided for a limited period with an expiration date.","C":"User IDs are deleted when work is completed.","D":"Access is provided to correspond with the service level agreement (SLA)."},"answer_ET":"B","answer":"A","question_id":601,"unix_timestamp":1729006740,"answers_community":["A (67%)","B (33%)"],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-10-15 17:39:00","isMC":true},{"id":"O9aZFWLnM2LOnEHkUera","exam_id":156,"question_text":"Which of the following can only be provided by asymmetric encryption?","question_images":[],"question_id":602,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741865580.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1388271","poster":"46080f2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAsymmetric encryption uniquely provides nonrepudiation, which ensures that a sender cannot deny the authenticity or origin of a message. This is achieved through digital signatures, a feature enabled by the use of public-private key pairs in asymmetric cryptography. When a sender encrypts a message with their private key, the recipient can verify its origin using the sender’s public key, creating an unforgeable proof of authorship."}],"answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/168992-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1796-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1741865580,"isMC":true,"answer":"D","choices":{"C":"256-bit key length","B":"Data availability","A":"Information privacy","D":"Nonrepudiation"},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-03-13 12:33:00","answer_description":""},{"id":"hGV1jJQRw3VXlXvw4kkp","unix_timestamp":1741865880,"choices":{"D":"Confirming whether multi-factor authentication (MFA) is deployed as part of the operational enhancements","A":"Validating whether baselines have been established","C":"Determining whether there is a process for annual review of the maintenance manual","B":"Reviewing whether all changes have been implemented"},"question_text":"Which of the following should be an IS auditor’s PRIMARY focus when auditing the implementation of a new IT operations performance monitoring system?","topic":"1","exam_id":156,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe establishment of baselines ensures the system can effectively monitor performance, making it the auditor's primary focus.
