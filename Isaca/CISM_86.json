Evaluate compensating control options.\nExplanation:\nCompensating controls are security measures or countermeasures that are put in place to mitigate the risk of a vulnerability when the primary control measure may disrupt normal operations. In this case, if employees are experiencing disruptions due to the new security control, it's essential to assess whether there are alternative or compensating controls that can provide the necessary security without causing significant disruptions.\nThe goal of this action is to balance security needs with operational requirements. It demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing security concerns while minimizing the impact on employees' ability to work.","timestamp":"1709613360.0","comment_id":"998972"},{"timestamp":"1743585000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe best course of action for the information security manager is to A.

By conducting a thorough analysis of the incident, including the cause, the actions taken and the outcomes, the team can identify any gaps in their knowledge or processes that led to the incident taking longer to identify.
