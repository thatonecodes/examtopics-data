Business impact analysis (BIA)\n\nThe most useful source when planning a business-aligned information security program is a Business Impact Analysis (BIA). A BIA assesses the potential impacts of disruptions to business operations, identifying critical business processes, dependencies, and their associated risks. By understanding the business's priorities, objectives, and tolerance for disruption, organizations can tailor their information security program to align with business needs effectively.
