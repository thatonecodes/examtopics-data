Accredited vendors follow industry standards and certified destruction methods\nfor A if the encryption keys are compromised, the data can still be accessed before destruction"},{"comment_id":"1010732","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Use an accredited vendor to dispose of the hard drives\n\nUsing an accredited vendor ensures that the vendor follows industry best practices and standards for the secure disposal of hard drives. Accreditation typically means that the vendor's processes and capabilities have been vetted and found to be compliant with established standards, significantly reducing the risk of data leakage.\n\nWhile the other options can also contribute to the security of the disposal process, they don't provide the same level of assurance that an accredited vendor does. Encryption (Option A) is useful while the hard drive is in use, but not necessarily when it's about to be destroyed. Degaussing (Option B) is a method of destroying data, but using an accredited vendor might encompass degaussing and other secure methods. Requiring confirmation (Option D) is a good practice but doesn't ensure that the destruction process was securely handled.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"01010100","timestamp":"1726675860.0"},{"comment_id":"991068","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Require the vendor to degauss the hard drives.\n\nThe best option to reduce the risk of data leakage when destroying hard drives through a vendor is to \"B. Require the vendor to degauss the hard drives.\" Degaussing is a method of erasing data from hard drives by exposing them to a strong magnetic field, effectively rendering the data unrecoverable. This process ensures that sensitive information stored on the hard drives is thoroughly and irreversibly destroyed.\n\nWhile the other options (implementing an encryption policy, using an accredited vendor, requiring confirmation of destruction) can contribute to data security, requiring the vendor to degauss the hard drives provides a strong technical measure to ensure data is properly and definitively erased before disposal.","timestamp":"1724709180.0","poster":"Staanlee"},{"comment_id":"919461","timestamp":"1717949400.0","poster":"mraiyan","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIf the question is excluding the vendor's risk (vendor is trusted and there is no risk from the vendor to leak data) which I assume per the text - then it is \"C\".
