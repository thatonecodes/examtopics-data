Insufficient information architecture\n\nThe most likely cause of the situation described, where an array of data services with overlapping functionality has been implemented, leading to business inefficiencies, is insufficient information architecture.\n\nInformation architecture involves the organization and structure of data, including how it is stored, accessed, and managed within an organization. When there is insufficient information architecture, it can lead to fragmentation and duplication of data services, resulting in inefficiencies and redundancies.\n\nWithout a clear and well-defined information architecture, different departments or projects may implement their own data services without considering existing systems or evaluating the overall needs of the organization. This can result in overlapping functionality and duplication of efforts, leading to increased costs, complexity, and reduced efficiency."},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Sathish5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe MOST likely cause of overlapping functionality and business inefficiencies in the implementation of an array of data services is insufficient information architecture (Option D).

Address as part of an architecture exception process\n\nThe best way to manage the situation within an IT governance framework is to address it as part of an architecture exception process. An architecture exception process allows the enterprise to evaluate requests for deviations from established IT standards, policies, or strategies.\n\nIn this case, the technology proposed in the business case is not in line with the existing IT strategy. However, if the business case indicates significant benefits to the enterprise, it may warrant consideration through an exception process.\n\nBy initiating an architecture exception process, the enterprise can assess the potential benefits, risks, and impacts of adopting the new technology. This process involves a thorough review by relevant stakeholders, including IT governance bodies, to determine whether the proposed technology aligns with the organization's overall objectives and if the benefits outweigh the risks of deviating from the IT strategy."}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1710056820,"answer":"D","topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"question_text":"An enterprise considers implementing a system that uses a technology that is not in line with its IT strategy.
