Role-based access control\n\nRole-based access control (RBAC) is a technique that greatly reduces security administration efforts following deployment. With RBAC, access rights are assigned to users based on their roles within an organization. This simplifies administration by allowing access permissions to be managed at the role level rather than for individual users, reducing the complexity of access control management. Once roles are defined and access permissions are assigned accordingly, ongoing administration efforts are minimized, as changes can be made to roles rather than to individual user accounts. This contrasts with techniques such as discretionary access control (DAC) and access control lists (ACLs), which typically require more granular management of access permissions for individual users or resources.","poster":"REHAMAZZAM","timestamp":"1723184340.0"},{"timestamp":"1710086040.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"oluchecpoint","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Role-based access control\n\nIn RBAC, access permissions are assigned based on a user's role within an organization. This means that instead of managing permissions for each individual user, administrators can define roles and assign permissions to those roles. Users are then assigned to specific roles, and they inherit the permissions associated with those roles. This simplifies access management and reduces the administrative burden, especially in larger organizations with many users and resources.","comment_id":"1004030"},{"poster":"richck102","timestamp":"1704941280.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Assess the risk and cost of noncompliance.\n\nBefore taking any action, it's essential to understand the potential consequences and implications of noncompliance. By assessing the risk and cost, you can make informed decisions about how to proceed. This assessment will help you determine the severity of the noncompliance, its potential impact on the organization, and whether immediate action is required. Once you have a clear understanding of the risk and cost, you can then proceed with the appropriate actions, which may include conducting a business impact and vulnerability analysis (A), reporting to senior management (B), and implementing corrective measures (D).","timestamp":"1725976680.0","poster":"oluchecpoint"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722822240.0","poster":"afc1019","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe first step that an information security manager should take upon learning of noncompliance with an impending information security regulatory change is to assess the risk and cost of noncompliance. This will help the manager to determine the urgency of the situation and the best course of action.\n\nOnce the risk and cost of noncompliance have been assessed, the manager can then report the noncompliance to senior management and develop a plan to become compliant. The manager may also need to conduct a business impact and vulnerability analysis to determine the impact of noncompliance on the organization.\n\nImplementing the correct measures to become compliant should be the final step in the process.
