Service level agreements (SLAs)\n\nService level agreements (SLAs) in cloud computing heavily rely on measurement results and metrics to define and ensure the quality of service provided by the cloud service provider. SLAs specify the expected performance and availability levels, and metrics are used to measure compliance with these commitments. Metrics such as uptime, response time, and throughput are typically included in SLAs to provide objective criteria for evaluating the provider's performance and to ensure accountability.","comment_id":"1411362"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":153,"answer":"D","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1743175740,"answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"g0VNgArPqd6K4AlHtzgi","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170062-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-254-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1743175740,"discussion":[{"poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1411363","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack renders the customer’s cloud inaccessible for 24 hours.\n\nThis situation is an example of an availability technical impact because it directly affects the ability of users to access the cloud services. Availability impacts involve disruptions in service access or functionality, which is precisely what occurs during a DDoS attack. Such attacks flood a service with excessive traffic, overwhelming the system and preventing legitimate users from accessing the services.","timestamp":"1743175800.0"}],"answer_description":"","exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170063-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-255-discussion/","question_id":168,"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following is an example of availability technical impact?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1743175800,"answer":"B","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:30:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"DdygbjA0WAmELyaKOVYA","choices":{"B":"Controls are the responsibility of the cloud service provider.","C":"Controls are the responsibility of the internal audit team.","D":"Controls are static and do not change.","A":"Controls adapt to changes in the threat landscape."},"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is MOST important for an auditor to understand regarding cloud security controls?","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:30:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Controls adapt to changes in the threat landscape.\n\nFor an auditor, it is most important to understand that cloud security controls need to adapt to changes in the threat landscape. The cloud environment is dynamic, and the threat landscape is constantly evolving, requiring security controls to be flexible and responsive to emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Understanding how controls can be adapted or updated ensures that the organization maintains an effective security posture in response to new risks, thereby protecting their data and operations in the cloud.","timestamp":"1743175800.0","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1411365"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":153,"answer":"A","topic":"1","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1743175800,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":169,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170064-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-256-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"fYSx5cFm48KNatX8Jhls","topic":"1","answer":"B","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:30:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1743175800,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1743175800.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
