Status of identified key security risks\n\nTo facilitate senior management's understanding of the impact on the organization, the most relevant information to include in an information security risk report is the status of identified key security risks. Senior management needs concise and significant information that directly relates to the organization's strategic objectives and operational integrity. Providing them with the current status of key security risks (including their severity, potential impact on business operations, and the measures taken or proposed for mitigation) directly supports strategic decision-making.\n\nThis information allows senior management to gauge how these risks might affect the organization's goals and what actions are needed to address them. Unlike the detailed technical specifics which might be less accessible to individuals without a technical background (options A, B, and C), focusing on the status of key risks provides a clear and immediate connection to business outcomes and priorities.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"helg420","comment_id":"1208271"},{"poster":"gigig76","content":"why C pen test finding is the answer?","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711115160.0","comment_id":"1180079"},{"comment_id":"1133084","timestamp":"1706334600.0","poster":"oluchecpoint","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

This ensures that data is handled and protected according to its level of sensitivity, and that only authorized personnel have access to it. Implementing role-based access controls, requiring the use of login credentials and passwords and conducting information security awareness training are all important measures to protect data, but creating a data classification policy is the most effective as it addresses the risk of data leakage from the root cause.","comment_id":"778891"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1673957460.0","comment_id":"778886","poster":"Broesweelies","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. A comparison of security incidents before and after software installation\nThe best way to determine if a recent investment in access control software was successful is to compare the number of security incidents that occurred before the software was installed with the number that occurred after it was installed. This will provide a clear indication of whether the software is effectively controlling access to systems and reducing the risk of security incidents. Other options, like senior management acceptance, business impact analysis and review of the number of key risk indicators implemented for the software are important but don't provide clear indication that software is effectively controlling access and reducing the risk of security incidents.","comments":[{"poster":"cosmo4ng","content":"This explanation is not for this question.","comment_id":"845043","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1679327640.0"}]},{"poster":"Prospect57","comment_id":"777222","timestamp":"1673829900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is my choice. \"Data Classification Policy defines sensitivity/classification levels and handling procedures for information/data for the protection of data at storage in a database, storage on a laptop, transmission via e-mail, and storage on backup media.\" However, if the question is asking for an immediate method in resolving this, then I understand RBAC limiting who has access to information based on \"least-privilege.\"","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"MyKasala","comment_id":"764397","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI guess A","timestamp":"1672740540.0"}],"question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST effective way to mitigate the risk of confidential data leakage to unauthorized stakeholders?","timestamp":"2023-01-03 11:09:00","isMC":true,"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","question_id":304,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Create a data classification policy.","D":"Conduct information security awareness training.","B":"Implement role-based access controls.","C":"Require the use of login credentials and passwords."},"answer_images":[]},{"id":"Hf9Ut6dvoccCEHnvxjWr","choices":{"D":"Outsource compliance activities.","A":"Obtain annual sign-off from executive management.","C":"Send the policies to stakeholders for review.","B":"Align the policies to the most stringent global regulations."},"timestamp":"2023-02-08 20:47:00","discussion":[{"content":"C.

This approach not only ensures adherence to local regulations but also provides a robust framework that can address various regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions.\n\nWhile obtaining annual sign-off from executive management (option A) and sending policies to stakeholders for review (option C) are valuable practices, aligning with the most stringent global regulations provides a comprehensive and proactive strategy for regulatory compliance.
