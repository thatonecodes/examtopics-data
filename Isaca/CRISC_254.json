Complex IT environments are more difficult to manage, maintain, and troubleshoot, which increases the potential for operational risk. Simplifying infrastructure allows for better control, clearer processes, easier monitoring, and faster identification and remediation of issues, ultimately reducing risk.","timestamp":"1742595180.0","poster":"faed87a","comment_id":"1401711"},{"poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"1009417","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Minimizing complexity of IT infrastructure.\n\nMinimizing the complexity of IT infrastructure is the most important factor for reducing IT operational risk. Complex IT environments are often more susceptible to operational failures, vulnerabilities, and errors. Simplicity in IT infrastructure can lead to more predictable and stable operations, making it easier to manage, monitor, and secure the technology environment.\n\nWhile increasing the frequency of data backups and improving senior management's understanding of IT operations are important measures, they are not as fundamental as reducing complexity. Decentralizing IT infrastructure can introduce additional risks if not managed properly, as it may lead to inconsistent control and management. Therefore, simplifying the IT environment should be a foundational step in reducing IT operational risk.","timestamp":"1726530900.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713277260.0","comment_id":"871828","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt is D.

This involves assessing the likelihood (frequency) of specific risks occurring and the potential impact (magnitude) they could have on the organization. Risk analysis considers various factors, including threats, vulnerabilities, and existing controls, to evaluate the overall risk exposure and prioritize risk management efforts.
