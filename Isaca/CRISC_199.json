Inform the IT manager of the concerns and propose measures to reduce them.\" The IT manager is responsible for the operation and management of the production system, and they need to be aware of any identified risks and potential vulnerabilities. The risk manager should communicate the findings and work collaboratively with the IT manager to propose and implement measures to mitigate or manage the identified risks.\n\nWhile involving process owners (option B) or the development team (option C) might be relevant depending on the context, it's important to inform the IT manager since they are directly responsible for the system's operation and security.
