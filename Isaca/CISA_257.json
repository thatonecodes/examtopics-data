Business impact analysis (BIA)\n\nBusiness impact analysis (BIA) is a method used to identify and evaluate the potential impact of various scenarios and disruptions on an organization's business operations. This includes assessing how IT systems and technology are integrated into the business processes and what the consequences would be in case of IT failures or changes.

Prior relationship with vendors","upvote_count":"6","poster":"saado9"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Prior relationship with vendors\n\nThe greatest potential impact on the independence of an IS auditor among the options listed is having a prior relationship with vendors. Independence is a critical concept in auditing, as it ensures that auditors can objectively assess the systems, processes, and controls they are evaluating without being influenced by personal or financial interests.\n\nHaving a prior relationship with vendors can compromise an auditor's independence because it may create conflicts of interest. \n\nWhile the other options (prior experience in IS audit, prior knowledge of technology, and prior job responsibilities) can also influence an auditor's perspective, they do not inherently create conflicts of interest in the same way that a prior relationship with vendors can. Independence is a fundamental principle in auditing, and auditors must strive to maintain it to ensure the integrity of their work.","upvote_count":"6","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1018457","timestamp":"1695791640.0"},{"comment_id":"1273432","content":"Selected Answer: B\ndifficult to choose between option B and option D, but i option D can still be mitigated by the auditor not performing the audit related to that job responsibility. but option B seems more exclusive.","timestamp":"1724763300.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1724771160.0","poster":"PurpleParrot","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1273528","content":"after reading ISACA's ITAF the answer is option D prior job responsibilities"}],"poster":"PurpleParrot","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1233657","content":"B is 100% correct answer","poster":"Sibsankar","timestamp":"1718891220.0"},{"timestamp":"1710657420.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is neither B nor C.

Confirm there are procedures in place to ensure organizational agreements address legal requirements\n\nIn highly regulated industries like banking, ensuring that organizational agreements address legal requirements is crucial. By confirming that procedures are in place to address these legal obligations, an IS auditor ensures that the organization has a structured approach to compliance. This step is vital to ascertain that all legal and regulatory requirements are being considered in the organizationâ€™s operations."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Identify industry-specific requirements that apply to the organization.\n\nIdentifying industry-specific requirements is a fundamental step in assessing compliance because it helps the IS auditor understand the specific regulatory and compliance standards that are relevant to the organization's operations in the banking industry. Once these requirements are identified, the auditor can proceed to evaluate how well the organization adheres to them and whether it has established the necessary procedures and documentation to ensure compliance.\n\nThe other options (A, B, and C) may be relevant to the assessment process, but they typically come after identifying the industry-specific requirements, as they involve evaluating adherence to those requirements and ensuring that organizational procedures align with legal and industry benchmarks.","timestamp":"1695791820.0","comment_id":"1018459","poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121528-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-822-discussion/"},{"id":"gQs2fRP7SQ8kEoWFMplJ","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1727414340.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1018463","poster":"SuperMax","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Business management\n\nThe primary responsibility for the design of IT controls to meet control objectives typically falls on the shoulders of business management. Business management is responsible for setting the overall objectives and requirements for IT controls that align with the organization's goals and compliance requirements. They determine what controls are necessary to mitigate risks and ensure the security and integrity of IT systems and data. While IT managers, internal auditors, and risk management teams may play supporting roles in this process, the ultimate responsibility for designing and implementing IT controls lies with the business management as they are the ones who have the most direct knowledge of the organization's specific needs and objectives."},{"content":"I agree, it should be C","comment_id":"958014","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1721531520.0","poster":"JONESKA"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"TEC1","timestamp":"1708032480.0","content":"C. Business management is primarily responsible for the design of IT controls to meet control objectives.\n\nIT controls are designed to mitigate the risks associated with IT systems and ensure that they operate effectively and efficiently. The responsibility for designing and implementing IT controls lies with the business management responsible for the system in question. Business management should identify the risks associated with the IT system and design IT controls to address those risks.\n\nIT managers are responsible for managing the IT system but may not have the necessary understanding of business objectives and risks to design effective IT controls. Internal auditors may review and assess the effectiveness of IT controls but are not responsible for designing them. Risk management may identify and assess risks, but it is ultimately the responsibility of business management to design controls to address those risks.","comment_id":"809999"}],"choices":{"C":"Business management","D":"Risk management","A":"IT manager","B":"Internal auditor"},"timestamp":"2023-02-15 22:28:00","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_id":1284,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/99322-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-825-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":156,"question_text":"Who is PRIMARILY responsible for the design of IT controls to meet control objectives?","unix_timestamp":1676496480,"answer":"C","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"5mt9ontB4qoqeXCg1fm8","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104019-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-827-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following risk scenarios is BEST addressed by implementing policies and procedures related to full disk encryption?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"851653","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1727407500.0","content":"Full disk encryption is a security control that protects data stored on devices such as laptops, desktops, and servers by encrypting the entire hard disk. If a device is stolen or lost, the encrypted data on the disk cannot be accessed without the appropriate decryption key or password.\n\nPhysical theft of media on which information is stored is a common threat to the confidentiality and integrity of organizational data. By implementing policies and procedures related to full disk encryption, organizations can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data in the event of a physical theft of a device containing the data.\n\nWhile policies and procedures related to full disk encryption may help prevent other risk scenarios, such as data leakage and unauthorized logical access, other security controls, such as access controls and data loss prevention, are better suited to address these scenarios.
