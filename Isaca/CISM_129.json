The main objective is to assess the effectiveness of existing security controls, identify vulnerabilities, and determine the potential impact of a real-world attack. By conducting penetration testing, organizations can gain insights into their security posture, validate the effectiveness of their security measures, and make informed decisions for improving their overall security.\n\nWhile identifying vulnerabilities at a particular point in time is a key aspect of penetration testing, the ultimate goal is to provide assurance and enhance the security of the network.","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"D for me as this is a point in time assessment","comment_id":"721168","poster":"Ziggybooboo","timestamp":"1684390920.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (81%)","C (19%)"],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-11-18 09:22:00","question_id":641,"exam_id":157,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"The PRIMARY purpose of a penetration test is to:","topic":"1"},{"id":"L2z6lJ1vhaWH8NcuU3ZR","exam_id":157,"question_id":642,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"CarlLimps","upvote_count":"12","timestamp":"1676402040.0","comment_id":"808728","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI like B because evaulating to the business strategy should have been done already."},{"upvote_count":"5","poster":"kortcl","comment_id":"883497","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI agree, the answer should be B.
