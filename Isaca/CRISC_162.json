According ISACA Crisc book 6th edition: Risk transfer is a decision to reduce loss by having another organization incur the cost. The most common\nexample of risk transfer is the purchasing of insurance, which provides a guarantee of compensation or\nreplacement should a loss occur.

Mitigation: This involves taking steps to reduce the severity or likelihood of the risk. A reciprocal agreement for disaster recovery is a form of mitigation. It reduces the impact of a disaster by ensuring that there are agreed-upon resources and support available from another organization, thereby lessening the potential damage or downtime. \"A\" would be wrong because Transfer involves shifting the risk to another party, typically through insurance or outsourcing. A reciprocal agreement, where two parties agree to assist each other in the event of a disaster, doesn't transfer the risk to another party; instead, it involves a mutual arrangement for support.","timestamp":"1720399380.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn the context of risk management, a reciprocal agreement for disaster recovery is a form of risk transfer.

A reciprocal agreement in which two organizations agree to provide computing resources to each other in the event of a disaster is a form of risk mitigation.
