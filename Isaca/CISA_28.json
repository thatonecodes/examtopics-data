However, CO2 systems pose a significant risk to human life because they can lead to suffocation if individuals are present in the area when the system discharges. Due to this risk, CO2 systems are often used in unoccupied spaces or are designed to allow for evacuation before discharge.\n\nIn addition to the risk to humans, the use of CO2 as a fire suppression agent does not remove the electrical energy that may have caused the fire, potentially allowing the fire to reignite once the CO2 has dissipated. Therefore, it's important that these systems be combined with an automatic switch to shut down the electricity supply in the event of activation. This helps ensure that the electrical source of the fire is also cut off, preventing re-ignition.","comment_id":"1191478","timestamp":"1712567340.0","poster":"mdh717"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCarbon dioxide (CO2): This gas displaces oxygen to extinguish fires. It displaces oxygen so rapidly that it can cause suffocation in occupied spaces.

Surveys completed by randomly selected employees: Surveys completed by randomly selected employees can provide the best evidence of the training's effectiveness. Surveys can be designed to assess employees' knowledge, understanding, and application of the security policies taught during the training. Randomly selecting employees ensures that the sample is representative of the entire population of employees, which increases the validity of the results. Surveys can also be conducted periodically to track changes in employees' knowledge and behavior over time.\nTherefore, option B, surveys completed by randomly selected employees, is the best evidence of the training's effectiveness as it provides a comprehensive evaluation of the employees' knowledge and understanding of the security policies.","poster":"3008","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"shiowbah","timestamp":"1695462600.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1014793","content":"A.
