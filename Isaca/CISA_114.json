The IS auditor's primary concern is whether the risk has been mitigated.\nCommunication of inefficiencies: The manual explicitly states auditors should \"note the deviation in implementation from the plan\" and document operational inefficiencies even when risks are addressed1. This aligns with the requirement to report suboptimal controls while acknowledging risk reduction.\nEscalation criteria: Escalation (Option D) applies only when risks remain unaddressed.
