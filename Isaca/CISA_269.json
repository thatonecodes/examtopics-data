Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Job dependencies are undefined: While undefined job dependencies can lead to issues, such as jobs running out of order or failing due to missing prerequisites, this may not be the greatest concern if the organization has other mechanisms in place to handle job failures or re-run jobs as needed.\n\nB. Job processing procedures are missing: Missing job processing procedures can indeed lead to a lack of documentation and standardization, but it may not be the greatest concern if jobs are otherwise functioning correctly.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1695874140.0","content":"C. Most jobs are run manually: This can be a significant concern as manual execution of jobs can introduce human errors, inconsistency, and increased operational costs. However, it may not be the greatest concern if the manual process is well-documented and managed effectively.\n\nD. Jobs are executed during working hours: This could be the greatest concern, especially if critical jobs are scheduled during normal working hours. Running jobs during working hours can impact system performance and disrupt business operations. It may lead to increased downtime or reduced availability during peak business hours.\n\nGiven the potential impact on business operations and system performance, option D, \"Jobs are executed during working hours,\" would likely be the GREATEST concern to an IS auditor reviewing an organization's job scheduling practices. However, it's essential to consider the specific context and requirements of the organization when making this determination, as all the options mentioned could be significant concerns depending on the circumstances.","comment_id":"1019402","poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"SuperMax"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe greatest concern to an IS auditor reviewing an organization’s job scheduling practices is when job dependencies are undefined.

Integration testing\n\nWhite box testing is a method where the internal structure, design, and code of a software application are examined. It is often used at the integration testing level to verify that different components or modules of the software work together correctly, and the focus is on understanding the internal logic and code paths to ensure proper integration.\n\nWhile white box testing can be used at other stages of testing to some extent, it is most commonly associated with integration testing and unit testing, which focus on the internal workings of the software.

Distributing disciplinary policies\n\nDistributing disciplinary policies is a deterrent security control that reduces the likelihood of an insider threat event. By clearly communicating the consequences of insider threats through disciplinary policies, organizations can discourage employees from engaging in malicious or unauthorized activities. This control establishes expectations for behavior and serves as a deterrent against insider threats by making employees aware of the potential consequences they may face if they engage in malicious actions.\n\nThe other options (A, C, and D) are not necessarily deterrent controls","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1019405"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following is a deterrent security control that reduces the likelihood of an insider threat event?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121625-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-894-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer":"B","timestamp":"2023-09-28 06:12:00","question_id":1343},{"id":"p7uWCk45iKQnR0RkyQnK","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-09-28 06:14:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121626-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-896-discussion/","choices":{"D":"Check sums","C":"Hash totals","B":"Data analytics","A":"Integrated test facility (ITF)"},"exam_id":156,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
