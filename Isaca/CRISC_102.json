The organization’s risk appetite\n\nThe organization’s risk appetite guides decision-making regarding the acceptable level of risk exposure.\nThe risk owner should align their decision with the organization's overall risk appetite to ensure consistency in risk tolerance across the organization.\nWhile other considerations such as industry risk standards, external audit opinions, and the likelihood of risk materialization are important, they should be evaluated in the context of the organization’s specific risk appetite. The organization's risk appetite serves as a foundational principle for risk acceptance decisions.","comment_id":"1110635","poster":"K5000ism"},{"timestamp":"1711654620.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"krishccie","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD it is","comment_id":"1020134"},{"comment_id":"1005290","upvote_count":"1","poster":"HS2804","timestamp":"1710213540.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAcceptance mainly based on Risk appetite."},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1707133080.0","comment_id":"972851","content":"D.

Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data. Migration failures introduce significant risk of corrupting, damaging, or losing data altogether. This compromises all subsequent analysis, reporting, and decisions relying on that data across the organization.\n\nWhile system performance, cost overruns, and availability of test data in choices B, C and D are worries, compromised data integrity can have the furthest-reaching impacts on business processes organization-wide.\n\nTherefore, a risk practitioner should be most concerned with confirming data stability and integrity first when encountering data migration issues. Confirming this critical quality protects decision-making, customer service, reporting accuracy and more which all depend on high-quality data.","poster":"Kennethlim79"},{"poster":"Cclantic","comment_id":"1039600","upvote_count":"1","content":"because the option describe is \"test data\". so i think the answer will be a.","timestamp":"1712759940.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nIf data is not available then everything is lost","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711653300.0","poster":"krishccie","comment_id":"1020120"}],"answers_community":["A (67%)","D (33%)"],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following should be a risk practitioner’s GREATEST concern upon learning of failures in a data migration activity?","exam_id":160,"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"name":"CRISC","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"provider":"Isaca","numberOfQuestions":1422,"id":160,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":102},"__N_SSP":true}
