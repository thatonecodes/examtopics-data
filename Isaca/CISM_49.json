The corresponding controls are viewed as prohibitive to business operations.\n\nWhen an organization's new information security policy is not being followed across all departments, the greatest concern for an information security manager should be that the controls outlined in the policy are viewed as prohibitive to business operations. This indicates a significant disconnect between the security measures and practical business functions, suggesting that the security controls may be overly restrictive, poorly designed, or not well integrated with current business processes.\n\nThis is a critical concern because if security controls hinder business operations, it leads to a higher likelihood of non-compliance as departments might bypass or ignore these controls to meet business objectives.
