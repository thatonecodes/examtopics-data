Rollbacks demonstrate that changes passed through planning and approval but failed in production, directly highlighting weaknesses in testing, quality assurance, or implementation controls. This aligns with the CISA Manual’s emphasis on failed changes as an audit concern (Section 2.2.9, p. 117) and the importance of rollback plans to mitigate issues (Section 4.8, p. 290). While emergency changes (B) are concerning, their impact depends on execution success, making rollbacks a more definitive red flag when reviewing historical tickets.","timestamp":"1741869360.0","comment_id":"1388294","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"9d83d68","content":"Selected Answer: B\nemergency test can bypass change management","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1734106080.0","comment_id":"1326187"},{"comment_id":"1262737","timestamp":"1723175700.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"PurpleParrot","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA high number of rollback changes suggests that changes are frequently failing or causing problems, which points to underlying issues in the change management process."}],"timestamp":"2024-08-09 05:55:00","question_id":502,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (80%)","B (20%)"],"answer":"C","exam_id":156,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/145269-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1701-discussion/"},{"id":"jOHxYNC4Edn1atDGWETM","timestamp":"2025-03-13 13:42:00","answer":"D","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741869720.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe biometric authentication prevents unauthorized access by verifying employee identity before entry, fitting the preventive control definition.
