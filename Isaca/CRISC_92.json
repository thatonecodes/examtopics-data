To ensure IT risk impact can be compared to the IT risk appetite\n\nAggregating the impact of IT risk scenarios allows organizations to assess and understand the cumulative impact of various risks. By reflecting these results in the enterprise risk register, the organization can compare the aggregated impact to its IT risk appetite.

Through this analysis, various risk scenarios can be identified, where a risk scenario typically involves a combination of a threat, vulnerability, and potential impact. Establishing risk scenarios helps organizations understand and prioritize potential risks in the IT environment, allowing for the development of effective risk management strategies and controls.","timestamp":"1719695160.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"K5000ism","comment_id":"1110118"}],"timestamp":"2023-12-31 00:06:00","question_id":457,"question_text":"An IT risk threat analysis is BEST used to establish:","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"risk maps.","D":"risk appetite.","A":"risk scenarios.","C":"risk ownership."},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","exam_id":160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/129936-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1439-discussion/"},{"id":"746HMrrD1vCedRUFq6pC","discussion":[{"comment_id":"293314","poster":"jfarrelly","upvote_count":"9","timestamp":"1723974360.0","content":"Choose 3 (would have been helpful) :-)"}],"choices":{"C":"Risk register updates","A":"Risk Priority Number","D":"Project management plan and Project document updates","B":"Residual risk","E":"Risk-related contract decisions"},"question_id":458,"answer":"CDE","timestamp":"2021-02-18 12:46:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/45093-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-144-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"question_text":"What are the various outputs of risk response?","answer_ET":"CDE","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1613648760,"exam_id":160,"answer_description":"The outputs of the risk response planning process are:\n✑ Risk Register Updates: The risk register is written in detail so that it can be related to the priority ranking and the planned response.\n✑ Risk Related Contract Decisions: Risk related contract decisions are the decisions to transmit risk, such as services, agreements for insurance, and other items as required.

Hence it acts as one of the inputs of risk response and is not the output of it.\nB: Residual risk is not an output of risk response. Residual risk is the risk that remains after applying controls. It is not feasible to eliminate all risks from an organization. Instead, measures can be taken to reduce risk to an acceptable level. The risk that is left is residual risk. As,\n\nRisk = Threat Vulnerability -\nand\nTotal risk = Threat Vulnerability Asset Value\nResidual risk can be calculated with the following formula:\nResidual Risk = Total Risk - Controls\nSenior management is responsible for any losses due to residual risk. They decide whether a risk should be avoided, transferred, mitigated or accepted. They also decide what controls to implement.

Assess the residual risk against the organization’s risk appetite.\n\nBy assessing the residual risk in relation to the organization's risk appetite, the practitioner can determine if the remaining level of risk is acceptable within the organization's established thresholds. This approach is data-driven and aligns with standard risk management practices. It provides a clear basis for decision-making and can inform whether additional actions are required, such as implementing more controls or seeking formal risk acceptance from senior management.","poster":"Kennethlim79","timestamp":"1717385880.0","comment_id":"1086625","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1023370","poster":"eblue","timestamp":"1712080980.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD seems best answer"}],"timestamp":"2023-10-02 20:03:00","question_id":459,"question_text":"A risk practitioner has been asked to mark an identified control deficiency as remediated, despite concerns that the risk level is still too high.

Current annualized loss expectancy report\n\nThe annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is a key metric in risk management that combines the probability of a loss event occurring with the potential financial impact. Communicating the current ALE to senior management is crucial for helping them understand the financial implications of the risks the organization faces and determining the appropriate level of insurance coverage needed.
