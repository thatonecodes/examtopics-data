It is important for a support team to track ticket reopen rate, as this can provide insight into how well their customer service is performing. \nReopen rates provide a direct measure of customer satisfaction with the service they receive and can help determine where improvements need to be made.

This can result in the loss or corruption of data during the migration process, leading to significant operational disruptions, data loss, and potentially compliance issues.\n\nWhile lack of data transformation rules (option A) is also a significant risk, having obsolete or incompatible data backups poses a more immediate and critical threat to the success of the data conversion and migration process.

One of the greatest risks is the lack of data transformation rules. These rules are crucial for ensuring that the data from the old system can be accurately and effectively used in the new system.
