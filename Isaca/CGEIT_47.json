Data modeling.\n\nData modeling involves the process of defining and organizing data elements and their relationships within a database or system. It helps establish standards and guidelines for structuring data in a consistent and logical manner, which in turn reduces the likelihood of data duplication and promotes data consistency throughout the enterprise.\n\nBy creating standardized data models, organizations can ensure that data is organized and represented uniformly across different systems, applications, and business units. This consistency makes it easier to identify and eliminate duplicate records, maintain data integrity, and facilitate data integration and sharing across the organization.","timestamp":"1725884040.0","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1169540"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1709993640,"topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"Which aspect of information governance BEST enables an enterprise to avoid duplication of records and promote consistency of data?","question_images":[],"question_id":234},{"id":"9dUbHI4uXyenhgACE7Lk","isMC":true,"exam_id":155,"answer":"D","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
