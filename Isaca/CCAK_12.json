Evaluate the service level agreement (SLA) through a BCP/DR lens.\n\nThis option is most appropriate because it involves examining the SLA to ensure that it adequately addresses BCP and DR considerations. The auditor should assess whether the SLA includes provisions for continuity and recovery in the event of disruptions, and whether these provisions align with the organization's business continuity and recovery objectives. This evaluation helps ensure that the cloud service provider's commitments are sufficient to meet the organization's needs in a BCP/DR scenario.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1387988","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1741798020.0"},{"timestamp":"1728979920.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"a5g","comment_id":"870759","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCCAK study guide page 306 - \n“The auditor also evaluates the cloud SLA through a BCP/DR lens to identify the recovery timeline for the service and the potential impact, or whether the organization accepts the risk.”"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCCAK study guide page 306 - \n“The auditor also evaluates the cloud SLA through a BCP/DR lens to identify the recovery timeline for the service and the potential impact, or whether the organization accepts the risk.”","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"858451","poster":"Kolusanya","timestamp":"1727836020.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"A"},{"id":"uHnZgPU0WA0QJHcCcnzm","topic":"1","question_id":57,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133871-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-153-discussion/","answer":"A","exam_id":153,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"When capturing compliance objectives within an organization’s cloud policy, it is MOST important for stakeholders to:","timestamp":"2024-02-14 15:55:00","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741798140.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. take into consideration the organization’s risk appetite.\n\nWhen capturing compliance objectives within an organization’s cloud policy, it is most important for stakeholders to take into consideration the organization’s risk appetite. This is because risk appetite defines the level and types of risk an organization is willing to accept in order to achieve its objectives. Aligning compliance objectives with the organization's risk appetite ensures that the cloud policy is tailored to the specific risk tolerance and strategic goals of the organization, facilitating effective risk management and decision-making processes.","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1387991","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nP#311 Risk perspective involves evaluating how the program has a comprehensive perspective on sources of risk and evaluating the alignment between the compliance objectives and risk appetite.\nP# 312 The alignment between compliance objectives and risk appetite is accomplished by leveraging tools such as dashboards or records of vulnerability information.

Among the options provided, the most important step is:\n\nB. Test and validate that the new service meets predefined security targets.\n\nTesting and validating the new cloud service against predefined security targets is essential to ensure that it meets the necessary regulatory and compliance requirements. This process involves assessing whether the service provides the required security controls, data protection measures, and compliance features that align with the organization's regulatory obligations. By thoroughly evaluating the service before fully transitioning, you can mitigate risks associated with noncompliance and ensure that the new service supports your organization's compliance strategy effectively.","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"comment_id":"858505","timestamp":"1727841600.0","poster":"Kolusanya","content":"\"equipment\" in the question should be \"requirements\"","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"id":"8z0MQv7zLCar4V0dFFBf","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"From a systems development life cycle perspective, where a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider follows a DevOps approach, it is MOST beneficial for continuous auditing controls to be:","choices":{"D":"evaluated with high frequency.","C":"integrated with external tools.","A":"designed natively into the software.","B":"subjected to independent review."},"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFrom a systems development life cycle perspective, particularly when a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider follows a DevOps approach, it is MOST beneficial for continuous auditing controls to be:\n\nA. designed natively into the software.\n\nDesigning auditing controls natively into the software ensures that these controls are an integral part of the system from the outset. This approach aligns well with the DevOps philosophy, which emphasizes collaboration and integration throughout the development process. By embedding auditing controls directly into the software, organizations can ensure consistent and automated monitoring, making it easier to detect and address issues as they arise. This also facilitates real-time compliance and security management, which is critical in a fast-paced DevOps environment.","timestamp":"1741798440.0","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1387994"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"339dfab","timestamp":"1729104000.0","comment_id":"1298880","content":"CCAK Study Guide.

The auditor should review the relationship between the cloud service provider and its service provider to help direct and estimate the level of effort and analysis the auditor should apply.\n\nThis option is the best approach because understanding the contractual and operational relationships between the cloud service provider and its underlying service providers is crucial. It helps the auditor assess how the dependencies and shared responsibilities might impact the security, compliance, and performance of the cloud services being provided to the customer. This understanding guides the auditor in determining the extent to which they need to evaluate the controls and processes of the third-party service providers, ensuring a comprehensive audit.","timestamp":"1741807980.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1388044"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCCAK P# 67 Cloud customers can be challenged to show auditors that the organization is in compliance.
