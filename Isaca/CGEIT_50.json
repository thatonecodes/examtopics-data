Loss of data confidentiality\n\nOutsourcing customer call center operations to a vendor with access to systems from offshore locations poses the greatest risk of data confidentiality loss. This risk arises due to the potential exposure of sensitive customer information to individuals who may not be subject to the same data protection laws and regulations as those in the institution's home country. Additionally, offshore locations may have different standards for data security and privacy, increasing the likelihood of data breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information. Therefore, ensuring data confidentiality is of paramount importance when considering outsourcing arrangements, especially in industries like finance where privacy and security are critical concerns.","poster":"SuperMax"}],"exam_id":155,"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2024-03-10 08:26:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/135627-exam-cgeit-topic-1-question-402-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1710055560,"question_id":250}],"exam":{"id":155,"provider":"Isaca","name":"CGEIT","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":362,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":50},"__N_SSP":true}
