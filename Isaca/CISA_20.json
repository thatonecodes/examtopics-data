If the management agreement is documented, it will be the basis for checking whether the recommendation was implemented and, if implemented, what its effect was. It will also be an important source of information when prioritizing recommendations and understanding the progress of their implementation.\n\nThe qualifications of B's previous auditor also have a certain meaning, but the auditor's qualifications and experience are only indicators for judging the appropriateness and feasibility of the recommendations.

Key verification falls into this category because it detects data entry errors after the initial entry by comparing it against a second entry.\nCompensating Control: A compensating control is an alternative control put in place to mitigate the risk when the primary control is deemed inadequate or is not feasible. It's essentially a backup measure, used when the preferred method of controlling a risk is too costly or complex. Compensating controls are generally used to achieve the same control objective as the primary control."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nKey verification is a form of detective control. It is designed to detect errors or discrepancies in data entry after the initial entry has occurred. By having data entered twice, usually by two different individuals, and then comparing the two sets of data, discrepancies can be identified and corrected. This process happens after the initial data entry error occurs, hence it is a detective control, not a preventive one.","timestamp":"1719809340.0","poster":"KAP2HURUF","comment_id":"1110989"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1070092","poster":"FAGFUR","timestamp":"1715663280.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe bank has implemented a Detective control.
