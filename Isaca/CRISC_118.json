Failure modes and effects analysis\n\nFailure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is one of the best methods for discovering high-impact risk types. FMEA is a systematic approach for identifying and assessing potential failure modes within a system, process, or product. It helps you determine the effects of these failure modes and prioritize them based on their impact.\n\nFMEA is particularly effective at identifying high-impact risks because it considers not only the potential consequences of failures (effects) but also the likelihood of those failures occurring (frequency or occurrence). By multiplying the severity of the effect, the likelihood of occurrence, and the ability to detect or mitigate the failure, you can calculate a risk priority number (RPN) that helps prioritize risks. This means that high-impact risks are more likely to have higher RPNs and thus be identified as a priority for mitigation.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"SuperMax"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":590,"answer_description":"Failure modes and effects analysis is used in discovering high-impact risk types.\nFMEA:\nâœ‘ Is one of the tools used within the Six Sigma methodology to design and implement a robust process to:\n- Identify failure modes\n- Establish a risk priority so that corrective actions can be put in place to address and reduce the risk\n- Helps in identifying and documenting where in the process the source of the failure impacts the (internal or external) customer\n- Is used to determine failure modes and assess risk posed by the process and thus, to the enterprise as a whole'\nIncorrect Answers:\nA, D: These two are the methods of analyzing risk, but not specifically for high-impact risk types. Hence is not the best answer.\nB: Delphi is a technique to identify potential risk. In this technique, the responses are gathered via a question: and their inputs are organized according to their contents. The collected responses are sent back to these experts for further input, addition, and comments. The final list of risks in the project is prepared after that. The participants in this technique are anonymous and therefore it helps prevent a person from unduly influencing the others in the group. The Delphi technique helps in reaching the consensus quickly.","timestamp":"2023-10-11 15:24:00","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1697030640,"question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Qualitative risk analysis","B":"Delphi technique","D":"Quantitative risk analysis","C":"Failure modes and effects analysis"},"answer":"C","exam_id":160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/123306-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-157-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST method for discovering high-impact risk types?"}],"exam":{"name":"CRISC","isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Isaca","numberOfQuestions":1422,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"id":160},"currentPage":118},"__N_SSP":true}
