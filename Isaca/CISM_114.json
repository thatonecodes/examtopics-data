Review the vendor contract.\n\nBefore taking any technical actions or conducting penetration tests, it's essential to review the vendor contract thoroughly. This is because the contract may contain specific provisions related to security, access, and remote monitoring. It will provide valuable insights into the agreed-upon security measures, responsibilities, and the scope of access granted to the vendor.

Review the vendor contract.\n\nReviewing the vendor contract is the first step because it allows the information security manager to understand the terms and conditions related to the vendor's access and responsibilities. The contract should outline the specific security requirements and controls that the vendor is obligated to adhere to, including measures for protecting the retailer's systems and data. By reviewing the contract, the information security manager can verify if the vendor's access is authorized and if it aligns with the retailer's security expectations.","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1694195880.0","comment_id":"833338","content":"Selected Answer: C\nContract first","poster":"CarlPTY07"},{"poster":"Broesweelies","timestamp":"1690207500.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"786677","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Review the vendor contract.\n\nThe first step that the information security manager should take is to review the vendor contract, as it will provide important information about the vendor's access rights and responsibilities. The contract should detail what type of access the vendor has, what data they are able to access, and what measures are in place to protect that data. The review of vendor contract will help the manager understand the scope of the vendor's access and the security controls that are in place to protect the organization's data. Based on the findings, further action can be taken such as reviewing vendor's technical security controls, conducting a penetration test or even disconnecting the real-time access."},{"timestamp":"1686922560.0","comment_id":"747338","poster":"aokisan","content":"Selected Answer: C\nat first, review the contract.","upvote_count":"3"}],"exam_id":157},{"id":"28MgqMVEE6QEDGK7Z1tb","topic":"1","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1668074820,"discussion":[{"poster":"Ziggybooboo","upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"715127","content":"Prevents IP spoofing attacks","timestamp":"1683706020.0"},{"poster":"D2D2","timestamp":"1685840760.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD should be the answer","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"734813"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nReverse lookups are commonly used by email servers.

Define incident classification.\n\nOne of the key things that management can do to rectify the issue of key stakeholders taking too long to decide whether an application should be shut down following a security breach is to define incident classification. Incident classification is the process of categorizing incidents based on their severity and potential impact on the organization. By clearly defining the different levels of incidents, management can establish clear criteria for when an application should be shut down and can ensure that key stakeholders are aware of these criteria. This will help to ensure that decisions regarding application shutdowns are made quickly and effectively in the event of a security breach, which is crucial for containing the damage and minimizing the impact of the incident.","timestamp":"1706112480.0","poster":"Broesweelies","comment_id":"786682","upvote_count":"13"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"991319","timestamp":"1724749500.0","poster":"Agamennore","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIMHO is D, it’s required a different containment provedure"},{"comment_id":"991011","poster":"Bl1024","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe more accurate response would be D.\nThey could not decide ifvthe app should be shutdown, that sould be defined in the containment prosedure, leaving no room for debate.","timestamp":"1724701380.0"},{"comment_id":"971516","timestamp":"1722726240.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nShit question.

Such decisions are much easier to make if there are predetermined strategies and procedures for containing the incident. \n\nOrganizations should define acceptable risks in dealing with incidents and develop strategies accordingly.\n\nContainment strategies vary based on the type of incident.
