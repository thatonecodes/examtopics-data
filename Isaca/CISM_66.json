Assess risks introduced by the technology\n\nBefore implementing any new technology, it is important to assess the risks it may introduce to the organization. This includes identifying and evaluating potential security risks, as well as assessing the impact of those risks on the organization's operations and assets. Once the risks have been identified, the information security manager can develop an appropriate risk mitigation strategy and determine if the benefits of implementing the technology outweigh the risks. By assessing risks first, the information security manager can help ensure that the organization's objectives are met in a secure and controlled manner.","comment_id":"783138","timestamp":"1689924360.0","poster":"Broesweelies","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1689636360.0","poster":"Prospect57","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMy choice is C.
