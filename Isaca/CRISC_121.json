However, in the scenario provided, where a critical vulnerability has been discovered in a regulatory reporting system, the immediate action of escalating the risk to senior management is crucial to ensure that timely and appropriate decisions can be made to address the vulnerability and mitigate potential negative consequences. Senior management has the authority and resources to take action quickly and effectively in response to such a critical risk.","comment_id":"1237204","timestamp":"1719379320.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"RmcALjE7odZEjEyFdR3z","answer_ET":"B","question_id":603,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe primary driver for an organization on a multi-year cloud implementation to publish a cloud security policy should be:\n\nB. Establishing minimum cloud security requirements.\n\nPublishing a cloud security policy primarily serves to define and establish the minimum security requirements that must be met in the cloud environment. This is crucial for ensuring that the organization's move to the cloud does not compromise its overall security posture. Such a policy sets clear standards and guidelines for how cloud services should be securely configured, used, and managed. It forms the baseline for all cloud-related security measures and helps ensure consistency and compliance across the organization's cloud initiatives.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1122200","poster":"Abbey2","timestamp":"1720917180.0"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/131138-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1595-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following should be the PRIMARY driver for an organization on a multi-year cloud implementation to publish a cloud security policy?","choices":{"A":"Evaluating gaps in the on-premise and cloud security profiles","D":"Educating IT staff on variances between on-premise and cloud security","B":"Establishing minimum cloud security requirements","C":"Enforcing compliance with cloud security parameters"},"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","timestamp":"2024-01-14 03:33:00","unix_timestamp":1705199580},{"id":"JoCAAsKbx203T9cONvjR","choices":{"D":"Architecture responsibilities may not be clearly defined.","A":"Due diligence for the recommended cloud vendor has not been performed.","B":"The business can introduce new Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions without IT approval.","C":"The maintenance of IT infrastructure has been outsourced to an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider."},"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"A","question_images":[],"question_text":"An organization's IT team has proposed the adoption of cloud computing as a cost-saving measure for the business.

Due diligence for the recommended cloud vendor has not been performed.\n\nDue diligence is a critical step in the process of adopting any new technology, especially when it involves cloud computing. It involves evaluating the cloud vendor's security measures, compliance with relevant regulations, reliability, data governance practices, and overall reputation. Failing to perform due diligence could expose the organization to various risks, including data breaches, compliance issues, service outages, and other security vulnerabilities. Ensuring that the vendor meets the organization's security and compliance requirements is paramount to protect its assets and reputation.","comment_id":"1122210","poster":"Abbey2"}],"exam_id":160},{"id":"1zZY9GbFCc5fJWOz7DQY","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1731411000,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Enterprise Architecture (EA) documentation provides the most useful information for tracing the impact of aggregated risk across an organization’s technical environment.
