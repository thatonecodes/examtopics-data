Unless it is a private cloud environment (and sometimes even if it is), taking bit-for-bit copy of hard-disk for instance may not be allowed because the resources are shared.","timestamp":"1695305880.0","poster":"CISSPST","comment_id":"1013158","upvote_count":"6"}],"poster":"dark_3k03r","content":"Expanding on MSKid, the correct answer is B cause trying to acquire additional hardware during an incident is nearly impossible as contracts, procurement, legal, etc.. will need to get involved. But with non-standard logs all you need to do is run it through a parser to normalize the logs and you should be fine. This is why (A) is not the answer.

Access to the hardware\n\nIn a cloud technology environment, one of the greatest challenges to the investigation of security incidents is access to the hardware. Cloud environments typically abstract the hardware layer from users, which means that customers do not have direct access to the physical servers, network equipment, or storage devices where their data is processed and stored. This limitation can significantly impede forensic investigations, as investigators may require physical access to gather evidence, analyze hardware configurations, or perform other forensic tasks that are simply not possible in a cloud setting where the infrastructure is managed by a service provider.","comment_id":"1208241"},{"comment_id":"1186815","poster":"Thavee","timestamp":"1711891140.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nStandard or non standard Log is likely not an issue at all. All type of logs are never be the same but they are understandable. Otherwise, Linux /Var/log and Windows Event logs must be problematic. Access to the hardware is the challenge.

Data encryption\n\nData encryption is a significant challenge when investigating security incidents in a cloud environment because it can make it extremely difficult to access and analyze the data that is encrypted. If data is properly encrypted, even if an attacker gains access to it, they will not be able to decipher it without the encryption keys. This can hinder the investigation process, as investigators may not be able to determine the nature and extent of a security incident or breach. In contrast, the other options (A, B, and D) can also pose challenges but are typically more manageable compared to the encryption of data."},{"timestamp":"1696507560.0","poster":"Perseus_68","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nGetting your cloud provider to give you access to their servers or other hardware is next to impossible while non-standard logs are a challenge, you can solve that.

Why would you need access to the hardware to investigate an incident? You think AWS is going to let their customers access their hardware? lolol. No customer gets access to the hardware. That's a moot option. It's not a challenge because it's not needed.
