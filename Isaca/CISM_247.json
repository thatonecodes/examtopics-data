In such cases, solely relying on trend analysis might not be sufficient to support the business case for implementing an anti-ransomware solution.\n\nA more comprehensive approach would involve considering various factors, including the potential impact and cost of ransomware attacks, the evolving tactics used by ransomware operators, industry-specific threats, regulatory requirements, and the organization's risk tolerance. Additionally, conducting a threat and vulnerability assessment (Option B) could provide a deeper understanding of the specific risks and vulnerabilities faced by the organization, helping to tailor the implementation of anti-ransomware solutions effectively.\n\nTherefore, while trend analysis of ransomware attacks can provide valuable insights, it should be complemented by other assessments and considerations to build a robust business case for implementing anti-ransomware solutions.","comment_id":"1142836","poster":"Jay2021aws"},{"comment_id":"1134857","timestamp":"1706526420.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI'm gonna go on a limb and say it's D.

A threat and vulnerability assessment.\n\nA threat and vulnerability assessment helps identify the specific risks and vulnerabilities that a business may face in relation to ransomware attacks. By conducting such an assessment, the business can gain a clear understanding of its current security posture and identify any weaknesses or gaps that need to be addressed. This information can then be used to make a compelling case for implementing an anti-ransomware solution, as it provides concrete evidence of the potential risks and the need for proactive measures to mitigate them.","comment_id":"1043129","timestamp":"1697259180.0","poster":"koala_lay"},{"timestamp":"1695530040.0","comments":[{"content":"threat & vulnerability is not how risk is defined, but rather likelihood and impact.","timestamp":"1706526540.0","poster":"AlexJacobson","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1134859"}],"comment_id":"1015487","poster":"CISSPST","content":"Selected Answer: B\nRisk assessment (threat & vulnerability) is the most compelling case to get approval for an anti-ransomware investment. \n\nIndustry benchmark or trend analysis do not make sense unless you present evidence of how it is impacting the organization.
