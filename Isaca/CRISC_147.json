The acceptable variation relative to the achievement of an objective is termed as risk tolerance. In other words, risk tolerance is the acceptable deviation from the level set by the risk appetite and business objectives.\nRisk tolerance is defined at the enterprise level by the board and clearly communicated to all stakeholders. A process should be in place to review and approve any exceptions to such standards.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA, C: Risk appetite level is not relevant in triggering of risk response process. Risk appetite is the amount of risk a company or other entity is willing to accept in pursuit of its mission. This is the responsibility of the board to decide risk appetite of an enterprise. When considering the risk appetite levels for the enterprise, the following two major factors should be taken into account:\n✑ The enterprise's objective capacity to absorb loss, e.g., financial loss, reputation damage, etc.\n✑ The culture towards risk taking-cautious or aggressive. In other words, the amount of loss the enterprise wants to accept in pursue of its objective fulfillment.\nD: Risk response process is triggered when the risk level increases the risk tolerance level of the enterprise, and not when it just equates the risk tolerance level.","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-10-13 05:23:00","answer":"B","choices":{"D":"Risk level equates the risk tolerance","A":"Risk level increases above risk appetite","C":"Risk level equates risk appetite","B":"Risk level increase above risk tolerance"},"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"SuperMax","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe trigger for the risk response process typically depends on an organization's risk management framework and specific policies. However, in many cases, the trigger is when the risk level increases above the established risk tolerance (Option B).\n\nRisk tolerance represents the acceptable level of risk that an organization is willing to take or tolerate, and when the actual risk exceeds this threshold, it is considered a trigger for the risk response process.\n\nIn contrast, risk appetite (Options A and C) is usually a broader and strategic consideration that informs an organization's willingness to take on risk in pursuit of its objectives. Equating risk appetite (Option C) may not necessarily be a trigger for the risk response process because it might be within the organization's acceptable boundaries.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1042228","timestamp":"1728789780.0"}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which among the following acts as a trigger for risk response process?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/123474-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-254-discussion/","question_id":731,"unix_timestamp":1697167380,"exam_id":160,"isMC":true},{"id":"w6CRFmPxHLpL03ND5Esj","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/123475-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-257-discussion/","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1697167440,"question_id":732,"timestamp":"2023-10-13 05:24:00","question_text":"Which of the following is true for Single loss expectancy (SLE), Annual rate of occurrence (ARO), and Annual loss expectancy (ALE)?","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer":"D","exam_id":160,"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_description":"A quantitative risk assessment quantifies risk in terms of numbers such as dollar values. This involves gathering data and then entering it into standard formulas.\nThe results can help in identifying the priority of risks. These results are also used to determine the effectiveness of controls. Some of the terms associated with quantitative risk assessments are:\n✑ Single loss expectancy (SLE)-It refers to the total loss expected from a single incident. This incident can occur when vulnerability is being exploited by threat.\nThe loss is expressed as a dollar value such as $1,000. It includes the value of data, software, and hardware. SLE = Asset value * Exposure factor\n✑ Annual rate of occurrence (ARO)-It refers to the number of times expected for an incident to occur in a year. If an incident occurred twice a month in the past year, the ARO is 24. Assuming nothing changes, it is likely that it will occur 24 times next year. Annual loss expectancy (ALE)-It is the expected loss for a year.\nALE is calculated by multiplying SLE with ARO. Because SLE is a given in a dollar value, ALE is also given in a dollar value. For example, if the SLE is $1,000 and the ARO is 24, the ALE is $24,000.\n✑ ALE = SLE * ARO Safeguard value-This is the cost of a control. Controls are used to mitigate risk. For example, antivirus software of an average cost of $50 for each computer. If there are 50 computers, the safeguard value is $2,500.
