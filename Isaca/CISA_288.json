When an IS auditor is asked to investigate critical business applications that have been producing suspicious results, the first step should be to review the configuration management processes and procedures that are in place. This will help the auditor to understand how the applications are being managed and controlled, and it will provide a basis for identifying any potential issues or vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the suspicious results.","timestamp":"1672367340.0","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"761622","comments":[{"poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1695959880.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1020427","content":"Control Design and Configuration Management: While evaluating control design (option A) and reviewing configuration management (option C) are essential aspects of IT auditing, they often come later in the process.
