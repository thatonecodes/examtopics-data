The risk practitioner should determine why the business owner is using the application, what data it processes, and what level of risk it presents to the organization.\nOnce the purpose of the application is understood, the risk practitioner can work with the business owner to evaluate the risk and determine the appropriate course of action. This may involve including the application in the business continuity plan (BCP), reporting the finding to management, or segregating the application from the network, depending on the level of risk involved.\nHowever, taking any action without first understanding the purpose of the application could potentially disrupt business operations or create unnecessary costs.
