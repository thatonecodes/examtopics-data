Training and awareness\n\nTraining and awareness are crucial for the effective operationalization of cloud security controls because they ensure that the personnel responsible for implementing and managing these controls understand their importance and how to apply them correctly. Without adequate training and awareness, even well-designed security controls may not be implemented effectively, leading to potential vulnerabilities. By ensuring that staff are knowledgeable about cloud security practices, organizations can better maintain their security posture and respond to emerging threats or incidents.","timestamp":"1743175380.0","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":153,"unix_timestamp":1743175380,"topic":"1","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"Mfz9DqX16HIKOatF3F2j","exam_id":153,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:23:00","topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743175380.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. While the breach was reported in a timely manner to the CEO, the CFO and CISO blamed each other in public, resulting in a loss of public confidence that led the board to replace all three.\n\nThis scenario describes a reputational business impact because it highlights how public perception and confidence in the company's leadership were negatively affected. The public blame game between high-level executives, followed by their replacement, illustrates a loss of reputation and trust, which can have long-term implications for the company's brand and customer relationships. Reputational damage can lead to loss of customers, decreased market value, and other indirect business consequences.","comment_id":"1411342"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1743175380,"choices":{"A":"While the breach was reported in a timely manner to the CEO, the CFO and CISO blamed each other in public, resulting in a loss of public confidence that led the board to replace all three.","D":"A hacker using a stolen administrator identity brings down the Software as a Service (SaaS) sales and marketing systems, resulting in the inability to process customer orders or manage customer relationships.","C":"A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack renders the customer's cloud inaccessible for 24 hours, resulting in millions in lost sales.","B":"The cloud provider fails to report a breach of customer personal data from an unsecured server, resulting in GDPR fines of 10 million euros."},"answer":"A","question_text":"Which of the following is an example of reputational business impact?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170044-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-236-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_id":147,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"ma1gmCwTp7mVaoNt3GWB","question_id":148,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170045-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-237-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer":"B","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743175440.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. A weakness in the cloud compliance posture\n\nFrom an auditor's perspective, shadow IT represents a weakness in the cloud compliance posture. Shadow IT refers to the use of IT systems, software, and services without explicit organizational approval, often bypassing established security and compliance controls. This unauthorized use can lead to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements, as these unsanctioned systems might not adhere to the organization's security policies and standards. Therefore, shadow IT is viewed as a compliance risk that needs to be addressed to ensure proper governance and security.","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1411343"}],"answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:24:00","question_text":"From an auditor perspective, which of the following BEST describes shadow IT?","unix_timestamp":1743175440,"choices":{"C":"A strength of disaster recovery (DR) planning","D":"A risk that jeopardizes business continuity planning","B":"A weakness in the cloud compliance posture","A":"An opportunity to diversify the cloud control approach"},"exam_id":153},{"id":"3E7TCAdVcGdfxfWvUNtp","question_id":149,"choices":{"A":"Establishing a joint security operations center","C":"Co-locating compliance management specialists","D":"Maintaining a centralized risk and controls dashboard","B":"Automating reporting of risk and control compliance"},"unix_timestamp":1743175440,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","exam_id":153,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"question_text":"In a situation where duties related to cloud risk management and control are split between an organization and its cloud service providers, which of the following would BEST help to ensure a coordinated approach to risk and control processes?","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1743175440.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Maintaining a centralized risk and controls dashboard\n\nMaintaining a centralized risk and controls dashboard would best ensure a coordinated approach to risk and control processes when responsibilities are split between an organization and its cloud service providers. A centralized dashboard provides a unified view of risk and compliance status across different parties, enabling better communication, monitoring, and management of risk-related activities. It allows both the organization and the cloud service providers to access and update information in real-time, ensuring that everyone is aligned and informed about the current risk landscape and any necessary actions. This approach facilitates collaboration and helps prevent gaps or overlaps in risk management efforts.","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1411344","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170046-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-238-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:24:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"sW74933KtgXnPp9bieHB","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:24:00","exam_id":153,"question_id":150,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following provides the BEST evidence that a cloud service provider's continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) development pipeline includes checks for compliance as new features are added to its Software as a Service (SaaS) applications?","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1743175440,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Compliance tests are automated and integrated within the CI tool.\n\nAutomating compliance tests and integrating them within the CI tool provides the best evidence that compliance checks are consistently and systematically applied as new features are added. This approach ensures that compliance requirements are automatically verified during the development process, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring that any non-compliance issues are identified and addressed promptly. Automated compliance checks can be executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline, providing ongoing assurance that the SaaS applications meet the necessary compliance standards.","comment_id":"1411345","timestamp":"1743175440.0"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170047-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-239-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Third-party security libraries are continuously kept up to date.","C":"Frequent compliance checks are performed for development environments.","A":"Compliance tests are automated and integrated within the CI tool.","B":"Developers keep credentials outside the code base and in a secure repository."}}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"name":"CCAK","id":153,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":258,"provider":"Isaca"},"currentPage":30},"__N_SSP":true}
