A well-implemented security awareness program educates users about the risks of phishing, teaches them how to recognize phishing attempts, and emphasizes the importance of security best practices. As a result, employees become more vigilant and less susceptible to falling for phishing scams, leading to a decrease in the success rate of such attacks.","poster":"FAGFUR"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":178,"answer_description":"","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1699973700,"timestamp":"2023-11-14 15:55:00","question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"urSRZjytTC2O11JHcnnB","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Invalid payment processing.","D":"Purchase order delays","C":"Inaccurate customer discounts.","A":"Inaccurate customer records."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/122131-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1159-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731596280.0","comment_id":"1070519","upvote_count":"2","poster":"FAGFUR","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe best risk mitigated by implementing an automated three-way match is invalid payment processing.\nA three-way match involves comparing three key documents in the procurement and payment process: the purchase order, the receiving report, and the vendor invoice.
