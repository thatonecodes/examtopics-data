This is because the central computer is likely to store the PINs of many cardholders, making it a high-value target for attackers. If an attacker were to gain access to the central computer, they could potentially obtain the PINs of all cardholders, leading to a massive data breach.\nIn contrast, the other options, while still concerning, present less severe risks. For example, option A could lead to a data breach if an individual POS terminal is compromised, but the impact would likely be less severe than a breach of the central computer"},{"comment_id":"1070102","timestamp":"1731569100.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nStoring encrypted PINs locally on the POS terminal can pose a significant security risk, as it increases the likelihood of unauthorized access and potential compromise of PINs. Best practices involve avoiding the local storage of encrypted PINs, especially in a manner that could be vulnerable to exploitation.\nThe storage of encrypted PINs on the local POS terminal is generally considered a higher risk due to the potential for direct compromise at the point of entry.","poster":"FAGFUR"}],"answer_ET":"D","exam_id":156}],"exam":{"name":"CISA","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":1441,"isBeta":false,"id":156,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Isaca"},"currentPage":21},"__N_SSP":true}
