This means that the risks have not been addressed in any way, and their potential impact remains unmitigated.\nRisk remains unaddressed: By delaying the assessment and treatment, the organization has essentially chosen to not address the risks at this time. This does not mean that the risks have been eliminated or resolved; they simply remain unaddressed and unmitigated.\nDeferred action: Deferring action implies that the organization intends to address the risks at a later date.
