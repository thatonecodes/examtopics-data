Implement Internet service provider (ISP) redundancy.\n\nISP redundancy involves using multiple ISPs to ensure continuous internet connectivity and service availability. In the event of a DDoS attack, traffic can be rerouted through alternative ISPs to mitigate the impact of the attack on a single connection point. This approach enhances the organization's resilience against DDoS attacks by distributing the load and providing alternative pathways for internet traffic, thereby reducing the likelihood of a complete service shutdown.\n\nThe other options, while important in a comprehensive security strategy, have different primary functions:\n\nImplementing an intrusion prevention system (IPS) (option B) is crucial for identifying and blocking malicious traffic, but it might not be sufficient on its own to handle large-scale DDoS attacks.","poster":"Abbey2"}],"exam_id":160,"answer":"A","question_id":598,"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"An organization expects to continually deal with severe distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks from hacktivist groups.

Reassess the risk scenario associated with the action plan.\n\nReassessing the risk scenario is crucial after a mitigation plan fails. This reassessment involves evaluating the current risk in light of the unsuccessful mitigation attempt, understanding why the mitigation failed, and determining the potential impact and likelihood of the risk in its current state. This process provides updated information that is essential for making an informed decision about whether to accept the risk and, if so, how to manage it moving forward.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","question_text":"An operations manager has requested risk acceptance after the execution of a mitigation plan has failed.

Data classification.\n\nData classification involves categorizing data based on its sensitivity, confidentiality, and criticality to the organization. This process is essential for determining the appropriate level of security controls needed to protect different types of data. By classifying data, an organization can effectively allocate resources and implement targeted security measures that are proportional to the sensitivity and importance of the data. Data classification helps in identifying which data requires more stringent protection measures (such as encryption, access controls, etc.) and which data might need less stringent controls.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Abbey2","timestamp":"1720912320.0"}],"answer":"A"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"provider":"Isaca","numberOfQuestions":1422,"name":"CRISC","isMCOnly":true,"id":160,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":120},"__N_SSP":true}
