Reciprocal\nagreements are not considered a viable option due to the constraining burden of maintaining hardware and software compatibility between the companies, the complications of maintaining security and\nprivacy compliance during shared operations, and the difficulty of enforcing the agreements should a\ndisagreement arise at the time the plan is activated."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer: C\nDifferences in IS policies and procedures between the two organizations can lead to inconsistencies, misunderstandings, and potential conflicts during a disaster recovery scenario.
