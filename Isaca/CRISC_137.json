The risk register is a central repository that documents and tracks all identified risks within an organization. It includes information such as the likelihood of occurrence, potential impact, risk owners, and mitigation strategies.\n\nBy maintaining a risk register, organizations can effectively monitor and assess the overall impact of aggregated risks. This allows them to prioritize and allocate resources for risk management activities based on the severity and potential consequences of each risk.\n\nThe risk register provides a holistic view of the organization's risk landscape, enabling management to make informed decisions regarding risk mitigation strategies, control implementation, and resource allocation. It helps identify control gaps by highlighting areas where existing controls may be insufficient or ineffective in addressing the identified risks.","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/141224-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1788-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"YBfNiDK7TWMD8yRfnQI9","exam_id":160,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/141334-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1792-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-05-27 15:29:00","question_id":682,"question_text":"When outsourcing a business process to a cloud service provider, it is MOST important to understand that:","unix_timestamp":1716816540,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732721340.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"D- correct","comment_id":"1219586","poster":"Silvias4"}],"choices":{"D":"accountability for the risk will remain with the organization.","C":"a risk owner must be designated within the cloud service provider.","B":"service accountability remains with the cloud service provider.","A":"insurance could be acquired for the risk associated with the outsourced process."},"answer":"D","answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"WKXFo1qgBW2p9akK3N9a","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answers_community":["D (75%)","A (25%)"],"question_id":683,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/140019-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1795-discussion/","exam_id":160,"timestamp":"2024-05-05 14:28:00","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Lack of a security information and event management (SIEM) system","D":"Weak privileged access management controls","B":"Lack of data classification policies","C":"Use of hashing algorithms"},"unix_timestamp":1714912080,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following situations would cause the GREATEST concern around the integrity of application logs?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIf privileged access management controls are weak, it increases the risk that individuals with elevated permissions could alter, delete, or tamper with logs without detection.
