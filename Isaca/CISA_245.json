There are conflicting permit and deny rules for the IT group.\n\nConflicting permit and deny rules for the IT group in the primary router's access control list would be considered a finding during the IS auditor's review. Access control lists (ACLs) are used to control network traffic and determine which packets are allowed or denied based on specified criteria. Conflicting rules for the same group could lead to inconsistent and unpredictable access permissions, potentially resulting in unauthorized access or unintended restrictions.\n\nOption C, individual permissions overriding group permissions, might not be a finding in itself as it can be a deliberate configuration choice.

Internal audit review: While internal audits are valuable for assessing risks and controls, they tend to be periodic and may not always catch emerging risks quickly.\n\nC.
