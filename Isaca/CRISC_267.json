Compliance reviews are typically conducted by independent auditors who are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the organization and who have no vested interest in the outcome of the review. This independence allows for a completely objective and unbiased evaluation of control effectiveness.\n\nThe Three Lines of Defense model, on the other hand, is a risk management framework that delineates the responsibilities of different functions within an organization for managing risk.
