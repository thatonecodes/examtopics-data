This method allows IT assets, such as hard drives or storage devices, to be reused or recycled since the physical medium is not destroyed. It's a balance between ensuring the data cannot be recovered and maintaining the integrity of the IT asset for potential reuse. Other methods like degaussing or factory reset might not ensure complete data sanitization, and simple data deletion does not prevent data from being recovered with specialized tools."}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","question_id":51,"choices":{"B":"Degaussing","A":"Factory reset","C":"Cryptographic erasure","D":"Data deletion"},"exam_id":154,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1698782760,"timestamp":"2023-10-31 21:06:00","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/125050-exam-cdpse-topic-1-question-164-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST method of data sanitization when there is a need to balance the destruction of data and the ability to recycle IT assets?"},{"id":"6dSGcoQXXJGt6JaSkDPD","answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which of the following BEST facilitates a privacy impact assessment (PIA)?","answer":"A","choices":{"A":"Creating an information flow and repository to identify personal data being collected","C":"Comparing current privacy policies and procedures to industry benchmarks","B":"Providing privacy and awareness training for project managers and system owners","D":"Identifying key systems used for processing and storing personal data"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"4dfe785","content":"Selected Answer: A\nYes, A.","comment_id":"1282385","timestamp":"1726101240.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCreating an information flow and repository to identify personal data being collected","comment_id":"1110038","timestamp":"1703972160.0","poster":"johnH123","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Ahbey_911","content":"A. Creating an information flow and repository to identify personal data being collected\nA Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is a systematic assessment of a project, system, or process to identify and mitigate privacy risks associated with the collection, use, and storage of personal data. To best facilitate a PIA, it's essential to understand the flow of personal data throughout the system or process being assessed. Creating an information flow and repository provides a clear visual representation of where personal data enters, traverses, and exits the system, and where it is stored. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of potential privacy risks and facilitates the assessment process.","timestamp":"1698782940.0","comment_id":"1059174","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1694064720.0","comment_id":"1001199","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Oklahsg","content":"Selected Answer: A\nis it should be A"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/120145-exam-cdpse-topic-1-question-167-discussion/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-07 07:32:00","answer_description":"","question_id":52,"exam_id":154,"unix_timestamp":1694064720},{"id":"cuWTWCbmLvSY3gFSsJST","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"The destruction is performed by a certified provider.","B":"The destruction of data is witnessed.","D":"The destruction method is approved by the data owner.","A":"The destruction of data is performed on site."},"timestamp":"2023-10-31 21:10:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"exam_id":154,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nBecause a certified provider is entrusted with this task and the accountability of the process.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ARaghunanan","timestamp":"1726595520.0","comment_id":"1176047"},{"timestamp":"1714500600.0","content":"B. The destruction of data is witnessed.\nWhile all the options have value in certain contexts, witnessing the destruction of data is most crucial. Having a witness ensures accountability and provides verification that the data was destroyed as intended. Without verification, there's no assurance the data was properly destroyed, which could lead to potential breaches or unauthorized access. It provides a level of assurance and evidence that can be critical, especially for sensitive or regulated information.","poster":"Ahbey_911","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1059175"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following is MOST important to ensure when reviewing processes associated with the destruction of data?","question_id":53,"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1698783000,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/125051-exam-cdpse-topic-1-question-168-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"C","question_images":[]},{"id":"Ms8l4wuExkkpEJMB6Ye4","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Which of the following is MOST important to ensure when developing a business case for the procurement of a new IT system that will process and store personal information?","answer":"D","choices":{"B":"A risk assessment has been completed.","C":"Security controls are clearly defined.","D":"Data protection requirements are included.","A":"The system architecture is clearly defined."},"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725891420.0","poster":"4dfe785","comment_id":"1280943","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nEnsuring that data protection requirements are included is critical for legal and regulatory compliance"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1147040","timestamp":"1707636660.0","poster":"Danford25","content":"Data protection requirements are included (D).\n\nIncluding data protection requirements in the business case ensures that the system will comply with necessary regulations and standards, thereby protecting the personal information it will process and store"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133516-exam-cdpse-topic-1-question-17-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-02-11 08:31:00","answer_description":"","question_id":54,"unix_timestamp":1707636660,"exam_id":154},{"id":"QN4TDLjGHhdjWhHhy092","unix_timestamp":1698783360,"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1714500960.0","comment_id":"1059177","upvote_count":"5","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"I agree with you in some ways.
