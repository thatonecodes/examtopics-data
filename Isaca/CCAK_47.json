Application architecture and configurations did not consider security measures.\n\nThis finding is the most critical because it directly impacts the security posture of the applications being developed and deployed. If security measures are not considered in the application architecture and configurations, it can lead to vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers, resulting in potential breaches, data loss, or service disruptions. Addressing security within the architecture and configuration stage is fundamental to ensuring that applications are resilient and secure from the outset.\n\nWhile the other options are significant findings as well, they relate more to compliance, service continuity, and certification processes. However, without secure architecture and configurations, the applications themselves may be exposed to risks that could have immediate and severe consequences for the organization.","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1741707060.0","comment_id":"1387502"}],"timestamp":"2025-03-11 16:31:00","question_id":231,"exam_id":153,"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1741707060,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following would be the MOST critical finding of an application security and DevOps audit?","choices":{"B":"Application architecture and configurations did not consider security measures.","D":"Certifications with global security standards specific to cloud are not reviewed and the impact of noted findings are not assessed.","C":"Outsourced cloud service interruption, breach or loss of data stored at the cloud service provider.","A":"The organization is not using a unified framework to integrate cloud compliance with regulatory requirements."}},{"id":"DX9K9GbdL8XieCdUAeiF","unix_timestamp":1741707120,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":153,"isMC":true,"answer":"A","choices":{"D":"Semi-annual","B":"Quarterly","A":"Annual","C":"Monthly"},"timestamp":"2025-03-11 16:32:00","question_text":"What should be an organization’s control audit schedule of a cloud service provider’s business continuity plan and operational resilience policy?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Annual\n\nAn annual audit schedule is typically appropriate for reviewing a cloud service provider's business continuity plan (BCP) and operational resilience policy. This timeframe allows the organization to assess the provider's preparedness, ensure that any changes in operations or infrastructure are incorporated, and verify that the plans remain effective and aligned with the organization's requirements. While more frequent audits (e.g., quarterly or semi-annual) may be warranted in certain high-risk scenarios or if there are significant changes in the provider's operations, annual audits are generally sufficient for maintaining oversight in most cases.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1387503","timestamp":"1741707120.0","poster":"Auditor2020"}],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/168871-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-75-discussion/","question_id":232},{"id":"nbhkmjrac7t3oWQT4ECq","answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":153,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741707180.0","comment_id":"1387504","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. relating to policies, processes, laws, regulations, and institutions conditioning the way an organization is managed, directed, or controlled.\n\nThe \"Corporate Governance Relevance\" feature in the Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) is used to filter out controls that pertain to the overarching policies, processes, laws, regulations, and institutions that dictate how an organization is managed, directed, or controlled.

The violation is agreed upon and documented.\n\nThe best way for a client to enforce a policy violation committed by a cloud service provider (CSP) is to ensure that the violation is agreed upon and documented. This documentation should be part of the contractual agreement between the client and the CSP. Having clear, documented terms regarding what constitutes a violation and the consequences for such violations provides a legal basis for enforcement. This approach ensures that both parties have a mutual understanding of the expectations and repercussions, allowing the client to take appropriate, documented action if the CSP fails to comply with the agreed-upon policies.","comment_id":"1387506","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741707240.0"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST way for a client to enforce a policy violation committed by a cloud service provider (CSP)?","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","topic":"1","question_id":234,"choices":{"A":"The violation is agreed upon and documented.","D":"Violations will be automatically enforced so no action is needed.","B":"Nothing can be done to enforce violations as this is a cloud service.","C":"The violation is agreed to verbally by the CSP."}},{"id":"ASCumgdP4b0CPanYgplz","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following is a corrective control that may be identified in a SaaS service provider?","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/96355-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-78-discussion/","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1674314280,"timestamp":"2023-01-21 16:18:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1387509","timestamp":"1741707300.0","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Incident response plans\n\nIncident response plans are considered corrective controls because they provide a structured approach for addressing and managing security incidents after they occur. These plans aim to reduce the impact of an incident, facilitate recovery, and prevent future occurrences by learning from the event and implementing improvements. Corrective controls are designed to rectify issues and restore normal operations.\n\nIn contrast, log monitoring, penetration testing, and vulnerability scans are typically considered preventive or detective controls.
