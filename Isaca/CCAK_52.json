Parallel testing**\n\nParallel testing allows for security testing processes to run concurrently with other tests or during different stages of the development lifecycle. This approach helps ensure that security validation does not become a bottleneck, thereby supporting quicker completion times without sacrificing the thoroughness of security checks. It is particularly useful in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments where speed and efficiency are crucial.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1387820","timestamp":"1741778340.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722347280.0","content":"Answer is A","poster":"4f2a581","comment_id":"1258259"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1148317","poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA common problem to all Agile development approaches is what to do about tests that take longer than a development cycle. For example, fuzz testing critical pieces of code takes longer than an average Agile sprint. SAST scans of large bodies of code often take an order of magnitude longer than the build process. DevOps is no different—with CI and CD, code may be delivered to users within hours of its creation, and it may not be possible to perform complete static analysis or dynamic code scanning. To address this issue, DevOps teams run multiple security tests in parallel to avoid delays. They break down large applications into services to speed up scans as well.\nValidation against known critical issues is handled by unit tests for quick spot checks, with failures kicking code back to the development team. Code scanners are typically run in parallel with unit or other functional tests.

Independent audits**\n\nThis specification emphasizes the need for independent reviews and assessments, which are typically carried out through independent audits. Independent audits are designed to evaluate whether an organization is complying with established policies, standards, procedures, and compliance obligations. Conducting these audits annually helps ensure that nonconformities are identified and addressed in a timely manner, maintaining the integrity and compliance posture of the organization.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741778460.0","comment_id":"1387822"}],"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"Jcerm3Pn3iQzMrbFrro8","question_id":258,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/100728-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-99-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"answer":"B","choices":{"C":"only application infrastructure contained within the CSP’s instances.","A":"both operating system and application infrastructure contained within the CSP’s instances.","D":"only application infrastructure contained within the customer’s instances.","B":"both operating system and application infrastructure contained within the customer’s instances"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"Justtemitayo","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"821265","content":"Correct answer is B according to CCAK material PG 89","timestamp":"1692941640.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn the context of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), a vulnerability assessment will scan virtual machines to identify vulnerabilities in:\n\n**B. both operating system and application infrastructure contained within the customer’s instances**\n\nIn an IaaS model, the cloud service provider (CSP) is typically responsible for the underlying physical infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for managing the virtual machines, including the operating systems and any applications running on them.
