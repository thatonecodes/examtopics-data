Capability to take a snapshot of virtual machines.\n\nTaking a snapshot of virtual machines is a valuable feature in an IaaS model that allows for the creation of a point-in-time copy of a virtual machine's disk, memory, and configuration. This snapshot serves as a backup or recovery point that can be used to restore the virtual machine to a previous known good state. In the event of a security incident, having the capability to take snapshots enables customers to roll back to a secure state before the incident occurred.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1705402980.0","comment_id":"953200"},{"comment_id":"945191","timestamp":"1704603060.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"richck102","content":"A.

Capability of online virtual machine analysis.\n\nThe capability of online virtual machine analysis allows the cloud service provider to analyze the virtual machines in real-time, providing valuable insights into the security incident and assisting in the recovery process. By having the ability to analyze the virtual machines, the cloud service provider can identify any malicious activities, assess the impact of the incident, and provide guidance on the necessary actions to mitigate the security breach and restore normal operations.","comments":[{"content":"However, it does not provide the same level of protection as snapshots, which can restore the entire virtual machine to a pre-incident state.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716559500.0","poster":"Cyberbug2021","comment_id":"1079418"}],"timestamp":"1700068260.0","poster":"mad68","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"898427"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","exam_id":157,"timestamp":"2023-05-15 17:11:00"},{"id":"K3gU6ZJQq47FXo3e00G2","answer":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1188409","comments":[{"poster":"usercism007","content":"This question is from Domain 3 and Domin 4 combined.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1214698","timestamp":"1732167540.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","content":"Could you kindly clarify from which section of the CISM exam questions are expected?

Monitoring access logs is a common practice in web application security to identify any suspicious or unauthorized activities. It helps in detecting potential security incidents, such as unauthorized access attempts, unusual patterns of behavior, or potential exploitation of vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile audit reports (option A) may provide a broader overview of security-related events, access logs are more specific to user interactions with the web application. Access lists (option C) are typically associated with network security and may not be as directly relevant to web application monitoring.
