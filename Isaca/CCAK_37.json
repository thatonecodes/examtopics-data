Incorporation of automation to identify and address software code problems early\n\nThe shift-left concept in software development focuses on identifying and addressing issues as early as possible in the development process, which is typically achieved through automation, continuous integration, and continuous testing practices. By incorporating automation tools and techniques, organizations can detect and fix software problems early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of defects and improving the quality and speed of releases.

This is because cloud adoption is a strategic decision that impacts the entire organization, including its operations, budget, and risk management strategies. Senior management is best positioned to align the cloud adoption approach with the organization's overall business objectives, ensure adequate resources and support are available, and address any significant risks or compliance issues that may arise. Additionally, their involvement ensures that the approach is communicated effectively across the organization and that there is accountability at the highest level.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741534380.0"}]}],"exam":{"provider":"Isaca","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":258,"isBeta":false,"name":"CCAK","isImplemented":true,"id":153},"currentPage":37},"__N_SSP":true}
