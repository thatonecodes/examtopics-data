Enabling monitoring-only mode (option A) may provide insights for further tuning, but it does not directly address the issue itself. Educating staff about risks (option B) is important for overall security awareness, but it may not immediately reduce false positives.

By adjusting the rules to distinguish between approved and unapproved business information pathways, you can significantly reduce the number of false positives while ensuring that sensitive data is still protected. This approach allows the DLP system to function more effectively, targeting only truly risky behaviors."},{"poster":"Swallows","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721541120.0","comment_id":"1252247","content":"Selected Answer: A\nProper configuration and rule definition are important for DLP tools to function accurately. We recommend using monitor-only mode to minimize false positives while evaluating your actual operational situation."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nA. Enable monitoring-only mode to permit further tuning of the solution.\n\nHere’s a concise rationale for why this option is the most effective:\n\nEnabling monitoring-only mode allows the DLP tool to continue monitoring and generating alerts without taking any enforcement actions (such as blocking or quarantining files).\nThis approach temporarily reduces the impact of false positives on administrators, enabling them to analyze and understand the alerts more comprehensively.\nFurther tuning of the DLP solution based on the data gathered during the monitoring-only period helps in identifying patterns and refining policies to reduce false positives while maintaining effective detection of actual data breaches or policy violations.","timestamp":"1719126300.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"KAP2HURUF","comment_id":"1235712"},{"comment_id":"945823","upvote_count":"1","content":"from the internet: To address this issue, administrators should enable monitoring-only mode in order to fine-tune the solution.
