Hardware capacity can be adjusted or expanded to accommodate data retention needs, but non-compliance with regulatory requirements can have far-reaching consequences for an organization's legal and regulatory standing. Therefore, adherence to regulatory requirements should be the MOST important consideration when establishing the retention period for customer data within a specific database or application.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Swallows"}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1716696180,"question_id":1377,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/141268-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-931-discussion/"},{"id":"YBM1QETSZlZ4PIcWmhU9","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-07 04:15:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/108668-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-933-discussion/","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1683425700,"question_text":"Which of the following is the GREATEST advantage of utilizing guest operating systems in a virtual environment?","choices":{"A":"They can be logged into and monitored from any location.","C":"They can be wiped quickly in the event of a security breach.","B":"They prevent access to the greater environment via Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)","D":"They are easier to containerize with minimal impact to the rest of the environment"},"question_id":1378,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe question is the greatest advantage of using guest operating sytem in virtual environment there is no emphasis on security and resilence.

Containerization is a form of operating system virtualization that allows applications to run in isolated user spaces called containers, but it is not the same as running full guest operating systems in a virtualized environment. Virtualization allows for the complete simulation of the underlying hardware, enabling entire operating systems to run as if they were on their own physical machine. This provides the flexibility to run multiple different operating systems on the same host and to manage them independently.","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1704297180.0","comment_id":"1112908","content":"Selected Answer: D\n, while both options are beneficial, the ability to containerize guest operating systems with minimal impact on the rest of the environment (D) is generally considered the greatest advantage due to its proactive nature in preventing problems and its broader impact on enhancing the overall efficiency and security of the virtual environment.","poster":"KAP2HURUF"},{"poster":"3008","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1087590","timestamp":"1701687900.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n**D. The biggest benefit of utilizing guest operating systems in a virtual environment is **D. It is easier to containerize with minimal impact on the rest of the environment. This is because the virtual environment provides an independent execution space, so problems in one environment do not affect the other. This independence also makes it easier to containerize applications to deploy and manage. In addition, the virtual environment has the advantage of being able to monitor at any location (A) and of being able to quickly delete security breaches (C). However, option B is generally not considered a virtual environment advantage because access restrictions over TCP/IP are part of the network security setup and not a function of the virtual environment itself."},{"comment_id":"1019657","upvote_count":"2","poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1695892980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. They can be wiped quickly in the event of a security breach.\n\nIn a virtual environment, guest operating systems are isolated from the host system, and you can easily create snapshots or backups of the virtual machines (VMs) running these guest operating systems. If a security breach occurs or if there are any issues with the guest OS, you can quickly restore a clean state by reverting to a previous snapshot or backup, effectively \"wiping\" the compromised or problematic state. This rapid recovery capability enhances security and minimizes downtime in the event of issues or breaches."},{"timestamp":"1683425700.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"BabaP","content":"Selected Answer: D\nwhy not D?","comment_id":"891116"}],"exam_id":156,"answer_description":"","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (55%)","C (27%)","A (18%)"],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"FsougtSjOGWcB9PtnZoZ","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-03-20 16:15:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/103393-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-934-discussion/","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1679325300,"question_text":"An IS auditor finds that a system receives identical information from two different upstream sources, even though redundancy is not required.
