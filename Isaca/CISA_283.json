Automated tests can be executed in a repeatable and consistent manner, ensuring that the same tests are performed under the same conditions every time. This consistency helps identify and catch defects early in the development process, reduces the likelihood of human error, and provides a reliable foundation for assessing the quality of the software. While other benefits such as reducing time and providing flexibility are important, test consistency is often considered a key advantage of test automation."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"SuperMax","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. provide test consistency\n\nThe primary benefit of automating application testing is to provide test consistency. Automated testing ensures that the same tests are executed in the same way every time, which helps identify issues and regressions reliably. While automation can also reduce the time to review code, provide more flexibility, and in some cases replace manual test processes for repetitive and well-defined tasks, the main advantage is the consistency and repeatability it offers in testing.","timestamp":"1727580180.0","comment_id":"1020384"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"exam_id":156,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121780-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-971-discussion/","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-09-29 05:23:00","choices":{"C":"replace all manual test processes","B":"provide test consistency","A":"reduce the time to review code","D":"provide more flexibility"},"answer_description":""},{"id":"wUhfCZEOj5kJtdAq0eSS","question_text":"Which of the following BEST enables an IS auditor to prioritize financial reporting spreadsheets for an end-user computing (EUC) audit?","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"Reviewing spreadsheets based on file size","A":"Understanding the purpose of each spreadsheet","C":"Identifying the spreadsheets with built-in macros","B":"Ascertaining which spreadsheets are most frequently used"},"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":156,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731510540.0","content":"Understanding the purpose of each spreadsheet is crucial for prioritizing them in an end-user computing audit.
