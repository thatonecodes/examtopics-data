Internal auditors share the audit plan and control test plans with management prior to audit commencement.\n\nSharing the audit plan and control test plans with management prior to audit commencement can be a threat to IS auditor independence because it could compromise the auditor's objectivity and the integrity of the audit process. If management has the opportunity to influence or manipulate the audit scope or testing plans, it can undermine the independence and effectiveness of the audit. Independence is a fundamental principle in auditing to ensure that audits are conducted impartially and without undue influence from the auditee. Therefore, option D is the choice that represents a threat to IS auditor independence.","timestamp":"1695872400.0","comment_id":"1019375"},{"timestamp":"1681822380.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"swmasinde","content":"C.

Developing robust backup and recovery procedures\n\nDeveloping robust backup and recovery procedures is a critical component of ransomware mitigation. In the event of a ransomware attack, having up-to-date and secure backups allows the organization to restore its systems and data without having to pay the ransom. This not only mitigates the financial impact of the attack but also reduces the incentive for attackers to continue their ransomware campaigns against the organization.\n\nWhile other options such as conducting security awareness training (option C) and conducting penetration testing (option B) are important security measures, they are not as directly related to mitigating the impact of a ransomware attack as having reliable backup and recovery procedures in place.\n\nOption A, ensuring a payment method is available, is not a recommended approach. It's generally discouraged to pay ransomware attackers as it does not guarantee the recovery of data and can encourage further attacks. Organizations should focus on preventive measures and recovery strategies that do not involve paying ransoms.","poster":"SuperMax"}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121620-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-875-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-09-28 05:41:00","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"uDDDpv4DhZn8L0bIU422","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-09-28 05:42:00","isMC":true,"exam_id":156,"answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121621-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-876-discussion/","choices":{"D":"Mesh configuration","A":"Star configuration","C":"Ring configuration","B":"Bus configuration"},"unix_timestamp":1695872520,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","discussion":[{"poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1727494920.0","comment_id":"1019379","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe network topology that provides the GREATEST fault tolerance is the Mesh configuration (option D).\n\nIn a Mesh configuration, every device is connected to every other device. This means that there are redundant paths for data to travel between devices. If one link or device fails, there are multiple alternative paths available for data to reach its destination. This inherent redundancy makes Mesh topology highly fault-tolerant, as it can withstand multiple failures without significant disruption to the network.\n\nIn contrast:\n\nA.
