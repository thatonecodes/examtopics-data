This technique has a high risk as it does not allow for a fallback if problems occur with the new system. Comprehensive testing of the new application prior to the changeover is the best way to mitigate the risk of system failure as it helps in identifying and resolving any issues before the live implementation. Other options like comprehensive documentation, threat and risk assessment, and change management are all important in a system replacement project but they do not directly prevent a potential system failure during abrupt changeover as comprehensively as thorough testing does.","timestamp":"1725350280.0","poster":"KAP2HURUF","comment_id":"1164682"},{"timestamp":"1718930340.0","poster":"0timepass","content":"A because is abrupt changeover.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1102122"},{"comment_id":"1094705","timestamp":"1718201700.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"001Yogesh","content":"Selected Answer: D\nChange mgmt as it take care of rollback procedure"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nHas to be testing not change management.
