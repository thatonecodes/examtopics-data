Code review aims to identify security flaws in the application related to its features and design, along with the exact root causes. With the increasing complexity of applications and the advent of new technologies, the traditional way of testing may fail to detect all the security flaws present in the applications. One must understand the code of the application, external components, and configurations to have a better chance of finding the flaws. Such a deep dive into the application code also helps in determining exact mitigation techniques that can be used to avert the security flaws.\n\nIt is the process of auditing the source code of an application to verify that the proper security and logical controls are present, that they work as intended, and that they have been invoked in the right places. Code review is a way of helping ensure that the application has been developed so as to be “self-defending” in its given environment.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"885716","poster":"3008","timestamp":"1698803880.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD IS AnSWER","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"835703","timestamp":"1694406900.0","poster":"saado9","content":"D.
