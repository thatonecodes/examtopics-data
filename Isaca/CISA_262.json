Stratified mean per unit sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups, or strata, based on relevant characteristics, such as monetary value or risk, and then selecting a sample from each stratum.

Stratified mean per nit sampling\nStratified mean per unit sampling is appropriate because it recognizes the differences in monetary values between corporate and small business accounts and ensures that both types of accounts are adequately represented in the sample. This approach provides a more accurate estimate of the overall mean for the entire population while taking into account the variations within each stratum. It can be particularly useful when dealing with populations that exhibit significant variability across subgroups."}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104023-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-850-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"hSJbwUJYItY4X9TCakQS","isMC":true,"exam_id":156,"unix_timestamp":1672339140,"question_id":1308,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/93192-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-851-discussion/","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-12-29 19:39:00","answers_community":[],"question_text":"An organization has established hiring policies and procedures designed specifically to ensure network administrators are well qualified.

Automation can help with data transfer efficiency but might not catch data transfer failures or errors.\n\nOption B is important for data security but does not directly address the problem of identifying and correcting records that are not transferred correctly.\n\nOption C is not an efficient solution as manual reconciliation can be time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. It's generally not the best practice for handling data discrepancies between systems.\n\nOption D is the best recommendation. This option suggests using dedicated software that can automatically reconcile data between systems. Such software can identify discrepancies, missing records, and errors in data transfers, making the process more efficient and less prone to human error.

Option A, automating the transfer of data between systems as much as feasible, addresses the root cause of the problem. By automating the transfer of data, the organization can reduce the risk of missing records and improve the efficiency and accuracy of the data transfer process.
