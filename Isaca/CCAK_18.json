CCM provides a controls framework, whereas CAIQ provides industry-accepted ways to document which security controls exist in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings.\n\nThe Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) is a comprehensive framework of security controls that are designed to address various aspects of cloud security across different service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). It provides a structured approach to identifying and implementing necessary security measures.\n\nOn the other hand, the Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) is a tool that helps cloud customers assess the security capabilities of cloud service providers. It includes a set of questions that are mapped to the CCM controls, allowing providers to document and communicate their security practices and controls in a standardized way.","comment_id":"1371572","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"comment_id":"1300077","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729355040.0","content":"CAIQ- an industry-accepted way of documenting the security and privacy controls that exist in cloud services provides security control transparency and, to some extent, assurance.","poster":"339dfab"}],"timestamp":"2024-10-19 18:24:00","answer":"D","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"CCM has a set of security questions, whereas CAIQ has a set of security controls.","D":"CCM provides a controls framework, whereas CAIQ provides industry-accepted ways to document which security controls exist in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings.","C":"CCM has 14 domains and CAIQ has 16 domains.","A":"CCM assesses the presence of controls, whereas CAIQ assesses overall security of a service."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/149797-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-18-discussion/","question_id":86,"answer_ET":"D","exam_id":153},{"id":"aK07bO1EApdUvgd5pe0z","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"exam_id":153,"question_id":87,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An auditor wants to get information about the operating effectiveness of controls addressing privacy, availability, and confidentiality of a service organization.
