This is because such exclusions could lead to misunderstandings or gaps in the expected quality of service, potentially resulting in service disruptions or failures that impact the customer. Operational matters are critical for ensuring that the service is delivered according to agreed-upon standards, and their exclusion from the SLA could indicate that important aspects of the service delivery are not being formally committed to by the provider.","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1743175920.0","comment_id":"1411370","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","exam_id":153,"timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:32:00","question_text":"An auditor examining a cloud service provider’s service level agreement (SLA) should be MOST concerned about whether:","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_id":175,"answer":"C","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"the agreement excludes any operational matters that are material to the service operations.","B":"the agreement includes any service availability matters that are material to the service operations.","A":"the agreement excludes any sourcing and financial matters that are material in meeting the service level agreement (SLA).","D":"the agreement includes any operational matters that are material to the service operations."},"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1743175920}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"id":153,"provider":"Isaca","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"CCAK","numberOfQuestions":258,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":35},"__N_SSP":true}
