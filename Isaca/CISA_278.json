Role-based access\n\nRole-based access control (RBAC) is the best preventative control to ensure that database integrity is maintained. RBAC restricts access to the database based on users' roles and responsibilities within an organization. It ensures that users only have access to the data and functions that are necessary for their job functions, preventing unauthorized access and potential data breaches. RBAC is a fundamental security principle in database management and helps in maintaining data integrity by limiting access to authorized users and roles.","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1019688","timestamp":"1727516880.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRole-based access reviews is a preventative control and UAR is a detective control","poster":"Zib06","timestamp":"1718648520.0","comment_id":"926185"},{"content":"Also think C","poster":"swmasinde","comment_id":"824976","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1709134860.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"m4s7er","content":"Selected Answer: C\ni think answer is C,user access reviews isn't preventative control.","timestamp":"1706403240.0","comment_id":"790132"}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Mandatory annual user access reviews","B":"Biometric authentication","C":"Role-based access","D":"Mandatory password changes"},"unix_timestamp":1674867240,"exam_id":156,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/97012-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-943-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","question_id":1386,"timestamp":"2023-01-28 01:54:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST preventative control to ensure that database integrity is maintained?"},{"id":"5aYhEfhITDTrowMikkvu","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhile organizational objectives (option D) are important for setting overall priorities, options A, B, and C are more directly relevant to investigating the observed high CPU utilization issue.
