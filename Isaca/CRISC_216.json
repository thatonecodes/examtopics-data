Percentage of unpatched IT assets\n\nMonitoring the percentage of unpatched IT assets is the best key performance indicator (KPI) for assessing the effectiveness of the IT asset management process. Here's why:\n\nSecurity Relevance: Unpatched IT assets pose a significant security risk. By tracking the percentage of unpatched assets, an organization can directly measure its vulnerability to security threats.\n\nOperational Efficiency: Ensuring that all IT assets are regularly patched and up-to-date is a fundamental aspect of IT asset management. Monitoring this metric helps assess how efficiently this process is being carried out.\n\nCompliance: Many compliance standards and regulations require organizations to maintain up-to-date software and security patches. Monitoring this KPI can help demonstrate compliance with such requirements.\n\nRisk Reduction: Reducing the percentage of unpatched assets aligns with risk reduction objectives, which is a core goal of IT asset management."},{"timestamp":"1716134640.0","content":"D is KRI, not KPI. going with C","comment_id":"902095","poster":"Yahealborini","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree it is D.","timestamp":"1712483760.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"863710"},{"content":"should be D","comment_id":"813004","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Julianleehk","timestamp":"1708262820.0"},{"poster":"fora","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1680781380.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nC is just number and tells nothing about the performance.
