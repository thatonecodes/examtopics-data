This involves verifying compliance with documented procedures at each phase of the lifecycle, such as design specifications, testing protocols, and post-implementation controls12. For example, auditors assess whether design documents align with institutional standards, whether testing follows approved methodologies, and whether changes are properly authorized13. While utilization of standards (B) is important, the audit’s critical function is validation (C) to ensure actual adherence rather than mere existence of standards. Quality attributes (D) and ownership details (A) are context-dependent considerations rather than universal requirements for every SDLC review.","poster":"46080f2"},{"content":"I am torn between B and C.

Adherence to quality standards throughout the development process helps in identifying and mitigating issues early, ensuring the final product meets the required quality benchmarks. On the other hand, Utilization of standards in the system focuses on the presence of standards rather than verifying that these standards are actually being followed and implemented correctly.","comment_id":"1301442","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1299990","timestamp":"1729336500.0"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1729336500,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-10-19 13:15:00","exam_id":156},{"id":"mCa3vAu5MFF5gA7qWxQN","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Rolling forward of transactions when a production server fails","D":"Hardware replacement work involving databases","C":"Analysis of application performance degradation","B":"Ad hoc batch reporting jobs from the replication server"},"exam_id":156,"answers_community":["B (67%)","A (33%)"],"question_id":617,"answer":"B","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/149789-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1809-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-10-19 13:17:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1364454","timestamp":"1741013940.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"46080f2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe architecture’s greatest advantage during business hours lies in balancing transactional and analytical workloads.
