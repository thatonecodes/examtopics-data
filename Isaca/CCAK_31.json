The rapidly changing service portfolio and architecture of the cloud.\n\nThis option is the most critical because cloud environments are dynamic, with frequent updates and changes to services, features, and configurations. Compliance programs must be adaptable and continuously updated to account for these changes, ensuring that all aspects of cloud services remain compliant with relevant regulations and standards. Unlike on-premise environments, the pace of change in the cloud requires organizations to have robust processes for monitoring, assessment, and adaptation to maintain compliance effectively.","timestamp":"1741533960.0","comment_id":"1372025"},{"comment_id":"1143462","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe main difference when dealing with a cloud compliance program is the pace of change of the service architecture and service portfolio.

Contractual documents of the cloud service provider\n\nThe primary area for an auditor to examine to understand the criticality of cloud services, their dependencies, and risks is the contractual documents of the cloud service provider. These documents typically outline the terms and conditions of the service agreement, including service level agreements (SLAs), security obligations, data protection measures, compliance requirements, and responsibilities of both the provider and the customer. By reviewing these documents, an auditor can gain insights into the importance of the cloud services to the organization, the associated risks, and how these risks are managed through contractual obligations. This understanding is crucial for assessing the impact of potential service disruptions or failures on the organization's operations."}]},{"id":"znIvFQcUVx3qkUXInTA0","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1411347","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. address audit objectives.\n\nDuring the planning phase of a cloud audit, the primary goal of a cloud auditor is to address audit objectives. This involves defining the scope and objectives of the audit, identifying the key areas of focus, and understanding the risks associated with the cloud environment being audited. By clearly specifying the audit objectives, the auditor can ensure that the audit is aligned with the organization's goals, compliance requirements, and risk management strategies. Addressing audit objectives effectively guides the entire audit process, from planning to execution and reporting, ensuring that the audit provides valuable insights and recommendations.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743175500.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170049-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-241-discussion/","question_id":153,"question_text":"During the planning phase of a cloud audit, the PRIMARY goal of a cloud auditor is to:","choices":{"B":"collect sufficient evidence.","A":"address audit objectives.","C":"minimize audit resources.","D":"specify appropriate tests."},"unix_timestamp":1743175500,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:25:00","exam_id":153},{"id":"f8yXxXLQncdkds2i9QUS","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer":"B","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:26:00","question_text":"An auditor is reviewing an organization's virtual machines (VMs) hosted in the cloud.

Review the relevant configuration settings on the CM tool and check whether the CM tool agents are operating effectively on the sample VMs.\n\nThis approach is the most comprehensive for assessing the operating effectiveness of the password policies enforced by the CM tool. By reviewing the configuration settings on the CM tool, the auditor can verify that the correct password policies are defined. Additionally, by checking the operation of the CM tool agents on a sample of VMs, the auditor can ensure that these policies are being correctly applied and enforced. This dual approach provides assurance that the CM tool is functioning as intended and that the VMs adhere to the organization's password requirements.","comment_id":"1411348","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743175560.0"}],"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"exam_id":153,"question_id":154},{"id":"KjHWIPK5ZPA74EcH0Pbt","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe results of third-party audits and certification should be relied on when analyzing and assessing cybersecurity risks in the cloud primarily because:\n\nC. To contrast the risk generated by the loss of control\n\nThird-party audits and certifications provide an independent assessment of a cloud service provider's security controls, helping organizations mitigate the risk associated with the loss of direct control over their IT environment. These assessments offer assurance that the provider meets industry standards and best practices for security and compliance, thereby allowing the organization to evaluate the risks more accurately and make informed decisions about their cloud adoption strategy. By relying on these third-party evaluations, organizations can gain confidence in the security posture of their cloud providers, despite the inherent loss of control that comes with using external services.","timestamp":"1743175560.0","poster":"Auditor2020","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1411349"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":153,"question_text":"Why should the results of third-party audits and certification be relied on when analyzing and assessing the cybersecurity risks in the cloud?","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170051-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-243-discussion/","topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:26:00","choices":{"A":"To reinforce the role of the internal audit function","D":"To establish an accountability culture within the organization","B":"To establish an audit mindset within the organization","C":"To contrast the risk generated by the loss of control"},"unix_timestamp":1743175560,"question_id":155}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"name":"CCAK","numberOfQuestions":258,"id":153,"provider":"Isaca","isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":31},"__N_SSP":true}
