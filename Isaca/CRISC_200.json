Identify changes in risk factors and initiate risk reviews.\n\nThe best course of action for the newly hired risk practitioner is to \"C. Identify changes in risk factors and initiate risk reviews.\" If the risk register has not been updated for a year, there is a significant risk that the register might not accurately reflect the current risk landscape. The risk practitioner should start by identifying any changes in risk factors, business environment, or operations that may have occurred over the past year. After identifying these changes, the practitioner should initiate risk reviews to assess the current risk profile and update the risk register accordingly.\n\nWhile the other options might have their merits in specific contexts, the immediate priority should be to ensure that the risk register is accurate and up to date. This can be achieved by systematically reviewing and updating the register based on changes in risk factors and the organization's context."},{"comment_id":"858111","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1711988820.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with C.","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1680366420,"exam_id":160,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-04-01 18:27:00","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Identify changes in risk factors and initiate risk reviews","D":"Engage an external consultant to redesign the risk management process","B":"Outsource the process for updating the risk register","A":"Implement a process improvement and replace the old risk register"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104773-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-588-discussion/","question_id":996,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"l7OAN3SSZYxmHdHNE5iK","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1624526880,"question_images":[],"exam_id":160,"question_text":"Reviewing results from which of the following is the BEST way to identify information systems control deficiencies?","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/55966-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-589-discussion/","question_id":997,"timestamp":"2021-06-24 11:28:00","choices":{"A":"Control self-assessment (CSA)","B":"Vulnerability and threat analysis","C":"User acceptance testing (UAT)","D":"Control remediation planning"},"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1658277420.0","content":"agree A","comment_id":"528087","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Raj1510"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"B is more objective than A","timestamp":"1718352480.0","poster":"King21","comment_id":"1096292"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nShould be A","poster":"mraiyan","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702322700.0","comment_id":"920879"},{"comment_id":"858115","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1696177920.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSelected A."},{"content":"should be A","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1691894160.0","poster":"Julianleehk","comment_id":"807053","comments":[{"content":"maybe is B","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Julianleehk","timestamp":"1698827580.0","comment_id":"885921"}]},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect, self-assessments allow you to monitor risk and the effectiveness of controls. 7th CRISC manual 'self-assessments' section.","timestamp":"1691771400.0","comment_id":"805520","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1640345280.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Answer is A","comment_id":"389396","comments":[{"content":"Are you absolutely sure it is A?","timestamp":"1643235540.0","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"poster":"huze","content":"this its A only. question is how to assess the information system <b> Control </b> deficiency. that is best by a self assessment of control.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"665366","timestamp":"1678455900.0"}],"poster":"Ramye","comment_id":"414915"}],"poster":"ARAMiS"}]},{"id":"WeLnsxYEiN8i7RhsaWvZ","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1593878460,"question_images":[],"exam_id":160,"question_text":"Which of the following role carriers is accounted for analyzing risks, maintaining risk profile, and risk-aware decisions?","answers_community":["A (80%)","D (20%)"],"answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/24735-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-59-discussion/","answer":"A","question_id":998,"timestamp":"2020-07-04 18:01:00","choices":{"C":"Chief information officer (CIO)","B":"Business process owner","D":"Chief risk officer (CRO)","A":"Business management"},"discussion":[{"poster":"Ramye","timestamp":"1618764720.0","comment_id":"338324","content":"The explanation for the answers says the below which is answer A: Business Management\n\n“Business management is the business individuals with roles relating to managing a program.
