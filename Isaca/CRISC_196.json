An increase in the number of incidents reported.\n\nThe best indication of an improved risk-aware culture following the implementation of a security awareness training program for all employees is \"C. An increase in the number of incidents reported.\" An improved risk-aware culture encourages employees to recognize and report security incidents, breaches, and suspicious activities. This suggests that employees are more vigilant and proactive in identifying potential risks and incidents, leading to increased reporting.\n\nWhile the other options (increase in the number of identified system flaws, reduction in the number of help desk calls, reduction in the number of user access resets) can also show positive outcomes from security awareness training, an increase in reported incidents demonstrates that employees are actively participating in risk management efforts by promptly reporting potential issues they encounter.
