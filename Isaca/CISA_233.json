Compliance with these regulations is crucial for protecting patient privacy, ensuring data security, and avoiding legal liabilities and penalties.","poster":"Swallows"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCompliance with local laws and regulations","poster":"MsFe","comment_id":"1178972","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726885320.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"3008","comment_id":"1009761","timestamp":"1710682200.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCompliance with the organization's policies and procedures: This test would ensure that the organization is following its own internal policies and procedures for handling patient data. These policies and procedures are likely to be tailored to the specific risks and requirements of the organization, and they may be updated more frequently than legal requirements. Therefore, compliance with the organization's policies and procedures could provide a strong level of assurance that patient data is being handled appropriately."}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/120864-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-677-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer":"C","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1694950200,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Compliance with local laws and regulations","B":"Compliance with action plans resulting from recent audits","A":"Compliance with industry standards and best practice","D":"Compliance with the organization's policies and procedures"},"question_id":1161,"timestamp":"2023-09-17 13:30:00"},{"id":"FC4mCrNAyRQhXZl7C3sa","question_id":1162,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/108131-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-679-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-05-01 17:55:00","unix_timestamp":1682956500,"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1292647","poster":"PurpleParrot","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727931600.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\noption C is not valid if it is a hot site. the biggest concern has to be insufficient environmental controls. option A is the answer."},{"poster":"1e71ed5","content":"D. Conflicts due to reciprocal agreements with other organizations\n\nReciprocal agreements, where organizations agree to share each other's resources in the event of a disaster, can lead to conflicts if multiple organizations need to use the hot site simultaneously. This could result in resource contention and affect the effectiveness of the disaster recovery strategy.\n\nWhile insufficient environmental controls, significant distance from the primary data center, and lack of networking infrastructure are also important considerations, they are typically addressed as part of the hot site's setup and operation.
