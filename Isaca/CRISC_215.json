Update the risk response plan.\n\nWhen a control for mitigating risk in a key business area cannot be implemented immediately, the risk practitioner's best course of action is to update the risk response plan. This ensures that there is a documented plan in place to address the risk, even if the primary control cannot be implemented right away. The risk response plan should include details about the compensating control, its effectiveness, and the timeframe for implementing the primary control. This helps in maintaining visibility and accountability for the risk mitigation efforts. While recording the risk as accepted in the risk register may be necessary if the risk cannot be fully mitigated, updating the risk response plan is a more proactive approach to address the issue."},{"poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1712417460.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"863102","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B."}],"answers_community":["B (67%)","D (33%)"]},{"id":"AS5dgAqNpCeOgvg9OgRs","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1677092400,"question_id":1072,"timestamp":"2023-02-22 20:00:00","answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"997132","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. The KRI threshold needs to be revised to better align with the organization's risk appetite.\n\nIf a key risk indicator (KRI) is consistently reported as exceeding thresholds, but senior management takes no action to reduce the risk, it's likely that the KRI threshold is not appropriately aligned with the organization's risk appetite. In such cases, the KRI thresholds may be set too conservatively, leading to frequent alerts that do not represent risks that are significant or unacceptable to the organization.\n\nSenior management should periodically review and adjust KRI thresholds to ensure that they reflect the organization's true risk tolerance. This allows KRIs to provide meaningful insights into risks that genuinely require attention and action. Therefore, revising the KRI thresholds to better align with the organization's risk appetite is the most likely reason for senior management's response in this scenario.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725310200.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"863696","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1712483160.0"},{"timestamp":"1708628400.0","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"818261","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree."}],"exam_id":160,"question_text":"A key risk indicator (KRI) is reported to senior management on a periodic basis as exceeding thresholds, but each time senior management has decided to take no action to reduce the risk.

The risk response aligns with the organization's risk appetite.\n\nThe highest priority when developing a risk response should be ensuring that the response aligns with the organization's risk appetite. Risk appetite defines the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept or tolerate in pursuit of its objectives. Any risk response that exceeds or falls short of the organization's risk appetite may not be effective or appropriate.\n\nWhile other factors like budget considerations, cost-benefit analysis, and a holistic view are important in developing a risk response, they should all be secondary to the fundamental requirement of aligning the response with the organization's risk appetite. This ensures that the response is consistent with the organization's strategic objectives and risk tolerance.","comment_id":"997133"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nMore inclined to go with B on this one.","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1712483400.0","comment_id":"863701","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree.","comment_id":"818262","timestamp":"1708628460.0"},{"timestamp":"1708256280.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"should be B","poster":"Julianleehk","comment_id":"812900"},{"content":"Correct see R2-78","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1654110060.0","comment_id":"372144","poster":"aselunar"}],"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"2YpiV5BuNoP0zPoW4PAS","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"enterprise architecture implementation","A":"buying an insurance policy.","C":"deployment of countermeasures.","B":"acceptance of exposures."},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742250420.0","poster":"faed87a","comment_id":"1399867","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA. is risk transfer\nB. is risk acceptance\nC. is risk mitigation\nD. not related to any risk actions"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C.","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728294660.0","comment_id":"863704"}],"question_id":1074,"unix_timestamp":1680861060,"answer":"C","question_text":"Risk mitigation procedures should include:","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/105495-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-663-discussion/","exam_id":160,"timestamp":"2023-04-07 11:51:00","topic":"1","answer_images":[]},{"id":"qJaU5kivu8C0Dq8IB0Mn","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"hussmohsin","comment_id":"275227","content":"C.
