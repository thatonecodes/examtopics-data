While recovery time objectives (RTOs) and missing information can be important considerations for reviewing the plan, they are not the most important criteria for determining when to review it. Instead, industry best practices recommend that incident response plans should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis, such as annually or bi-annually, to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in response to the evolving threat landscape.

A well-designed incident response plan should contain all the necessary information and procedures required to effectively respond to and recover from incidents. If there are gaps or missing information in the plan that hinder the successful recovery from an incident, it becomes crucial to review and update the plan accordingly.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n\nA. When recovery time objectives (RTOs) are not met: While not meeting recovery time objectives can be a trigger for reviewing the incident response plan, it may be a symptom of other underlying issues rather than the primary criterion for review.
