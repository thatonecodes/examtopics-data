By taking proactive steps to guarantee the occurrence of the opportunity (in this case, reducing the project time by bringing in more qualified resources or enhancing quality), the organization is exploiting the opportunity.\nThe other options are:\n\nEnhance: This strategy involves increasing the probability or impact of an opportunity, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee that the opportunity will be realized.

This strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized. Exploiting a risk event provides opportunities for positive impact on a project. Assigning more talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion is an example of exploit response.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: The enhance strategy closely watches the probability or impact of the risk event to assure that the organization realizes the benefits.

Quantitative analysis helps in prioritizing risks based on their potential impact on the project's objectives and allows for better decision-making regarding risk response strategies.

Identifying controls.\n\nIS monitoring and maintenance is an ongoing process that involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to the organization's information systems. The first step in this process is to identify the controls that are currently in place to protect the organization's information systems. This includes identifying both technical and organizational controls.\n\nOnce the current controls have been identified, they need to be assessed to determine their effectiveness in mitigating risks. This will involve evaluating the likelihood and impact of potential threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the effectiveness of the controls in preventing or detecting these threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe results of the risk assessment will be used to prioritize risks and to identify the controls that need to be strengthened or implemented.
