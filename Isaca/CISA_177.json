This approach can be useful if the organization has a specific goal or objective in mind and wants to focus its efforts on the areas that need the most improvement. This approach can also be more feasible for small organizations, as it does not necessarily require a significant investment of time or resources.","comment_id":"915003"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhile assessing the current maturity level and compliance with key controls (Option A) is valuable, small organizations often have limited resources and may not have the capacity to fully comply with all controls associated with higher maturity levels. Therefore, the primary focus should be on identifying practical and achievable actions that can help the organization progress towards its desired maturity level. This involves identifying specific areas for improvement, setting realistic goals, and implementing targeted initiatives to enhance organizational processes, capabilities, and performance.","comment_id":"1226544","timestamp":"1733641860.0","poster":"Swallows"},{"timestamp":"1725348840.0","poster":"KAP2HURUF","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA maturity model is used to assess the current level of efficacy and development in a certain area, like IT processes, in an organization. For a small organization, it is crucial to identify where they currently stand in terms of maturity and what actions need to be taken to reach their desired maturity level. It helps with strategically planning improvements, resource allocation, and setting achievable targets. While benchmarking against mature organizations or striving for the highest maturity level could be useful, the first and most beneficial step is to understand the steps needed to reach their specific, realistic goals.","comment_id":"1164656","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1682610480,"exam_id":156},{"id":"IlAXWMXSuEC1XqA1RFWI","timestamp":"2023-03-02 17:32:00","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":156,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":882,"discussion":[{"poster":"KEVCASTILLO","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741301640.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDefine la legitimidad y el mandato del auditor para llevar a cabo las actividades necesarias y obtener acceso a la informaci√≥n requerida.","comment_id":"1366054"},{"comment_id":"827105","timestamp":"1725287520.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

The individual may approve fraudulent invoices, alter the amounts on invoices, or misstate the reconciliation to hide discrepancies. Segregation of duties is a fundamental principle of internal control that aims to minimize the risk of fraud and error by dividing critical financial and operational responsibilities among different individuals. By separating the tasks of reconciling invoices from the authority to approve them, it becomes more difficult for a single individual to commit fraud or make an error without detection."},{"comment_id":"790164","poster":"Eric0223","content":"B, it s finance concerns. for SoD. fraund is more critical and must be fully concern","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674870660.0"},{"comment_id":"768458","content":"Selected Answer: B\nshould be B","upvote_count":"3","poster":"David_Hu","timestamp":"1673089440.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-01-07 12:04:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/94281-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-407-discussion/","question_id":883,"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Vendor selection and statements of work","D":"Goods receipts and payments","B":"Invoices and reconciliations","C":"Purchase requisitions and purchase orders"},"question_text":"Which of the following areas of responsibility would cause the GREATEST segregation of duties conflict if the individual who performs the related tasks also has approval authority?","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1"},{"id":"NqSrxodREbO60OFvbicV","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":884,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/115603-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-408-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"B":"The IS auditor designed an embedded audit module exclusively for auditing the application system.","D":"The IS auditor provided consulting advice concerning application system best practices.","C":"The IS auditor participated as a member of the application system project team, but did not have operational responsibilities.","A":"The IS auditor implemented a specific control during the development of the application system."},"question_text":"Which of the following would MOST likely impair the independence of the IS auditor when performing a post-implementation review of an application system?","timestamp":"2023-07-18 12:45:00","unix_timestamp":1689677100,"topic":"1","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":156,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725045120.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"994429","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is answer.","poster":"3008"},{"content":"C.
