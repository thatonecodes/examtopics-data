The intention of these scenarios is to elicit feedback from multiple stakeholders (e.g., departments, customers, management).

KRIs are used to track and monitor the performance of risk management activities and to provide early warning of potential risk events. If KRIs exceed their thresholds, it is important that they are reported to management so that they can take appropriate action to mitigate the risk. Failure to report such incidents in a timely manner can result in increased risk exposure and the potential for negative impacts to the organization. The frequency of reporting to management may be important, but it would not be as significant a concern as a lack of reporting of key risk events.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"814588","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1676842800.0"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1676842800,"timestamp":"2023-02-19 22:40:00","choices":{"C":"There is a significant number of manual risk monitoring processes.","B":"The list of stakeholders for alert notifications is outdated.","A":"There is a lack of reporting when a key risk indicator (KRI) exceeds its thresholds.","D":"The frequency of reporting to management is misaligned with corporate standards."}},{"id":"Z19ZeBNNnsjG4z6Jk9Js","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":179,"exam_id":160,"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/93106-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1170-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","choices":{"B":"Data minimization","A":"Purpose limitation","D":"Accountability","C":"Accuracy"},"topic":"1","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1724235780.0","comment_id":"1155510","poster":"Promz","upvote_count":"1","content":"C\nIn the context of launching a campaign to advertise a new product using data analytics, the GREATEST concern to the risk practitioner should be the \"Accuracy\" of the data.
