Risk assessment\n\nA risk assessment is the best approach for selecting controls to minimize risk because it involves identifying, analyzing, and evaluating potential risks to an organization's assets. By understanding the risks faced by an organization, it becomes possible to prioritize and select controls that are most effective in reducing those risks. While industry best practices, cost-benefit analysis, and control-effectiveness evaluations are important considerations in selecting controls, they are typically more effective when informed by the results of a comprehensive risk assessment."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719261540.0","comment_id":"1104897","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
