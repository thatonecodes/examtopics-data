This can help to reduce the variance in the assessment of risk, meaning that different people or teams within the organization are more likely to come to similar conclusions about the likelihood and impact of a particular risk. This, in turn, can lead to more consistent and reliable risk assessments, which can help the enterprise to make more informed decisions about risk management and mitigation.\n\nReducing risk appetite and tolerance levels (Option A) is not necessarily a direct outcome of establishing a uniform definition for likelihood and impact. Developing key risk indicators (KRIs) (Option B) is a separate process that may be informed by consistent risk assessments but is not a direct outcome of establishing uniform definitions.
