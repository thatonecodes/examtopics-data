At the repeatable level, requisite processes are established, defined and documented. As a result, basic project management techniques are established, and successes in key process areas are able to be repeated.\n3. Defined. At the defined level, an organization develops its own standard software development process. These defined processes enable greater attention to documentation, standardization and integration.\n4.
