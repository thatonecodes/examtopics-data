Acquire the resources that will be required.\n\nHere are the reasons why:\n\n IT governance is a complex and resource-intensive undertaking. Before any other steps can be taken, the enterprise must first acquire the resources that will be required to implement the program. This includes things like funding, personnel, and IT infrastructure.\n Acquiring resources early in the process helps to ensure that the program is aligned with the organization's overall goals and objectives. This is because the resources that are acquired will be used to support the program's activities and initiatives.\n Acquiring resources early in the process helps to build momentum for the program. When stakeholders see that the organization is serious about implementing IT governance, they are more likely to be supportive of the program.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it is not the first step in implementing IT governance. The scope of the program can be developed after the resources have been acquired."}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":"establish initiatives for business and managers","A":"communicate the program to stakeholders to gain consensus","C":"initiate the program using an implementation roadmap","D":"acquire the resources that will be required"},"answer_images":[],"exam_id":155,"question_text":"An enterprise considering implementing IT governance should FIRST develop the scope of the IT governance program and:","timestamp":"2023-06-20 07:59:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/112663-exam-cgeit-topic-1-question-431-discussion/","question_id":278,"question_images":[],"answer":"A"},{"id":"6o2R8eYEDozmnvX4zVft","exam_id":155,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":279,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"A","question_text":"Which of the following is a responsibility of an IT strategy committee?","unix_timestamp":1710057780,"choices":{"A":"Advising the board on the development of IT goals","B":"Providing oversight on enterprise strategy implementation","D":"Tracking projects in the IT investment portfolio","C":"Approving the business strategy and its IT implications"},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"SuperMax","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Assess the risk associated with the new regulation.\n\nWhen an enterprise learns of a new regulation that may impact the delivery of one of its core technology services, the FIRST step should be to assess the risk associated with the new regulation.\n\nAssessing the risk allows the enterprise to understand the potential impact of the regulation on its operations, services, compliance requirements, and overall business objectives. It involves evaluating the likelihood of non-compliance, the potential consequences of non-compliance, and identifying any gaps or areas of vulnerability within the current processes or systems.\n\nOnce the risk associated with the new regulation is assessed, the enterprise can then develop an informed action plan to address the compliance requirements and mitigate any potential risks.
