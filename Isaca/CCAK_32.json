Risk mitigation\n\nThe scenario describes a situation where the organization continues to use the SaaS service but avoids processing secret customer data to prevent disclosure to unauthorized parties. By not processing the sensitive data, the organization is reducing the potential impact of the risk. This approach aligns with risk mitigation, which involves taking steps to reduce either the likelihood or the impact of a risk to an acceptable level. In this case, the organization is mitigating the risk by altering its operations to avoid exposing sensitive data while still using the SaaS service for other purposes."}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"cnZT4NYNtLbs76A2epUl","timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:26:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":153,"choices":{"B":"shared.","A":"transferred.","C":"maintained.","D":"avoided."},"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_text":"When an organization is moving to the cloud, responsibilities are shared based upon the cloud service providerâ€™s model and accountability is:","discussion":[{"poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1411351","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. shared.\n\nIn a cloud computing environment, responsibilities are shared between the cloud service provider and the customer based on the specific cloud service model being used (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, etc.). Accountability, however, is shared rather than transferred. Both parties have specific responsibilities that they must manage and fulfill. For example, the cloud provider may be responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, whereas the customer is responsible for securing their data and applications within that infrastructure. This shared responsibility model requires both parties to work together to ensure security and compliance in the cloud environment.","timestamp":"1743175560.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1743175560,"question_id":157,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170053-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-245-discussion/","answer":"B"},{"id":"0bmD7YzKFHreyNi0UKOS","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST relevant question in the cloud compliance program design phase?","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170054-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-246-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1743175620,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":158,"exam_id":153,"choices":{"C":"Who owns the cloud services strategy?","A":"Who owns the cloud portfolio strategy?","B":"Who owns the cloud governance strategy?","D":"Who owns the cloud strategy?"},"answer":"D","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743175620.0","comment_id":"1411353","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Who owns the cloud strategy?\n\nDuring the cloud compliance program design phase, understanding who owns the cloud strategy is the most relevant question. The cloud strategy encompasses the overall vision, goals, and objectives for cloud adoption within the organization, including compliance considerations. Ownership of the cloud strategy indicates who is responsible for aligning cloud initiatives with business objectives, ensuring compliance requirements are met, and managing risks associated with cloud services. This strategic ownership is crucial for guiding the compliance program's design to ensure it supports the organization's cloud-related goals effectively."}],"timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:27:00","topic":"1"},{"id":"b2Sb5cLUVCRlnN0TmN77","answer_images":[],"question_id":159,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. shadow IT.\n\nShadow IT refers to the use of information technology systems, devices, software, applications, and services without explicit organizational approval and outside the control of the IT department.
