This involves identifying and assessing potential risks and vulnerabilities in your current information security practices and systems. By conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, you can gain a clear understanding of the potential impact of the new regulation on your organization and prioritize your efforts accordingly. This will help you identify the areas that need improvement and allocate resources effectively. Once the risk assessment is completed, you can proceed with other measures such as industry benchmarking, independent audit, and gap analysis to ensure compliance with the regulation.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1051469"},{"comment_id":"1024444","upvote_count":"1","poster":"richck102","timestamp":"1696394340.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\ni vote C.
