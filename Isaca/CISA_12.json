Rapid elasticity refers to the ability to quickly and easily scale computing resources up or down based on demand. This allows users to dynamically allocate and deallocate resources as needed, providing flexibility and efficiency in handling varying workloads.","timestamp":"1731551700.0"}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":56,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1699929300,"question_text":"Which feature associated with an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud service provider allows for the provisioning of new servers as demand changes?","timestamp":"2023-11-14 03:35:00","exam_id":156},{"id":"q4r1YUOpgV6MU4qvHUZp","unix_timestamp":1699929360,"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/126017-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1049-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":57,"question_text":"Which of the following provides the BEST evidence that all elements of a business continuity plan (BCP) are operating effectively?","timestamp":"2023-11-14 03:36:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":156,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731551760.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1069939","poster":"FAGFUR","content":"Selected Answer: B\nFull operational test results provide the BEST evidence that all elements of a business continuity plan (BCP) are operating effectively.

Additionally, they rely on predefined criteria for what constitutes a \"reasonable\" value, which may not always capture all legitimate transactions.\n\nIn contrast, reconciling total amounts by project (Option B) provides a more comprehensive validation of data accuracy.

This aligns with CISA's emphasis on preventive controls that catch errors at the source, before they are transferred to the job-costing system.\n\nBy implementing reasonableness checks, the system can flag entries that seem too high or low compared to historical data or project benchmarks.

It ensures that the total costs in the job-costing system match the calculated totals from the spreadsheets used for project cost estimates.\n\nSo, while both \"Reconciliation of total amounts by project\" and \"Validity checks, preventing entry of character data\" are valuable controls, they serve slightly different purposes:\n\n- \"Reconciliation of total amounts by project\" focuses on detecting errors and discrepancies after data entry.\n- \"Validity checks, preventing entry of character data\" focuses on preventing incorrect data from being entered in the first place by ensuring the data meets certain criteria.\n\nIn practice, a combination of these controls would provide robust data accuracy and integrity assurance.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"996311"},{"comment_id":"984924","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Reconciliation of total amounts by project\n\nThe best control to ensure that data is accurately entered into the job-costing system after being calculated in spreadsheets is to perform a reconciliation of total amounts by project (Option B). Reconciliation involves comparing the totals from the spreadsheet calculations with the totals entered into the job-costing system. This helps identify any discrepancies or errors between the two sets of data, ensuring that the data has been accurately transferred and entered. Reconciliation provides an effective way to catch data entry mistakes and maintain the integrity of the financial information in the system.","timestamp":"1692417300.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"lsiau76"},{"content":"Reconciliation of total amounts by project: This control involves verifying the total cost estimate calculated in the spreadsheet against the total entered into the job-costing system.
