High-risk scenarios can have a significant impact on the enterprise's objectives, and could cause a significant delay or failure of the project if not properly managed.\nThis level of risk is different from moderate risk which is a risk that can be mitigated or managed with proper planning, low risk which is a risk that has little or no impact on the project, and extremely high risk which is a risk that is seen as catastrophic and has a severe impact on the project.\nIt's important to note that the level of risk is usually relative and it depends on the context of the project, the industry, and the enterprise.","timestamp":"1689359640.0","upvote_count":"6","poster":"mfourati"},{"comment_id":"1348829","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBest answer is High Risk (B) ✅: Significant impact on critical enterprise goals, requiring immediate attention.","timestamp":"1738195500.0","poster":"CPS13","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733077620.0","poster":"mo7k","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe key word here is noticeable","comment_id":"1222776"},{"poster":"jorigene","content":"It's definitely B.

However, we can provide some guidance on how to assess the level of risk in a project.\n\nThe level of risk in a project is typically assessed by considering two factors: the likelihood of the risk occurring and the impact it would have if it did occur. The likelihood of a risk can be assessed by considering factors such as the probability of the risk occurring, the frequency with which it might occur, and the severity of its consequences. The impact of a risk can be assessed by considering factors such as the potential financial or reputational damage to the enterprise, the impact on stakeholders, and the effect on the success of the project goals.","timestamp":"1712474160.0","poster":"SuperMax","comments":[{"content":"Based on these factors, the level of risk can be assessed as low, moderate, high, or extremely high. A low level of risk typically means that the likelihood of the risk occurring is low and the impact, if it were to occur, would be relatively minor. A moderate level of risk typically means that the likelihood of the risk occurring is moderate and the impact, if it were to occur, would be moderate. A high level of risk typically means that the likelihood of the risk occurring is high and the impact, if it were to occur, would be significant. An extremely high level of risk typically means that the likelihood of the risk occurring is very high and the impact, if it were to occur, would be catastrophic.","poster":"SuperMax","comments":[{"content":"Therefore, without additional information on the likelihood and impact of the risk, it is not possible to definitively determine the level of the identified risk in the project.
