Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n\nExplanation:\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network, like the internet. When the goal is to protect data transmissions, especially to devices in the field, TLS is the most suitable method. It ensures that data transmitted between two systems—such as a web server and a client device—is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping and tampering.\n\nNote: HTTPS (Option D) is essentially HTTP over TLS. While HTTPS is commonly mentioned in the context of web browsers and secure web communication, TLS is the underlying protocol that provides the security, making it the best choice when considering general data transmissions and not just web-based communications.","poster":"Ahbey_911","timestamp":"1697656800.0"},{"poster":"MikeHui","timestamp":"1696849620.0","content":"B, for transmission below Layer 7","comment_id":"1028786","upvote_count":"3"}],"exam_id":154,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/122970-exam-cdpse-topic-1-question-147-discussion/","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_text":"What is the BEST method for protecting data transmissions to devices in the field?","answer_ET":"B","choices":{"C":"Application level authentication","D":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)","B":"Transport Layer Security (TLS)","A":"Multi-factor authentication"},"timestamp":"2023-10-09 13:07:00"},{"id":"smYViIA2v2yQUkvP5WWw","exam_id":154,"question_id":44,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nYep - DLP","poster":"4dfe785","timestamp":"1726069200.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1282214"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Craigp990i","timestamp":"1713968220.0","comment_id":"1201442","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
