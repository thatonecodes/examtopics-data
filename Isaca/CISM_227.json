Contractual provisions for data repatriation\n\nThe best option for mitigating the risk of information loss caused by a cloud service provider becoming insolvent is to have contractual provisions for data repatriation. This means that in the event of the cloud service provider's insolvency or other issues, the contract should include provisions that allow you to retrieve your data and applications from the provider's infrastructure and bring them back in-house or transfer them to another service provider.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1710138060.0","comment_id":"1004437"}],"answer_images":[],"answer":"C"},{"id":"aQWB28yCrIzLUeCEfHWC","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":1132,"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":157,"question_text":"An information security team has been tasked with identifying confidential data within the organization to formalize its asset classification scheme.

To improve the response process.\n\nA post-incident review, also known as a post-mortem or after-action review, is conducted after an incident or event to assess what happened, identify lessons learned, and improve future incident response. While all the options listed are important considerations after an incident, the primary reason for conducting a post-incident review is to improve the response process.\n\nDuring a post-incident review, the organization involved in the incident analyzes the incident's causes, response effectiveness, and any gaps or shortcomings in their procedures, systems, or training. By identifying areas for improvement, organizations can make adjustments to their incident response plans, enhance their security measures, and better prepare for future incidents.","poster":"koala_lay","timestamp":"1729646220.0"},{"comment_id":"1024395","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

This ensures that even if the email is intercepted, the password is not readily available to the unauthorized party, adding an extra layer of security.","poster":"oluchecpoint","timestamp":"1710138240.0"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1694406240,"question_id":1134,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/120482-exam-cism-topic-1-question-897-discussion/","exam_id":157,"timestamp":"2023-09-11 06:24:00","answer":"C"},{"id":"wABOAi9IX8IjWjhVIN7P","unix_timestamp":1696390560,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":157,"question_text":"The PRIMARY purpose of implementing information security governance metrics is to:","choices":{"A":"measure alignment with best practices.","D":"guide security towards the desired state.","B":"refine control operations.","C":"assess operational and program metrics."},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-10-04 05:36:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722185340.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AlexJacobson","content":"Selected Answer: D\nMetrics are all about decision making.","comment_id":"1134351"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. guide security towards the desired state.","poster":"richck102","comment_id":"1024399","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712201760.0"}],"answer":"D","question_id":1135,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/122327-exam-cism-topic-1-question-898-discussion/","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"id":157,"name":"CISM","provider":"Isaca","isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":1247},"currentPage":227},"__N_SSP":true}
