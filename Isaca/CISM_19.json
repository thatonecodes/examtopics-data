Isolate the impacted endpoints.\n\nIsolating the impacted endpoints should be the information security manager's FIRST step upon discovering that a ransomware attack has been triggered by an employee clicking on a link in a phishing email. This action is essential to prevent the ransomware from spreading further across the organization's network, thereby containing the attack and minimizing potential damage. Isolating affected systems helps in protecting unaffected resources and is a critical step in managing and mitigating the incident effectively.\n\nWhile senior management's involvement and guidance are essential, especially in handling communications, legal considerations, and overarching organizational responses, the urgency of containing the ransomware attack to minimize its impact dictates that notifying senior management should follow after initial containment efforts have been initiated. This approach aligns with incident response best practices that prioritize immediate actions to secure the organization’s IT environment.","comment_id":"1208248"},{"poster":"nuel_12","timestamp":"1712121600.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the best choice, you have to come in terms to define the function of an information security manger, this is managerial position not operation position, if it was CASP+, GIAC, B will be the answer","comment_id":"1188474","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1711892760.0","poster":"Thavee","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nReport to management first is the correct step even if it does look not a smartest way.
