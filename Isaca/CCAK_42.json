Unlike SAST, DAST is a blackbox and programming language agnostic.\n\nThe primary advantage of using Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) over Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is that DAST is a blackbox testing method and is programming language agnostic. This means DAST tests the application from the outside in, simulating how an attacker would interact with the application without needing access to the source code. It can be used to test any application regardless of the programming language or technology stack used.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1315834","timestamp":"1732195560.0","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"comment_id":"1300015","timestamp":"1729342860.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Rather than scanning code or binaries like SAST, DAST dynamically crawls through an application interface, testing how it reacts to various inputs.\nThe good news is they tend to have low rates of false positives.\nDAST may require some time to fully scan code.","poster":"339dfab"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nCCAK P# 355 - dynamic application security testing (DAST) dynamically crawls through an application’s interface, testing how it reacts to various inputs.

A DAST tool crawls the application and probes it for runtime vulnerabilities just like an attacker would. On the other hand, static application security testing (SAST) is a white-box security testing method that inspects the application source code to identify potential security vulnerabilities.\n...\n\nSAST works on the application source code, so you need to have that code along with tools that support a specific programming language and web application framework.","timestamp":"1674313320.0","poster":"DawnMBentley"},{"poster":"MJORGER","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree D.","timestamp":"1671889320.0","comment_id":"754905"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1668825060.0","comment_id":"721732","content":"Selected Answer: D\nShould be D.\nRather than scanning code or binaries like SAST, dynamic application security testing (DAST) dynamically crawls through an application’s interface, testing how it reacts to various inputs. DAST scanners cannot see what’s going on behind the scenes, but they offer valuable insight into how code behaves, and they can flush out errors other tests\nmay not see in dynamic code paths. The good news is they tend to have low rates of false positives. These tests are typically run against fully-built applications and they can be destructive, so the tools often include settings to vary between test and production environments. Like SAST, DAST may require some time to fully scan code, so in-line\ntests that gate a release are often run against new code only, and full application sweeps are run in parallel.","poster":"bportuguez"}]},{"id":"4VOqdOCANMB3F1VOiSN5","topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following is a direct benefit of mapping the Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) to other international standards and regulations?","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/168866-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-52-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","exam_id":153,"unix_timestamp":1741704180,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":207,"timestamp":"2025-03-11 15:43:00","answer":"B","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
