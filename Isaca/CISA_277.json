Function point analysis\n\nFunction point analysis is a widely recognized technique for measuring the size and complexity of software applications. It helps in providing a more accurate and standardized way of estimating project size and complexity. By using function points, organizations can establish a common and objective metric for evaluating development efforts, which can lead to more reliable project planning and estimation.\n\nWhile Agile development approaches, Critical Path Methodology (CPM), and Rapid Application Development (RAD) are valuable methodologies for managing and executing software development projects, they don't directly address the issue of inconsistent and inaccurate estimation, which is the primary concern mentioned in the question. Function point analysis, on the other hand, is specifically designed to improve the accuracy of size and complexity estimation in software development projects."},{"timestamp":"1719751620.0","content":"On B, Critical path to check inconsistent","upvote_count":"2","poster":"hoho","comment_id":"939087"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/113758-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-937-discussion/","question_id":1381,"exam_id":156,"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1688129220,"choices":{"B":"Critical path methodology","C":"Rapid application development","A":"Agile development approach","D":"Function point analysis"}},{"id":"sG83ROBgXchXaGACNSaJ","unix_timestamp":1695893400,"topic":"1","answer":"B","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST way to faster continuous improvement of IS audit processes and practices?","question_images":[],"question_id":1382,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/121657-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-938-discussion/","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Invite external auditors and regulators to perform regular assessment of the IS audit function.","D":"Implement rigorous managerial review and sign-off of IS audit deliverables.","B":"Establish and embed quality assurance (QA) within the IS audit function.","A":"Frequently review IS audit policies, procedures, and instruction manuals."},"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1019664","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe best way to facilitate faster continuous improvement of IS audit processes and practices is option B: Establish and embed quality assurance (QA) within the IS audit function.\nOption B, establishing and embedding quality assurance within the IS audit function, involves ongoing processes and practices that focus on improving the quality of audits continually.

Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Determine the audit universe.\n\nDetermining the audit universe involves identifying and defining the scope of the audits to be performed. This step is essential as it helps the IS auditor understand what systems, processes, and areas within the organization need to be audited. Once the audit universe is defined, the IS auditor can then proceed to allocate audit resources, prioritize risks, and review prior audit reports, as these activities are typically based on the knowledge of what is within the audit universe.\n\nSo, while all the listed activities are important, determining the audit universe is the logical starting point for planning IS audits.","timestamp":"1727515860.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1019666","poster":"SuperMax"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1715088120.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"891406","poster":"BabaP"},{"poster":"saado9","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"845029","content":"B.

Compensating controls are alternative controls put in place to address a residual risk after the implementation of preventive or detective controls has not reduced the risk to an acceptable level. In this case, the organization has implemented processes to recover critical files in the event of a ransomware attack as a way of mitigating the risk of data loss in the event of a successful attack. While the ideal situation would be to prevent the attack from occurring in the first place through the implementation of preventive controls (e.g. anti-virus software, firewalls, etc.), the compensating control provides a backup plan to minimize the impact of the attack if it does occur. This type of control is often used when the cost or complexity of implementing preventive controls is high or when the likelihood of the risk event is low."},{"poster":"m4s7er","comment_id":"790129","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1706403000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nanswer is A"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702173660.0","comment_id":"740625","poster":"peelu","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
