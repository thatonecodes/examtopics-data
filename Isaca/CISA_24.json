Network performance testing is typically performed during the system testing phase, which occurs after UAT. Unit testing is performed by developers during the coding phase, and regression testing is performed during the testing phase to ensure that changes to the system do not adversely affect existing functionality."},{"poster":"FAGFUR","comment_id":"1070199","timestamp":"1715672760.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe primary focus of the IS auditor reviewing the first year of the project, where the system version upgrade will be applied, should be on unit testing. Unit testing is a phase of the testing process where individual components or modules of the software are tested in isolation to ensure their correctness and functionality.

Gateway.\n\nA gateway is a networking device that acts as an entry and exit point between two networks, such as a corporate or home network and the Internet. In this context, it typically connects the internal network to the Internet, obtains a public IP address from the Internet Service Provider (ISP), and then assigns private IP addresses to devices within the internal network using Network Address Translation (NAT) or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This allows devices within the internal network to communicate with each other and access the Internet using private IP addresses, while the gateway handles the translation between private and public IP addresses.","timestamp":"1727059740.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1715673000.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"FAGFUR","comment_id":"1070204","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe device that sits on the perimeter of a corporate or home network, obtains a public IP address, and generates private IP addresses internally is a Router. Routers are networking devices that connect different networks together, such as a local area network (LAN) to the Internet. They typically perform network address translation (NAT), allowing multiple devices within the internal network to share a single public IP address while using private IP addresses internally. This helps manage the flow of traffic between the internal network and the external network, providing security and enabling communication between devices on the local network and the Internet."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/126068-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1103-discussion/","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Intrusion prevention system (IPS)","B":"Switch","D":"Router","A":"Gateway"},"exam_id":156,"question_text":"Which type of device sits on the perimeter of a corporate or home network, where it obtains a public IP address and then generates private IP addresses internally?","answer_description":""},{"id":"GsoSmkxOQZA9AWkBN0fj","question_id":119,"choices":{"B":"The frequency of user access reviews performed by management","D":"The frequency of intrusion attempts associated with the accounts payable","C":"The process for terminating access of departed employees","A":"The ability of departed employees to actually access the system"},"question_text":"An IS auditor observes that a large number of departed employees have not been removed from the accounts payable system.
