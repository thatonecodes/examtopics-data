Continuous integration**\n\nContinuous integration (CI) is the most critical concept in managing the build and test of code in DevOps. CI involves automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by building the application and running tests to detect errors as quickly as possible. This practice helps to identify and resolve code conflicts and integration issues early, ensuring that the codebase remains in a healthy state and reducing the risk of defects in the final product.\n\nWhile continuous build, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment are also important in DevOps, continuous integration is the foundational practice that enables these other processes by ensuring that code changes are quickly and consistently verified.","comment_id":"1387857","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1741781880.0"},{"poster":"vsgsds","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPage 347 - Continuous integration manages code building and testing, while continuous delivery refers to the ongoing creation of new features or artifacts.

Organizations may be able to transfer their responsibility for compliance with various regulatory requirements to their CSPs, but they retain the ownership of accountability.**\n\nIn the context of cloud services, while organizations can delegate certain compliance responsibilities to their cloud service providers (CSPs), such as managing the security of the cloud infrastructure, the ultimate accountability for compliance with regulatory requirements remains with the organizations themselves.
