Expected time to resolve incidents is not specified.\n\nThe expected time to resolve incidents is a critical aspect of incident management. It helps establish clear service level agreements (SLAs) and expectations regarding incident resolution times. Without specified resolution timeframes, incidents may linger unresolved for extended periods, leading to potential disruptions, security breaches, and dissatisfied stakeholders. This lack of clarity can undermine the effectiveness of incident management processes and compromise the organization's security and operational stability.","poster":"AB1237","comment_id":"1003714","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1710055860.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/115606-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-412-discussion/"},{"id":"7V2aJO4ZBs2okjOiQviI","isMC":true,"exam_id":156,"choices":{"B":"Implementing a quality assurance (QA) process during the development phase","D":"Tracking data protection requirements throughout the SDLC","A":"Utilizing a data protection template for user acceptance testing (UAT)","C":"Deriving data protection requirements from key stakeholders"},"answer_description":"","question_id":890,"question_text":"Which of the following approaches would BEST ensure that data protection controls are embedded into software being developed?","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731988920.0","poster":"3008","comment_id":"1074438","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1719208740.0","poster":"hoho","content":"I am on B, QA process","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"932235"}],"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/113155-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-413-discussion/","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-06-24 07:59:00","unix_timestamp":1687586340,"topic":"1","answer":"D"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":156,"numberOfQuestions":1441,"provider":"Isaca","isMCOnly":true,"name":"CISA","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":178},"__N_SSP":true}
