Organizational risk appetite\n\nOrganizational risk appetite is the factor that has the MOST influence on the information security investment process. Risk appetite refers to an organization's willingness to accept and manage risks. It sets the tone for how much an organization is willing to invest in information security to protect its assets, data, and operations. The level of risk appetite directly impacts decisions regarding budget allocation, resource allocation, and the overall approach to information security.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1725703200.0","comment_id":"1001406","poster":"oluchecpoint"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"richck102","timestamp":"1719552540.0","content":"B.
