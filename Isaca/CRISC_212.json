Periodically reviewing big data strategies\n\nIn an organization where data analytics plays a crucial role in decision-making, it's important to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable. Periodically reviewing big data strategies can help identify any issues with data quality, sourcing, and processing, thus helping to minimize the risk associated with inaccurate data.\n\nEvaluating data sources for vulnerabilities (Option A) is important but focuses more on security rather than accuracy. Establishing an intellectual property agreement (Option B) would likely not address the issue of data accuracy. Benchmarking to industry best practice (Option C) could help improve processes but may not directly address the specific risk of inaccurate data. Therefore, the periodic review of big data strategies is the best choice for ensuring data accuracy and minimizing associated risks.","timestamp":"1727253960.0","comment_id":"1016628","poster":"01010100"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Evaluating each of the data sources for vulnerabilities\n\nBy thoroughly evaluating each data source for vulnerabilities, you can identify potential weaknesses and data quality issues early in the data collection and integration process. This allows you to implement appropriate data cleansing, validation, and quality assurance measures. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your data sources is a fundamental step in minimizing the risk of inaccurate data negatively impacting decision-making.\n\nWhile establishing intellectual property agreements (B), benchmarking to industry best practices (C), and periodically reviewing big data strategies (D) are important aspects of managing data-related risks, they do not directly address the issue of inaccurate data at the source, which is crucial for data-driven decision-making.","timestamp":"1725304200.0","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"997086","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree with A.","comment_id":"859806","timestamp":"1712140080.0","poster":"CbtL"},{"poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708627140.0","comment_id":"818231","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree."},{"content":"should be D","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708220940.0","comment_id":"812553","poster":"Julianleehk"},{"timestamp":"1674356280.0","poster":"Raj1510","comment_id":"529545","content":"agree with A","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1655444460.0","comment_id":"383941","content":"I agree with A","poster":"ARAMiS"},{"comment_id":"347019","poster":"oguz_1523","content":"It should be D.","timestamp":"1651412460.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"choices":{"B":"Establishing an intellectual property agreement","D":"Periodically reviewing big data strategies","A":"Evaluating each of the data sources for vulnerabilities","C":"Benchmarking to industry best practice"},"topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":160,"answers_community":["A (75%)","D (25%)"],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/51419-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-645-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"In an organization dependent on data analytics to drive decision-making, which of the following would BEST help to minimize the risk associated with inaccurate data?","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1619876460,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_id":1056},{"id":"CK2XBCzGeTvIcpfmLUu8","question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST important consideration when multiple risk practitioners capture risk scenarios in a single risk register?","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-04-03 12:32:00","answers_community":["A (67%)","D (33%)"],"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"Aligning risk ownership and control ownership","C":"Maintaining up-to-date risk treatment plans","A":"Using a consistent method for risk assessment","B":"Developing risk escalation and reporting procedures"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104957-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-646-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":160,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nConsistency in the method of risk assessment ensures that all risk practitioners evaluate and record risks in a uniform manner, which is critical for accurately comparing and aggregating risk data across different areas of the organization.

Aligning risk ownership and control ownership\n\nThis is crucial because clear ownership ensures accountability for managing and mitigating risks. When risk ownership and control ownership are aligned, it becomes clear who is responsible for taking actions to address the identified risks, implement controls, and monitor their effectiveness. Without clear ownership, there can be confusion and a lack of accountability in managing and mitigating risks, which can lead to gaps in risk management processes.","timestamp":"1709415060.0","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"997094","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"859811","timestamp":"1696329120.0","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A."}],"question_images":[],"question_id":1057,"unix_timestamp":1680517920},{"id":"jJNKp2B1IECsbIpDEbMz","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104958-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-647-discussion/","question_id":1058,"answer":"D","question_text":"Which of the following approaches will BEST help to ensure the effectiveness of risk awareness training?","timestamp":"2023-04-03 12:34:00","answer_description":"","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (50%)","A (25%)","C (25%)"],"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"C":"Piloting courses with focus groups","D":"Creating modules for targeted audiences","B":"Using reputable third-party training programs","A":"Reviewing content with senior management"},"unix_timestamp":1680518040,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"997099","poster":"Staanlee","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Piloting courses with focus groups\n\nPiloting courses with focus groups allows you to gather feedback from a representative sample of your target audience before rolling out the training program organization-wide. This approach helps identify any potential issues with the training content, delivery, or materials and allows you to make improvements based on the feedback received. It ensures that the training is relevant, engaging, and effective for the specific audience it is intended for, increasing the likelihood of successful risk awareness and understanding among employees.","timestamp":"1725305700.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"892157","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA, \"senior mgmt owns the risk and bears the ultimate responsibility\" - page 41 of manual.

Developing threats are detected earlier.\n\nAnalyzing logs collected from different systems allows for the correlation of events and behaviors that might not be apparent when looking at logs from a single system in isolation. This integrated view can often lead to the earlier detection of developing threats, providing an opportunity to mitigate risks before they become critical incidents.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D are valid benefits of log analysis, the greatest benefit in a proactive sense is the early detection of developing threats (Option A), as it enables timely response to minimize potential damage.","poster":"01010100"},{"timestamp":"1725306060.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Security violations can be identified.\n\nAnalyzing logs collected from different systems is primarily aimed at identifying security violations and anomalies in the behavior of these systems. It helps in detecting unauthorized access, unusual patterns of activity, and potential security breaches. While logs also support forensic investigations and maintaining a record of incidents, the primary benefit is the real-time or near-real-time identification of security violations, which can enable organizations to respond quickly to mitigate potential threats and minimize damage.","comment_id":"997103"},{"comment_id":"924814","content":"A is proactive, C is reactive.
