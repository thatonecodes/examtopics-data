Require files to be digitally signed before they are transmitted.\n\nExplanation: Digital signatures provide a high level of confidence in the integrity and authenticity of data when it is sent from one party to another. When files are digitally signed, they are encrypted using the sender's private key, and the recipient can use the sender's public key to decrypt and verify the signature. This process ensures that the data has not been tampered with during transit and that it indeed originated from the expected sender.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"987119","timestamp":"1692683400.0","poster":"Hugo1717"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"todush","comment_id":"973858","timestamp":"1691327580.0","content":"Sorry but digital signature has no impact on integrity, only on authentication and non-repudiation.

Require files to be digitally signed before they are transmitted.\n\nRequiring files to be digitally signed before transmission ensures data integrity and authenticity. Digital signatures use cryptographic techniques to verify that the data has not been tampered with during transit and that it originated from the expected sender. The digital signature provides a strong assurance that the data has not been altered and that it comes from a trusted source."}],"question_text":"Which of the following would provide the HIGHEST level of confidence in the integrity of data when sent from one party to another?","answers_community":["B (80%)","D (20%)"],"answer_ET":"B","question_id":351,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/108881-exam-cism-topic-1-question-191-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Harden the communication infrastructure.","D":"Require data to be transmitted over a secure connection.","C":"Enforce multi-factor authentication on both ends of the communication.","B":"Require files to be digitally signed before they are transmitted."},"answer_description":"","exam_id":157,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1683736680,"answer":"B"},{"id":"2rvDh7P5UqJUvKRn9vYR","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/110845-exam-cism-topic-1-question-192-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following is MOST important to the successful implementation of an information security program?","topic":"1","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1324591","poster":"pizzab0i","timestamp":"1733837580.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf you don't have stakeholder input (business unit leaders, end users) how do you know the value to the assets when conducting risk assessments?"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI'm going with D on this one.\n\nPeriodic risk assessments help identify vulnerabilities that may threaten regular operations and, consequently, an organization's reputation.

It also establishes a clear framework for managing access and ensures that access rights are granted based on defined roles, responsibilities, and business needs.\n\nWhy its not D: Performing a risk assessment of access rights is valuable, but it should be coupled with the implementation of standardized access control practices to effectively mitigate the risk of exposure due to conflicting access rights.","poster":"Hugo1717","comment_id":"987124","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1692683880.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nverify the risk, them act on it.","poster":"wello","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1685755620.0","comment_id":"913135"},{"comment_id":"913133","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1685755500.0","content":"Security manager is not sure whether the different access controls will cause a problem.
