Classification of the data\n\nWhen assessing the risk associated with allowing users to access company data from their personal devices (often referred to as Bring Your Own Device or BYOD), the classification of the data is the most important factor to consider. Here's why:\n\nData Sensitivity: The classification of data (e.g., sensitive, confidential, public) determines the level of risk associated with its exposure. Sensitive and confidential data pose higher risks if accessed or stored on personal devices.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Requirements: Different types of data may be subject to specific legal and regulatory requirements regarding their protection and handling. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in legal consequences and fines.\n\nImpact of Exposure: Assessing data classification helps determine the potential impact of data exposure or breach. Highly sensitive data, such as customer personal information or financial records, may have severe consequences if compromised.","timestamp":"1725399060.0"},{"comment_id":"865425","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1712658840.0"},{"poster":"helg420","timestamp":"1712380320.0","comments":[{"poster":"helg420","timestamp":"1712380380.0","content":"I meant A!","comment_id":"862697","upvote_count":"2"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn addition to Boubou480's comments and to further emphasis the rationale... in a scenario where the company data is classified (first step) as non confidential or public information, remote mamagement is unlikely be a factor in the controls.

This is the most important factor to consider when assessing the risk of allowing access to company data from personal devices, as it will help determine the necessary measures to ensure that the data is protected from unauthorized access, modification, or loss. Other factors, such as the type of device, remote management capabilities, and volume of data, may also play a role in the risk assessment but the classification of the data is the primary concern.","timestamp":"1706703060.0"},{"content":"C for me","poster":"Ziggybooboo","comment_id":"778748","timestamp":"1705484280.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1684095420.0","poster":"fora","comment_id":"601761","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC seems correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\ndefinitely A","poster":"MusMus","comment_id":"514099","timestamp":"1672494780.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1623925380,"answer_description":"","exam_id":160,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-06-17 12:23:00","question_id":1124},{"id":"iTL0e3tG78NXBOsHbojh","topic":"1","exam_id":160,"question_text":"Whose risk tolerance matters MOST when making a risk decision?","choices":{"A":"Customers who would be affected by a breach","C":"The business process owner of the exposed assets","D":"Auditors, regulators, and standards organizations","B":"The information security manager"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-09-06 03:33:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1599355980,"answer_images":[],"question_id":1125,"discussion":[{"poster":"hussmohsin","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"275674","content":"The correct answer is C.

The business process owner of the exposed assets\n\nWhen making a risk decision, the risk tolerance of the business process owner of the exposed assets matters most. Here's why:\n\nOwnership and Accountability: The business process owner is responsible for the assets and operations related to the specific business process. They are directly accountable for the outcomes and risks associated with that process.\n\nContextual Understanding: The business process owner has a deep understanding of the specific business operations, objectives, and priorities. They can evaluate risks in the context of how they impact the achievement of business goals.\n\nRisk-Benefit Trade-offs: Business process owners are in the best position to assess the trade-offs between risk and potential benefits.
