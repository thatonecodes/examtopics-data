It should include details about identified risks, their likelihood, potential impact, risk owners, risk responses, and other pertinent information that helps the organization understand and manage its IT risks effectively. While involvement and review by IT governance bodies like the IT steering committee can be beneficial, the primary purpose of the IT risk register is to capture and communicate the results of risk assessments related to IT.","timestamp":"1725746340.0"},{"timestamp":"1712782140.0","comment_id":"866616","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree with A.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL"},{"comment_id":"818462","timestamp":"1708637820.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree.","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI also think it should be A,","comment_id":"515633","timestamp":"1672743720.0","poster":"MusMus"},{"timestamp":"1662814140.0","content":"Process of maintaining a risk register begins from risk identification stage itself.

Risk capacity is the maximum amount of risk that an organization can absorb without jeopardizing its ability to achieve its objectives. It represents the financial, operational, and strategic limits within which an organization can operate while still managing risk effectively. Risk appetite should be set below this threshold to ensure that the organization can handle the risks it takes on without exceeding its capacity to manage them.","poster":"Staanlee"},{"poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree it is A. The review manual talks about appetite not exceeding capacity. I can see that appetite should not exceed tolerance, however tolerance is on a case by case basis whereas appetite and capacity are on organizational / overall basis.
