For software that executes critical business processes, ensuring compliance with licensing terms and the reliability of the software is paramount. Without a right-to-audit clause, the organization may lack the ability to verify the vendor's performance, potentially exposing it to risks such as non-compliance, security vulnerabilities, or service disruptions. While software escrow (option B) is also important for mitigating risks associated with vendor non-performance, the absence of a right-to-audit clause presents a more significant concern as it directly impacts the organization's ability to verify and enforce contractual obligations and ensure the integrity of critical business processes.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1218066","poster":"Swallows"},{"timestamp":"1714637340.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer C\nIn the context of reviewing contracts for licensed software, the primary concern is often ensuring that the organization has the necessary rights and mechanisms to monitor and enforce compliance with the terms of the software license agreement.
