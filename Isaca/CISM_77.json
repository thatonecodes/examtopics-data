APTs are typically highly sophisticated and require specialized skills to address. Threat Intelligence: Skilled professionals can actively monitor emerging threat landscapes, identify APT indicators, and adapt security measures accordingly. Incident Response: They are proficient in incident response practices, enabling them to rapidly respond to APT incidents, contain the threat, and minimize damage. Having network detection tools in place is an important part of APT defense, but without skilled professionals to configure, monitor, and respond to alerts generated by these tools, their value is limited.","comment_id":"1019044"},{"timestamp":"1709491200.0","poster":"oluchecpoint","comment_id":"997808","content":"D.

These tools, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems, network behavior analysis tools, and security information and event management systems, can help identify and respond to APTs in real-time.
