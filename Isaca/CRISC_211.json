Determine if the scenarios need to be accepted or responded to.\n\nWhen new risk events are identified during a project, the next step should be to assess these risks to determine whether they need to be accepted (meaning no action is taken), or if a risk response plan should be developed and implemented. This assessment helps in deciding how to address these new risk events effectively. Continuing with a quantitative or qualitative risk analysis may be part of the process of assessing these new risks, but the initial step is to decide on a course of action based on their potential impact and likelihood. Recording the scenarios in the risk register is an important step but typically comes after the assessment and decision-making process.","timestamp":"1725227520.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"996434"},{"poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712130540.0","comment_id":"859653","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWe do not have enough information to decide if a quantitative or qualitative approach would be warranted.

IT risk register\n\nThe IT risk register typically contains a comprehensive list of identified risks, their descriptions, assessments of their likelihood and impact, current controls in place, risk owners, and potentially the status of risk mitigation efforts. This document serves as a central repository for all known risks within the IT domain and provides a holistic view of the organization's risk landscape.\n\nWhile the other options, such as a list of key risk indicators (A), internal audit reports (B), and a list of approved projects (D), can provide valuable insights and context, the IT risk register is specifically designed to consolidate and present detailed information about IT-related risks, making it the most suitable choice for IT management's needs in this context.","timestamp":"1725303720.0","comment_id":"997079","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712131140.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C.","comment_id":"859661","poster":"CbtL"}],"isMC":true}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true,"id":160,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":1422,"name":"CRISC","provider":"Isaca","isBeta":false},"currentPage":211},"__N_SSP":true}
