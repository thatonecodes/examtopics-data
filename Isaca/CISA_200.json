By implementing clustering, the organization can distribute the workload across multiple servers and ensure high availability. In the event of a server failure, the workload can automatically be shifted to other servers in the cluster, minimizing downtime and maintaining service continuity."},{"content":"B.

Performance data, on the other hand, offers a broader perspective on IT process performance and is directly relevant to evaluating the effectiveness of IT process monitoring initiatives. Therefore, performance data is the BEST source of information for assessing the effectiveness of IT process monitoring."},{"comment_id":"797852","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1691139780.0","poster":"zebree","content":"Performance data is considered the best source of information for assessing the effectiveness of IT process monitoring because it provides objective and quantifiable evidence of the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes being monitored. Performance data can include metrics such as processing times, resource utilization, error rates, and more. By analyzing performance data, IT teams can identify areas where processes can be improved, determine if IT resources are being used optimally, and make data-driven decisions about process monitoring and improvement. In contrast, participative management techniques, quality assurance (QA) reviews, and real-time audit software may provide useful information, but performance data is the most direct and tangible measure of process effectiveness."}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/97936-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-510-discussion/","question_id":998,"choices":{"A":"Performance data","B":"Participative management techniques","D":"Real-time audit software","C":"Quality assurance (QA) reviews"},"unix_timestamp":1675508580,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"exam_id":156},{"id":"TgWqKHzYHBHD7Ykvb5Eo","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Restoring system information from data backups","B":"Generating automated batch job failure notifications","D":"Employing only qualified personnel to execute tasks","A":"Utilizing processes that enforce segmentation of duties"},"exam_id":156,"unix_timestamp":1689940020,"question_text":"Which of the following is an example of a corrective control?","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-07-21 13:47:00","answers_community":[],"question_id":999,"answer":"C","topic":"1","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/115951-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-511-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"C.
