Therefore, if they are not meeting the agreement they will not be getting paid to some degree. Money talks and is what will force them to stay within the bounds that were agreed upon. \n\nC just states that they have a documented process which is great. But say its the weekend and no one is required to be on call but something breaks and it needs to be resolved. But the agreement does not put any requirements on it. Then it won't get fixed till Monday.

Financial penalties or other forms of repercussions for failing to resolve issues promptly create a strong motivation for the provider to prioritize and address problems. While the other options are valuable, they don't provide the same direct and immediate pressure for timely resolution. Why the other options are less effective in this scenario: \nA. Right to audit the service provider upon request: Audits are important for verification, but they don't guarantee immediate issue resolution.\nC.
