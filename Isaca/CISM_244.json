Testing current incident response plans with relevant stakeholders\n\nTesting current incident response plans with relevant stakeholders is the most effective practice for determining the adequacy of incident management operations. This process, often referred to as tabletop exercises or simulations, involves simulating various incident scenarios and evaluating how well the incident response plans and team members perform in real-time. It allows organizations to identify weaknesses, gaps, and areas for improvement in their incident management operations."}],"question_text":"Which of the following practices is MOST effective for determining the adequacy of incident management operations?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":1216,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"AKTRxgE4v9B4fVXY13QG","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/124509-exam-cism-topic-1-question-971-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following MUST happen immediately following the identification of a malware incident?","choices":{"B":"Containment","A":"Eradication","D":"Recovery","C":"Preparation"},"answer_description":"","exam_id":157,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-10-24 06:18:00","unix_timestamp":1698121080,"question_id":1217,"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1052482","timestamp":"1729743480.0","poster":"richck102","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Risk management dashboards.\nRisk management dashboards are specifically designed to provide a comprehensive overview of an organization's risk landscape.
