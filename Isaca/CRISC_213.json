Average time to provision user accounts\n\nMeasuring the average time it takes to provision user accounts is a useful indicator to assess the efficiency of an identity and access management (IAM) process. A shorter average time generally indicates that user accounts are set up quickly and efficiently, reducing delays for employees and ensuring they can access the resources they need promptly. This can contribute to better user satisfaction and more efficient onboarding processes within an organization."},{"timestamp":"1712224200.0","comment_id":"860858","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt is A.","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1708227660.0","poster":"Julianleehk","content":"maybe A is correct","comment_id":"812614","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"812612","content":"should be B","poster":"Julianleehk","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708227540.0"}],"exam_id":160,"unix_timestamp":1676691540,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Number of tickers for provisioning new accounts","B":"Password reset volume per month","D":"Average account lockout time","A":"Average time to provision user accounts"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-02-18 04:39:00","question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST useful indicator to measure the efficiency of an identity and access management process?","question_id":1061,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"Y2NTydrJPQQMM1PGvvlD","answer":"B","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/26687-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-651-discussion/","timestamp":"2020-07-26 13:52:00","choices":{"D":"Risk management strategy planning","B":"Risk identification","A":"Risk response planning","C":"Risk monitoring and control"},"answer_description":"","exam_id":160,"question_id":1062,"unix_timestamp":1595764320,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"The focus should be on Risk Identifications, as the risk register is linked to risk identification activity.","upvote_count":"21","comment_id":"144082","timestamp":"1627300320.0","poster":"NeilKK"},{"timestamp":"1726339320.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1007861","content":"Selected Answer: D\n\nThe Risk Practitioners assist the Risk Officers by undertaking or facilitating activities related to the implementation of the plans for managing risk in an organization.","poster":"Bertolini"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Risk identification\n\nWhen developing a new risk register, the primary focus should be on the initial phase of risk management, which is risk identification. During this phase, the goal is to identify and document potential risks and their associated details, such as their descriptions, potential impacts, and likelihood of occurrence. This forms the foundation for the subsequent risk management activities, including risk response planning, risk monitoring, and control, and risk management strategy planning.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725306420.0","comment_id":"997109","poster":"Staanlee"},{"poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt is B.

Strong authentication\n\nStrong authentication is the most effective measure against external threats to an organization's confidential information. Strong authentication typically involves the use of multiple factors to verify a user's identity, such as something the user knows (e.g., a password), something the user has (e.g., a smart card or token), and something the user is (e.g., biometric data like a fingerprint or facial recognition). This multi-factor approach significantly enhances security by making it much more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access to confidential information, even if they possess some of the authentication factors."},{"timestamp":"1712492520.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"It should be D. the question is talking about external threat. strong authentication can also prevent internal threat.

Identify information security controls in the requirements analysis.\n\nThe best way to ensure that information security risk factors are mitigated when developing in-house applications is to identify information security controls during the requirements analysis phase. This means integrating security considerations into the early stages of the application development process. By doing so, you can define security requirements, identify potential risks, and specify controls that need to be implemented to mitigate those risks."},{"comment_id":"860898","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712226900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with C."},{"timestamp":"1707864720.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWithout a doubt:\nTasks that determine the needs or conditions to meet a new or altered solution, accounting for multiple perspectives, e.g., balancing stakeholder needs and constraints, allocation of requirements to components, breaking down complex requirements to lower level requirements (CMMI).","poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"807892","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"586022","upvote_count":"1","content":"A: is my choice.
