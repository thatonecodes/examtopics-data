In the event that the software vendor goes out of business or is unable to support the software, having the source code held by a third party ensures that the organization can access and maintain the software.

A capacity management plan is a plan for evaluating the load that the system can handle, the size of transactions, resource utilization, etc. By checking whether this plan is properly formulated, it becomes clear how to respond when the load on the system increases and how to increase resources if necessary.","poster":"Swallows","comment_id":"1243145","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720235400.0"},{"timestamp":"1700550540.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nStress testing is designed to evaluate how a system behaves under extreme conditions, including high transaction volumes or loads. If the transaction processing times have increased, reviewing the stress testing results can help identify whether the system was adequately tested under conditions that simulate the production environment.\nStress testing assesses how well the system can handle peak loads, and it helps identify potential performance bottlenecks or issues that may arise during heavy usage. By reviewing the stress testing results, the auditor can gain insights into the system's performance characteristics and identify any weaknesses or areas that need improvement, which could be contributing to the increased transaction processing times.","comment_id":"1076077","upvote_count":"1","poster":"FAGFUR"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Pakawat","comment_id":"907111","timestamp":"1685082360.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB: Stress testing results, this related to performance testing."},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1678629360.0","content":"you have to check the test results first.
