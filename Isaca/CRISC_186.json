By discussing the issue with the risk owner, the control owner can work collaboratively to identify and assess the risks associated with the deteriorated control, determine the appropriate course of action to mitigate the risks, and implement a plan to address the issue.

Discuss risk mitigation options with the risk owner.\n\nThe best recommendation to the control owner when they state that an existing control has deteriorated over time is to discuss risk mitigation options with the risk owner. This course of action involves collaborating with the individual or team responsible for managing the risk associated with the deteriorated control. By discussing the issue with the risk owner, they can work together to identify potential solutions or alternative controls that can help address the situation effectively.\n\nOption B reflects a proactive approach to addressing the control deterioration, focusing on identifying solutions to mitigate the risk. While the other options might be relevant in certain situations, discussing risk mitigation options with the risk owner is the most direct and constructive way to address the control's deterioration.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf the CO for a DOOR finds out the key has been copied, thus out of hands for too many persons.

Evaluating risk impact.\n\nThe most effective way to incorporate stakeholder concerns when developing risk scenarios is to evaluate risk impact. When you evaluate the potential impact of risks, you consider how various scenarios could affect the organization's goals, objectives, operations, and stakeholder interests. By incorporating stakeholder concerns into the evaluation process, you ensure that the identified risk scenarios are aligned with what matters most to the organization's stakeholders.\n\nWhile the other options (creating quarterly risk reports, establishing key performance indicators (KPIs), conducting internal audits) are all important aspects of risk management, they don't directly address the process of developing risk scenarios and integrating stakeholder concerns into those scenarios.
