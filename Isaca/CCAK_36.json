The organization does not perform periodic reviews or control monitoring for its cloud environment, but it has a documented audit plan and performs an audit for its cloud environment every alternate year.\n\nThe greatest concern for an auditor should be the absence of periodic reviews or control monitoring for the cloud environment. Regular monitoring and reviews are essential for identifying and responding to security incidents, compliance issues, and changes in the risk landscape. Without ongoing monitoring, the organization may not be aware of vulnerabilities or non-compliance until an audit is conducted, which in this case, occurs only every alternate year. This gap in continuous oversight increases the risk of undetected security breaches and compliance violations.","comment_id":"1411371","poster":"Auditor2020"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170070-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-262-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","question_id":176,"question_text":"For an auditor auditing an organization’s cloud resources, which of the following should be of GREATEST concern?","unix_timestamp":1743175920,"answer":"C","question_images":[],"exam_id":153,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true},{"id":"BKemqybInWtj6Gm4nk7l","choices":{"A":"Personally identifiable information (PII) is pseudonymized but not fully encrypted.","B":"The cloud customer has encrypted the confidential data in the cloud using its own encryption keys.","D":"According to the cloud customer’s data handling policy, all confidential data should be encrypted, but the confidential data stored in the cloud is well segmented but not encrypted.","C":"The confidential data stored in the cloud is encrypted using encryption keys that are managed by the provider."},"answer":"D","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"An auditor is auditing the services provided by a cloud service provider.

According to the cloud customer’s data handling policy, all confidential data should be encrypted, but the confidential data stored in the cloud is well segmented but not encrypted.\n\nThe greatest concern for the auditor should be that the confidential data stored in the cloud is not encrypted despite the cloud customer’s data handling policy requiring encryption. This represents a direct violation of the organization's policy and potentially exposes the data to unauthorized access. Encryption is a critical control for protecting data confidentiality, especially for sensitive information. Failing to apply encryption as per the organization's policy poses a significant security risk and compliance issue.","comment_id":"1411372","timestamp":"1743175920.0","poster":"Auditor2020"}],"question_id":177,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170071-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-263-discussion/","topic":"1","exam_id":153,"question_images":[]},{"id":"o3vg08reQSlw5B9iLyyj","answer_ET":"C","answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Enterprise cloud security strategy","D":"Policies and procedures","C":"Attestation reports","B":"Enterprise cloud strategy and policy"},"question_id":178,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1743175980,"question_text":"When performing audits in relation to the organizational strategy and governance, what should be requested from the cloud service provider?","exam_id":153,"timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:33:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Enterprise cloud strategy and policy\n\nWhen performing audits concerning the organizational strategy and governance, it is important to request the enterprise cloud strategy and policy from the cloud service provider. These documents outline the strategic objectives, governance framework, and guidelines for using cloud services within the organization. They help the auditor understand how the organization aligns its cloud adoption with its overall strategic goals and how it manages governance and compliance within the cloud environment. This information is crucial for assessing whether the cloud services are supporting the organization's strategic direction and governance requirements effectively.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743175980.0","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1411373"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170072-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-264-discussion/"},{"id":"wWnxR8chukzYUciTs2w8","exam_id":153,"choices":{"B":"the system can handle a high number of users.","D":"the system can be restored after a technical issue.","A":"new releases do not impact previous stable features.","C":"the expected outputs are provided by the new features."},"timestamp":"2025-03-28 16:33:00","answer":"A","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"The MOST important goal of regression testing is to ensure:","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","question_id":179,"unix_timestamp":1743175980,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1743175980.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1411375","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. new releases do not impact previous stable features.\n\nThe most important goal of regression testing is to ensure that new releases do not negatively impact previously stable features of the software. Regression testing is conducted to verify that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionality. By doing so, it helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the application after updates, ensuring that the software continues to perform as expected without introducing new bugs or issues in already-working features."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/170074-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-265-discussion/"},{"id":"a3XAHOk1Z4eKZO4CqLgp","question_id":180,"choices":{"A":"develop a cloud audit plan on the basis of a detailed risk assessment.","D":"monitor progress of audits and initiate cost control measures.","B":"schedule the audits and monitor the time spent on each audit.","C":"train the cloud audit staff on current technology used in the organization."},"unix_timestamp":1741534140,"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"To ensure that cloud audit resources deliver the best value to the organization, the PRIMARY step would be to:","topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. develop a cloud audit plan on the basis of a detailed risk assessment.\n\nThis option is the primary step because it ensures that the audit focuses on areas of highest risk and potential impact to the organization. By conducting a detailed risk assessment, the organization can prioritize audit activities and allocate resources effectively to address significant threats and vulnerabilities. This approach maximizes value by ensuring that audit efforts are aligned with the organization's risk management objectives and compliance requirements, leading to more effective identification and mitigation of risks associated with cloud services.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1372065","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1741534140.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"A","timestamp":"2025-03-09 16:29:00","exam_id":153,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/162480-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-27-discussion/","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":258,"isImplemented":true,"id":153,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"CCAK","isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Isaca","isBeta":false},"currentPage":36},"__N_SSP":true}
