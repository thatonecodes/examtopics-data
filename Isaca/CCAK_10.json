SOC 2 Type 2**\n\nA SOC 2 Type 2 report evaluates not only the design of the controls but also their operating effectiveness over a specified period. This type of report provides assurance that the controls were in place and functioning effectively throughout the period under review, making it the best option for ensuring the operating effectiveness of controls in a cloud service provider offering.\n\nIn contrast, a SOC 2 Type 1 report focuses on the suitability of the design of controls at a specific point in time, without evaluating their operational effectiveness over time. SOC 3 reports are less detailed and intended for public distribution, while SOC 1 reports are focused on financial reporting controls rather than IT and operational controls.","comment_id":"1387910","timestamp":"1741788180.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1298779","content":"Page 379 of CCAK Study Guide.\nSoc2 Type 2- Report on management's description of a CSP system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls (over-a-period-of-time assessment).","poster":"339dfab","timestamp":"1729088880.0"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","choices":{"B":"SOC 2 Type 2","A":"SOC 2 Type 1","D":"SOC 1 Type 1","C":"SOC 3 Type 2"},"question_text":"Which of the following types of SOC reports BEST helps to ensure operating effectiveness of controls in a cloud service provider offering?","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/149621-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-143-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","question_id":46,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"1XxieREKwAe9AetshajR","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741788360.0","poster":"Auditor2020","comment_id":"1387914","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**B.

This service model supports the concept of scripting by enabling developers to write lightweight, event-driven scripts that can be run in the cloud. It promotes rapid development and deployment, enabling developers to focus on writing code that responds to specific triggers or events, similar to scripting.","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nCCAK P# 151 The introduction of new categories of services, such as Function as a Service (FaaS), enhances the concept of scripting. This allows automatic creation of new controls, a capability that is not necessarily available in an on-premises infrastructure. For instance, a FaaS corrective control may replace deleted credentials after notification; this does not have an enterprise analog. A preventive FaaS infrastructure control can proactively adjust security group administrative port assignments (i.e., SSH or RDP) from world open (0.0.0.0/0) to the IP range constraints of an organization","comment_id":"1150176","poster":"sai_murthy","timestamp":"1723629540.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":""},{"id":"s6ipgfKSJwmmYTkVK1Ef","answer":"C","question_id":49,"choices":{"A":"German IDW PS 951","D":"BSI IT-basic protection catalogue","C":"BSI Criteria Catalogue C5","B":"Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS)"},"timestamp":"2024-02-14 13:07:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133866-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-146-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1707912420,"exam_id":153,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following has been provided by the Federal Office for Information Security in Germany to support customers in selecting, controlling, and monitoring their cloud service providers?","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1741788600.0","comment_id":"1387916","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**C.

CCM maps to existing security standards, best practices, and regulations.**\n\nThis is a key benefit of using the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM). The CCM provides a comprehensive framework of security controls that are specifically designed for cloud computing. It maps these controls to a variety of existing standards, best practices, and regulations, such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST, COBIT, and others. This mapping helps organizations ensure that their cloud security practices align with established security standards and regulatory requirements, making it easier to assess compliance and manage risk in cloud environments.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741788660.0"}],"question_id":50,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/168929-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-147-discussion/","answer":"A","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1741788660,"question_text":"Which of the following is a KEY benefit of using the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)?","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2025-03-12 15:11:00","choices":{"B":"CCM utilizes an ITIL framework to define the capabilities needed to manage the IT services and security services.","A":"CCM maps to existing security standards, best practices, and regulations.","D":"CCM uses a specific control for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).","C":"CCM V4 is an improved version from CCM V3.0.1."}}],"exam":{"provider":"Isaca","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"id":153,"name":"CCAK","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":258,"isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":10},"__N_SSP":true}
