However, if I had to choose the most effective option, I would go with option D, conducting penetration testing.\n\nPenetration testing involves simulating real-world attacks on the server to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the server's security posture and helps identify potential entry points for unauthorized access. By performing penetration testing, any security vulnerabilities can be identified and addressed before they can be exploited by malicious actors.","poster":"koala_lay","comment_id":"1047840","timestamp":"1713526500.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"1016112","timestamp":"1711313880.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"D.
