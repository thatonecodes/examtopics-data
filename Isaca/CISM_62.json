Linking security metrics to business objectives\nWhen reporting the effectiveness of an information security program to key business stakeholders, the most important consideration is linking security metrics to the business objectives. This helps to demonstrate the value of the information security program by showing how it supports the overall goals and objectives of the organization. By linking security metrics to business objectives, it becomes clear how the program is helping to protect the organization's assets and reduce risk, which is the ultimate goal of an information security program. Linking security metrics to the business impact analysis (BIA) and demonstrating a decrease in information security incidents and cost savings are also important considerations, but they are not as important as linking security metrics to business objectives as they don't provide a clear indication of how the program is aligning with the organization's goals and objectives.","comment_id":"778895","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1705493880.0"}],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST important consideration when reporting the effectiveness of an information security program to key business stakeholders?","topic":"1","question_images":[],"exam_id":157,"answer_images":[],"question_id":306,"timestamp":"2023-01-17 13:18:00"},{"id":"DXC1zzWOBuTfZFdO4MpR","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/110616-exam-cism-topic-1-question-151-discussion/","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1685511000,"question_id":307,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"poster":"oluchecpoint","upvote_count":"3","content":"C.\nThe PRIMARY purpose of establishing an information security governance framework is to align information security strategy and investments with organizational activities.
