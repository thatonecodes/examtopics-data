With risk appetite, you still have risk tolerance to consider - you can go past the appetite and accept the remainder after choosing to mitigate. If the cost of mitigation or transfer is the same as the impact, you can avoid or accept, but avoidance seems more probable. In the 7th edition of the review manual, page 143, second bullet talks about avoidance is a good choice if mitigation is impractical or too expensive.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"882398"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709316900.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree.","poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"826151"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Risk avoidance is the BEST risk treatment strategy when:","answers_community":["D (50%)","C (50%)"],"exam_id":160},{"id":"mzTCpKyqnUJnXAP1wLFM","question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST important objective from a cost perspective for considering aggregated risk responses in an organization?","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/89602-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-1196-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1669913880,"question_id":207,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer":"B","discussion":[{"content":"Agree with B.","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"882402","timestamp":"1730025240.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1724098500.0","comment_id":"814620","poster":"john_boogieman","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAddress more than one risk response. Aggregating risk responses enables an organization to tackle multiple risks simultaneously, reducing the total cost of risk management. By addressing multiple risks with a single response, the organization can realize economies of scale and reduce the overall cost of managing risks. Prioritizing risk response options is also important, but it is not the primary objective when considering aggregated risk responses from a cost perspective.","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1717253880.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[],"content":"How is combining risk responses going to prioritize individual risk response options?","comment_id":"732865","poster":"blokey"}],"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2022-12-01 17:58:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Reduce likelihood","D":"Reduce impact","C":"Prioritize risk response options","B":"Address more than one risk response"},"exam_id":160},{"id":"mqyBW8DQFnEZyXY0Z2Iu","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following provides the MOST useful information for regular reporting to senior management on the control environment's effectiveness?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730025300.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","comment_id":"882403","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL"},{"timestamp":"1727521200.0","poster":"Broesweelies","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
