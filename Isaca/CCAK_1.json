Risk appetite\nThe risk appetite of an organization defines the level and type of risk it is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. Changes to an organization's risk appetite will most likely influence the expansion or reduction of controls required to remediate risk, including those arising from changes to a SaaS vendor. If the risk appetite increases, the organization may opt for fewer controls, accepting higher risk. Conversely, if the risk appetite decreases, more stringent controls may be implemented to mitigate risks more thoroughly."},{"comment_id":"1310297","content":"C is the correct answer.

Security requirements**\n\nSecurity requirements are critical in evaluating a cloud service provider because they directly relate to how the provider protects data and resources. This includes assessing the provider’s security controls, such as authentication mechanisms, encryption practices, data protection measures, and incident response capabilities. Security requirements ensure that the provider can adequately safeguard the organization's assets in the cloud, making them a central focus in any evaluation and control checklist. Legal, compliance, and operational requirements are also important, but security requirements often require a more detailed and technical evaluation of the provider’s practices and infrastructure.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1387829","poster":"Auditor2020","timestamp":"1741779180.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen building the cloud governance framework, there are two types of requirements that must be met: operational and security.

This approach allows the organization to systematically assess which services pose higher risks and require more frequent or in-depth assurance activities. By focusing on risk, the organization can allocate resources effectively and ensure that the most critical areas receive appropriate attention.
