The review of processes for making changes includes assessing how changes to configurations are authorized, tested, and implemented. This is crucial for ensuring that changes are well-controlled and aligned with business and security requirements.","poster":"FAGFUR","comment_id":"1070522","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1731596400.0"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/126114-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1160-discussion/"},{"id":"IB1rkfdm7WrffhhIjAhP","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/122132-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1161-discussion/","exam_id":156,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"To ensure alignment with the business impact analysis (BIA)","A":"To determine the current risk profile","D":"To achieve compliance with regulatory requirements","C":"To help allocated budget for risk mitigation controls"},"question_text":"Which of the following is the PRIMARY reason to perform a risk assessment?","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2023-10-02 05:16:00","unix_timestamp":1696216560,"discussion":[{"poster":"FAGFUR","comment_id":"1070528","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731596580.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe primary reason to perform a risk assessment is to determine the current risk profile of an organization.

To determine the current risk profile\n\nA risk assessment is typically conducted to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential risks and threats to an organization's assets, operations, and objectives. The primary goal is to understand the organization's current risk profile, which involves assessing the likelihood and impact of various risks. While the other options (B, C, and D) may also be important in the context of risk management, they are often secondary to the fundamental purpose of assessing the current risk profile.","comment_id":"1022763","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":182,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"gTmHkEgcMp5GdNTC4nXN","answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"exam_id":156,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Virtual servers can be recreated on similar hardware faster than restoring from backups.","A":"Virtual servers decrease the recovery time objective (RTO).","B":"Virtual servers reduce the time and complexity associated with backup procedures.","D":"Virtual servers eliminate the need to verify backups."},"timestamp":"2023-08-20 07:50:00","discussion":[{"poster":"Swallows","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn a virtualized environment, the entire server infrastructure is abstracted from physical hardware, allowing for greater flexibility and agility in disaster recovery scenarios.","comment_id":"1213584","timestamp":"1716088860.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe greatest benefit related to disaster recovery for an organization that has converted its infrastructure to a virtualized environment is that virtual servers can be recreated on similar hardware faster than restoring from backups.\nIn a virtualized environment, server configurations are encapsulated in virtual machine (VM) images, allowing for rapid deployment and recovery. If a disaster occurs, virtual servers can be quickly recreated using these images on similar hardware, reducing the time needed for recovery.\nOption C emphasizes the speed advantage of recreating virtual servers, which is often a significant benefit in disaster recovery scenarios.","poster":"FAGFUR","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1070533","timestamp":"1699974420.0"},{"poster":"3008","comment_id":"985570","timestamp":"1692510600.0","upvote_count":"4","comments":[{"content":"Incorrect.

It's important to have a diversified and robust approach to security, considering factors such as encryption algorithms, key management, and overall cryptographic strength.\nIn summary, while encryption is crucial for securing sensitive data in transit, the concern here is the exclusive reliance on a single encryption strength without considering other aspects of security."},{"comment_id":"1022767","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
