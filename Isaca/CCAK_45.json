Audits, assessments, and independent verification of compliance certifications with agreement terms\n\nWhen forming supply chain agreements between cloud service providers (CSPs) and cloud customers, it is essential to include provisions that allow for audits, assessments, and independent verification of compliance certifications. These elements ensure that the CSP is meeting the agreed-upon standards and regulatory requirements, providing the cloud customer with assurance regarding the security and compliance of their data and services. This clause is fundamental to maintaining transparency, accountability, and trust in the cloud service relationship. While organizational charts, customer policies, and regulatory guidelines are relevant, the ability to independently verify compliance is critical for ensuring adherence to the terms of the agreement.","comment_id":"1387487","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"timestamp":"1729338540.0","comment_id":"1198580","poster":"f17907f","content":"Selected Answer: C\nPage 202","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","question_id":221,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Organization chart of the CSP","D":"Regulatory guidelines impacting the cloud customer","B":"Policies and procedures of the cloud customer","C":"Audits, assessments and independent verification of compliance certifications with agreement terms"},"question_text":"Supply chain agreements between CSP and cloud customers should, at minimum, include:","unix_timestamp":1713527340},{"id":"U7NSA8FEHyHHdieOzlpi","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe most appropriate contract term to meet a company's requirement for moving data from one cloud service provider (CSP) to another is:\n\nD. Transition and data portability\n\nTransition and data portability are essential terms that ensure a company can seamlessly transfer its data and applications from one CSP to another. These terms typically cover the processes and technologies needed to export data in a usable format, ensuring interoperability between different cloud environments.
