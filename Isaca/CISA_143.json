This indicates a possibility of source code tampering, misconfiguration, or inadvertent re-introduction of the issue during the build or deployment process. One of the best ways to ensure that only clean, verified code is deployed to production is to compile the code on a dedicated server. This dedicated server should be isolated from development and source code modifications, thereby ensuring that the build process is secure, controlled, and free from tampering or errors.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1328243","poster":"1Naa","timestamp":"1734490620.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. must be the correct answer.

This is because a private cloud is typically dedicated to a single organization and relies on the organization's own infrastructure and resources. Consequently, the scalability is constrained by the physical and financial limits of the organization's hardware and data center capacity.
