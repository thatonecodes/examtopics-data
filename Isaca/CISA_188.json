An outdated plan may no longer be relevant or effective in responding to current risks or disasters.

Without updates, the plan may lack critical information, fail to address new threats or vulnerabilities, and be unable to support the organization's recovery efforts effectively.\n\nWhile conducting tabletop exercises (option C) is important for testing the BCP and enhancing preparedness, the absence of updates to the plan represents a fundamental weakness that could undermine its overall effectiveness. Therefore, the finding that the plan has not been updated in several years should be of greater concern during an IS audit or review of a business continuity plan.","poster":"Swallows","timestamp":"1717889160.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1226959"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1164632","timestamp":"1709457360.0","poster":"KAP2HURUF","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTabletop exercises are critical components of business continuity planning as they simulate various disaster scenarios and test the effectiveness of the BCP in response to those scenarios. Conducting tabletop exercises helps identify weaknesses, gaps, and areas for improvement in the plan, as well as assess the organization's readiness to respond to different types of disruptions. The absence of tabletop exercises suggests that the organization has not tested its BCP in a real-world scenario, leaving it unvalidated and potentially ineffective during an actual disaster or crisis situation.
