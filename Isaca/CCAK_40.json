Aligning shared responsibilities between provider and customer\n\nThe greatest governance challenge in an organization where production is hosted in a public cloud and backups are held on-premises is aligning shared responsibilities between the provider and the customer. This involves clearly defining and managing who is responsible for what aspects of security, compliance, data integrity, and availability. Misalignment or gaps in understanding these responsibilities can lead to vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and potential service disruptions. Ensuring both parties understand and effectively manage their respective duties is critical for maintaining robust governance in such a hybrid environment.","timestamp":"1732142520.0","comment_id":"1315555"},{"comment_id":"1056948","timestamp":"1698595740.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nConsidero que es la C","poster":"Farca","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1680145860.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"855236","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn a hybrid cloud environment, where production is hosted in a public cloud and backups are held on-premises, the greatest governance challenge would be aligning shared responsibilities between the provider and customer.
