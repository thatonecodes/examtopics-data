A project to implement a risk response action plan has been completed and closed successfully.**\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe risk register is a comprehensive document that records identified risks, their assessment, and the strategies employed to manage them. It is updated throughout the project lifecycle, especially when significant events occur that affect risk status. Completing and closing a project aimed at implementing a risk response action plan signifies that specific risks have been addressed. This development necessitates updating the risk register to reflect the current status of these risks, including any changes in their severity, the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies, and any residual risks that may remain.","poster":"d9iceguy","timestamp":"1742589540.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"C","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-03-21 21:39:00"},{"id":"GZw1HVjpVyGdJXWvZrQh","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741966140.0","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nGiven answers are correct.\nCapability to Recognize an Event as Wrong: The enterprise must be able to identify anomalies or deviations from expected behavior to develop effective risk scenarios.\n\nPosition to Observe Issues: The organization needs mechanisms and tools to monitor processes and environments so that potential risks can be spotted early.\n\nThese capabilities ensure the enterprise is proactive and well-prepared to manage risks, even those that are obscure.

The question state \"you have planned the risk response process and now you are about to implement various controls.\" Since you have not actually implemented the control, you do not have any data to evaluate the performance.

Answer is C.","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"775920","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBefore relying on any controls, it is important to conduct pilot testing to ensure that the controls are effective and can be implemented as planned. Pilot testing allows the project team to test the controls in a controlled environment, and to make any necessary adjustments before fully implementing them. This can help to prevent errors, delays, and additional costs that could be incurred if the controls were found to be ineffective or not feasible after implementation.\n\nA. Reviewing performance data refers to evaluating how well the controls are working, discovering risk exposure refers to identifying and analyzing new risks, and articulating risk refers to clearly and effectively communicating risks to stakeholders.","timestamp":"1727409060.0","poster":"mfourati"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Conduct pilot testing\n\nPilot testing involves implementing the controls on a smaller scale or in a controlled environment to assess their effectiveness and identify any potential issues or unforeseen consequences. It allows you to test whether the selected controls can effectively mitigate the identified risks before fully implementing them across the entire project. Conducting pilot testing helps ensure that the controls are practical and that they will work as intended in the actual project environment. This step is crucial for risk management as it helps verify that the chosen controls are appropriate and do not introduce new risks or problems.","comment_id":"1027165","poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727409060.0"},{"timestamp":"1678467240.0","comment_id":"835244","content":"I would also go with C","poster":"ldl","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"haitao1234","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"832030","timestamp":"1678200660.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nPilot testing is important, reviewing performance data may not be able to tell whether the control is reliable or not"},{"poster":"Ndy","comment_id":"472088","timestamp":"1635946380.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"C is the correct answer"},{"content":"I will go with C, pilot testing is very important before you can rely on any controls, performance data review may not be able to provide that reliance","comment_id":"216359","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1604982720.0","poster":"TheSaintRaph"},{"poster":"simonsezzz","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1635307740.0","poster":"LMakoti","comment_id":"468363","content":"I would also go with C"}],"content":"so what is the final answer ,","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"37931","timestamp":"1578810300.0"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":160,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1575104400,"answer_description":"","question_text":"You are the project manager of GHT project.
