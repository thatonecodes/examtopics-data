The iterative meetings allow the project manager and the risk identification participants to identify newly discovered risk events throughout the project.\n\nWhile it's essential to identify risks during the initial project planning phase, risks can evolve or emerge as the project progresses. Holding iterative risk identification meetings allows the project team and stakeholders to stay vigilant and identify any new risks that may not have been apparent during the initial planning phase. This continuous risk assessment helps in proactive risk management and can lead to more effective risk mitigation strategies throughout the project's lifecycle.","comment_id":"1027136","poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"C.

Management may be unable to accurately evaluate the risk profile\n\nWhen risk registers are not automatically aggregated and consolidated into a central view, it becomes challenging for senior management and decision-makers to get a comprehensive and accurate view of the organization's overall risk profile. This lack of visibility can hinder the organization's ability to make informed decisions, prioritize risk treatments, and allocate resources effectively. It can also lead to the misalignment of risk management efforts and a fragmented understanding of the organization's total risk exposure. While the other concerns listed (inefficient resource allocation, multiple risk treatment efforts, and the same risk factor identified in multiple areas) are valid issues, the inability to accurately evaluate the risk profile can have a more significant and overarching impact on the organization's risk management and decision-making processes.","comment_id":"1043215","timestamp":"1728891900.0","poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1717380240.0","poster":"mraiyan","content":"Yes agree with option \"B\", the greatest concern is that maintaining independent departmental risk registers that are not automatically aggregated may result in management being unable to accurately evaluate the overall risk profile of the organization which could result in making wrong decisions about risk management and mitigation.","comment_id":"913163","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree with B.
