However, in this case it talks about which one to address FIRST.\nIt would be more logical to prioritize the responses that are more effective and have high cost effectiveness ratios, especially if both have high risk levels. It's important to consider both the potential impact of the risk and the cost-effectiveness of the proposed response when classifying and prioritizing risk responses.\n\nBy prioritizing the most effective responses with high cost effectiveness ratios, the organization can maximize the use of its resources and reduce the potential impact of the risk.","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1708862940.0"},{"timestamp":"1708439700.0","poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"815374","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe areas to address FIRST when classifying and prioritizing risk responses are those with high risk levels and low cost effectiveness ratios.\n\nRisk responses can be classified and prioritized based on the potential impact of the risk and the cost-effectiveness of the proposed response. High-risk levels imply a greater likelihood of the risk occurring and a higher potential impact if it does occur. Low cost-effectiveness ratios indicate that the proposed response would be less efficient or less effective in mitigating the risk compared to other potential responses.\n\nAddressing high-risk areas first is important because these risks have the potential to cause significant damage to the organization. In addition, addressing low-cost effectiveness areas first can help to ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and that the most effective responses are implemented.\n\nTherefore, when classifying and prioritizing risk responses, the areas to address FIRST are those with high risk levels and low cost effectiveness ratios.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Chachacha12","comment_id":"1059344","content":"This is the correct interpretation.

Risk assessment results provide a detailed understanding of the potential risks to a system and can help prioritize risk mitigation efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, mapping resources to business processes involves identifying the assets and resources used by a system and the business processes that rely on them. This mapping can help identify critical resources and processes, which can inform risk assessment and risk mitigation efforts.
