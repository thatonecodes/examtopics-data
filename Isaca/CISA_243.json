Carbon dioxide (CO2): A CO2 suppression system is a good choice for a computer room because it is a clean agent that does not leave residue or cause damage to equipment.

Vulnerabilities have not been properly addressed.\n\nWithout investigating the root causes of security incidents, organizations cannot identify and rectify the underlying vulnerabilities that led to these incidents in the first place. This can result in a continuous cycle of incidents and potential security breaches, leaving the organization exposed to ongoing risks. Addressing vulnerabilities is a fundamental aspect of maintaining effective cybersecurity, and it should be a top priority for any organization.\n\nWhile the other options (A, B, and D) may also be concerns, they are not as directly related to the failure to investigate root causes of security incidents.","poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1712160180.0","comment_id":"1024052","comments":[{"poster":"ChaBum","content":"so according to you all incidents comes from Vulnerabilities?","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1172052","timestamp":"1726167000.0"}]},{"comment_id":"889942","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1699186200.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"BabaP"},{"poster":"tkm901","timestamp":"1689933900.0","comment_id":"783235","content":"i think that answer is B","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/96286-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-733-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":1212,"answers_community":["C (67%)","B (33%)"],"exam_id":156,"question_text":"An IS auditor reviewing security incident processes realizes incidents are resolved and closed, but root causes are not investigated.

Acceptance test criteria have been developed.\n\nDuring the detailed design phase, it is crucial to ensure that clear and comprehensive acceptance test criteria have been developed. Acceptance testing is a critical phase in system development where the system is evaluated to ensure it meets the specified requirements. This phase helps in validating that the system functions as intended and is ready for deployment. Ensuring the existence and adequacy of acceptance test criteria helps mitigate risks associated with system functionality and performance.
