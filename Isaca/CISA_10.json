By comparing security logs with HR records, organizations can ensure that individuals entering or leaving the premises align with the expected personnel movements. This helps in detecting instances of tailgating, where unauthorized individuals follow authorized personnel through access points.\nWhile data analytics tools and continuous auditing can play a role in analyzing large datasets and monitoring ongoing activities, reconciling with HR records provides a direct link between personnel data and physical security logs, making it a more targeted and effective approach for identifying tailgating incidents.","comments":[{"content":"Incorrect.
