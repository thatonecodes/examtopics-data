Insurance is one form of risk transfer.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: The act of spending money to reduce a risk probability and impact is known as mitigation.\nC: When extra activities are introduced into the project to avoid the risk, this is an example of avoidance.\nD: Exploit is a strategy that may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized.","unix_timestamp":1588898340,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":726,"answer":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1337660","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B (Mitigation), even if you outsource the work the ACCOUNTABILITY is still you.

In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies.\nAs IDS detects and gives warning when the violation of security policies of the enterprise occurs, it is a detective control.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: These controls make effort to reduce the impact of a threat from problems discovered by detective controls.
