Obtain independent control reports from high-risk vendors.\n\nWhen evaluating the control environment of third-party vendors, independent control reports (such as SOC 2 Type II or ISO 27001 certifications) provide the most comprehensive and reliable insight. These reports are conducted by third-party auditors and assess the effectiveness of a vendor's internal controls over a specific period.

Develop a business impact analysis (BIA).\n\nTo forecast the effects of a disaster, an organization should start by developing a business impact analysis (BIA). The BIA is a comprehensive assessment that identifies critical business processes, their dependencies, and the potential impact of disruptions. It helps in quantifying the financial and operational consequences of a disaster, including downtime costs, lost revenue, regulatory penalties, and damage to the organization's reputation.\n\nOnce the BIA is complete, the organization can use the information to set recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each critical process, prioritize recovery efforts, and develop a disaster recovery plan (DRP) that outlines the necessary actions and resources needed to recover from various disaster scenarios. Additionally, conducting regular disaster recovery simulations (option D) is a vital part of testing and validating the DRP to ensure its effectiveness in real-world situations."},{"timestamp":"1712821860.0","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree with C.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"867074"},{"timestamp":"1709050980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree.","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"823943"},{"content":"C seems more correct:\n\nAt first glance, a business impact analysis and risk assessment may seem to perform a similar purpose, but each one addresses a different critical aspect of DR planning. \nRisk assessments analyze potential threats and their likelihood of happening, a business impact analysis BIA explains the [ effects of particular disasters and their severity.]","poster":"Ceecil1959","comment_id":"575315","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1679791980.0"},{"poster":"Raj1510","timestamp":"1674440580.0","comment_id":"530214","upvote_count":"1","content":"agree with C"},{"timestamp":"1672747740.0","poster":"MusMus","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDefinitely BIA, simulating a disaster \"Recovery\" would help test recovery operations not forecast the effects.","comment_id":"515672"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"372191","content":"BIA looks correct.
