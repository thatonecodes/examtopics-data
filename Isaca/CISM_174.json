Escalate to senior management.\n\nEscalating the issue to senior management allows for a higher-level decision-making process. Senior management can evaluate the situation, consider the potential risks, and make an informed decision regarding whether to adjust the business objective, allocate additional resources, seek exceptions or waivers from the security standard, or take other appropriate actions.

Threat intelligence\nFor protecting an enterprise from advanced persistent threats (APTs), threat intelligence is the most helpful option.
