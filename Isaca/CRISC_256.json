To raise awareness of operational issues\n\nKey Control Indicators (KCIs) are metrics used specifically to measure the effectiveness of controls in place. They help in understanding how well a control is operating. By continuously monitoring KCIs, organizations can raise awareness of operational issues. When a KCI falls outside of an acceptable range, it signifies a potential problem with the control's effectiveness.\n\nB. While KCIs can potentially help identify control vulnerabilities, their primary purpose is not to identify vulnerabilities but to measure the effectiveness of controls.\n\nC. The measure of business exposure to risk is typically captured through Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), not KCIs.\n\nD. The monitoring of the achievement of set objectives is typically associated with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), not KCIs.","poster":"01010100","comment_id":"1039606"},{"poster":"Staanlee","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. To monitor the achievement of set objectives\n\nThe PRIMARY reason to use key control indicators (KCIs) to evaluate control operating effectiveness is to monitor the achievement of set objectives. KCIs are specific metrics or measurements that provide insights into the performance of control activities within an organization. These indicators are typically aligned with the organization's objectives, and their purpose is to track and assess whether controls are operating effectively in support of those objectives.\n\nBy monitoring KCIs, organizations can gauge how well their controls are functioning and whether they are effectively mitigating risks and achieving their intended objectives. KCIs provide valuable data that can help organizations make informed decisions about control improvements, identify areas where controls may be weak or ineffective, and take corrective actions as needed to maintain or enhance control effectiveness.","timestamp":"1726531860.0","comment_id":"1009428"},{"comment_id":"871903","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree with D.","timestamp":"1713283260.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree.","poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"819546","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1708712880.0"}],"question_id":1278,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"To measure business exposure to risk","B":"To identify control vulnerabilities","A":"To raise awareness of operational issues","D":"To monitor the achievement of set objectives"},"exam_id":160,"answers_community":["D (80%)","A (20%)"],"timestamp":"2023-02-23 19:28:00","topic":"1"},{"id":"Cd0zKHM92rS6C5tcgnL9","question_text":"Which of the following BEST indicates whether security awareness training is effective?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1726531980.0","poster":"Staanlee","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. User behavior after training\n\nThe effectiveness of security awareness training is best indicated by user behavior after training. While course evaluations, user self-assessments, and the quality of training materials are important aspects of a training program, the ultimate goal of security awareness training is to influence and improve user behavior with regard to security practices.\n\nUser behavior can be assessed by monitoring whether employees are implementing the security practices and guidelines taught during training. This includes observing whether employees are following security policies, adhering to best practices, reporting security incidents, and taking appropriate security precautions in their day-to-day work.","comment_id":"1009430","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","poster":"CbtL","timestamp":"1713283320.0","comment_id":"871904","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":160,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/106408-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-859-discussion/","topic":"1","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1681660920,"timestamp":"2023-04-16 18:02:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"User self-assessment","B":"User behavior after training","A":"Course evaluation","D":"Quality of training materials"},"answer":"B","answer_description":"","question_id":1279},{"id":"hMMfeal1UakPFesV9by6","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/106409-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-860-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree it is B.","timestamp":"1729094640.0","poster":"CbtL","comment_id":"871905","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1681661040,"answer_images":[],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"make a note for this item in the next audit explaining the situation.","C":"insist that the remediation occur for the benefit of other customers.","B":"ask the client to document the formal risk acceptance for the provider.","A":"develop a risk remediation plan overriding the client's decision."},"answer_description":"","question_text":"A service provider is managing a client's servers.
