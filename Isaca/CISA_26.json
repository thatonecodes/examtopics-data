This is the most secure method for erasing sensitive information from storage media that will be reused.\nRe-partitioning and reformatting only change the file system structure and do not erase data.\nMultiple overwriting can be effective but is less secure than crypto-shredding as it's more susceptible to data recovery techniques.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"KAP2HURUF","comment_id":"1256259","timestamp":"1722078660.0"},{"timestamp":"1720535280.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the correct answer","comment_id":"1244957","poster":"abd9663","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nCrypto-shredding, also known as cryptographic erasure, involves encrypting the entire storage media and then securely deleting or discarding the encryption key. This process makes the data effectively irretrievable, even if remnants of the encrypted data are left on the storage media. Crypto-shredding is considered a secure and efficient method for protecting sensitive information during the decommissioning or reuse of storage media.","timestamp":"1699961280.0","poster":"FAGFUR","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1070296"},{"timestamp":"1684045320.0","comment_id":"897309","poster":"3008","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nd is answer because it will be recycle disk"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\noption D - Multiple overwriting.\n\nMultiple overwriting involves writing random data to the storage media multiple times, effectively destroying any previously stored data. This method is highly effective in ensuring that sensitive information cannot be recovered from the storage media.\n\nRe-partitioning (option A) and reformatting (option C) involve deleting the file system information and/or the partition table, but may leave some data fragments intact and could potentially be recovered using advanced recovery techniques.\n\nCrypto-shredding (option B) involves encrypting the storage media and then deleting the encryption key, making the data unreadable. While this method can be effective, it requires the use of strong encryption and proper key management to ensure that the data cannot be recovered.","comment_id":"893760","poster":"Aly","timestamp":"1683708300.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"BabaP","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D, Crypto-shredding works only on encrypted storage","timestamp":"1683672720.0","comment_id":"893478"}],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":126,"timestamp":"2023-05-10 00:52:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following is the BEST method to delete sensitive information from storage media that will be reused?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/108832-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1110-discussion/","answers_community":["D (67%)","B (33%)"]},{"id":"TuXSeofAyZAcJ9rOZBGF","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"An IS auditor is reviewing how password resets are performed for users working remotely.
