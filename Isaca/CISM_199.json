For example, discontinuing a critical business activity may not be an option for many organizations.\n\nImproving security controls (A), on the other hand, is a more flexible and common approach to risk mitigation. By enhancing the security measures in place, organizations can reduce the likelihood or impact of a potential security incident. This approach allows organizations to continue their operations while reducing the risk of a security breach or loss of sensitive information.","comment_id":"798148","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1707062940.0","poster":"Broesweelies"},{"poster":"richck102","content":"A.

Containment.\n\nDuring the incident response process, containment is the phase where the information security manager takes steps to prevent the malware from spreading further within the system or network. This involves isolating the affected systems, disconnecting them from the network, and implementing safeguards to prevent the malware from spreading to other systems or users.

This is done by isolating the affected systems and preventing them from communicating with other systems. Once the malware has been contained, the incident response team can move on to the eradication phase, which is focused on removing the malware from the affected systems.\n\nTherefore, the information security manager should be confident that the malware has not continued to spread at the completion of the containment phase. This is because the containment phase is focused on stopping the spread of malware, which is the first step in recovering from an incident.","timestamp":"1707131940.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1704869460.0","poster":"richck102","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
