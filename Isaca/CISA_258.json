Lack of user accountability\n\nWhen users do not formally acknowledge the acceptable use policy, it becomes difficult to hold them accountable for their actions. This means that users may not be fully aware of the rules and guidelines outlined in the policy, and they may not feel responsible for adhering to it. This lack of accountability can lead to a wide range of security and compliance issues, including data breaches, misuse of resources, and violations of the policy itself. It also makes it challenging to enforce consequences for policy violations.
