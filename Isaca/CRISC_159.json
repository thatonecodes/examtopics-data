Authentication\n\nAuthentication controls are responsible for verifying the identity of users or entities attempting to access a system or network. Unusual activity might indicate that an unauthorized user has somehow gained access to the system, possibly by compromising or bypassing the authentication mechanisms. This could include techniques such as password cracking, brute force attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process. Once authentication is compromised, an attacker may gain unauthorized access to the system and potentially compromise other controls, including data integrity, data validation, and identification.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"SuperMax","comment_id":"1043201"},{"timestamp":"1707962760.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Identification\n\nIn the context of information security, \"identification\" refers to the process of recognizing and verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity that is trying to access a system or network. It is the first step in the authentication process, which is used to ensure that only authorized individuals or entities are granted access.\n\nIf the system administrator identifies unusual activity indicating an intruder within a firewall, it suggests that the identification control has likely been compromised. This could mean that the intruder has gained access to the system using unauthorized credentials or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the identification process.\n\nAuthentication (A) is closely related to identification and involves verifying the identity of the user after they've provided their credentials. Data validation (C) and data integrity (D) are measures related to ensuring the accuracy and security of data but are not directly related to the situation described in the question.","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"981172"}],"exam_id":160,"choices":{"B":"Identification","D":"Data integrity","A":"Authentication","C":"Data validation"},"question_text":"During a routine check, a system administrator identifies unusual activity indicating an intruder within a firewall.

Alignment to management reports\n\nAlignment to management reports is crucial because KPIs are designed to provide relevant and actionable information to management and stakeholders. KPIs should reflect the organization's strategic goals and objectives and provide a clear, measurable way to assess progress and performance against those goals. If KPIs are not aligned with management reports, they may not accurately represent the organization's priorities and objectives, making them less effective in guiding decision-making and performance improvement.

The primary benefit of KRIs is their ability to facilitate ongoing monitoring and proactive management of potential risks.

By monitoring KRIs, organizations can detect and respond to emerging risks before they escalate into more significant issues, helping to mitigate potential negative impacts on the business.
