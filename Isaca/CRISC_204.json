Continuous monitoring.\n\nThe most effective way for a business operations manager to identify events exceeding risk thresholds is \"D. Continuous monitoring.\" Continuous monitoring involves real-time or near-real-time monitoring of systems, processes, and activities to detect and respond to events that may exceed predefined risk thresholds. This proactive approach allows for timely identification and intervention to prevent or mitigate adverse events.\n\nWhile the other options (control self-assessment, benchmarking against peers, transaction logging) can provide valuable insights and contribute to risk management efforts, continuous monitoring provides the most timely and dynamic method for identifying events that may impact risk thresholds."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree with D.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712057580.0","comment_id":"858792","poster":"CbtL"}],"question_id":1016,"timestamp":"2023-04-02 13:33:00","question_text":"Which of the following would MOST effectively enable a business operations manager to identify events exceeding risk thresholds?","answer":"D","choices":{"B":"Benchmarking against peers","D":"Continuous monitoring","A":"A control self-assessment","C":"Transaction logging"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/104846-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-606-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"FfqYsm8bJbtslO7KmHSe","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following would provide executive management with the BEST information to make risk decisions as a result of a risk assessment?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"faed87a","comment_id":"1399427","timestamp":"1742161860.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C.\n\nfor A indeed numerical data offers precision, it may lack context regarding how risks compare to organizational goals or thresholds"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"dagwo","timestamp":"1719779040.0","content":"A is correct","comment_id":"1239825"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. A quantitative presentation of risk assessment results.\n\nThe best information to provide executive management for making risk decisions as a result of a risk assessment is \"A. A quantitative presentation of risk assessment results.\" Quantitative information includes numerical data that quantifies the potential impact and likelihood of risks. This type of presentation allows executives to understand the magnitude of risks in concrete terms, making it easier to prioritize and allocate resources effectively.\n\nWhile qualitative presentations (option B) can provide valuable insights, quantitative data provides a more precise and objective basis for decision-making. Comparing risk assessment results to the desired state (option C) and assessing organizational maturity levels (option D) are also important aspects of risk management, but a quantitative presentation of risk assessment results directly addresses the executives' need for actionable information related to risks.","timestamp":"1693182240.0","comment_id":"991711","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Staanlee"},{"poster":"Koulyo","timestamp":"1680637920.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nGoing with C.

This information can be presented using a variety of tools, such as risk matrices, heat maps, or probability curves, which can provide executives with a clear and concise overview of the risks facing the organization and their potential impact.\n\nIn contrast, a qualitative presentation of risk assessment results typically relies on descriptive language or subjective assessments of risk likelihood and impact. While qualitative assessments may be useful in identifying and categorizing risks, they may not provide the same level of detailed information on the specific risks facing the organization or the potential impact of those risks.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"818109","poster":"john_boogieman","timestamp":"1677087180.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1676349060.0","content":"should be B","poster":"Julianleehk","comment_id":"808075"},{"content":"C, the desired state is the risk is within apatite.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1672639560.0","comment_id":"763530","poster":"Suchib"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC - right answer.","comment_id":"665381","timestamp":"1662811560.0","poster":"huze","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1649115900.0","comment_id":"580956","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ceecil1959","content":"A is correct.

If the percentage of IT assets with current malware definitions is high, it indicates that the antivirus program is doing a good job of keeping the system protected from known threats.\n\nThe number of false positives detected over a period of time is not a good KPI for measuring the effectiveness of an antivirus program because false positives do not necessarily indicate that the antivirus program is ineffective.
