Risk appetite**\n\nRisk appetite is the most relevant factor in determining whether an organization is risk-taker or risk-averse. It defines the level and type of risk that the organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. Risk appetite is a strategic decision made by the organization's leadership and reflects the organization's attitude towards risk-taking and risk management. While risk management methodology (A), risk culture (B), and risk heat map (C) provide valuable insights into how risks are identified, managed, and visualized, risk appetite directly addresses the organization's willingness to take on risk.","comment_id":"1387897","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"timestamp":"1723553640.0","poster":"sai_murthy","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1149252","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCCAK P# 119 The risk appetite of an organization determines its risk management style. An organization that is a risk taker may be willing to accept more risk in the face of a higher return. In contrast, a risk-averse organization minimizes its risk exposure to lower the probability of suffering a negative event, but at the cost of losing possible opportunities."},{"poster":"a5g","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1697356500.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nrisk appetite","comment_id":"870745"},{"comment_id":"859606","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1696315860.0","content":"risk appetite","poster":"a5g"}],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Which of the following is MOST relevant to determine whether an organization is a risk taker or is risk-averse?","topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"92aiSlQCdLcRpVJXFm8O","question_text":"An audit that can be achieved using real-time automated scripts or manual testing and that organizations continuously perform as part of operations to help them implement continuous assurance and compliance its:","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-02-13 15:59:00","question_images":[],"exam_id":153,"choices":{"A":"a governance and strategy audit.","C":"access review.","D":"configuration and activity monitoring.","B":"a compliance and controls audit."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133744-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-139-discussion/","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1707836340,"discussion":[{"poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: D\n**D. Configuration and activity monitoring**\n\nConfiguration and activity monitoring involves the ongoing review of system configurations and user activities to ensure compliance with policies and standards. This type of audit can be automated using scripts that continuously check configurations against predefined baselines and alert administrators to any deviations or unauthorized activities. By integrating these monitoring processes into daily operations, organizations can maintain continuous assurance and compliance, making configuration and activity monitoring a crucial component of a real-time audit strategy.","timestamp":"1741786560.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1387898"},{"content":"Agree.

A security categorization of the information systems**\n\nThe first step in implementing the NIST SP 800-53 control framework is to perform a security categorization of the information systems. This process involves determining the sensitivity and criticality of the information systems based on the potential impact of a security breach. Security categorization helps in identifying the appropriate set of controls needed to protect the systems according to their risk profile. This step is critical as it guides the subsequent selection and tailoring of controls to ensure they are aligned with the organization's security needs and priorities."},{"poster":"339dfab","content":"Page 8 of Withdrawn publication NIST Special Publication 800-53 Rev. 4\n\"...organizations first determine the security category of their information system in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems\"\nPublication can be found at:\nhttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729088040.0","comment_id":"1298773"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","exam_id":153,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/149619-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-141-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1729088040,"answer":"B"},{"id":"I5A68XPYegOu9TBySj67","timestamp":"2023-04-12 11:50:00","exam_id":153,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**D. The as-is and to-be enterprise architecture (EA)**\n\nConducting a gap analysis involves comparing the current state (as-is) with the desired future state (to-be) to identify the differences or gaps that need to be addressed. In the context of enterprise architecture, this means examining the existing architecture to determine what changes are necessary to achieve the target architecture. By understanding both the current and desired states, auditors can identify gaps in processes, controls, or technology that need to be filled to meet organizational goals and compliance requirements.","timestamp":"1741788060.0","comment_id":"1387909"},{"poster":"sai_murthy","comment_id":"1149545","timestamp":"1723572960.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCCAK P# 255 Standards that define an auditing methodology—These define how an auditor should conduct an audit and state the rules and requirements that auditors must follow.
