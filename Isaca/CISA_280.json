The array cannot recover from a natural disaster.\n\nWhile RAID provides redundancy and can protect against disk failures, it does not provide protection against natural disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, or other catastrophic events that could potentially destroy the entire data center or physical location where the RAID array is located. Offsite backups are essential to ensure data recovery in the event of a natural disaster or any situation where the physical infrastructure is compromised.
