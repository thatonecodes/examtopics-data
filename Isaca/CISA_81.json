It can be used to determine whether IT service delivery is based on consistently effective processes. Option B may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of IT service delivery, but it does not address the issue of consistently effective processes. Option C involves comparing the current state of an organization's processes to a desired state, but it does not address the issue of consistently effective processes.

Attackers are limited in the number of attempts they can make before the account is locked, which makes brute force attacks impractical.

Longer passwords exponentially increase the time it would take for an attacker to successfully guess the correct combination, thus reducing the probability of a successful brute force attack. While an account lockout policy can deter attackers by limiting the number of login attempts, a strong password policy acts as a barrier against brute force attacks from the outset.","poster":"Swallows","comment_id":"1220879","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1712415000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nEstablishing an account lockout policy (A) is the most effective method for reducing the probability of a brute force attack being successful. A brute force attack involves trying many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing the correct one. An account lockout policy will lock the account after a certain number of failed login attempts, thereby preventing the attacker from continuing to try different password combinations. This policy directly interrupts the brute force attack process by not allowing the attacker unlimited attempts within a short period of time.","comment_id":"1190441","poster":"mdh717","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","content":"D ir right.
