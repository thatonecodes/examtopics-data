Real-time network traffic monitoring.\n\nReal-time network traffic monitoring allows for the continuous observation and analysis of network traffic. This helps in quickly identifying any unusual or unauthorized devices (such as rogue IoT devices) connecting to the network. It can detect abnormal traffic patterns, unauthorized data transmissions, or other indicators of rogue devices. By identifying these anomalies, organizations can promptly respond to potential security threats posed by these devices. While an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), using a connection-oriented protocol, and documenting network architecture are important for overall network security, real-time monitoring specifically addresses the challenge of detecting and managing rogue devices in the network.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717387320.0"},{"comment_id":"1020352","content":"Correction IPS for external traffic (DDoS attacks) so B is still the correct answer","timestamp":"1711684860.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"krishccie"},{"timestamp":"1711684800.0","comment_id":"1020351","poster":"krishccie","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the right answer.

The organization’s control owner.\n\nEven when an organization outsources certain functions or processes, it retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring that all controls, including data retention controls, are effectively managed. The control owner within the organization is responsible for overseeing these controls and ensuring they meet the organization's standards and requirements, regardless of whether the function is performed in-house or by a third-party provider. While the third-party provider (and their control owner) is responsible for executing the controls as per the agreed terms, the organization's control owner must ensure that these controls are adequate and effective. The internal audit team typically plays a role in verifying and assessing the effectiveness of these controls, but the primary responsibility remains with the organization's control owner.","comment_id":"1086645","poster":"Kennethlim79","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1717387500.0"},{"comment_id":"1060213","timestamp":"1714612800.0","poster":"Chachacha12","content":"Selected Answer: C\nKeyword: Responsible - so it should be the control owner, in this case, the service provider.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1020344","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\norg responsible for their data","poster":"krishccie","timestamp":"1711683720.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":160,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-29 03:42:00","answer_description":"","question_text":"An organization is outsourcing data processing to a third-party data center facility to reduce costs.

Risk communication is mostly concerned with the nature of risk or expressing concerns, views, or reactions to risk managers or institutional bodies for risk management. The key plan to consider and communicate risk is to categorize and impose priorities, and acquire suitable measures to reduce risks. It is important throughout any crisis to put across multifaceted information in a simple and clear manner.\nRisk communication helps in switching or allocating the information concerning risk among the decision-maker and the stakeholders.\nRisk communication can be explained more clearly with the help of the following definitions:\n✑ It defines the issue of what a group does, not just what it says.\n✑ It must take into account the valuable element in user's perceptions of risk.\n✑ It will be more valuable if it is thought of as conversation, not instruction.\nRisk communication is a fundamental and continuing element of the risk analysis exercise, and the involvement of the stakeholder group is from the beginning. It makes the stakeholders conscious of the process at each phase of the risk assessment.

It ensures that senior management is aware of the risk landscape and understands the consequences of various risk treatment options.
