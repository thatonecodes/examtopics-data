Local regulations may contradict the policy.\n\nWhile all of the options listed can be concerns in such a scenario, ensuring compliance with local regulations is often the top priority. Global data privacy policies need to align with local laws and regulations, and this can be challenging as data privacy laws vary significantly from one country to another. Failure to comply with local regulations can result in legal consequences, fines, and damage to the organization's reputation. Therefore, an IS auditor should pay the greatest attention to the potential conflicts between the global policy and local regulations to minimize legal and compliance risks.","poster":"SuperMax","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1019408","timestamp":"1711606860.0"},{"comment_id":"806813","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Local regulations may contradict the policy.\n\nAn IS auditor's greatest concern when an international organization intends to roll out a global data privacy policy should be local regulations that may contradict the policy. Data privacy laws vary from country to country and it is crucial for organizations to ensure that their data privacy policy complies with the relevant local regulations. If a global data privacy policy conflicts with local regulations, it may lead to legal and regulatory issues, and potentially cause harm to the organization's reputation. The IS auditor should be vigilant in checking that the policy is aligned with local regulations and provide recommendations to the organization on any necessary changes.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1691866620.0","poster":"TEC1"},{"timestamp":"1690415820.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"m4s7er","content":"Selected Answer: C\nanswer is C","comment_id":"789266"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1687068900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the ans","poster":"ziutek_","comment_id":"748692"},{"poster":"gomboragchaa","timestamp":"1686817020.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think C","comment_id":"745923"},{"poster":"Deeplaxmi","content":"i also think C","comment_id":"677597","timestamp":"1679638200.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"MunaM","timestamp":"1678235280.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"662949","content":"Could the answer be C?"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"P2VKMTwINgVlumo6JpjE","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"There are no backups of the videos.","B":"Cameras are not monitored 24/7.","D":"The retention period for video recordings is undefined.","A":"There are no notices indicating recording is in progress."},"answer":"A","exam_id":156,"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"An IS auditor is conducting a physical security audit of a healthcare facility and finds closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems located in a patient care area.

These tests simulate real-world security threats and assess whether employees are able to identify and respond to them appropriately, making it a robust indicator of the program's impact on reducing security risks. Employee satisfaction (Option A) and the number of employees completing training (Option D) can be useful metrics, but they may not necessarily correlate with improved security outcomes.
