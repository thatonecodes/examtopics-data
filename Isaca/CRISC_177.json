This process will help identify the underlying issues causing the outages and provide insight into what controls or changes need to be implemented to prevent future outages. The other options, such as updating the risk tolerance level, recommending additional controls, or updating the risk register, are potentially valid steps, but they should be performed after the root cause analysis has provided more information about the situation."},{"comments":[{"content":"Yes FIRST thing is Root Cause this will allow you to better understand the cause of the issue and allow for better selection of Controls","poster":"MartyMar","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711027020.0","comment_id":"845984"}],"comment_id":"816962","poster":"john_boogieman","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect.","timestamp":"1708538460.0"},{"poster":"Puma_","comment_id":"665520","timestamp":"1694361840.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Answer: A.
