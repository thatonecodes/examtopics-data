The cloud service provider may have extra copies for availability purposes.\n\nIn cloud environments, providers often maintain multiple copies of data across different locations to ensure high availability and redundancy. These additional copies are intended to protect against data loss due to hardware failures or other issues. When a deletion command is issued by a cloud customer, it may not result in full destruction of all copies of the data, as the command might only affect the primary instance of the data. The extra copies maintained by the cloud provider for availability purposes might still exist until they are explicitly addressed or until the provider's retention policies are applied to remove them.","timestamp":"1741810740.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020"},{"poster":"339dfab","comment_id":"1299034","content":"A. \nWhen a cloud customer makes a request to delete a cloud resource or data, it might not result in true and complete wiping of the data, because CSPs may have extra copies of data/resources for availability and reliability purposes.","timestamp":"1729129380.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":72,"question_text":"Which of the following is the MOST likely reason for a deletion command not resulting in full destruction of data in the cloud?","choices":{"C":"Cloud encryption may not allow the data to be deleted completely.","D":"The cloud customer may not know the proper way to delete the data.","B":"The cloud customer may not have the required rights to delete the data.","A":"The cloud service provider may have extra copies for availability purposes."},"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133894-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-167-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1707945000},{"id":"yxdrLWuvtpvCn37MhAcK","question_id":73,"exam_id":153,"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-02-14 22:12:00","question_text":"Which of the following cloud service provider activities MUST obtain a clientâ€™s approval?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133895-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-168-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","choices":{"B":"Deleting subscription owner accounts","C":"Deleting guest accounts","D":"Destroying test data","A":"Deleting test accounts"},"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1707945120,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1723662720.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"sai_murthy","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCCAK P# 73 Master accounts and subscription owner accounts are special and may require out-of-band interaction with the provider to delete those accounts or destroy fundamental data.","comment_id":"1150525"}]},{"id":"uifvaZMwfccxBZJeyflW","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/133897-exam-ccak-topic-1-question-169-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"If a cloud agreement allows the cloud service provider to decommission any service within a set period, who is responsible for managing the risk introduced by this change?","question_id":74,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Auditor2020","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Cloud customer\n\nIn scenarios where a cloud agreement permits the cloud service provider to decommission services, the primary responsibility for managing the risk introduced by this change falls to the cloud customer. While the cloud service provider may communicate decommissioning plans and timelines, it is ultimately the customer's responsibility to assess the impact of such changes on their operations, data, and compliance obligations. The cloud customer must prepare contingency plans, such as migrating to alternative services or providers, to mitigate any potential disruptions. However, effective risk management may involve collaboration with the cloud service provider to ensure smooth transitions and minimal impact on business processes.","comment_id":"1388072","timestamp":"1741810860.0"},{"poster":"4f2a581","timestamp":"1721975580.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1255510","content":"A: CSP and CSC Risk Manager"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nCCAK P# 42 if a CSP decommissions a particular service offering, it is important to understand who is responsible for managing the lifecycle of data migration and conversion to the new service.
