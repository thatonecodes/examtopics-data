This ensures that only authorized users can access and modify application data. Users are granted access to specific data based on their job function, and they can only perform actions that are necessary to perform their job.\n\nIn contrast, multi-factor authentication is a security mechanism that requires users to provide two or more forms of identification, such as a password and a one-time code, to access systems or applications. While multi-factor authentication is an effective security control, it is primarily designed to prevent unauthorized access to systems and applications, rather than controlling what users can do within those systems and applications.","comments":[{"content":"its an outsider, not an insider. if insider the RBAC will be the right answer.","timestamp":"1732095540.0","comment_id":"902415","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Yahealborini"}],"poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"820289"}],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"exam_id":160},{"id":"hwXfBn1J7cTOXNUDVRZ8","choices":{"A":"The chief information security officer (CISO) has not approved the plan.","C":"Some critical business applications are not included in the plan.","D":"The plan is not based on an internationally recognized framework.","B":"Several recovery activities will be outsourced."},"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":1417,"timestamp":"2023-04-22 22:00:00","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/107042-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-994-discussion/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"877602","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C.","timestamp":"1729627200.0","poster":"CbtL"}],"exam_id":160,"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1682193600,"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"Which of the following issues found during the review of a newly created disaster recovery plan (DRP) should be of MOST concern?"},{"id":"sK9Jnek1wpEN6jKTs9Px","answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1717318620,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"Radko96","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733137020.0","comment_id":"1223079","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect..
