Review the provider’s incident definitions and notification criteria.\nReviewing the provider's incident definitions and notification criteria should be the information security manager's first course of action when aligning their incident response capability with a public cloud service provider. This is because it is important to understand the provider's definition of what constitutes an incident and their criteria for triggering notifications. This information is critical in order to determine the provider's incident response capability and to ensure that the organization's incident response plan aligns with the provider's processes. Without this understanding, the organization may not be notified of incidents in a timely manner or may not be able to effectively respond to incidents that occur. By reviewing the provider's incident definitions and notification criteria first, the information security manager can ensure that the organization's incident response capability is aligned with the provider's processes and can effectively respond to security incidents as they occur.","poster":"Broesweelies"},{"poster":"ServerBrain","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

The effectiveness of an incident response team will be GREATEST when the incident response process is updated based on lessons learned. This means that the team should continuously review and update the incident response plan based on the outcomes of previous incidents and exercises, as well as new threats and vulnerabilities. This will help to ensure that the incident response process is as effective as possible, and that the team is prepared to respond to a wide range of incidents.

Collect additional metrics - collecting more information does nothing for helping in the decision-making process. In fact it makes it worse because that is just more data to review. While a cost-benefit analysis already has that result for you.\n\nC. Begin due diligence on the outsourcing company is incorrect cause it may be too early in the process to do this. Due diligence requires people and time. While a cost-benefit analysis is faster and cheaper way to get the results while due diligence can validate that after the fact. (i.e. from cheap to expensive validation if the effort is warranted.)\n\nD. Submit funding requests to senior management is incorrect cause this is premature without due diligence or cost benefit analysis.","timestamp":"1713212580.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-15 22:23:00","question_id":850,"question_text":"Which of the following should be the FIRST step to gain approval for outsourcing to address a security gap?","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1681590180,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Isaca","isImplemented":true,"name":"CISM","numberOfQuestions":1247,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":157},"currentPage":170},"__N_SSP":true}
