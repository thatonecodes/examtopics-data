A risk register will have the risk owner, and they are accountable. RACIs are specifically there to spell out who is accountable. So most likely the answer is B.","poster":"CbtL"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nChange for 'B', reason:\nAccountability for a particular risk is BEST represented in a RACI matrix. The RACI matrix is a tool used to clarify and communicate the roles and responsibilities of different individuals or groups in relation to specific tasks or decisions. The acronym RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed, and is used to describe the level of involvement or responsibility of each person or group involved in a particular process or activity. By clearly assigning accountability for specific risks in the RACI matrix, everyone involved in the risk management process will know who is responsible for managing each risk and can take appropriate action if necessary. The risk register, on the other hand, is a document that records all identified risks and associated information, such as risk owners, risk impacts, and risk mitigation strategies. While the risk register is a useful tool for tracking and managing risks, it does not specifically assign accountability for each risk.","comments":[{"poster":"CbtL","content":"The risk owner is accountable for the risk, though.","timestamp":"1712690340.0","comment_id":"865761","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1708637280.0","poster":"john_boogieman","comment_id":"818449","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"789153","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA RACI matrix has a more global focus within the risk management process, it is in the risk register where the owner of the risk that has accountability is truly identified.","timestamp":"1706308980.0","poster":"john_boogieman"},{"comment_id":"556639","comments":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1703305620.0","poster":"GRamos","comment_id":"753844","upvote_count":"1","content":"A RACI chart can have multiple name.
