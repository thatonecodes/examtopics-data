Scenarios with threats and impacts\n\nWhen performing qualitative risk analysis, scenarios that consider both threats and impacts are essential to produce comprehensive results. This approach involves identifying potential threats (such as risks or vulnerabilities) and assessing the potential impacts or consequences they may have on the organization. By considering both the threats and the impacts, you can develop a more complete understanding of the risks and their potential consequences, which is crucial for making informed decisions about risk mitigation and management.","poster":"SuperMax","comments":[{"timestamp":"1728652980.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1040684","content":"While the other options (B, C, and D) can be valuable components of risk analysis, they may not be as comprehensive on their own and are often used in conjunction with scenario-based risk analysis. Cost-benefit analysis (B) can help in evaluating the economic aspects of risk mitigation measures. Assessing the value of information assets (C) is important for understanding the significance of the assets at risk.
