By determining remaining vulnerabilities after countermeasures are in place.\n\nResidual risk is the risk that remains after security countermeasures have been implemented. It represents the level of risk that an organization or system still faces even with the security controls and measures in place. To determine the residual risk, you assess the vulnerabilities that are still present or partially mitigated after implementing security measures, and you evaluate the potential impact of these remaining vulnerabilities. This helps in understanding the level of risk that the organization or system still needs to manage and be aware of.","poster":"SuperMax","timestamp":"1712977320.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708743000.0","poster":"eblue","content":"Residual risk refers to the level of risk that remains after risk mitigation measures have been implemented.
