It also documents risks' characteristics. The Identify Risks process is part of the\nProject Risk Management knowledge area. As new risks may evolve or become known as the project progresses through its life cycle, Identify Risks is an iterative process. The process should involve the project team so that they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the risks and associated risk response actions. Risk Register is the only output of this process.","exam_id":160,"timestamp":"2020-03-08 03:31:00","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"poster":"PAVLOF","timestamp":"1719068340.0","comment_id":"388077","upvote_count":"1","content":"Risk register"}],"question_id":781,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"4gtrgAt1upvZOkjHRsKl","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":160,"timestamp":"2021-05-31 03:55:00","unix_timestamp":1622426100,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/53866-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-367-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Publish the risk register in a knowledge management platform with workflow features that periodically contacts and polls risk assessors to ensure accuracy of content","B":"Perform regular audits by audit personnel and maintain risk register","D":"Monitor key risk indicators, and record the findings in the risk register","C":"Submit the risk register to business process owners for review and updating"},"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_description":"A knowledge management platform with workflow and polling feature will automate the process of maintaining the risk registers. Hence this ensures that an accurate and updated risk register is maintained.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: Audit personnel may not have the appropriate business knowledge in risk assessment, hence cannot properly identify risk. Regular audits may also cause hindrance to the business activities.\nC: Business process owners typically cannot effectively identify risk to their business processes. They may not have the ability to be unbiased and may not have the appropriate skills or tools for evaluating risks.\nD: Monitoring key risk indicators, and record the findings in the risk register will only provide insights to known and identified risk and will not account for obscure risk, i.e. , risk that has not been identified yet.","answer":"A","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"content":"This is correct.

Your project utilizes a machine for production of goods. This machine has the specification that if its temperature would rise above 450 degree Fahrenheit then it may result in burning of windings. So, there is an alarm which blows when machine's temperature reaches 430 degree Fahrenheit and the machine is shut off for 1 hour. What role does alarm contribute here?","isMC":true,"answer_description":"Here in this scenario alarm indicates the potential risk that the rising temperature of machine can cause, hence it is enacting as a risk indicator.\nRisk indicators are metrics used to indicate risk thresholds, i.e., it gives indication when a risk level is approaching a high or unacceptable level of risk. The main objective of a risk indicator is to ensure tracking and reporting mechanisms that alert staff about the potential risks.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: The first thing we must do in risk management is to identify the areas of the project where the risks can occur. This is termed as risk identification. Listing all the possible risks is proved to be very productive for the enterprise as we can cure them before it can occur. In risk identification both threats and opportunities are considered, as both carry some level of risk with them.\nC: The temperature 430 degrees in scenario is the risk trigger. A risk trigger is a warning sign or condition that a risk event is about to happen. As in this scenario the 430-degree temperature is the indication of upcoming risks, hence 430 degree temperature is a risk trigger.\nD: Risk response is the action taken to reduce the risk event occurrence.
