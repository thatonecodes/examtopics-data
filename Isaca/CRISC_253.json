Adopt the standard determined by legal counsel.\n\nWhen faced with conflicting data privacy regulations, the best course of action is to seek guidance from legal counsel. Legal counsel can provide advice on how to navigate the legal requirements and ensure compliance with both international and local regulations.\n\nAdopting the standard determined by legal counsel helps mitigate legal risks and ensures that the organization follows the appropriate regulations while disposing of personal data. Legal counsel can assess the legal implications, evaluate the potential consequences of non-compliance, and provide guidance on the most appropriate course of action. This approach prioritizes legal compliance and minimizes legal exposure.","poster":"Staanlee","comment_id":"1009412"},{"comment_id":"871788","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree with B.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713274800.0","poster":"CbtL"},{"content":"B is correct","comment_id":"565595","timestamp":"1678546680.0","poster":"boyladdudeman","upvote_count":"2"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/72663-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-841-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"A":"Adopt the international standard.","C":"Adopt the local standard.","B":"Adopt the standard determined by legal counsel.","D":"Adopt the least stringent standard determined by the risk committee."},"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-03-11 15:58:00","exam_id":160,"topic":"1"},{"id":"BrorwPgVjTmcVtPkDhem","question_images":[],"question_id":1262,"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1665181800,"question_text":"Which of the following should be the MAIN consideration when validating an organization's risk appetite?","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/84663-exam-crisc-topic-1-question-842-discussion/","answer":"C","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729086420.0","comment_id":"871793","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CbtL","content":"Selected Answer: B\nGoing with B.

Changes in senior management.\n\nThe risk profile of an organization represents a summarized view of its risks, taking into account the probability of occurrence, potential impacts, and the effectiveness of controls in place. Changes in the leadership or direction of the organization, such as changes in senior management, can directly influence its risk tolerance, strategic direction, and priorities, which would likely lead to updates in its IT risk profile.\n\nEstablishment of a risk committee (Option B) can provide more structured governance around risk management, but the mere establishment of such a committee doesn't necessarily change the risk profile itself.\n\nExternal audit findings (Option C) can highlight weaknesses or gaps in controls and may lead to changes in risk responses or mitigation strategies, but they might not lead to changes in the overall risk profile unless the findings reveal risks that weren't previously recognized.\n\nFeedback from focus groups (Option D) is typically more about perceptions and preferences of a specific topic and might not have a direct impact on the IT risk profile.","poster":"01010100","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728570960.0"},{"timestamp":"1713275520.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree it is C.","poster":"CbtL","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"871799"}],"answer":"C"},{"id":"gK9sQ29lQppWbQjyOIYt","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A risk practitioner notices a risk scenario associated with data loss at the organization's cloud provider is assigned to the provider.
