Inability to deploy updated security patches.\n\nFrom an IS auditor's perspective, an incomplete inventory of deployed software in an organization poses several risks. However, the greatest risk is the inability to deploy updated security patches. When an organization does not have a complete inventory of its deployed software, it becomes difficult to determine which systems are running specific software applications and therefore, which systems need to be updated with the latest security patches. This can leave the organization vulnerable to security threats and attacks, as attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in the software that have already been patched by the software vendors. To mitigate this risk, IS auditors would recommend that the organization maintain an up-to-date inventory of its deployed software and regularly deploy security patches to all applicable systems.","comment_id":"806717","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1721451000.0","poster":"takuanism","comment_id":"1127094","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt seems D is correct","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1705732800.0","poster":"JONESKA","content":"I am thinking D as well.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"957124"},{"poster":"m4s7er","comment_id":"789261","timestamp":"1690414920.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"i think answer is D"},{"content":"could the answer be D?","comment_id":"662913","timestamp":"1678232520.0","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"content":"yes, I think D is proper answer.","comment_id":"698943","timestamp":"1681901760.0","poster":"zuchwaly","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"748682","timestamp":"1687068240.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Agree here, D","poster":"ziutek_"}]}],"poster":"MunaM"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Inability to deploy updated security patches","C":"Inability to identify unused licenses within the organization","A":"Inability to determine the cost of deployed software","B":"Inability to close unused ports on critical servers"},"exam_id":156,"unix_timestamp":1662586920,"answer":"D","question_id":1253,"timestamp":"2022-09-07 23:42:00"},{"id":"2V8rbQRNt8bPQoCjOKFU","answer_images":[],"question_id":1254,"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"An IS auditor finds that firewalls are outdated and not supported by vendors.
