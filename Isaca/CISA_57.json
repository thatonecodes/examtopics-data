By calculating hash values of files in storage that hold data captured during a forensic investigation and comparing those hash values, it is possible to verify whether the data has been altered.\n\nOn the other hand, maintaining a chain of custody is important to ensure the continuity and reliability of evidence, but it is not a method to directly verify data integrity. A chain of custody is used to properly manage the handling of evidence and prevent tampering or unintentional changes, but it is not a means of verifying changes to the content of specific data.\n\nTherefore, comparing the hashes of data files in storage is the most effective way to verify the integrity of data captured after a security incident.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1717634760.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sibsankar","comment_id":"1225079","content":"Hashing creates a unique digital fingerprint of data, which can be used to verify that the data has not been altered. By comparing the hash values of the data files at different stages (e.g., when they were first captured and later during analysis), investigators can confirm that the data remains unchanged, ensuring its integrity. This method is widely recognized and used in forensic investigations to maintain the authenticity and reliability of digital evidence.\nRight answer is B"}]},{"id":"HmhwjoMS72qGmxB6Sj5M","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-07-15 03:36:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isaca/view/143911-exam-cisa-topic-1-question-1302-discussion/","question_text":"During an audit, an IT finding is agreed upon by all IT teams involved, but no team wants to be responsible for remediation or considers the finding within its area of responsibility.

Enabling detection points.\n\nEnabling detection points is a foundational step in the implementation of a DLP solution.

This step is crucial for defining the scope and coverage of the DLP solution before configuring specific rules, exceptions, or generating reports.\n\nWhile configuring rule sets (Option A), establishing exceptions workflow (Option C), and configuring reports (Option D) are important components of a comprehensive DLP implementation, they typically come after enabling detection points to ensure a systematic and effective deployment of the solution."},{"timestamp":"1725792180.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"PurpleParrot","comment_id":"1280309","content":"Selected Answer: A\nBefore enabling detection points or configuring exceptions and reports, it is crucial to establish the DLP rule sets that will govern the organization's data protection policies.

The rule set defines what data to protect and what action to take. For example, it can include detection and blocking of specific sensitive data, notification, logging, and other countermeasures.\n\nEnabling detection points is also important, but it is an activity that is carried out in a certain implementation phase and should be done after specific rules and policies are configured. Enabling detection points is the phase where you decide how to apply rule sets and policies to the actual network and systems after they are configured.\n\nTherefore, the first activity to be completed is \"A.
