Evidence of population completeness is not maintained.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is C : By randomly selecting a sample of new users based solely on user access to all servers in the environment, the bot may not be capturing all relevant data for the audit. This may result in a biased sample that does not accurately represent the entire population of new users. Without maintaining evidence of population completeness, the auditor cannot be confident that the results of the audit are representative and reliable.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"890401","poster":"007Georgeo","timestamp":"1683336900.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe greatest concern with the described approach is that evidence of population completeness is not maintained.

Control risk.\n\nControl risk refers to the risk that the organization's internal controls will fail to prevent or detect material misstatements or issues, which could impact the organization's ability to achieve its objectives. Communicating control risks to stakeholders is crucial because these risks indicate potential weaknesses in the control environment that could lead to significant operational or financial consequences.
