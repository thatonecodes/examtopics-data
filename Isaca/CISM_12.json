Repeatable metrics provide consistent and reliable data, which is crucial for tracking progress over time and making comparisons. However, repeatability alone is not enough to ensure that the metric is useful and meaningful.

Ideally, information security metrics should align with the security strategy, which in turn should be developed in alignment with both the IT strategy and the overarching business objectives.\n\nGiven the context of the available options and considering the importance of the security focus, the priority shifts to ensuring the metrics are not only aligned but also practical and actionable.
