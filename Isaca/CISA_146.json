Deleting the files logically does not overwrite the files' physical data.\n\nAn IS auditor should be concerned because deleting files from a hard disk logically (e.g., using the delete function) does not necessarily overwrite the files' physical data. Deleted files can potentially be recovered using specialized software or tools unless the data is securely overwritten. This means that sensitive data could still be accessible to unauthorized individuals, posing a significant security risk.\n\nFormatting the hard disk or using secure data erasure methods is a more effective way to ensure that the data is permanently removed and not recoverable. Simply deleting files is not sufficient from a security perspective.","timestamp":"1714299120.0","comment_id":"1056110"},{"comment_id":"1052044","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713887340.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. backup copies of files were not deleted as well.\nAll others talk about the same."},{"timestamp":"1703608680.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"934560","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis is an easy one, D","poster":"oldmagic"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhen data is deleted from a hard disk, it is typically only removed from the file allocation table","timestamp":"1701921240.0","poster":"mibg83","comment_id":"916779","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"007Georgeo","timestamp":"1699197060.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correcte answer is D , When data is deleted from a hard disk, it is typically only removed from the file allocation table, which means that the space previously occupied by the data is marked as available for reuse. However, the physical data on the disk is not necessarily overwritten at this stage, and it may be possible for someone to recover the deleted data using specialized software.
