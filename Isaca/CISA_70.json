While restore tests (option C.) are a general requirement for a backup implementation, this is specifically about disaster case. From my understanding of the ISACA way of thinking, whenever an area is narrowed down in the question, an answer specific to that area is expected. In addition, ISACA also describes the following requirement summarized in the article \"How to Develop and Execute a Rigorous Data Backup and Recovery Strategy\" from 18.04.2022: \nThe most crucial control to ensure an organization can recover its data from backup media in case of a disaster is to follow the 3-2-1 rule. This rule states that organizations should maintain at least 3 copies or versions of data stored on 2 different pieces of media, with 1 copy being offsite.
