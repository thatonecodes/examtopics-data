However:\n -Oracle’s Read Consistency Rule ensures that ALICE's session operates under the \"view\" of the data at the point in time when ALICE started her session (or query).\n -Since the row has been modified after ALICE’s session began, ALICE's DELETE will fail with an ORA-08177: Cannot serialize access for this transaction error, because the row has been changed by another committed transaction."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.
