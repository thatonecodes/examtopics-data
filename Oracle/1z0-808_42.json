This means that if you have a method that is overridden in a subclass, the version of the method that gets called will depend on the type of the object at runtime. This can lead to more flexible and powerful code that can adapt to different situations.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"dsms","comments":[{"content":"made a misprint.

This means that if you have a method that works with an object of a particular class, you can also use that method with objects of other classes that inherit from that class or implement the same interface. This can save a lot of time and effort because you don't have to write a separate method for each class."},{"poster":"winfred_lu","timestamp":"1688695980.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC: Method overriding is runtime polymorphism.
