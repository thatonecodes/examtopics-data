Two of the subnets contain application servers and the third subnet contains a DB\nSystem. The application requires a shared file system so you have provisioned one using the file storage service (FSS). You also created the corresponding mount target in one of the application subnets. The VCN security lists are properly configured so that both application servers and the DB System can access the file system. The security team determines that the DB System should have read-only access to the file system.\nWhat change would you make to satisfy this requirement?","question_id":33,"choices":{"A":"Create an NFS export option that allows READ_ONLY access where the source is the CIDR range of the DB System subnet.","C":"Modify the security list associated with the subnet where the mount target resides.

However, it is not the most secure option because it relies on IP-based access control, which can be less secure than access control based on identity and access management (IAM) policies.\n\nTherefore, the most secure and appropriate option is to create an instance principal for the DB System and write an IAM policy that allows the instance principal read-only access to the file storage service. This approach provides fine-grained control over access to the file system based on the identity of the DB System, ensuring that only the DB System can access the file system and only for read-only operations.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699991580.0"},{"poster":"Mohamed79","content":"Correct answer is A","timestamp":"1616962380.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"322908"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/18314-exam-1z0-932-topic-1-question-128-discussion/","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"X2TtzudXnjXWihAEmiM1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/18501-exam-1z0-932-topic-1-question-129-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Create a group for developers on OCI and map the group to a similar group in Microsoft Active Directory during the federation process.","B":"Federate all Microsoft Active Directory groups with OCI to allow users to use their existing credentials.","D":"Create a group for developers on OCI, export all the developers from Microsoft Active Directory, and then import them into the Identity and Access Management (IAM) group.","C":"Create a new user account for each user, and then create policies to provide access to developers."},"topic":"1","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1586973780,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1587442080.0","comment_id":"77282","content":"I reckon it's A too.
