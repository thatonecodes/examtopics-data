The Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) Compare Periods report enables you to compare database performance between two periods of time.\nWhile an AWR report shows AWR data between two snapshots (or two points in time), the AWR Compare Periods report shows the difference between two periods (or two AWR reports with a total of four snapshots). Using the AWR Compare Periods report helps you to identify detailed performance attributes and configuration settings that differ between two time periods.\nReferences:","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1602937620}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":53,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"1z0-067","isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Oracle","id":376},"currentPage":8},"__N_SSP":true}
