PrintWriter outputs characters and automatically flushes the stream. Explanation: A. PrintWriter is a class in Java that outputs characters to an output stream and automatically flushes the stream when a newline character is written, when the println method is invoked, or when a carriage return character is written. B. System.exit() does not invoke the close() method for the InputStream/OutputStream resources. It terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's the responsibility of your code to close streams before exiting. C. Console.readPassword() does not encrypt the text entered. It simply disables echoing, so the password is not displayed on the console when it's entered. D. PrintStream does not output only bytes. It can output all primitive data types and strings using its print and println methods."},{"timestamp":"1712147280.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nRetested. C is not true.
