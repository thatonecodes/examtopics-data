Each instance in a replication topology must have a unique server ID. This is important to ensure that each instance can be uniquely identified in the replication process.\n\nF. Binary logging must be enabled on the master in order to replicate to other instances. Binary logging is essential for the master server to record changes that need to be replicated to the slave servers.\n\nG. A replication user must have the SELECT privilege for all tables that need to be replicated. The replication user on the slave server needs the SELECT privilege on the tables it's replicating to retrieve the data changes from the master.","timestamp":"1713199320.0","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"higUzA07CzrSkNQuGLZS","answers_community":["BE (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1697388180,"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which two statements are true about the mysql_config_editor program?
