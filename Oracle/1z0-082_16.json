Unlike traditional space management with a fixed relink and unlink threshold, bitmap space managements allow Oracle to compare the actual row space for an INSERT with the actual available space on the data block. This enables better reuse of the available free space especially for objects with rows of highly varying size. Here are the values inside the four-bit space:\nValue Meaning\n0000 Unformatted Block\n0001 Block is logically full\n0010 <25% free space\n0011 >25% but <50% free space\n0100 > 50% but <75% free space\n0101 >75% free space\n\nTable 1: Bitmap value meanings.","timestamp":"1649323140.0"},{"poster":"nautil2","comment_id":"1010497","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nA - FALSE; default 0 for compressed tables\nB - TRUE; each block is divided into four sections, named FS1 (between 0 and 25% of free space), FS2 (25% to 50% free), FS3 (50% to 75% free), and FS4 (75% to 100% free)\nC - FALSE; only before INSERT operations free space in block is tested and when there is a lack of space, new blocks are allocated.

If a block has sufficient free space to accomodate the row update then Oracle does not need to search for a different block with enough free space.\nD is correct. Oracle does this by scanning the BMB in the segment to determine a block that can store the entire row. The main purpose here is to avoid row chanining.\nE is wrong.
