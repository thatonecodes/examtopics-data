RAC One Node supports rolling patching, which allows patching with minimal downtime by enabling patches to be applied one node at a time.\nC: True, RAC One Node enhances high availability by automatically failing over the database instance to another node in the cluster if the primary node experiences a failure. This failover mechanism ensures that the database remains accessible without manual intervention, thereby reducing downtime.\nD: True. RAC One Node allows for an online conversion from non-RAC databases to RAC One Node databases, providing a streamlined upgrade path for adding high availability without downtime.\nE: false\nAlthough RAC One Node offers flexibility in terms of converting to and from single-instance and RAC configurations, this option was not selected because the question specifically asks for benefits of using RAC one node.","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":379,"unix_timestamp":1733671980,"answer_ET":"BDE","question_id":71,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["BCD (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/152697-exam-1z0-078-topic-1-question-90-discussion/","choices":{"E":"Online conversion from RAC One Node databases to multi-instance RAC databases","C":"Automatic failover for high availability","B":"Ability to perform rolling patches","A":"Multiple instances of the same database on a single node to protect against instance failure","F":"Load balancing of services within a single instance","D":"Online conversion from non-RAC databases to RAC One Node databases"},"answer":"BCD"},{"id":"aZ6Xs1PCMh2itl6n6KnZ","answer":"CD","answer_ET":"AD","timestamp":"2024-12-08 16:47:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1733672820,"choices":{"B":"srvctl stop service prevents logins for service HR only to CDB1 on HOST01.","E":"srvctl stop service closes PDB_1 on all CDB1 instances.","A":"HR is available on a single instance of prod_pool.","C":"HR is uniformly managed across all instances in prod_pool.","D":"srvctl stop service prevents logins to any instance of CDB1 using service HR.","F":"srvctl stop service only closes PDB_1 in the instance on HOST01."},"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-078/image12.png"],"question_text":"You support a three-instance, policy-managed, multitenant RAC database CDB1 with two PDBs PDB_1 and PDB_2.\n\nIt runs on an eight-node cluster and serverpool prod_pool has three servers.\n\nExamine these commands executed on HOST01:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich two statements are true?
