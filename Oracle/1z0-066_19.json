This is accomplished by allowing transactions to commit as soon as all redo data generated by those transactions has been written to the online log. Redo data is also written to one or more standby databases, but this is done asynchronously with respect to transaction commitment, so primary database performance is unaffected by delays in writing redo data to the standby database(s).\nE: Increasing the bandwidth would decrease the lag.\nNote: If STANDBY_MAX_DATA_DELAY is set to a non-zero value, a query issued to a physical standby database will be executed only if the apply lag is less than or equal to STANDBY_MAX_DATA_DELAY. Otherwise, an ORA-3172 error is returned to alert the client that the apply lag is too large.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28294/protection.htm http://docs.oracle.com/html/E26088_02/statements_2013.htm","exam_id":375,"answer":"EF","timestamp":"2021-08-05 10:55:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/59298-exam-1z0-066-topic-1-question-87-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Change the protection mode to Maximum Performance.","D":"Change the protection mode to Maximum Protection.","F":"Increase the number of standby redo log files on the primary database.","C":"Reduce I/O latency for the storage used by the primary database.","E":"Increase the network bandwidth between the primary and standby databases.","B":"Increase the size of the buffer cache on the standby database instance."}},{"id":"Zh1Ug2FAqmm4lIGEh5J4","answer_description":"A: On the Data Guard Performance page, you can monitor the Redo Generation Rate in the Primary database, and the Apply Rate and Lag Times in the Standby\nDatabase.\nE: Look at the Standby Database Progress Summary Section.

The Transport lag is the time difference between the last update on the primary database, and the last received redo on the standby.
