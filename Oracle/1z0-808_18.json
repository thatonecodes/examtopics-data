What you have to pay in these questions is to which object the variable is pointing and we see this in the \"new DerivedB\", so we know that our B1 and B3 even being of the \"Base\" type they are \"DerivedB\" objects. the variable B4 is a reference of B3 which is a \"DerivedB\" object so we know that in the second position of the print it is a \"DerivedB\", even doing a cast of B2 -> Base the overload always takes the child's method then prints \"DerivedA \" getting \"DerivedA DerivedB\". To be honest, I don't know what to mark if this happens in the test, but I would mark the alternative that came closest to the truth, which is alternative B.
