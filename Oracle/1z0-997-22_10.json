Ensure that all necessary intermediate CA certificates and the root CA certificate are included in the chain. The certificate chain should be complete.\nD. If the key usage extension is present, it should not include KEY_CERT_SIGN.\n\nIn a typical TLS/SSL certificate chain, the key usage extension should not include the KEY_CERT_SIGN flag. This flag is typically associated with CA certificates. If it's present in an end-entity certificate, it can cause validation issues.","comments":[{"content":"correction\nBC\nThe certificate's common name is non-null.\nIn the basic constraints extension, the isCA bit is set to true.\nIn the basic constraints extension, if the path length is specified, the number of intermediate certificates in the certificate chain hierarchy does not exceed it.\nIf the key usage extension is present, it includes KEY_CERT_SIGN.","timestamp":"1699740540.0","comment_id":"1068159","poster":"daws08322","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BC\nConfirm that the certificate chain includes all certificate authority (CA) certificates up to and including the root certificate.\n...\n- The certificate's common name is non-null.\n...\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/certificates/invalidcertificatechain.htm","poster":"Nots","comment_id":"1039568","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1696945500.0"}],"topic":"1","exam_id":413,"question_text":"You are a principal cloud consultant at a retail firm.
