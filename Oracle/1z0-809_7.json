It is a terminal operation that reduces the stream to a single value, which is the count of elements.\n\ncollect(): The collect() method is a more general reduction operation that allows you to accumulate elements of a stream into a mutable result container, such as a List, Set, or Map. It takes a Collector as a parameter, which specifies the rules for accumulating the elements. It is also a terminal operation that reduces the stream to a single value, which is the result of the accumulation.","poster":"duydn","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1711077720.0","comment_id":"1013497"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"517925","poster":"samtash1034","content":"a and b，tested","timestamp":"1657069740.0"}],"answer":"AB","timestamp":"2022-01-06 04:09:00","topic":"1","answer_ET":"AB","answers_community":["AB (100%)"],"question_id":32,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1641438540,"choices":{"D":"peek ()","E":"filter ()","A":"count ()","C":"distinct ()","B":"collect ()"},"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/69560-exam-1z0-809-topic-1-question-122-discussion/","question_text":"Which two methods from the java.util.stream.Stream interface perform a reduction operation?
