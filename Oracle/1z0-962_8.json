This is based on the information defined in the country defaults and the application tax options. Oracle Fusion Tax calculates the corresponding taxes accordingly. If you need to revise the taxes, make the Receivables transaction incomplete and revise the tax determinants to recalculate taxes based on your revised values.\n\nWhile copying the Receivable transaction information to the Payables interface tables, the transaction business category of SALES_TRANSACTION available on the Receivables transaction is replaced with PURCHASE_TRANSACTION. If there are any specific tax rules driven based on the transaction business category, you must configure them for both Receivables and Payables transactions.","poster":"Pasha","comment_id":"5524","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1564581180.0"}],"answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Tax for intercompany is loaded by using Create Taxable Transactions in Spreadsheet.","F":"Ensure that both the receiver and provider business units and legal entities are subscribed to the applicable tax regime on the transaction date.","E":"Ensure if any tax-specific rules that are defined should cover both the sales_transaction and purchase_transaction business category.","B":"The payable options and the receivable system options should have the same tax application options.","A":"Intercompany system options enable use of the same tax rate code for the payable and receivable invoices.","D":"First enter a payable transaction to calculate tax and then enter the receivable transaction."},"question_id":37,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/3067-exam-1z0-962-topic-1-question-42-discussion/","topic":"1"},{"id":"vWJnISLdm1dTLOqDtWwS","isMC":true,"exam_id":410,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/14456-exam-1z0-962-topic-1-question-43-discussion/","answer":"ABC","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1582122120,"discussion":[{"content":"The correct answer is ACD","timestamp":"1582122120.0","upvote_count":"11","poster":"Guido_d","comment_id":"52624"}],"question_id":38,"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"question_text":"After reviewing an incomplete invoice, the Billing Manager clicks the Complete button in the Transactions window.\nWhat are three results of this action?
