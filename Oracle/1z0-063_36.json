In this case the metadata from the source database is exported to a dump file, and both the dump file and the tablespace data files are transferred to a new system. The steps would be as follows:\n* (1) Set user tablespaces in the source database to READ ONLY.\n* (3) Create a CDB on the destination system, including a PDB into which you will import the source database.\n* (4) From the Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2.0.3) environment, export the metadata and any data residing in administrative tablespaces from the source database using the FULL=Y and TRANSPORTABLE=ALWAYS parameters. Note that the VERSION=12 parameter is required only when exporting from an\nOracle Database 11g Release 2 database.\n* (5) Copy the tablespace data files from the source system to the destination system.\n* (6) In the Oracle Database 12c environment, connect to the pre-created PDB and import the dump file.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/upgrade/upgrading-oracle-database-wp-12c-1896123.pdf\n, page 11","question_text":"You want to migrate your Oracle 11g database as a pluggable database (PDB) in a multitenant container database (CDB).\nThe following are the possible steps to accomplish this task:\n1.
