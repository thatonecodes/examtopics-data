It reconfigures InnoDB Cluster if the cluster was stopped. This function is specifically designed to recover a cluster after a complete outage, which means that group replication has stopped on all member instances.\nG. It picks the minimum number of instances necessary to rebuild the quorum and reconfigures InnoDB Cluster. The function retrieves the cluster metadata and topology from the current instance, checks which instances of the cluster are currently reachable, and recovers the cluster based on the metadata stored in that instance. If any member is currently unreachable, the function fails, but this check can be bypassed with the force option.","comment_id":"1122544","timestamp":"1705238580.0"},{"comment_id":"1020486","poster":"marklv","timestamp":"1695964920.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"C and D.
