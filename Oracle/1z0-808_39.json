The correct combination is C and E.\nBecause:\n\nEarth's revolve() (line n3) has default access but inherits from protected access in Planet - it needs to be made at least protected (option D) or public (option C)\nEarth's rotate() (line n4) is implementing an abstract method with default access - it needs to be made public (option E) as it can't be more restrictive than the parent's access level\n\nTherefore my final answer is C and E - Make line n3 public and line n4 public.","comment_id":"1354969"},{"timestamp":"1739272200.0","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nWe need TWO modifications that would allow compilation.
