The master is most probably too busy to transmit data and the slave needs to wait for more data.\nD. The master is producing a large volume of events in parallel but the slave is processing them serially.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. When the \"Seconds_Behind_Master\" value is steadily growing, it indicates that the slave is falling behind the master because it's waiting for data from the master. This can happen if the master is busy and cannot transmit data to the slave as quickly as the slave can process it.\n\nD. If the master is producing a large volume of events (changes) in parallel, but the slave is processing them serially (one by one), it can lead to a situation where the slave falls behind the master. The slave might not be able to keep up with the incoming changes, causing the \"Seconds_Behind_Master\" value to increase.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"982455","timestamp":"1692183660.0","poster":"FelipeK"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/118251-exam-1z0-908-topic-1-question-7-discussion/","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"The master is most probably too busy to transmit data and the slave needs to wait for more data.","C":"This value shows only I/O latency and is not indicative of the size of the transaction queue.","E":"The parallel slave threads are experiencing lock contention.","D":"The master is producing a large volume of events in parallel but the slave is processing them serially.","B":"One or more large tables do not have primary keys."},"topic":"1","answers_community":["AD (50%)","DE (25%)","BD (25%)"],"question_id":111,"exam_id":405,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Examine the modified output:\n//IMG//\n\nSeconds_Behind_ Master value is steadily growing.\nWhat are two possible causes?
