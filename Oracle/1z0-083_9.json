A SQL profile is a set of auxiliary information specific to a SQL statement. Conceptually, a SQL profile is to a SQL statement what statistics are to a table or index.

This information can improve optimizer cardinality and selectivity estimates, which in turn leads the optimizer to select better plans. The SQL profile does not contain information about individual execution plans.
