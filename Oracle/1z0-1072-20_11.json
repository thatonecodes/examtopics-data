The data sitting on this instance needs to be copied to OCI Object storage bucket available in the same region without traversing over the internet. To enable the connectivity between the instance and Object Storage, you created a service gateway with service CIDR of all Object Storage in us-phoenix-1 enabled. You also modified the security rules to allow the desired traffic.\nHowever, when you tried sending the data to the Object Storage bucket, you notice that the data is going over the internet and not via the service gateway.\nWhat could be the possible reason for this behavior?","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"The route table associated with the subnet has no route rule where the destination is object storage service.","B":"The service gateway created in the VCN resides in a different availability domain.","C":"The security list associated with the subnet has an egress rule that allows all traffic to be forwarded to a destination CIDR 0.0.0.0/0.","A":"Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies restrict the access to the object storage bucket."},"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"d5a865u","comment_id":"286969","content":"D is correct but could be better explained.
