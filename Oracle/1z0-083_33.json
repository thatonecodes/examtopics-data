Clean restore point.\nIn a CDB that uses shared undo, one set of tablespaces is shared by all PDBs. Undo data for multiple PDBs may be mixed within the undo tablespaces and even within individual data blocks. Therefore, to perform a flashback database operation for a PDB, RMAN automatically uses an auxiliary instance to restore shared undo tablespaces and certain tablespaces in the root and then recovers data to the required point in time. This process may involve restoring backups for a relatively small amount of data. When you perform a flashback database operation on a PDB to a clean PDB restore point, no auxiliary instance or restoring of backups is required.\n\nBy default, the auxiliary instance is created in the FRA.
