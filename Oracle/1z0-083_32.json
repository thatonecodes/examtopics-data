These metric alert events are called stateful alerts. For those metric alert events that are not tied to the state of a monitored system (for example, snapshot too old, or resumable session suspended ), these alerts are called stateless alerts.

You can define thresholds for more than 120 metrics, including the following:\n• Physical Reads Per Sec\n• User Commits Per Sec\n• SQL Service Response Time\nExcept for the Tablespace Space Usage metric, which is database related, the other metrics are\ninstance related. Threshold alerts are also referred to as stateful alerts, which are automatically\ncleared when an alert condition clears.

However, other alerts (such as generic alert log errors) are sent to you for notification and must be acknowledged by you. After taking the corrective measures, you acknowledge an alert by clearing or purging it. Clearing an alert sends the alert to the Alert History which is accessible from Monitoring sub menu.
