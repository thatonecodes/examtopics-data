Also see Q.200 and you will know why A is not the answer.\nIn addition in the reference \"Stored scripts are either global or local. It is possible for global scripts, but not local scripts, to have name conflicts during import because the destination schema contains an object with the same name. In this case, RMAN renames the global script name to COPY OF script_name. For example, RMAN renames bp_cmd to COPY OF bp_cmd.\"\nSo the recommended answer is correct.\nREF:https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RCMRF/rcmsynta026.htm#RCMRF198","timestamp":"1645682520.0","poster":"HakuPudding"},{"poster":"NorthKorean","timestamp":"1587814740.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"The version of the source recovery catalog schema must be equal to the current version of the destination recovery catalog schema.
