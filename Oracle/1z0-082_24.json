Get the result: Two promotion data that have the same period but with different cost, and one cost has the minimum cost of all promotions.\n>> if set the data like this:\n 1-$5000-period 10 days/ 2- $3000-period 15 days/ 3- $2500- period 30 days/ 4-$3500-period 30 days\n>> We can get the ALL list of ($5000, $3000, $3500), and $2500 will be left to the group but this cost is meet the < ALL situation and the related product ID will show up in the end.\n\n2. No result in the end:\nIf the example above change the third data to $3000, then we can still get the same ALL list ($5000, $3000, $3500) but there are no other cost that is less than the cost in the list.
