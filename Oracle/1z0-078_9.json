Correct: ACFS replication requires a minimum of 2 GB free space on the primary file system to ensure proper functioning and prevent data consistency issues.\nB. Correct: ACFS replication can include auditing information as part of the metadata it replicates, ensuring that the audit trail is maintained on the standby system. But it's important to clarify what this entails and how it fits into the overall ACFS replication process.\nE. Correct: ACFS replication allows for a flexible deployment where a single site can host both primary and standby file systems, useful for testing or staging environments.\n\nC. Incorrect: This pertains to Oracle Data Guard, not ACFS replication. While ACFS can replicate redo log files stored in the file system, it does not specifically require standby redo log files for its replication process.\nD. Incorrect: There is no SYSREPL privilege mentioned in Oracle's documentation for ACFS replication. Standard administrative privileges are used to manage ACFS replication configurations.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"cvcs1977","content":"Selected Answer: ABE\nThere is no SYSREPL privilege\nThis question is only about ACFS Replication, there is nothing that references to redo log files","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1229002","timestamp":"1718194800.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"wiprooracle","timestamp":"1715342460.0","content":"Thats correct, thanks for correcting.","comment_id":"1209359"},{"comment_id":"1208125","content":"https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sbydb/oracle-data-guard-redo-transport-services.html#GUID-E6EC6104-3C38-482D-B807-A0E84ECFB937","timestamp":"1715133180.0","comments":[{"poster":"Dbadoring","comment_id":"1208332","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715165400.0","content":"This questions is about ACFS, not dataguard."}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"wiprooracle"},{"poster":"wiprooracle","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715133120.0","content":"Looks like BCE","comment_id":"1208124"},{"timestamp":"1710915120.0","poster":"krwi1","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: ABE\nI think D is wrong - there is no SYSREPL privilege","comment_id":"1177964"}]},{"id":"tSAiaOjfA2lebnMBWycx","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728125760.0","content":"Selected Answer: BDE\nI think BDE.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"217972f","comment_id":"1293444"}],"topic":"1","exam_id":379,"answer_ET":"BDE","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/148676-exam-1z0-078-topic-1-question-53-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Cluster resources running on the failed node must be recovered when the node is restarted.","B":"Cluster Resources running on the failed node are relocated to one or more surviving hub nodes.","E":"The node is evicted from the cluster.","C":"Cluster Resources running on the failed node are suspended until the node is restarted.","D":"Sessions connected to the failed node could be relocated to one or more surviving nodes."},"answer":"BDE","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["BDE (100%)"],"question_text":"Which three events occur when a node fails in an Oracle Clusterware 19c Cluster?
