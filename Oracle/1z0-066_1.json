A SYNC/AFFIRM transport provides an additional protection benefit at the expense of a performance impact caused by the time required to complete the I/O to the standby redo log.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: When a transport is performed using SYNC/NOAFFIRM, the primary performs write operations and waits only for acknowledgement that the data has been received on the standby, not that it has been written to disk. The SYNC/NOAFFIRM transport can provide a performance benefit at the expense of potential exposure to data loss in a special case of multiple simultaneous failures.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28294/protection.htm","timestamp":"2021-05-04 14:47:00","choices":{"A":"SYNC NOAFFRIM and Maximum Protection","E":"SYNC AFFIRM and Maximum Protection","C":"ASYNC and Maximum Performance","D":"SYNC AFFIRM and Maximum Availability","B":"SYNC NOAFFIRM and Maximum Availability"},"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer":"E","answers_community":["E (100%)"],"exam_id":375,"question_id":2,"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1620132420,"question_text":"You must configure an Oracle Data Guard environment consisting of:\n1.
