The subclass getRatings method uses super.getRatings() to call the base class method but uses its own named fields in the implementation.\n\nExplanation:\n\nUsing super.getRatings() allows the Football subclass to call the getRatings method defined in the Sports superclass.\nThe subclass can then use its own named fields and logic in the implementation of the method while still leveraging the functionality provided by the base class.","timestamp":"1712834820.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1709207640.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is syntatically correct.
