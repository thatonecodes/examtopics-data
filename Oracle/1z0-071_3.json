The DELETE statement executes successfully even if the subquery selects multiple rows. This is because the EXISTS condition only checks for the existence of at least one row in the subquery, regardless of how many rows are returned.\n\nE. The subquery is executed for every row in the EMPLOYEES table. This is because the subquery is a correlated subquery, which means that it references a column from the outer query (e.employee_id).
