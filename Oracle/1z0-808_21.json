Data abstraction is a concept in OOP that refers to the process of hiding implementation details while only showing the functionality to the user. It is achieved in Java by using abstract classes and interfaces, which define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits from them . Encapsulation, on the other hand, is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class. By using encapsulation, a class can enforce its own data validation rules and ensure that its internal state remains consistent .","timestamp":"1690475700.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nThe correct answer is CD, there is nothing to talk about, they are basic concepts.","timestamp":"1665320760.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"690196","poster":"iSnover"}]},{"id":"aqmOwOytsr7WmefuBNzk","timestamp":"2022-10-09 15:10:00","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1060059","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bear4TW","timestamp":"1730494740.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTo test:\n\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n int sum = 0;\n for (int xVal = 1; xVal <= 5; xVal++) {\n sum = sum + xVal;\n }\n System.out.println(\"The sum of \" + xVal + \" numbers is: \" + sum);\n\n }"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"982886","poster":"dsms","content":"Selected Answer: B\nanswer is B: \"A compile time error occurs.\" \nxVal - is unreachable outside FOR loop","timestamp":"1723833660.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is the letter B, it is the typical case of differentiating between local variable and instance variable, as the local variable \"xVal\" was instantiated inside the for, the code inside the for compiles normally, but when exiting for and trying printing the variable inside the class cannot because there is no variable created with that name, as \"xValr\" is a local variable, its instantiation is only valid locally inside the for and not outside it.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1696857000.0","poster":"iSnover","comment_id":"690201"}],"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Given the code fragment:\n//IMG//\n\nWhat is the result?","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":105,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04353/0021700002.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/84858-exam-1z0-808-topic-1-question-195-discussion/","exam_id":399,"topic":"1","answer":"B","choices":{"B":"A compile time error occurs.","D":"The sum of 5 numbers is: 15","C":"The sum of 5 numbers is: 10","A":"The sum of 4 numbers is: 10"},"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1665321000}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"id":399,"provider":"Oracle","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":234,"name":"1z0-808","isBeta":false},"currentPage":21},"__N_SSP":true}
