Inconsistent backups offer superior availability because you do not have to shut down the database to make backups that fully protect the database.\n\nAns: C\nAny database backup that is not consistent is an inconsistent backup. A backup made when the database is open is inconsistent, as is a backup made after an instance failure or SHUTDOWN ABORT command. When a database is restored from an inconsistent backup, Oracle Database must perform media recovery before the database can be opened, applying changes from the redo logs that took place after the backup was created.\n\nAbout Inconsistent RMAN Backups\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/BRADV/rcmcncpt.htm#BRADV99964","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1595909580.0","poster":"taiyang"},{"content":"the answers provided here seems wrong. if you will based it on the concept of COnsitent and inconsistent backup, answer should be A B\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADMQS/GUID-74B864F7-2413-4142-BDB0-7B98BE960462.htm#ADMQS09111","timestamp":"1593836760.0","poster":"Sugar","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"125948"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1587864720.0","content":"Sorry I understood the question vice versa..","upvote_count":"1","poster":"NorthKorean","comment_id":"79665"}],"comment_id":"79116","poster":"NorthKorean","upvote_count":"1","content":"A,D ? anyone knows the answer?","timestamp":"1587731100.0"}]},{"id":"BfUDp7NJ5GUzm8g1UJpj","discussion":[{"poster":"hilaire","content":"ADF correct","timestamp":"1628759160.0","comment_id":"423488","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"ADF\nYou can use the CONFIGURE ...
