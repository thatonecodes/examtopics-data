So, by default, the REMOTE_LISTENER parameter is set to the SCAN, assuming that the Database is created using standard Oracle tools. This enables the instances to register with the SCAN Listeners as remote listeners to provide information on what services are being provided by the instance, the current load, and a recommendation on how many incoming connections should be directed to the instance.\nNote: Single Client Access Name (SCAN) is an Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) feature that provides a single name for clients to access Oracle\nDatabases running in a cluster.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: You must set the LOCAL_LISTENER parameter to the node-VIP. If you need fully qualified domain names, then ensure that the LOCAL_LISTENER parameter is set to the fully qualified domain name. By default, a node listener is created on each node in the cluster during cluster configuration. With Oracle Grid\nInfrastructure, the node listener runs out of the Oracle Grid Infrastructure home and listens on the node-VIP using the specified port.\nD: LOAD_BALANCE=on, not LOAD_BALANCE=YES, is used.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/JJDBC/scan.htm#JJDBC29151 https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RACAD/hafeats.htm#RACAD7122","answer":"CE","question_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727139300.0","poster":"ccshyu","comment_id":"574033","content":"I think C.E. is right."},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"I think is AE","poster":"FTR72","comment_id":"230600","timestamp":"1685387580.0"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"mIuTZuzb5xExVkwiGXi3","timestamp":"2019-06-11 20:22:00","discussion":[{"content":"E is the correct as per below oracle ref , create script , store it in the grid path mentioned and give grid the execution privilege's\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RACAD/GUID-2024CEF8-F984-4377-9182-E17F738A4715.htm#RACAD7133","comment_id":"652135","poster":"bestsalman","timestamp":"1724661180.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"I think is \"E\"","timestamp":"1711250460.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"574046","poster":"ccshyu"},{"timestamp":"1698154560.0","comment_id":"466976","content":"E is correct.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Yoones"},{"poster":"nqobile","upvote_count":"4","content":"in other exams the answer to this question is said to be E, i am yet to see a good explanation","timestamp":"1623435720.0","comment_id":"2579"}],"answer":"F","question_id":38,"unix_timestamp":1560277320,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"F","answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02266/0002600001.png"],"choices":{"E":"2, 4, 7","B":"1, 4, 6","C":"2, 5, 8","D":"2, 4, 7, 8","A":"1, 3, 7","F":"1, 4, 7, 8"},"answer_description":"FAN callouts are server-side executables that Oracle Restart executes immediately when high availability events occur.\nYou can use FAN callouts to automate the following activities when events occur, such as:\n✑ Opening fault tracking tickets\n✑ Sending messages to pagers\n✑ Sending e-mail\n✑ Starting and stopping server-side applications\n✑ Maintaining an uptime log by logging each event as it occurs\nTo use FAN callouts, place an executable in the directory grid_home/racg/usrco on both the primary and the standby database servers.
