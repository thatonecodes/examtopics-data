It can host other applications and additional schemas while protecting data replicated from the primary against local changes.\nD: A logical standby database is open read/write while changes on the primary are being replicated. Consequently, a logical standby database can simultaneously be used to meet many other business requirements, for example it can run reporting workloads that would problematical for the primary's throughput.\nF: Logical standby can be used to greatly reduce downtime associated with applying patchsets and new software releases. A logical standby can be upgraded to the new release and then switched over to become the active primary. This allows full availability while the old primary is converted to a logical standby and the patchset is applied.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e41134/standby.htm#SBYDB00103","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1624952040,"exam_id":375,"answer":"CDF","question_images":[],"choices":{"F":"It can be used for testing patches without affecting the primary database.","E":"It provides a disaster-recovery solution with switchover and failover options that can recover any data updated on the primary database.","B":"It can be used to replicate a single pluggable database (PDB) in a multitenant container database.","C":"It can be used as an updatable database for Real Application testing and then converted back to a standby database without affecting the updates.","A":"It can be used for database rolling release upgrades.","D":"It can be used for reporting workloads requiring additional indexes or materialized views or both."},"question_text":"Which three are always benefits of using a logical standby database?","timestamp":"2021-06-29 09:34:00","answer_ET":"CDF","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1697969160.0","poster":"ScottL","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1050430","content":"A,D,E -"},{"content":"A, D and E\nC: is the definition of snapshot database. \nF: Real application testing should be on a database with similar structure but logical standby database is an independent database.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ucdongmo","comment_id":"931863","comments":[{"comment_id":"931864","timestamp":"1687545000.0","content":"Sorry A, D and F","upvote_count":"3","poster":"ucdongmo"}],"timestamp":"1687544880.0"},{"content":"Answer: A, D and E","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JESUSBB","timestamp":"1661561760.0","comment_id":"652436"},{"comment_id":"393591","poster":"Yoones","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1624952040.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1636207080.0","comment_id":"473480","poster":"Sugar","upvote_count":"1","content":"A D E were also my answers and obviously they provided wrong answers"}],"content":"The right answers are: ADE\nC: is the definition of snapshot stdb not a logical stdb\nF: should not be correct because logical stdb is more used to rolling upgrade rather testing porpuses."}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/56246-exam-1z0-066-topic-1-question-37-discussion/","question_id":42},{"id":"GhoJnHASuiV717dyEoRM","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1060149","timestamp":"1698885420.0","poster":"Rockfics","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nAnswer A,B\nC.
