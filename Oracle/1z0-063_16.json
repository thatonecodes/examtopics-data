After the operation, the database returns the triggers to the state they were in before the operation (enabled or disabled). To keep triggers enabled during the flashback of the table, add an ENABLE\nTRIGGERS clause to the FLASHBACK TABLE\nD: Flashback Table operations are not valid for the following type objects: tables that are part of a cluster, materialized views, Advanced Queuing (AQ) tables, static data dictionary tables, system tables, remote tables, object tables, nested tables, or individual table partitions or subpartitions.\nReferences: Oracle Database, Backup and Recovery User's Guide, 12 Release 2 (January 2017), page 18-11","exam_id":374,"question_text":"You accidentally drop the CUSTOMERS table, and then recover it by using the FLASHBACK TABLE command.\nWhich two statements are true about the dependent objects of the CUSTOMERS table?","unix_timestamp":1626865500,"discussion":[{"content":"BE correct","poster":"hilaire","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1626865500.0","comment_id":"410812"}]},{"id":"9G1pnilVYV8WMCr6YAtW","exam_id":374,"timestamp":"2020-02-14 03:58:00","unix_timestamp":1581649080,"topic":"1","answer_description":"A: To implement Temporal Validity(TV), 12c offers the option to have two date columns in that table which is having TV enabled using the new clause Period For in the Create Table for the newly created tables or in the Alter Table for the existing ones.
