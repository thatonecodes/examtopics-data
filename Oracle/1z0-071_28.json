A relationship can be mandatory for both entities.\nExplanation:\nIn an entity relationship, it is possible to define a relationship as mandatory for both entities. For example:\nA \"Student\" must be enrolled in a \"Course\" (mandatory for \"Student\").\nA \"Course\" must have at least one \"Student\" (mandatory for \"Course\").\nThis is known as a mandatory participation constraint.\nE. A table name can be specified just once when selecting data from a table having a self-referencing relationship.\nExplanation:\nIn a self-referencing relationship, a table refers to itself through a foreign key. When querying, you can use a single table name but must use aliases to differentiate between the parent and child references.\n\nSELECT e1.employee_id, e1.name AS manager_name, e2.name AS employee_name\nFROM employees e1\nJOIN employees e2 ON e1.employee_id = e2.manager_id;","comment_id":"1340859","timestamp":"1736941020.0","poster":"Thameur01","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BD\nC IS NOT CORRECT WITH ''ONLY''.","poster":"bca123","comment_id":"1333328","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735447440.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BC\nI think many-to-many relationships are implemented using an associative table with foreign keys.","poster":"jm9999","comment_id":"1026401","timestamp":"1728207960.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1720767300.0","poster":"WingL","comment_id":"949540","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nBD can be correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BD\nD because A one-to-many relationship in one direction is a many-to-one relationship in the other direction. For example, if a customer can have many orders, then an order can have only one customer.\n\nStatement C, “A many-to-many relationship can be implemented only by using foreign keys,” is not correct because a many-to-many relationship cannot be implemented directly using foreign keys. Instead, it is typically implemented using a junction table (also known as a bridge table or associative table) that sits between the two tables representing the entities in the relationship.","comment_id":"943025","upvote_count":"1","poster":"zouve","timestamp":"1720113300.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-07-04 19:15:00","answer":"BD"}],"exam":{"id":378,"numberOfQuestions":267,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Oracle","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"1z0-071"},"currentPage":28},"__N_SSP":true}
