A dedicated host provides you with a physical server dedicated to your use, ensuring that your VMs run on isolated, dedicated hardware without sharing it with other tenants. This allows you to meet both the requirement of avoiding shared infrastructure and ensuring that you can license the entire server for your node-based licensing needs.\n\nSo, the correct choice is:\n\nB.
