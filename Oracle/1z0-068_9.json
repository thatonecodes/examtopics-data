When the connection to an instance is lost, SESSION failover results only in the establishment of a new connection to another Oracle RAC node; any work in progress is lost. SESSION failover is ideal for online transaction processing (OLTP) systems, where transactions are small.\nC: SELECT failover. With SELECT failover, Oracle Net keeps track of all SELECT statements issued during the transaction, tracking how many rows have been fetched back to the client for each cursor associated with a SELECT statement. If the connection to the instance is lost, Oracle Net establishes a connection to another Oracle RAC node and re-executes the SELECT statements, repositioning the cursors so the client can continue fetching rows as if nothing has happened.\nThe SELECT failover approach is best for data warehouse systems that perform complex and time-consuming transactions.\nD: Oracle's answer to application failover is a new Oracle Net mechanism dubbed Transparent Application Failover. TAF allows the DBA to configure the type and method of failover for each Oracle Net client.\nIncorrect Answers:\nE: In PRECONNECT failover, the application simultaneously connects to both a primary and a backup node. This offers faster failover, because a pre-spawned connection is ready to use. But the extra connection adds everyday overhead by duplicating connections.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.dba-oracle.com/art_oramag_rac_taf.htm","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/73563-exam-1z0-068-topic-1-question-47-discussion/","topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-04-12 11:27:00","unix_timestamp":1649755620,"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"question_id":43,"answer_ET":"ABC"},{"id":"XkLrXnSrJXCDtwNjOFcL","question_id":44,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/11692-exam-1z0-068-topic-1-question-49-discussion/","question_text":"Which three statements are true concerning the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) in a RAC environment?","answer":"ADE","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1578604380,"answer_ET":"ADE","choices":{"C":"Data captured by an AWR is aggregated across all instances before being stored in the database.","A":"Taking an AWR snapshot in a RAC database captures data from all instances that have the database opened.","D":"The awr_snapshot_time_offset parameter specifies the number of seconds each instance waits after the top of the hour before taking its AWR snapshot.","B":"Taking an AWR snapshot in a RAC database captures data from the local instance only.","E":"AWR snapshots are created when control_management_pack_access is set to \"none\""},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"652193","content":"ADE is correct and reference make it clear as well","timestamp":"1724668260.0","poster":"bestsalman"},{"timestamp":"1705045980.0","comment_id":"521971","content":"When the parameter CONTROL_MANAGMENT_PACK_ACCESS is set to NONE, it is expected behavior that AWR snapshots will continue to be generated.

The set consists of one template for each file type (data file, control file, redo log file, and so on) that is supported by Oracle ASM. For example, a template named ONLINELOG provides the default file redundancy and striping attributes for all redo log files written to Oracle ASM disks. Default template settings depend on the disk group type. The default template for data files for a normal redundancy disk group sets two-way mirroring, while the corresponding default template in a high redundancy disk group sets three-way mirroring.
