DBCS or DBaaS is a fully managed (by Oracle) service, requiring no operation effort for the underlying database. \n\nA. BYOL is available on both DBaaS and OCI DB Service.\nB. Makes no sense as we are comparing services and the license costs would be the same and infrastructure cost does not play to the question.\nC. RAC is available on both DBaaS and OCI DB Service. OCI DB Service has a one-node or two-node RAC option for bare-metal or virtualized compute instances.\nD. This option ends with compute service and not compute instance.
