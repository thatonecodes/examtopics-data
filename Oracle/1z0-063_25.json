By default, 0 is the redacted value when Oracle Database performs full redaction\n(DBMS_REDACT.FULL) on a column of the NUMBER data type. If you want to change it to another value (for example, 7), then you can run the\nDBMS_REDACT.UPDATE_FULL_REDACTION_VALUES procedure to modify this value. The modification applies to all of the Data Redaction policies in the current database instance. After you modify a value, you must restart the database for it to take effect.","answer":"E","answer_ET":"E","topic":"1","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-08-16 08:59:00","question_id":121,"choices":{"D":"Flush the shared pool.","C":"Re-connect the sessions that access objects with redaction policies defined on them.","A":"Re-enable redaction policies that use FULL data redaction.","B":"Re-create redaction policies that use FULL data redaction.","E":"Restart the database instance."},"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1629097140,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/59802-exam-1z0-063-topic-1-question-33-discussion/"},{"id":"0JeUiMLzmArr4hE5s2ab","unix_timestamp":1587775860,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"AC","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/backup.102/b14192/rpfbdb002.htm","exam_id":374,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"AC","timestamp":"2020-04-25 02:51:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"402582","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1625822040.0","content":"AC correct","poster":"hilaire"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sugar","comment_id":"105055","timestamp":"1591595940.0","content":"Indeed correct answer"}],"poster":"NorthKorean","comment_id":"79289","timestamp":"1587775860.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"confirmed"}],"choices":{"F":"A database backup must be taken.","C":"Fast Recovery Area must be enabled.","A":"The database must be running in archivelog mode.","E":"Undo retention guarantee must be enabled.","B":"Flashback Database must be enabled.","D":"The recyclebin must be enabled for the database."},"question_text":"You want to create a guaranteed restore point for your database by executing the command:\nSQL> CREATE RESTORE POINT dbrsp1 GUARANTEE FLASHBACK DATABASE;\nIdentify two prerequisites for the successful execution of this command.","question_id":122,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/19026-exam-1z0-063-topic-1-question-34-discussion/"},{"id":"7B0ujl1dxobTVLcFIObF","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02262/0002200001.png"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":123,"timestamp":"2020-04-14 08:16:00","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer":"C","exam_id":374,"question_text":"Your database has a table customer that contains the columns cust_name, amt_due, and old_status.\nExamine the commands executed and their output:\n//IMG//\n\nWhy is it that only one update is listed by the Flashback Version Query?","unix_timestamp":1586844960,"answers_community":[],"choices":{"E":"Flashback Data Archive is full after the first update statement.","D":"Undo retention guarantee is not enabled.","C":"The db_flashback_retention_target parameter is set to a lower value and the undo data pertaining to the first transaction is flushed out.","A":"Supplemental logging is not enabled for the database.","B":"The undo data that existed for versions of rows before the change to the table structure is invalidated."},"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/18404-exam-1z0-063-topic-1-question-35-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"79290","content":"B confirmed","poster":"NorthKorean","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1587775920.0"},{"content":"I think B is correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"74374","timestamp":"1586844960.0","poster":"edenzhang"}]},{"id":"LY6p0mg2gUiVjBepmiLh","question_id":124,"unix_timestamp":1577717580,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"33935","content":"B and D","timestamp":"1577781120.0","poster":"smokeystone"},{"poster":"arbol1","timestamp":"1671567720.0","content":"There are two B.\nB.
