In this mode, the planning process deletes the existing data for the selected entities from the data repository. Next, if subsequently collected from the source, the data for the selected entities replaces the deleted data. \n\nNet change\nWhen you use the Net Change collection type, you collect data incrementally. The Net Change collection type collects only changed or new data. Collecting data using the Net Change collection type is usually faster than using the Targeted collection type. You typically use the Net Change collection type when you have previously performed a Targeted collection, and now you want to keep your planning data current with your execution system data. You cannot select the demand planning data when the collection type is Net Change.\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/supply-chain-management/20b/faurp/planning-data-collection.html#FAURP1889938"}],"choices":{"E":"It collects data only incrementally to the planning data repository.","C":"Data for the selected entities is deleted from the planning data repository.","D":"It collects only changed data to the planning data repository.","B":"It completely refreshes the planning data repository.","A":"Data for the selected entities is replaced in the planning data repository."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/66746-exam-1z0-347-topic-2-question-3-discussion/","question_text":"Which two statements describe Net Change Collection?

Global Order Promising continues promising orders based on lead-time availability until the server or backup server can be restarted.\nPromise Orders When the Global Order Promising Server is Down\nContinuous access to availability checking and order scheduling is critical to many businesses, which need to be able to take orders even when a system fails or the server is otherwise down. Beginning with this release, Global Order Promising continues promising orders based upon lead-time availability until the server or backup server can be restarted. Affected orders may be rescheduled based upon supply chain availability search after server recovery, if desired. A more fail-safe order promising solution minimizes disruptions, so you can focus on growing your business.","comment_id":"487293","poster":"Dany24","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttp://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/tutorial/cloud/r12/nfs/r12-scm-order-features.htm#_Toc463340131","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/66747-exam-1z0-347-topic-2-question-5-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1637925540,"question_text":"Your customer is concerned about not having access to schedule orders and check availability when the Global Order Promising server is down.
