When the disk I/O is asynchronous, a server process can begin an I/O operation and then perform other work while waiting for the I/O to complete.

Also, if a channel reads from a raw device managed with a volume manager, then asynchronous disk I/O also works well. Some operating systems support native asynchronous disk I/O.
