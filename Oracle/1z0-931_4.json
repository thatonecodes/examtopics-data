I personally have tried doing this it worked.\n\nHe also mentions specific conditions to connect to databases that are non-autonomous in the same post;\n\"In this post you will have noticed that I have created a new database link between an Autonomous Data Warehouse and an Autonomous Transaction Processing instance. Whilst this is a great use case I suspect that many of you will want to connect your Autonomous Data Warehouse to an on-premise database. Well, as I mentioned at the start of this post there are some specific requirements related to using database links with Autonomous Data Warehouse where the target instance is not an autonomous database and we will deal with those in the next post: How to Create a Database Link from an Autonomous Data Warehouse to a Database Cloud Service Instance.\""},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1595244660.0","comment_id":"139434","poster":"Lucky667","content":"Correct Ans: B"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"136039","timestamp":"1594852800.0","poster":"rider","content":"Correct answer is C.
