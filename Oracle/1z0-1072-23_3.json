It does not inherently allow you to clone an existing volume to a new, larger volume. You can, however, create a new larger volume separately and then copy data from the source volume to the new volume.","timestamp":"1713967140.0","comment_id":"1052903"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":386,"topic":"1","question_id":11},{"id":"eFx9KgXFVaDhARS73ZOF","timestamp":"2023-09-27 19:38:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/121579-exam-1z0-1072-23-topic-1-question-2-discussion/","exam_id":386,"isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"Export your current image in the QCOW2 format and copy to an Object Storage bucket.
