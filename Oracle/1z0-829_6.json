That is to say:\n- either the \"name\" variable must be made static so that it can be accessed by the display() method on line 3\n- or the display() method on line 3 must be made non-static (remove the static keyword) so that it can access the \"name\" variable\nOnly alternative that achieves one of these two is A.\n\nNote that despite this change, i1.display(\"Flower\") will still call the display() method on line 7. Non-static methods are allowed to access static instance variable regardless. In this case, since both \"this.name\" and \"name\" are null, \"this.name += name;\" will simply do \"null += null;\" and the result will be \"nullnull\"."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe name field is an instance variable (non-static), but you are trying to access it directly from the static method display().So add static to the variable","timestamp":"1735549560.0","comment_id":"1334002","poster":"SrinivasJasti","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1706692740,"topic":"1","answer":"A","choices":{"A":"Replace 2 with static String name;","D":"Replace 15 with Item.display(\"Flower\");","B":"Replace 7 with public static void display(String design) {","C":"Replace 3 with private static void display() {"},"exam_id":403,"timestamp":"2024-01-31 10:19:00","answer_images":[],"question_id":26,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/132541-exam-1z0-829-topic-1-question-32-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"6eSuNjPhE2Ax2hQpBMsS","timestamp":"2024-01-31 10:59:00","question_id":27,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Marketing -\n\nFinance -\nTechnical","D":"UnDefined","C":"Marketing -\nUnDefined","A":"Marketing"},"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-829/image31.png","https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-829/image32.png"],"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1706695140,"exam_id":403,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1334009","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe result of the dropWhile operation is unused because the method call is not assigned to a variable or consumed.","poster":"SrinivasJasti","timestamp":"1735550460.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct answer","poster":"xplorerpj","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719325680.0","comment_id":"1236942"},{"comment_id":"1155999","poster":"james2033","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\npackage q33;\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class Q33 {\n\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n Arrays.stream(Desig.values()).dropWhile(s -> s.equals(Desig.CMO));\n switch (Desig.valueOf(\"CMO\")) {\n case CEO -> System.out.println(\"Executive\");\n case CMO -> System.out.println(\"Marketing\");\n case CFO -> System.out.println(\"Finance\");\n case CTO -> System.out.println(\"Technical\");\n default -> System.out.println(\"UnDefined\");\n }\n }\n}\n\n// Result:\n// Marketing","timestamp":"1708565520.0"},{"poster":"supersquax","comment_id":"1136613","content":"A is correct, tested in online compiler.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706695140.0"}],"question_text":"Given:\n//IMG//\nand the code fragment:\n//IMG//\n\nWhat is the result?","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/132545-exam-1z0-829-topic-1-question-33-discussion/"},{"id":"v6pvHrsrvpzUyVOb7UMP","timestamp":"2024-01-11 16:28:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_id":28,"answer_images":[],"answer":"B","choices":{"A":"B A D","B":"D A D","D":"D D D","C":"B A C"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/130861-exam-1z0-829-topic-1-question-34-discussion/","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-829/image33.png"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1704986880.0","content":"the right answer is B.
