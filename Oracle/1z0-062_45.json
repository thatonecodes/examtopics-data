The question tells you an administrator user can login (CREATE SESSION) and can issue SET CONTAINER commands. It also tells you it is a CDB and that the multi-threaded architecture is disabled. That means OS authentication will work. So D is correct. As long as TCP/IP is configured, then using EZ Connect would work, so C is correct. Assuming thereâ€™s a listener and a tnsnames.ora file correctly configured would make E correct. Since the connection is to the ROOT container, that immediately eliminates any answer referencing LOCAL users because ROOT cannot have any LOCAL users. SELECT DISTINCT(COMMON) from DBA_USERS returns YES in CDB$ROOT. Further evidence of COMMON only users in root is provided if you attempt to create a local user in CDB$ROOT (i.e. a user without the C## prefix). Oracle returns an error if you attempt it. So, that eliminates B and F, leaving B as the fourth choice. \n\nAnswer: ACDE\n\nLink for reference: https://www.thegeekdiary.com/oracle-12c-new-feature-multi-threaded-architecture-of-processes/","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"139964"}]},{"id":"eEiNvGLoAGpXm5jZ1sqN","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02261/0004400001.jpg"],"answer":"C","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"423153","timestamp":"1628666580.0","content":"Answer C \nEven with this parameter specified, there is still redo logging for other operations of Oracle Data Pump.
