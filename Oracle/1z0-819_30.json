After atomic operation we can see another value without the happens-before relationship (see Java Memory Model).\nTo avoid data inconsistency we can use synchronized statements or atomic operator like AtomicInteger.\nB Failed\nthe use of volatile variables are limited, in non atomic operations (auto increment)\nE.
