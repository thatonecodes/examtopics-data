However, the number of I/O server processes used by Recovery Manager is set to 4 only if asynchronous I/O is disabled (either your platform does not support asynchronous I/O or disk_asynch_io is set to false).\n\nTypically, I/O server processes are used to simulate asynchronous I/O on platforms that do not support asynchronous I/O or that implement it inefficiently. However, you can use I/O server processes even when asynchronous I/O is being used. In that case the I/O server processes will use asynchronous I/O.\n\nI/O server processes are also useful in database environments with very large I/O throughput, even if asynchronous I/O is enabled.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"147948","comments":[{"poster":"SimoneF","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"347205","content":"Based on what you reported, F is wrong: \n\"the number of I/O server processes used by Recovery Manager is set to 4 only if asynchronous I/O is disabled\"\n\nIt's true that afterwards it states that multiple I/O servers can be used even with asynch_io is enabled but it sounds more of an indication on the DB performance: since we're talking about a backup, I'm inclined to think that the impossibility to use more slaves for recovery manager makes the parameter influent on the backup only when asynch I/O is disabled.\n\nPlus, obviously, F wouldn't make B false and I think D is quite certainly right, so I wouldn't find a way to restrict the right answers to three...","timestamp":"1667337480.0"}],"timestamp":"1643630760.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"BCF is right ans","poster":"rajnishsg","timestamp":"1643127480.0","comment_id":"143476"}],"answer_ET":"BCD"},{"id":"mUNrophuCrTzIbchsCGI","question_id":110,"answer_ET":"AC","isMC":true,"answer":"AC","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03747/0002100001.png"],"exam_id":381,"choices":{"B":"The inserts on USER1.EMP were committed when the session inserted a row into USER2.DEPT.","C":"The insert on USER2.DEPT fails because of the active transaction in the parent container.","A":"The inserts on USER1.EMP remain uncommitted when the session connected to PDB2.","E":"The inserts on USER1.EMP were rolled back when the session connected to PDB2.","G":"The inserts on USER1.EMP were committed when the session connected to PDB2.","D":"The insert on USER2.DEPT is a recursive autonomous transaction by the child session and is committed.","F":"The insert on USER2.DEPT is uncommitted."},"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["AC (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/22291-exam-1z0-083-topic-1-question-34-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1591434360,"timestamp":"2020-06-06 11:06:00","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"115354","upvote_count":"25","timestamp":"1592725980.0","content":"other session to check any transaction \n\nVersion 19.5.0.0.0\n\nSQL>\nSQL> alter session set container=ELC20MIG;\n\nSession altered.\n\nSQL> select * from user1.emp;\n\nno rows selected\n\ncorrect answer is A & C","poster":"you1234"},{"comment_id":"115351","poster":"you1234","content":"tested in 19c. \n\ncorrect answer is A & C","timestamp":"1592725800.0","upvote_count":"17"},{"poster":"df404e2","timestamp":"1730908860.0","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nInstead of my previous comment, F is FALSE.
