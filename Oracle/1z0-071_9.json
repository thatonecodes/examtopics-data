Multitable INSERT statements can insert each computed row into more than one table. This is achieved by specifying multiple INTO clauses in the INSERT statement, each corresponding to a different table. Here's an example:\nINSERT ALL INTO table1 (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2) INTO table2 (column3, column4) VALUES (value3, value4) SELECT * FROM source_table;\nIn this example, the computed rows from the source_table are inserted into both table1 and table2.\nC. Multitable INSERT statements can be performed on external tables using SQL*Loader. External tables allow you to access data in external files as if it were in a regular database table. Here's an example:\nINSERT ALL INTO table1 (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2) INTO table2 (column3, column4) VALUES (value3, value4) SELECT * FROM external_table;\nIn this example, the data from the external_table is inserted into both table1 and table2.\nF.
