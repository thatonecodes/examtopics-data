Disk groups that contain Oracle Clusterware files (OCR and voting files) have a higher minimum number of failure groups than other disk groups because the voting files are stored in quorum failure groups. A quorum failure group ensures that a quorum of the specified failure groups are available and is used to determine if the disk group can be mounted if there is a loss of one or more failure groups.\n\nE: The Installer permits the creation of a disk group for use by the voting disks and OCR file is true.\nThe Oracle Universal Installer can be used to install Oracle Clusterware, which can put the Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) and the voting files on Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM). The installer provides the option to automatically mirror OCR. Also, the Grid Infrastructure Management Repository can be created in its own disk group during installation of Oracle Grid Infrastructure.","timestamp":"1737015060.0"},{"poster":"217972f","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB but NOT for ASM Instance.
