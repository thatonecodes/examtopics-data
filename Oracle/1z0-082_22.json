INTERSECT returns rows common to both sides of the compound query\nE. INTERSECT ignores NULLs\n\nExplanation:\nD. INTERSECT returns rows common to both sides of the compound query:\n\nThe INTERSECT operator returns only the rows that are present in both queries (i.e., rows common to both result sets). If a row exists in one query's result but not the other, it will not appear in the INTERSECT result.\nE. INTERSECT ignores NULLs:\n\nINTERSECT treats NULL values as equal when comparing rows, which means if two rows contain NULL in the same position, they are considered identical for the purpose of intersection.
