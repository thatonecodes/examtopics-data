The database shuts down immediately when any of the multiplexed control files become inaccessible. Also, the database reports an error if you try to start it without a valid control file at each location specified in the CONTROL_FILES initialization parameter.\n\nLoss of some but not all copies of your control file does not require you to restore a control file from backup. If at least one control file remains intact, then you can either copy an intact copy of the control file over the damaged or missing control file, or update the initialization parameter file so that it does not refer to the damaged or missing control file. After the CONTROL_FILES parameter references only present, intact copies of the control file, you can restart your database.\n\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/BRADV/rcmcomre.htm#BRADV89763","timestamp":"1597987560.0","poster":"dancymonkey","upvote_count":"9","comment_id":"162706","comments":[{"poster":"hggz","comment_id":"166125","upvote_count":"3","content":"I'm agree with D.","timestamp":"1598373240.0"},{"comment_id":"556910","content":"Agree, D is correct.","poster":"NorwayOracle","timestamp":"1645898220.0","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"timestamp":"1568764860.0","poster":"rcgenilo27","comment_id":"11484","comments":[{"comment_id":"332924","content":"If you just copy the other controlfile to the duplexed controlfile using cp command without shutting down the instance, then when you shutdown instance or switch redo log or archive redo log, instance will crash.
