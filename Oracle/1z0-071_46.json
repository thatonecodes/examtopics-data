Option A is true. A full outer join returns both matched rows and unmatched rows from the joined tables. Matched rows are those that satisfy the join condition, while unmatched rows are those that do not have a matching row in the other table.\n\nB. Option B is true. Outer joins can be used when there are multiple join conditions on two tables. This allows for more complex join conditions and provides flexibility in joining tables based on multiple criteria.\n\nF. Option F is true. An inner join returns only the matched rows from the joined tables. It filters out the unmatched rows, resulting in a result set that contains only the rows that satisfy the join condition.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"zouve"},{"timestamp":"1694706720.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Eltelwany","comments":[],"comment_id":"839099","content":"What exactly is the Oracle syntax here?"},{"poster":"MoreC","content":"QUESTION\nUNMATCHED COLUMN ARE THEY NOT PRODUCED BY LEFT AND RIGHT OUTER JOINS","comments":[{"content":"E states that ONLY unmatched rows are found, and matched rows are not in the output.
