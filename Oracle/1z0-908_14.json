There could be both a 2 node and 3 node group replication still running, so shutting down group replication and diagnosing the issue is recommended. In a situation where there is a network partition, the remaining nodes are not able to tell if the unreachable servers have crashed or whether a network partition has isolated these nodes alone and therefore the group cannot be reconfigured automatically1. This could potentially lead to both a 2 node and 3 node group replication still running.\nE. A manual intervention to force group members to be only the working two instances is required. When a majority of group members is lost, the group is unable to progress and blocks because it cannot secure majority or quorum1. In this case, manual intervention may be required to reconfigure the group with only the working instances.\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication-network-partitioning.html","timestamp":"1713299160.0","comment_id":"1045248"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1038966","poster":"marklv","timestamp":"1712692020.0","content":"D, the 3 unreachable nodes could be together in a group\nE, If you want to up nodes in a cluster, you need to remove the other 3"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1696880820,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"DE"},{"id":"VCJBC8y4zPSVjNUl7c0l","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"JanithJayawardena","timestamp":"1739721240.0","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nWhy focus on QN = 5?\nIt has the highest average latency (21.03 s), meaning it is the slowest-running query.\nEven though it executes only once, it takes too long and could be causing a bottleneck.\nWhy focus on QN = 4?\nIt has the second-highest average latency (10.32 s), which is still significant.\nIt has higher execution count (200) than QN = 5, meaning it might be slowing down the system more frequently.\nWhy not the other options?\nQN = 3: Though it has 120.24 ms lock latency, its execution time (523.32 ms) is much lower than QN = 4 and 5.\nQN = 1: Has a high execution count (381,268) but low average latency (31.44 ms).
