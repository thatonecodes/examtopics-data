The DDL log is created only for the RDBMS component and only if the ENABLE_DDL_LOGGING initialization parameter is set to true. When this parameter is set to false, DDL statements are not included in any log.\n\nThe DDL log contains one log record for each DDL statement issued by the database. The DDL log is included in IPS incident packages.\n\nThere are two DDL logs that contain the same information. One is an XML file, and the other is a text file. The DDL log is stored in the log/ddl subdirectory of the ADR home."},{"content":"Correct Answer: BC","timestamp":"1611661500.0","comment_id":"276882","poster":"jobao","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"id":"EEQDasYGhYFA6OdaTcAA","exam_id":373,"answer":"ACE","answer_ET":"ACE","unix_timestamp":1583590920,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2020-03-07 15:22:00","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A database is open READ WRITE and the instance has multiple sessions some of which have active transactions.\nYou execute this command:\nSQL> ALTER SYSTEM ENABLE RESTRICTED SESSION;\nWhich three are true about the active transactions?
