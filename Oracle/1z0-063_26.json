When you unplug a PDB from a CDB, the unplugged PDB is in mounted mode. The unplug operation makes some changes in the PDB's data files to record, for example, that the PDB was successfully unplugged. Because it is still part of the CDB, the unplugged PDB is included in an RMAN backup of the entire CDB. Such a backup provides a convenient way to archive the unplugged PDB in case it is needed in the future.","timestamp":"1591602120.0","comments":[{"content":"AD is correct doesn't mean AC is not correct.
