Online Table Redefinition.","timestamp":"1663761000.0","poster":"sela","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"* Oracle Database provides a mechanism to make table structure modifications without significantly affecting the availability of the table. The mechanism is called online table redefinition. Redefining tables online provides a substantial increase in availability compared to traditional methods of redefining tables.\n* To redefine a table online:\nChoose the redefinition method: by key or by rowid\n* By keySelect a primary key or pseudo-primary key to use for the redefinition. Pseudo-primary keys are unique keys with all component columns having NOT\nNULL constraints. For this method, the versions of the tables before and after redefinition should have the same primary key columns. This is the preferred and default method of redefinition.\n* By rowidUse this method if no key is available. In this method, a hidden column named M_ROW$$ is added to the post-redefined version of the table. It is recommended that this column be dropped or marked as unused after the redefinition is complete. If COMPATIBLE is set to 10.2.0 or higher, the final phase of redefinition automatically sets this column unused. You can then use the ALTER TABLE ... DROP UNUSED COLUMNS statement to drop it.\nYou cannot use this method on index-organized tables.\nNote:\n* When you rebuild an index, you use an existing index as the data source. Creating an index in this manner enables you to change storage characteristics or move to a new tablespace. Rebuilding an index based on an existing data source removes intra-block fragmentation. Compared to dropping the index and using the CREATE INDEX statement, re-creating an existing index offers better performance.\nIncorrect:\nNot E: Edition-based redefinition enables you to upgrade the database component of an application while it is in use, thereby minimizing or eliminating down time.","exam_id":373,"isMC":true,"question_text":"You are the DBA supporting an Oracle 11g Release 2 database and wish to move a table containing several DATE, CHAR, VARCHAR2, and NUMBER data types, and the tables indexes, to another tablespace.\nThe table does not have a primary key and is used by an OLTP application.\nWhich technique will move the table and indexes while maintaining the highest level of availability to the application?","timestamp":"2022-09-21 13:50:00","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":[],"question_id":206,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/83073-exam-1z0-062-topic-1-question-39-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1663761000},{"id":"OGxFwaU14GNxdPoOUXkr","isMC":true,"question_text":"What happens if a maintenance window closes before a job that collects optimizer statistics completes?","exam_id":373,"answers_community":[],"answer":"D","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-09-02 13:21:00","question_id":207,"unix_timestamp":1599045660,"answer_description":"The stop_on_window_close attribute controls whether the GATHER_STATS_JOB continues when the maintenance window closes.

And it fully complements other options, including Oracle\nReal Application Clusters and Oracle Active Data Guard. An existing database can be simply adopted, with no change, as a pluggable database; and no changes are needed in the other tiers of the application.\nNot D: You can unplug a PDB from one CDB and plug it into a different CDB without altering your schemas or applications. A PDB can be plugged into only one\nCDB at a time.\nnot F:\n* UNDO tablespace can NOT be local and stays on the CDB level.\n* Redo and undo go hand in hand, and so the CDB as a whole has a single undo tablespace per RAC instance."}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":282,"name":"1z0-062","isBeta":false,"provider":"Oracle","id":373,"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":42},"__N_SSP":true}
