The explanation is that CPE is an object in OCI that represents your on-premises router or VPN device that connects to your VCN via a site-to-site VPN. A site-to-site VPN is a secure and encrypted connection between your on-premises network and your VCN over the public internet. To set up a site-to-site VPN, you need to create a CPE object with your router's public IP address and other information, such as vendor and platform. You also need to create a Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) object in your VCN and attach it to your VCN. Then, you need to create an IPSec connection between your CPE and DRG, which will create two redundant VPN tunnels for high availability.","poster":"daws08322","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1719254160.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1703450160,"topic":"1","question_text":"Your DevOps team needs to interconnect the on-premises network to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) resources, such as a managed database that resides in a private subnet.
