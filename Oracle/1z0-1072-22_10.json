Domains can be delegated to OCI DNS via FastConnect partners.\n\nExplanation:\nOCI DNS is a highly scalable, global anycast domain name system network. To make your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure hosted zone accessible through the internet, you must delegate your domain with your domain's registrar. You can use the noted name servers provided by OCI DNS to change your domain's DNS delegation. The registrar's documentation will provide instructions on how to delegate your domain to OCI DNS. FastConnect partners are one of the options to establish a dedicated network connection to OCI, which can include DNS services like OCI DNS [7].\n\nThe other options listed (A, B, C, and D) are not correct based on the information provided from the internet sources and the context of DNS management with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure."}],"answer":"A","question_id":47,"exam_id":385,"answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/115515-exam-1z0-1072-22-topic-1-question-51-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Domains can be delegated to OCI DNS from the OCI Marketplace.","A":"Domains can be delegated to OCI DNS from the Domain Registrar's self-service portal.","E":"Domains can be delegated to OCI DNS via FastConnect partners.","B":"All domains can be retrieved to OCI DNS via DYN.","D":"Domains can be self-delegated to OCI DNS from its own service portal."},"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[]},{"id":"4G26bHfOOvHbbS046i4Q","question_id":48,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/120409-exam-1z0-1072-22-topic-1-question-52-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-09-10 11:55:00","unix_timestamp":1694339700,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1694339700.0","comment_id":"1003890","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMetric-based autoscaling relies on performance metrics that are collected by the Monitoring service, such as CPU utilization \nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/autoscalinginstancepools.htm","upvote_count":"1","poster":"foad"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"Install OCI SDK on all compute instances and create a script that triggers the autoscaling event if there is high memory usage.","B":"Install the monitoring agent on all compute instances, which triggers the autoscaling group.","C":"Configure the autoscaling policy to monitor CPU usage and scale up the number of instances when it meets the threshold.","A":"Configure the autoscaling policy to monitor memory usage and scale up the number of instances when it meets the threshold."},"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","exam_id":385,"question_text":"You are responsible for deploying an application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
