If your region includes multiple availability domains, a public load balancer requires either a regional subnet (recommended) or two availability domain-specific (AD-specific) subnets, each in a separate availability domain. With a regional subnet, the Load Balancing service creates a primary load balancer and a standby load balancer, each in a different availability domain, to ensure accessibility even during an availability domain outage. If you create a load balancer in two AD-specific subnets, one subnet hosts the primary load balancer and the other hosts a standby load balancer. If the primary load balancer fails, the public IP address switches to the secondary load balancer. The service treats the two load balancers as equivalent and you cannot specify which one is \"primary\"."},{"comment_id":"171208","upvote_count":"1","poster":"saaon","timestamp":"1598941260.0","comments":[{"content":"2020 OCI Practice Test?","comment_id":"171958","timestamp":"1599040020.0","poster":"Tittly","upvote_count":"2"}],"content":"A is the answer for 2020 OCI Exam"},{"content":"C is right best practice to have lb in own subnet","comments":[{"comment_id":"152939","content":"\"C. six subnets in total; two subnets in each AD; one for the load balancer and one for the web servers\"\nIf I understood it correctly, you will end up having 3 load balancers.
