To proceed with the transaction with the least interruption, you can re-execute the failed statement in your transaction. Since the privilege issue has been resolved by the administrator's action, re-executing the statement should work without any further issues. This approach minimizes interruption and allows you to continue your transaction without having to roll back the entire transaction or close and reconnect the connection.","comment_id":"982703"}]},{"id":"dntJ9bPWJehd4tu1scQj","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/120131-exam-1z0-908-topic-1-question-140-discussion/","exam_id":405,"timestamp":"2023-09-07 01:10:00","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1001012","poster":"marklv","timestamp":"1725664200.0","content":"B functional index\nC virtual column with index."}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1694041800,"question_id":47,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-908/image41.png","https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-908/image42.png"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Examine this statement, which executes successfully:\n//IMG//\n\nNow examine this query:\n//IMG//\n\nYou must add an index that can reduce the number of rows processed by the query.\nWhich two statements can do this?
