They contain events that describe database changes on the master.\n\nBinary logs in MySQL contain events that describe changes to the data in the master database. These changes can include INSERTs, UPDATEs, DELETEs, and other data modifications.\nE. They are pulled from the master to the slave.\n\nIn asynchronous replication, the slave server typically pulls the binary logs from the master server. The slave connects to the master and requests the binary log events it needs to replicate changes from the master.\nOption A is not entirely accurate because binary logs are not \"pushed\" from the master to the slave; instead, they are made available on the master for the slave to pull.\n\nOption C and D are incorrect because binary logs do not necessarily contain all queries or administrative commands run on the master; they specifically contain events related to database changes, not all SQL queries or administrative commands.","poster":"FelipeK","comment_id":"1025826"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BE\nEach replica that connects to the source requests a copy of the binary log.
