In this example, two `LocalDate` objects are created. The first one is created when `d1` is initialized with the current date using the `now()` method. The second one is created when `d2` is assigned the value of `d1.plusWeeks(3)`. The other method calls, such as `plusDays(1)`, `minusMonths(2)`, and `minusDays(4)` do not create new objects because the `LocalDate` class is immutable and these methods return new objects instead of modifying the existing ones.","timestamp":"1706623920.0","comment_id":"967080","poster":"Stavok"},{"timestamp":"1705174440.0","poster":"belal97","comment_id":"950903","upvote_count":"1","content":"i think 3 (80%) b"}],"choices":{"D":"5","A":"2","C":"4","B":"3"},"exam_id":402,"answer_description":"","question_id":25,"unix_timestamp":1689269640,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-07-13 19:34:00","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/115071-exam-1z0-819-topic-1-question-120-discussion/","answers_community":["D (44%)","A (33%)","B (22%)"],"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"id":402,"name":"1z0-819","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":213,"provider":"Oracle","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":5},"__N_SSP":true}
