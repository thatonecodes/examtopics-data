You need to only identify those items shipped and enter a quantity. You can invoice against open, approved, standard, or blanket purchase orders that are not fully billed. You can enter a credit memo against a fully billed purchase order (use negative quantity amounts to enter a credit memo), as well as invoice against multiple purchase orders. However, the currency and organization of all items on an invoice must be the same. The organization is the entity within the buyerâ€™s company that you are invoicing.\n\nYou can also partially complete an invoice, save it, and submit it later.\n\nAfter you submit an invoice, you cannot change the invoice. If you need to make adjustments to a submitted invoice, you can create a credit memo against the same purchase order items to net out the invoice charges.
