The idea is that failures are detected so for example a service node fails synthetic monitoring or alive checks. Kubernetes stops traffic to the node at the load balancer. Then kubernetes rebuilds the node and replaces the defective one in the cluster. Another real world application is ChaosMonkey which intentionally creates faults in prod (big balls energy) and tests that the system is resilient enough to tolerate this without actual downtime or data loss.","comment_id":"149297","poster":"Adijobi","timestamp":"1596390660.0"},{"poster":"rider","timestamp":"1595942400.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"145824","content":"answer is A"},{"poster":"Ani_1811","timestamp":"1595811060.0","comment_id":"144499","upvote_count":"3","content":"We are continuing\n despite failures so we are not avoiding failure here i go with A"},{"comment_id":"144002","poster":"Jatindra","timestamp":"1595760480.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer : D"},{"poster":"xteuaiporhqdryvabm","content":"It is A .\nResiliency and availability refers to the ability of a system to continue operating, despite the failure or sub-optimal performance of some of its components.\nhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsavailability.htm","timestamp":"1595431620.0","comment_id":"141226","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1595419380.0","comment_id":"141103","content":"Correct Answer is is A","upvote_count":"3","poster":"goodh32"},{"comment_id":"141080","content":"Resiliency is the ability to recover from failures and continue to function.
