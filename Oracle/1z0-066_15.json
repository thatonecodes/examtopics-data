It is not sufficient to use only the control file as the RMAN repository because the primary database will have no knowledge of backups taken on the standby database.\nNote: RMAN uses a recovery catalog to track filenames for all database files in a Data Guard environment. A recovery catalog is a database schema used by\nRMAN to store metadata about one or more Oracle databases. The catalog also records where the online redo logs, standby redo logs, tempfiles, archived redo logs, backup sets, and image copies are created.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SBYDB/rman.htm#SBYDB4853","question_text":"Which three types of backups taken in which situations may be used to perform restore operations to a logical standby database in a Data Guard environment?","timestamp":"2021-05-05 08:23:00","answer":"ADE","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1620195780,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1685748360.0","comment_id":"913085","content":"B, D, E","poster":"JESUSBB"},{"poster":"marpayer","timestamp":"1620195780.0","comment_id":"349997","upvote_count":"2","content":"B,D,E\nOn a logical standby the backups are not interchangeables with the primary"}],"choices":{"C":"backups of control files taken on the primary database if connected to the recovery catalog where the logical standby database is registered","A":"backups of data files taken on the primary database if connected to the recovery catalog where the logical standby database is registered","E":"backups of control files taken on the logical standby database if not connected to a recovery catalog","B":"backups of data files taken on the standby database if connected to the recovery catalog where the logical standby database is registered","D":"backups of data files taken on the logical standby database, if not connected to a recovery catalog"}},{"id":"dtIMJG265PLLbCgGZGbv","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":72,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/108448-exam-1z0-066-topic-1-question-68-discussion/","topic":"1","question_text":"Which two are true about offloading backups to a physical standby database in a Data Guard environment?","choices":{"C":"Backups of the standby control file taken while connected to the catalog where the database is registered, may be used to restore the control file on the primary database.","B":"The standby database cannot be registered in an RMAN catalog if the primary database has not been registered.","A":"The standby database must be registered in an RMAN catalog after the primary database has been registered.","D":"The standby database must be registered in an RMAN catalog before the primary database has been registered."},"unix_timestamp":1683145440,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-03 22:24:00","answer_description":"Only the primary database must be explicitly registered using the REGISTER DATABASE command.
