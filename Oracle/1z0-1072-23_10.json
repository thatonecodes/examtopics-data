Auth Tokens\n\nExplanation:\n\nAuth Tokens: OCI supports authentication using Auth Tokens, which can be used as an alternative to signature-based authentication. Auth Tokens are short-lived and can be generated and used for authentication without exposing the actual user credentials.\nOption B (API Signing Key) is related to signature-based authentication and is not suitable for third-party APIs that do not support OCI's signature-based authentication.\n\nOption C (SSH Key Pair with 2048-bit algorithm) is not typically used for API authentication in OCI.\n\nOption D (OCI Username and Password) is not recommended for security reasons. Using passwords directly in the application poses security risks, and it's generally better to use more secure authentication mechanisms like Auth Tokens.\n\nTherefore, for compatibility with third-party APIs and avoiding signature-based authentication, Auth Tokens are the appropriate choice."}],"question_text":"You are using a custom application with third-party APIs to manage the application and data hosted in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenancy.
