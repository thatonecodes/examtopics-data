The main reason is that if your derived class doesn't call any super method explicitly, JVM will help you invoke a no-argument constructor of your parent class.

By the same token, the no-argument constructor of C is also called.\n\nTry to modify a bit of this question so that the constructor of C accepts some parameters, say public C(int test){ System.out.print(\"C \");}.

A class can have final static methods.\nYes, a class can have final static methods. The final modifier means that the method cannot be overridden in subclasses, and the static modifier means that the method belongs to the class itself, not to instances of the class.\n\nD. A class can have overloaded private constructors.\nYes, a class can have overloaded private constructors. Overloading means having multiple constructors with different parameter lists. Private constructors restrict instantiation outside the class but allow overloading.\n\nE. Fields need to be initialized before use.\nYes, fields in Java need to be initialized before they are used.

While a class with a public static void main(String[] args) method is required to be the entry point for a Java application, not all public classes need to have a main method.\n\nF.
