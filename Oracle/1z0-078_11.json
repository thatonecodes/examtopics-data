TRUE. You can use srvctl relocate pdb -eval or srvctl relocate service -eval to see the potential impact of relocating a PDB or a service associated with a PDB.

False\nOracle ACFS file systems cannot be used for an Oracle base directory or an Oracle Grid Infrastructure home that contains the software for Oracle Clusterware, Oracle ASM, Oracle ACFS, and Oracle ADVM components. However, Oracle ACFS file systems can be configured for use as a home for applications.\nE: A database instance on a node uses an ASM instance as an I/O server when requesting I/O to disk groups. True\nWhen a database instance creates or opens an Oracle ASM file, it communicates those requests to the Oracle ASM instance. The ASM instance then provides file extent map information to the database instance.
