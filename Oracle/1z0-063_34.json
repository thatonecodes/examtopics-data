There is no concept of redo from the PDB perspective, but of course any changes in tablespaces owned by the root container or a user-defined PDB are protected by redo in the normal manner. As a result, you will never perform a PDB-level archived redo log backup, because there are no PDB-specific redo logs. Instead, you will do your archived redo log backups in the normal way from the root container.
