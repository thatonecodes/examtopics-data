Cycle is an interface that is implemented by the MotorCycle class.\nE. Cycle and MotorCycle both implement the Transportation interface.\n\nExplanation:\n\nB. Cycle is an interface that is implemented by the MotorCycle class.\nIf Cycle is an interface and MotorCycle is a class that implements that interface, the code can compile successfully.\n\nE. Cycle and MotorCycle both implement the Transportation interface.\nIf both Cycle and MotorCycle classes implement the Transportation interface, the code can compile successfully.","poster":"dsms","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"dsms","content":"The other options are not valid based on the typical Java class hierarchy and interface implementation rules:\n\nA. MotorCycle is an interface that implements the Cycle class.\nThis is not a valid Java syntax. An interface cannot implement a class.\n\nC. Cycle is an abstract superclass of MotorCycle.\nThis is not the usual relationship between an interface and a class in Java. Interfaces are implemented, and classes are extended.\n\nD. Cycle and MotorCycle both extend the Transportation superclass.\nThis is not mentioned in the code or the question, and there's no indication of a \"Transportation\" superclass.\n\nF. MotorCycle is a superclass of Cycle.\nThis is not the typical relationship between an interface and a class in Java. Interfaces are not superclass/subclass relationships.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"980193","timestamp":"1691951100.0"}],"comment_id":"980192","timestamp":"1691951040.0"},{"poster":"UAK94","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1665771060.0","comment_id":"694946","content":"BC are correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is CD, I'll give you a tip to get questions about inheritance right. Always think that a Father can be a son but a son cannot be a father. With that in mind let's solve the questions:\nA -> Wrong, Motocycle cannot implement Cycle, otherwise the code would be wrong because we call Motocycle type object inside cycle.\nB -> That's correct, Cycle can be an interface and a variable can be an interface and since MotorCycle implements Cycle it is a child of Cycle.\nC -> You are correct, Cycle can be a superclass of Motorcycle.\nD and E -> If they are extending or implementing the same class, they are not parent and child of each other then they are wrong.\nF -> Remember the tip I gave?
