SELECT ROUND(SYSDATE - TO_DATE('01/JANUARY/2019')) FROM DUAL;\n\nThis query works because TO_DATE('01/JANUARY/2019') converts the string to a date, and subtracting it from SYSDATE gives the number of days. The ROUND function rounds the result to the nearest whole number.\nE. SELECT SYSDATE - TO_DATE('01-JANUARY-2019') FROM DUAL;\n\nThis query also works because it correctly converts '01-JANUARY-2019' to a date and subtracts it from SYSDATE, returning the exact number of days as a decimal."},{"comment_id":"1274058","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nC, E is correct","poster":"HUGO2024","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724849580.0"},{"poster":"Misi_Oracle","timestamp":"1716560400.0","comment_id":"1217576","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nC is correct if you change the - operator between sysdate and to_date manually. i think there is a mistake."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"NB196","comment_id":"1143626","timestamp":"1707329220.0","content":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/20180-exam-1z0-071-topic-2-question-44-discussion/"},{"timestamp":"1706103000.0","comment_id":"1130642","poster":"yaya32","content":"Selected Answer: E\nThe only working query is E all of the others are not working.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":["CE (75%)","E (25%)"],"timestamp":"2024-01-24 14:30:00","question_text":"You need to calculate the number of days from 1st January 2019 until today.\n\nDates are stored in the default format of DD-MON-RR.\n\nWhich two queries give the required output?
