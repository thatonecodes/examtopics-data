The JOINUSING clause allows one or more equijoin columns to be explicitly specified in brackets after the USING keyword. This avoids the shortcomings associated with the pure natural join. Many situations demand that tables be joined only on certain columns, and this format caters to this requirement.","question_id":34},{"id":"Yukutdw71J5ptvxnatOn","answer":"D","question_text":"You work as a database administrator at ABC.com.
