They can be applied in-place.\n\nThis statement is not always true as some patches require downtime.\nB. When performing rolling patches, the VIPs for the node being patched are relocated to another node.\n\nThis statement is true. During rolling patches, the Virtual IP addresses (VIPs) are relocated to other nodes to ensure high availability and minimize disruption.\nC.
