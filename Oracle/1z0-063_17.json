The database takes advantage of this feature if it is available. On operating systems that do not support native asynchronous I/O, the database can simulate it with special I/O slave processes that are dedicated to performing I/O on behalf of another process. You can control disk I/O slaves by setting the DBWR_IO_SLAVES parameter to a nonzero value. The database allocates four backup disk I/O slaves for any nonzero value of DBWR_IO_SLAVES. By contrast, tape I/O is always synchronous. For tape I/O, each channel allocated (whether manually or based on a CONFIGURE command) corresponds to a server process, called here a channel process.\n\nIf LARGE_POOL_SIZE is set, then the database attempts to get memory from the large pool.

If a database is registered in both schemas, then UNREGISTER this database from source recovery catalog and execute the IMPORT command again.\nNote: Use the IMPORT CATALOG command to import the metadata from one recovery catalog schema into a different catalog schema.
