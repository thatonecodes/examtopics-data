Execute alter user MTHEO quota unlimited on tablespace DATA;\n\nThis command will grant an unlimited quota to the user MTHEO on the tablespace DATA. You can replace 'unlimited' with a specific value to set a limit on the tablespace quota.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the \"alter tablespace\" command is used to modify the attributes of a tablespace, not to grant tablespace quota to a user.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no syntax for \"alter tablespace for user\" in Oracle Database.\n\nOption C is incorrect because DBMS_CLOUD_ADMIN.GRANT_TABLESPACE_QUOTA is not applicable to Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure.
