You dont have to turn on or off all of the different auidting types individually and as a matter of fact auditing is enabled by default right out of the box. The AUD$ and FGA$ tables have been replaced with one single audit trail table. All of the audit data is now stored in Secure Files table thus improving the overall management aspects of audit data itself.\nB: Further the audit data can also be buffered solving most of the common performance related problems seen on busy environments.\nE: Unified Auditing is able to collect audit data for Fine Grained Audit, RMAN, Data Pump, Label Security, Database Vault and Real Application Security operations.\nNote:\n* Benefits of the Unified Audit Trail\nThe benefits of a unified audit trail are many:\n/ (B) Overall auditing performance is greatly improved. The default mode that unified audit works is Queued Write mode. In this mode, the audit records are batched in SGA queue and is persisted in a periodic way. Because the audit records are written to SGA queue, there is a significant performance improvement.\n/ The unified auditing functionality is always enabled and does not depend on the initialization parameters that were used in previous releases\n/ (A) The audit records, including records from the SYS audit trail, for all the audited components of your Oracle Database installation are placed in one location and in one format, rather than your having to look in different places to find audit trails in varying formats. This consolidated view enables auditors to co-relate audit information from different components. For example, if an error occurred during an INSERT statement, standard auditing can indicate the error number and the SQL that was executed. Oracle Database Vault-specific information can indicate whether this error happened because of a command rule violation or realm violation. Note that there will be two audit records with a distinct AUDIT_TYPE. With this unification in place, SYS audit records appear with AUDIT_TYPE set to\nStandard Audit.\n/ The management and security of the audit trail is also improved by having it in single audit trail.\n/ You can create named audit policies that enable you to audit the supported components listed at the beginning of this section, as well as SYS administrative users. Furthermore, you can build conditions and exclusions into your policies.\n* Oracle Database 12c Unified Auditing enables selective and effective auditing inside the Oracle database using policies and conditions. The new policy based syntax simplifies management of auditing within the database and provides the ability to accelerate auditing based on conditions.\n* The new architecture unifies the existing audit trails into a single audit trail, enabling simplified management and increasing the security of audit data generated by the database.","isMC":true,"answer":"BDE","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/16092-exam-1z0-062-topic-1-question-149-discussion/","timestamp":"2020-03-10 14:08:00"},{"id":"CiK0xdbX2Sdzxoo2MTIX","exam_id":373,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":42,"timestamp":"2020-02-12 08:32:00","isMC":true,"answer":"B","answers_community":[],"question_text":"Which action takes place when a file checkpoint occurs?","choices":{"D":"The Log Writer process (LGWR) writes all redo entries in the log buffer to online redo log files.","A":"The checkpoint position is advanced in the checkpoint queue.","C":"The Database Writer process (DBWn) writes all dirty buffers in the buffer cache to data files.","B":"All buffers for a checkpointed file that were modified before a specific SCN are written to disk by DBWn and the SCN is stored in the control file."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/13886-exam-1z0-062-topic-1-question-15-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1581492720,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"592348","content":"I will try C.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1650972240.0","poster":"jackymak"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"B is correct","comments":[{"timestamp":"1659696000.0","content":"please can i get your email, got some question on this exam","poster":"Dragon67","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"642922"}],"poster":"_Cobra_","comment_id":"592212","timestamp":"1650960420.0"},{"timestamp":"1622608200.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"exampro46","content":"FILE LEVEL CHECKPOINT\nFile level checkpoint is writing dirty blocks associated with set of files belonging to a tablespace.
