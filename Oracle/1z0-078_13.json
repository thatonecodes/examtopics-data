It will shut down one of the running ASM instances, likely the least loaded one, to reach the desired count.

When using GNS and DHCP, Oracle Clusterware configures the VIP addresses for the SCAN name. The SCAN VIPs are obtained from the DHCP server. The SCAN addresses resolve to the cluster, rather than to a node address in the cluster, which allows nodes to be added to or removed from the cluster without affecting the SCAN address configuration.\n•\nNode VIPs. When using GNS, each node in the cluster is assigned a virtual IP (VIP) address, which is obtained from the DHCP server. These node VIPs provide a stable address for clients to connect to the database, and can failover to another node if a node fails.\nAs a result, B & E are ture.","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1343348","content":"Updated.
