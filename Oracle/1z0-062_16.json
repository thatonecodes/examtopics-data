Now, to test whether user02 can insert into the table, you have to connect without SYSDBA admin privilege (i.e conn user02/us123) \n\nSince user02 was not granted the insert object privilege on the MYTAB table owned by sys, the user user02 cannot insert rows into the table. \n\nSome people are most likely confirming B because they are attempting the insert without switching from the SYS user to USER02.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Ray_gk","comment_id":"587294","timestamp":"1650208560.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"587314","upvote_count":"2","content":"I would also add that it is not advisable to grant users privileges on objects in the system tablespace.
