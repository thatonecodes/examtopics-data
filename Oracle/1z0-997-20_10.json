This gives you an early warning if your spending increases and you're at risk of getting an overage.\n Use compartments primarily as an access-control mechanism, but consider that you can also see cost per compartment. In practice, many enterprise customers set up one compartment per department, and having one compartment per department works well for cross-charging.\n Use cost-tracking tags (like cost-center) to allocate cost in more granular ways. We have recently rolled out tag defaults to make it easier to tag resources.\n Enable monitoring on all resources. You can merge monitoring data with cost data to gain powerful insights on how to improve resource utilization. \n Use the usage report to analyze costs and drive custom solutions.\n\nThis clearly shows A,B & C are the correct options","poster":"EaglEyeZ","comment_id":"515491","comments":[{"comment_id":"521007","timestamp":"1641836640.0","content":"Sure it is the answer is ABC","poster":"Tanat","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"no for A: \"This gives you an early warning if your spending increases and you're at risk of getting an overage.\".
