A primary database\n2. A Physical Standby Database\n3. A Snapshot Standby Database\nYou must meet these requirements:\n1. Primary database availability should not be compromised by the availability of the standby databases.\n2. Under normal operations, transactions executed on the primary database should not commit before redo is written to disk on the primary database and on at least one standby database.\nWhich redo transport mode, and which protection mode should you configure to meet these requirements?","answer_description":"The Maximum Availability protection mode provides the highest level of data protection that is possible without compromising the availability of a primary database. Transactions do not commit until all redo data needed to recover those transactions has been written to the online redo log and to at least one synchronized standby database. If the primary database cannot write its redo stream to at least one synchronized standby database, it operates as if it were in maximum performance mode to preserve primary database availability until it is again able to write its redo stream to a synchronized standby database.\nThis mode ensures that no data loss will occur if the primary database fails, but only if a second fault does not prevent a complete set of redo data from being sent from the primary database to at least one standby database.\nWhen a transport is performed using SYNC/AFFIRM, the primary performs write operations and waits for acknowledgment that the redo has been transmitted synchronously to the physical standby and written to disk. A SYNC/AFFIRM transport provides an additional protection benefit at the expense of a performance impact caused by the time required to complete the I/O to the standby redo log.\nIncorrect Answers:\nD: In the case of SYNC/NOAFFIRM, in which there is no check that data has been written to disk on the standby, there may be some data loss.\nA, B: The Maximum Protection mode ensures that zero data loss occurs if a primary database fails. To provide this level of protection, the redo data needed to recover a transaction must be written to both the online redo log and to at least one synchronized standby database before the transaction commits. To ensure that data loss cannot occur, the primary database will shut down, rather than continue processing transactions, if it cannot write its redo stream to at least one synchronized standby database.\nBecause this data protection mode prioritizes data protection over primary database availability, Oracle recommends that a minimum of two standby databases be used to protect a primary database that runs in maximum protection mode to prevent a single standby database failure from causing the primary database to shut down.\nE: The Maximum Performance protection mode provides the highest level of data protection that is possible without affecting the performance of a primary database. This is accomplished by allowing transactions to commit as soon as all redo data generated by those transactions has been written to the online log.\nRedo data is also written to one or more standby databases, but this is done asynchronously with respect to transaction commitment, so primary database performance is unaffected by delays in writing redo data to the standby database(s).\nThis protection mode offers slightly less data protection than maximum availability mode and has minimal impact on primary database performance.\nThis is the default protection mode.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28294/protection.htm","topic":"1","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1685748540},{"id":"BODynfG0TslBzDH5Iknj","unix_timestamp":1628240940,"question_id":80,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-08-06 11:09:00","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"ACFG","choices":{"A":"They can be used to skip execution of DML triggers on a table while allowing the DML to execute.","D":"They can be used to skip all SQL statements executed on a specific pluggable database (PDB) within a standby multitenant container database (CDB).","F":"They can be used to skip ALTER TABLE commands on a specific tables.","B":"They can be used to skip ALTER SYSTEM and ALTER DATABASE commands.","C":"They can be used to stop SQL apply if it encounters an error.","E":"They can only be used to skip DML statements on a table.","G":"They can be used to skip CREATE TABLE commands."},"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/59387-exam-1z0-066-topic-1-question-75-discussion/","exam_id":375,"question_text":"Which four statements are true regarding SQL Apply filters for a logical standby database?","discussion":[{"poster":"Rockfics","timestamp":"1698982380.0","content":"Selected Answer: AFG\nB.
