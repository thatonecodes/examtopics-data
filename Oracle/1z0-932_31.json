A volume group can include both types of volumes, boot volumes, which are the system disks for your Compute instances, and block volumes for your data storage. You can use volume groups to create volume group backups and clones that are pointin-time and crash-consistent.\nThis simplifies the process to create time-consistent backups of running enterprise applications that span multiple storage volumes across multiple instances. You can then restore an entire group of volumes from a volume group backup.\nTo create a backup of the volume group\nOpen the navigation menu. Under Core Infrastructure, go to Block Storage and click Volumes Groups. In the Volume Groups list, click Create Volume Group Backup in the Actions menu for the volume group you want to create a backup for.","poster":"myassin81","comment_id":"135685","timestamp":"1594814520.0","upvote_count":"7"},{"content":"correct is D To create a backup of the volume group\nOpen the navigation menu.
