You can put an alternating sequence by moving the increment, for example, if you want to jump from 2 to 2 places, in the for increment field you put \"var = var +2\" that will compile. About the correct sequence any for does.\n* Enchanced for -> You can only loop through the elements in the order of entry, you can't do it in reverse or alternately, as in enchanced for you access each element of the collection scalable (from smallest to largest in position).","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"689633","poster":"iSnover","comments":[{"poster":"iSnover","content":"With these concepts, let's answer the questions:\nA -> Wrong, you cannot implement option 1 (reverse entry) and 3 (alternaty entry) in an enchanced for\nB -> Correct, you can use options 1,2,3 and a standard for\nC -> Wrong, you can implement option 2 (normal entry) and 3 (alternaty entry) in a Standard for\nD -> Correct, you can implement option 2 (normal entry) in an enchanced for\nAnd -> Incorrect, you can implement option 3 (alternaty entry) in a Standard for","comment_id":"689634","timestamp":"1665257040.0","upvote_count":"1"}]}],"choices":{"A":"Requirements 1, 2, and 3 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop.","B":"Requirements 1, 2, and 3 can be implemented by using the standard for loop.","E":"Requirement 3 CANNOT be implemented by using either the enhanced for loop or the standard for loop.","D":"Requirement 2 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop.","C":"Requirements 2 and 3 CANNOT be implemented by using the standard for loop."},"answer_ET":"BD","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/84783-exam-1z0-808-topic-1-question-165-discussion/","question_id":73,"unix_timestamp":1665257040,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04353/0017700001.png"]},{"id":"kCIsDye96VEb2pE4yz3C","answer":"D","exam_id":399,"isMC":false,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04353/0017900001.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/84784-exam-1z0-808-topic-1-question-166-discussion/","discussion":[{"comments":[{"poster":"DriftKing","upvote_count":"2","content":"Here \"Character\" belongs to wrapper class and is not a primitive data type \"char\".
