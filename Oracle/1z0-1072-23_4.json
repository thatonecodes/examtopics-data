Two of the subnets contain application servers and the third subnet contains a DB System. The application requires a shared file system, therefore you have provisioned one using the file storage service (FSS).\nYou have also created the corresponding mount target in one of the application subnets. The VCN security lists are properly configured so that the application servers can access FSS. The security team changed the settings for the DB System to have read-only access to the file system. However, when they test it, they are unable to access FSS.\nHow would you allow access to FSS?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nNFS Export Options: These control access to the file system at the NFS protocol level. You can specify which subnets or IP ranges can access the file system and what level of access (read, write) they have.\nBy creating an NFS export option that grants read-only access to the specific CIDR range of the DB System subnet, you explicitly allow the DB System to access the FSS with the necessary permissions.","comment_id":"1221974","timestamp":"1732955160.0","poster":"partnerexams","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Mopo","timestamp":"1726686180.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1176816","content":"Selected Answer: A\nNFS export options define access permissions for NFS clients accessing the file system.
