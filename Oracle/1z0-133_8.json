File domain (seperti konfigurasi, skrip, dll.) dapat direkonstruksi dengan alat ini.\n\nNamun, data LDAP tertanam (embedded LDAP) yang digunakan untuk menyimpan informasi keamanan (seperti pengguna, grup, kebijakan) tidak disertakan dalam file JAR hasil pack. Jika domain menggunakan LDAP tertanam, data ini harus dicadangkan secara terpisah.\n\nOpsi lain seperti aplikasi yang di-deploy (opsi C) tidak relevan karena file aplikasi biasanya disimpan di luar direktori domain dan tidak tergantung pada pack/unpack.
