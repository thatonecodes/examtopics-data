SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE MOD(quantity, 10) = 0;\n\nThis is correct. The MOD function returns the remainder of a division operation. If MOD(quantity, 10) equals 0, it means that quantity is evenly divisible by 10, i.e., quantity is a multiple of 10.\nC. SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE FLOOR(quantity / 10) = TRUNC(quantity / 10);\n\nThis is correct. FLOOR(quantity / 10) and TRUNC(quantity / 10) will both give the same result when quantity is a multiple of 10, because the division of a multiple of 10 by 10 will always be an integer. This ensures that quantity is a multiple of 10.","poster":"Bissto","comment_id":"1276124","timestamp":"1725202440.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1128426","timestamp":"1705911360.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct for sure, I think that B has a typo.","poster":"yaya32"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1108593","timestamp":"1703846460.0","content":"B has a typo , should be = 0","poster":"benjamin2023"},{"comment_id":"1002638","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nBD is correct","timestamp":"1694194680.0","poster":"XTIMON"},{"poster":"Izzicertificacion","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC, D IS CORRECT","comment_id":"974337","timestamp":"1691374020.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"benjamin2023","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1108600","timestamp":"1703846700.0","content":"C is wrong, it just returns all rows."}]}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-071/image81.png"],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE FLOOR(quantity / 10) = TRUNC(quantity / 10);","D":"SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE quantity = TRUNC(quantity, -1);","E":"SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE quantity = ROUND(quantity, 1);","B":"SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE MOD(quantity, 10) - 0;","A":"SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE quantity / 10 - TRUNC(quantity"},"answer":"BD","question_id":78,"timestamp":"2023-08-07 04:07:00","answer_ET":"BD","exam_id":378,"unix_timestamp":1691374020,"answers_community":["BD (40%)","CD (20%)","D (20%)","Other"],"answer_description":""},{"id":"bJj8zqwcje80lp3shWSh","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1662276180,"question_text":"Which is true about the ROUND, TRUNC and MOD functions?","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1720412580.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"769122","poster":"dexdinh91","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBoth return 0"},{"comment_id":"659030","content":"C is correct\nBoth return 0","poster":"Artur1991","timestamp":"1709544180.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"choices":{"D":"ROUND(MOD(25,3),-1) and TRUNC(MOD(25,3),-1) are both valid but give different results.","A":"TRUNC(MOD(25,3),-1) is invalid.","B":"ROUND(MOD(25,3),-1) is invalid.","C":"ROUND(MOD(25,3),-1) and TRUNC(MOD(25,3),-1) are both valid and give the same result."},"question_id":79,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/79980-exam-1z0-071-topic-1-question-17-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-09-04 09:23:00","exam_id":378,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1"},{"id":"bKRzMRY0h8hWHKR5g0vI","timestamp":"2023-03-29 15:29:00","isMC":true,"answer":"AB","question_text":"Which two statements are true about indexes and their administration in an Oracle database?

No, that statement is not necessarily true.
