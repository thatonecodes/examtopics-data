It evaluates whether a column or expression of any data type is null or not.\n5-6 The NVL function\\\nIf the first term is not null, the second parameter is returned, else the third parameter is returned. Recall that the NVL function is different since it returns the original term if it is not null. The NVL2 function takes three mandatory parameters. Its syntax is NVL2(original, ifnotnull, ifnull), where original represents the term being tested. Ifnotnull is returned if original is not null, and ifnull is returned if original is null. The data types of the ifnotnull and ifnull parameters must be compatible, and they cannot be of type LONG.\nThey must either be of the same type, or it must be possible to convert ifnull to the type of the ifnotnull parameter.
