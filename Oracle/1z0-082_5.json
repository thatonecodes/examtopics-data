If you started up the database using a parameter file (pfile), then this is the only scope you can specify.\n\n SPFILE indicates that the change is made in the server parameter file.

A table is joined to itself to compare rows in the same table. The join condition would have to be an equijoin. If it is not there is another name for the join and it's called non equijoins. I guess a self non equijoin would be possible but this goes against the point I'm making. A self join is joining the same table to itself ON a condition and that is why it has to be an equijoin.\n\nFor example the left outer joined table would show all the rows from the left and unmatched rows on the right filled with nulls where there was no matches. I don't think in self joins there would be any unmatched rows due to a missing column on the right.\n\nAn outer self join is not possible because it's the same table your joining.
