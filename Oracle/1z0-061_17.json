Locks are acquired automatically by Oracle when a\nDML statement is executed; no user intervention or action is needed. Oracle uses the\nlowest level of restrictiveness when locking data for DML statements—only the rows\naffected by the DML operation are locked.\nLocks are held for the duration of the transaction. A commit or rollback will release all\nthe locks. There are two types of locks: explicit and implicit.\nThe locks acquired by Oracle automatically when DML operations are performed are\ncalled implicit locks. There is no implicit lock for SELECT statements.\nIf the user locks data manually, it is called explicit locking. The LOCK TABLE statement\nand SELECT…FOR UPDATE statements are used for explicitly locking the data."}],"content":"I think BDE is correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"13313"},{"poster":"duongvietnam","content":"E is correct answer","comments":[],"comment_id":"9849","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1567753560.0"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":82,"choices":{"E":"After it is enforced by a SELECT statement, no other query can access the same rows until a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is issued.","A":"It locks only the columns specified in the SELECT list.","D":"It can be used in SELECT statements that are based on a single or multiple tables.","C":"It can be used only in SELECT statements that are based on a single table.","B":"It locks the rows that satisfy the condition in the SELECT statement."},"answer_ET":"BD","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"answer":"BD","exam_id":372,"topic":"4","unix_timestamp":1567753560,"answer_description":"FOR UPDATE Clause in a SELECT Statement\nLocks the rows in the EMPLOYEES table where job_id is SA_REP.\nLock is released only when you issue a ROLLBACK or a COMMIT.\nIf the SELECT statement attempts to lock a row that is locked by another user, the database waits until the row is available, and then returns the results of the\nSELECT statement.\nFOR UPDATE Clause in a SELECT Statement\nWhen you issue a SELECT statement against the database to query some records, no locks are placed on the selected rows. In general, this is required because the number of records locked at any given time is (by default) kept to the absolute minimum: only those records that have been changed but not yet committed are locked. Even then, others will be able to read those records as they appeared before the change (the \"before image\" of the data). There are times, however, when you may want to lock a set of records even before you change them in your program.\nOracle offers the FOR UPDATE clause of the SELECT statement to perform this locking. When you issue a SELECT...FOR UPDATE statement, the relational database management system (RDBMS) automatically obtains exclusive row-level locks on all the rows identified by the SELECT statement, thereby holding the records \"for your changes only.\" No one else will be able to change any of these records until you perform a ROLLBACK or a COMMIT.\nYou can append the optional keyword NOWAIT to the FOR UPDATE clause to tell the Oracle server not to wait if the table has been locked by another user. In this case, control will be returned immediately to your program or to your SQL Developer environment so that you can perform other work, or simply wait for a period of time before trying again. Without the NOWAIT clause, your process will block until the table is available, when the locks are released by the other user through the issue of a COMMIT or a ROLLBACK command.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/4780-exam-1z0-061-topic-4-question-78-discussion/","timestamp":"2019-09-06 09:06:00","question_text":"Which statements are true regarding the FOR UPDATE clause in a SELECT statement?
