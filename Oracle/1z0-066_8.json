Therefore, on a far sync instance there is no need to copy data files or restore data files from a backup. Once the far sync instance has been created, the configuration is modified to send redo synchronously from the primary database to the far sync instance in Maximum Availability mode and the far sync instance then forwards the redo asynchronously in real time.\nD: Creating and Configuring a Far Sync Instance\nTake the following steps to create a far sync instance:\n1. Create the control file for the far sync instance.\n2. Create a parameter file (PFILE) from the server parameter file (SPFILE) used by the primary database.\n3. Create a server parameter file (spfile) from the edited parameter file (pfile) to facilitate any subsequent changes to parameter values.\n4. Use an operating system copy utility to copy the far sync instance control file created in Step 1 and the server parameter file (spfile) created in Step 3 from the primary system to the appropriate locations on the far sync instance system.\n5.
