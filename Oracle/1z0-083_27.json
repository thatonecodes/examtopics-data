Container maps partition data in application PDBs based on a commonly-used column.\n-The map object is the partitioned table. The names of the partitions in the map table match the names of the application PDBs in the application container. The metadata-linked object is not physically partitioned at the table level, but it can be queried using the partitioning strategy used by the container map.\n-In addition, you can enable the CONTAINERS_DEFAULT attribute for a table or view in an application root. When this attribute is enabled, the CONTAINERS clause is used for queries and DML statements on the database object by default, and the CONTAINERS clause does not need to be specified in the SQL statements. To enable the CONTAINERS_DEFAULT attribute for a table or view in an application root, run the an ALTER TABLE or ALTER VIEW statement with the ENABLE CONTAINERS_DEFAULT clause.\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/multi/administering-application-containers-with-sql-plus.html#GUID-AAF93A02-7C70-4024-8758-E351C213543E","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"i mean C and F","timestamp":"1593185460.0","comment_id":"120662","poster":"veginha"}],"timestamp":"1593185400.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"120660","poster":"veginha"}],"timestamp":"2020-06-26 17:30:00","exam_id":381,"question_text":"Your SALES_ROOT application container has two application PDBs.\nThe SALES_APP application has a common table, FIN.REVENUE, in the two PDBs.\nExamine this query and its output:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich two are true?
