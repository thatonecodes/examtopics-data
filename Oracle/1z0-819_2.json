The code s.replace(s.indexOf(\"B\"), s.indexOf(\"C\"), \"Q\") would cause s to be \"AQCD\".\n\nThe replace method of the StringBuilder class replaces the characters in a substring of this sequence with characters in the specified String. The substring begins at the specified start index and extends to the character at index end - 1 or to the end of the sequence if no such character exists.\n\nIn this case, s.indexOf(\"B\") returns 1, which is the start index of the substring to be replaced, and s.indexOf(\"C\") returns 2, which is the end index of the substring to be replaced. So, the character at index 1 (\"B\") is replaced with \"Q\", resulting in \"AQCD\".","timestamp":"1721407380.0","comment_id":"956824","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-819/image155.png"],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/115782-exam-1z0-819-topic-1-question-107-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1689784980,"answer_ET":"C","question_id":10}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"1z0-819","id":402,"provider":"Oracle","numberOfQuestions":213},"currentPage":2},"__N_SSP":true}
