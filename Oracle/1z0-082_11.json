Answer A is almost correct, however function ROUND negatively affects condition cust_credit limit < 1000 for customers with credit ranging from 999.50 to 999.99. Their credit is rounded to 1000 and condition < 1000 removes these customers from query results. So these customers are not shown in final results, thought their credit is below 1000. Initial instruction requesting to show customers with credit below 1000 is not fulfilled. Answer A is false.
