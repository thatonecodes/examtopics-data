With administrator-managed clusters, you manually configure how the cluster resources are deployed and where the workload is managed. Therefore, servers in a server pool that is not managed by a policy set are unaffected by policy changes because the policy set only governs the behavior of managed pools.\nC: true\n Specifically, when using Oracle Database QoS Management, server pools are categorized by setting server pool directive overrides, and the use of CRSCTL commands using the policy and policyset nouns are disabled\nE: true\nCan have different attributes in different policies\nFor example, the MIN_SIZE and MAX_SIZE attributes of a server pool can be modified for different policies within a policy set to accommodate different application demands at different times","poster":"Tunglinfo9","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1251784","timestamp":"1721484960.0","content":"Selected Answer: CDE\nA I think is false because Generic Server pool is created by default and it's not policy-managed.\nB: I think is false because QoS influence the configuration based on performance objectives but administrator may be able to modify","poster":"217972f","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1189240","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712227140.0","poster":"Jaroslav113","content":"I would choose B,C,D."},{"comment_id":"1188368","content":"looks like ABD","timestamp":"1712102820.0","poster":"wiprooracle","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":379,"answer_ET":"ACD"},{"id":"nzaeKAxr1vjE8YtSGSeT","answer_description":"","exam_id":379,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["AD (50%)","AB (50%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/140201-exam-1z0-078-topic-1-question-15-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-05-09 00:07:00","question_id":7,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer":"AD","question_text":"Disk group DGRP1 has these attributes:\n1.

However, Oracle ASM is designed to maintain data availability and integrity even in the event of failures. Transactions may experience temporary interruptions or delays, but they typically do not fail outright unless the failure severely impacts data access.\n\nB is false because In Oracle ASM, the redundancy level of a disk group is not lowered during a failure. Instead, Oracle ASM dynamically adjusts data allocation and mirroring to maintain redundancy even in the presence of failures.\n\nC is false because . Oracle ASM continues to mirror new allocation units across the remaining operational failure group (FG2) to maintain redundancy and data availability.
