When one instance leaves the cluster, the GRD of that instance needs to be redistributed to the surviving nodes. RAC uses an algorithm called lazy remastering to remaster only a minimal number of resources during a reconfiguration.\nD: Using the SHUTDOWN TRANSACTIONAL command with the LOCAL option is useful to shut down a particular Oracle RAC database instance. Transactions on other instances do not block this operation.\nC: Recovery from instance failure is automatic, requiring no DBA intervention. In case of instance failure, a surviving instance can read the redo logs of the failed instance.\nFor example, when using the Oracle Parallel Server, another instance performs instance recovery for the failed instance. In single-instance configurations, Oracle performs crash recovery for a database when the database is restarted, that is, mounted and opened to a new instance. The transition from a mounted state to an open state automatically triggers crash recovery, if necessary.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: After a NORMAL or IMMEDIATE shutdown, instance recovery is not required.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RACAD/admin.htm#RACAD8910"},{"id":"H8eb6pHFuk0WrXHY5wN1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/51056-exam-1z0-068-topic-1-question-54-discussion/","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1619520660,"question_id":47,"timestamp":"2021-04-27 12:51:00","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"ASM files created using an alias name are not OMF files even if OMF is enabled.","D":"Alias names can be stored only in user-defined directories.","C":"ASM files created using an alias name are OMF files even if OMF is not enabled.","B":"Alias file names cannot be used together with templates when creating tablespaces.","E":"ASM files created using an alias name also have a fully qualified name and can be accessed by either name."},"question_text":"Which two statements are true about ASM alias names?","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1729865760.0","content":"According Oracle Docs such as bellow doc, correct answer are A and E.\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/OSTMG/GUID-2D167F11-F77A-4269-967E-5A9F3EF8FE3A.htm#OSTMG94202","poster":"Yoones","comment_id":"467492"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"torynek","timestamp":"1714215060.0","comment_id":"343912","content":"A, E - https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/OSTMG/GUID-2D167F11-F77A-4269-967E-5A9F3EF8FE3A.htm#OSTMG94202"}],"answer_ET":"CE","exam_id":377,"topic":"1","answer":"CE","answer_description":""},{"id":"ggc2PmMpCcMWMABr1E6a","question_id":48,"answer_description":"C: Server pools divide the cluster into logical groups of servers hosting both singleton and uniform applications.
