The development team is testing the use of packaged procedures with containers in a fully serverless environment. Before migrating the existing code to production, the team decides to perform a lift and shift of the monolithic application and code the new features that are essential for serverless microservices.\nYou want to carry out a steady migration to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform, making the new microservice functionalities available while maintaining the monolithic application for all the other activities. You also want to integrate the legacy monolithic application with the new microservices to have a single interface with simplified management for auditing and monitoring while meeting operational and compliance requirements.\nHow can you meet this requirement?","unix_timestamp":1681381920,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorrecting myself. only A is correct","comment_id":"972782","poster":"p55p","timestamp":"1691221080.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1691211540.0","comment_id":"972688","content":"A or C as both means the same.","poster":"p55p"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"A makes more sense.","comment_id":"958787","timestamp":"1689962640.0","poster":"nenoAZ"},{"content":"I think it's A","comment_id":"930277","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1687421400.0","poster":"_danielgurgel"},{"comment_id":"919072","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1686298200.0","poster":"a66030","content":"there is nothing called OCI code repo.
