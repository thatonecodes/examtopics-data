REDO apply on a physical standby database is the capacity that my standby can process the received logs, therefore it will not be affected by the reception delay: the rate at which the standby can process will be the same if the delay is 0 seconds, 1 second or 10 seconds, therefore in my opinion the A is false.\nOn the other hand, a higher rate of generation of REDO in the primary, will necessarily have to increase the rate of application of REDO in standby.\nTherefore I believe that the correct thing is BDE","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"422569","timestamp":"1628584320.0"},{"content":"How it \"* (B) Set Parallel Recovery to Twice the Number of CPUs on One Standby Host\" related to \"B. the number of archiver processes on the standby database\" ?\nI believe right answer must be ADE.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"24936","poster":"Kamaelk","timestamp":"1574914020.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/9246-exam-1z0-066-topic-1-question-77-discussion/","answer_description":"Consider using the following methods to optimize the time it takes to apply redo to physical standby databases.\n* (B) Set Parallel Recovery to Twice the Number of CPUs on One Standby Host\n* (E) During media recovery or Redo Apply, the redo log file is read, and data blocks that require redo application are parsed out. With parallel media recovery, these data blocks are subsequently distributed evenly to all recovery processes to be read into the buffer cache. The default is serial recovery or zero parallelism, which implies that the same recovery process reads the redo, reads the data blocks from disk, and applies the redo changes.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14239/manage_ps.htm#BACHIBGG","exam_id":375,"isMC":true},{"id":"jGFRt9FentWXuHAieJKq","choices":{"C":"The fal_client database initialization parameter for the specified database is updated with the new value.","D":"The broker configuration must be disabled and then enabled to use the new connection property.","E":"The service attribute of the log_archive_dest_n initialization parameter referring to all standby databases is updated with the new value.","A":"The fal_client database initialization parameter on all standby databases is updated with the new value.","B":"The service attribute of the log_archive_dest_n initialization parameter for any database referring to the specified database is updated with the new value."},"timestamp":"2023-03-02 03:04:00","answer_ET":"AB","exam_id":375,"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1677722640,"question_text":"You edit the DGConnectIdentifier database property using the edit database set property DGMGRL command.\nWhich two are effects of this change?","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/101313-exam-1z0-066-topic-1-question-78-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"888926","timestamp":"1683145800.0","content":"Answer: A and C","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JESUSBB"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"826376","timestamp":"1677722640.0","content":"DGConnectIdentifier is define as FAl Server, not Fal Client.","poster":"JorgeZG"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":82,"answer":"AB","answer_description":"B: The DGConnectIdentifier configurable database property specifies the connection identifier the broker uses when making connections to a database.\nThe value of this property is specified in the SERVICE attribute of the LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n parameter when the broker configures redo transport services on the primary database.\nA: The connect identifier for a database must allow all other databases in the configuration to reach it.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e40771/dbpropref.htm#DGBKR870"},{"id":"KmJxc06sOTvA2EFhLT7U","answers_community":["ABC (100%)"],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Dogs will be an enabled logical standby database.","D":"Dogs will be a disabled logical standby database.","C":"Cats will be a disabled physical standby database.","E":"Cats will be an enabled physical standby database.","B":"Sheep will be the primary database."},"exam_id":375,"timestamp":"2020-01-21 08:57:00","answer":"ABC","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Examine the Data Guard configuration:\nDGMGRL> show configuration;\n\nConfiguration Animals -\nProtection Mode: MaxAvailability\nDatabases:\ndogs- Primary database\ncats- Physical standby database\nsheep- Logical standby database\n\nFast-Start Failover: DISABLED -\nConfiguration Status:\n\nSUCCESS -\nWhich three will be true after a switchover to Sheep?","question_images":[],"question_id":83,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/12430-exam-1z0-066-topic-1-question-79-discussion/","answer_ET":"ABE","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: ABC\nDog will be a logical standby enable\nCat will be a standy logical disable\nAfter a switch over a logical, the primary take logical standby role and the others will be disabled.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Rockfics","timestamp":"1698983400.0","comment_id":"1061061"},{"content":"DGMGRL> show configuration;\n\nConfiguration - DRSolution\n\n Protection Mode: MaxPerformance\n Members:\n boston - Primary database\n london - Physical standby database \n london2 - Logical standby database \n\nFast-Start Failover: Disabled\n\nConfiguration Status:\nSUCCESS (status updated 29 seconds ago)\n\nDGMGRL> switchover to london2;\nPerforming switchover NOW, please wait...\nSwitchover succeeded, new primary is \"london2\"\nDGMGRL> show configuration;\n\nConfiguration - DRSolution\n\n Protection Mode: MaxPerformance\n Members:\n london2 - Primary database\n boston - Logical standby database \n london - Physical standby database (disabled)\n ORA-16795: the standby database needs to be re-created\n\nFast-Start Failover: Disabled\n\nConfiguration Status:\nSUCCESS (status updated 54 seconds ago)","timestamp":"1697984460.0","poster":"ScottL","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1050736"},{"comment_id":"888927","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1683145920.0","poster":"JESUSBB","content":"Answer: A, B and E"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Correct ABC","comment_id":"422021","timestamp":"1628500260.0","poster":"Rogazan"},{"timestamp":"1579593420.0","comment_id":"41243","content":"C is wrong.\nWhereas a switchover to a logical standby database will invalidate and disable all of the physical and snapshot standby databases in the configuration.
