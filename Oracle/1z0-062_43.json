Seed column usage -\nOracle must observe a representative workload, in order to determine the appropriate column groups. Using the new procedure\nDBMS_STATS.SEED_COL_USAGE, you tell Oracle how long it should observe the workload.\nStep 2: (3) You don't need to execute all of the queries in your work during this window. You can simply run explain plan for some of your longer running queries to ensure column group information is recorded for these queries.\nStep 3. (1) Create the column groups\nAt this point you can get Oracle to automatically create the column groups for each of the tables based on the usage information captured during the monitoring window. You simply have to call the DBMS_STATS.CREATE_EXTENDED_STATS function for each table.This function requires just two arguments, the schema name and the table name. From then on, statistics will be maintained for each column group whenever statistics are gathered on the table.\nNote:\n* DBMS_STATS.REPORT_COL_USAGE reports column usage information and records all the SQL operations the database has processed for a given object.\n* The Oracle SQL optimizer has always been ignorant of the implied relationships between data columns within the same table.
