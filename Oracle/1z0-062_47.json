Therefore, the FIELD NAMES FIRST FILE directive could not be processed.\nAction: Check the listed data file and fix it. Then retry the operation\nE:\n* A comma-separated values (CSV) (also sometimes called character-separated values, because the separator character does not have to be a comma) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form. Plain text means that the file is a sequence of characters, with no data that has to be interpreted instead, as binary numbers. A CSV file consists of any number of records, separated by line breaks of some kind; each record consists of fields, separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal comma or tab. Usually, all records have an identical sequence of fields.\n* Fields with embedded commas must be quoted.\nExample:\n1997,Ford,E350,\"Super, luxurious truck\"\nNote:\n* SQL*Loader is a bulk loader utility used for moving data from external files into the Oracle database.","discussion":[{"comment_id":"554139","content":"Selected Answer: ABE\nA maybe not right, C,D must be wrong.\nSeem to be the CREATE TABLE　statement will be there while generating .ctl file,\nbut you need to manually execute the CREATE statement anyway.\nhttps://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_ReadersWriters/sqlldr/sqlldr_table_creation.htm","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1645583460.0","poster":"jackymak"},{"poster":"hggz","upvote_count":"3","content":"I'am confused with this, \"A\" can't be correct, but some guys tell what thay chosen this answer and got that point.\n\nhttp://www.briefmenow.org/oracle/which-three-statements-are-true-regarding-the-sql-loader-operation-performed-using-the-control-file-2/","comment_id":"61885","timestamp":"1583864580.0"}],"choices":{"C":"The SQL* Loader operation fails because no record terminators are specified.","E":"The SQL* Loader operation assumes that the file must be a stream record format file with the normal carriage return string as the record terminator.","A":"An EMP table is created if a table does not exist.
