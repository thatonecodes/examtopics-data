Cloud Agent Plugin:\n\n Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Logging provides the Cloud Agent Plugin, which allows you to collect logs from on-premises environments and send them to OCI Logging. You can configure the Cloud Agent Plugin on your on-premises instances to collect and forward logs to OCI Logging.\n\nE. ObjectCollection Rule:\n\n In OCI Logging, ObjectCollection Rules are used to specify which log data should be archived to OCI Object Storage.
