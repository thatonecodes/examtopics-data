(Here, we use empty to mean containing no customer-created artifacts.) It is referred to as the seed PDB and has the name\nPDB$Seed. Every CDB non-negotiably contains a seed PDB; it is non-negotiably always open in read-only mode. This has no conceptual significance; rather, it is just an optimization device. The create PDB operation is implemented as a special case of the clone PDB operation. The size of the seed PDB is only about 1 gigabyte and it takes only a few seconds on a typical machine to copy it.","choices":{"D":"Alt existing PDBs must be closed.","A":"The CDB must be open.","B":"The CDB must be in the mount stage.","C":"The CDB must be in the nomount stage."},"discussion":[{"poster":"jackymak","timestamp":"1645357920.0","comment_id":"551743","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTested that the PDB cannot be created in mount mode.","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"In your multitenant container database (CDB) with two pluggable database (PDBs).

You CAN have tnsnames.ora configured on both the local and remote server. However, for the purpose of successful connection to the DB server, the client initiating the above command MUST have a tnsnames.ora file with the net service name being used (in this case orcl) on their server. The tnsnames.ora in the remote DB does NOT have to have the exact same tns entry for successful connection. The requirement is that the net service name be registered with the listener it is using to request connection to the DB server. So B is correct as opposed to A. \n\nC is correct.
