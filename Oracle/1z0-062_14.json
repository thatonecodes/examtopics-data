The reload command rereads the listener.ora\nfile for the new definitions. As you can see, it is not necessary to stop and start the listener to\nreload it. Although stopping and restarting the listener can also accomplish a reload, using\nthe reload command is better because the listener is not actually stopped, which makes this process more efficient.
