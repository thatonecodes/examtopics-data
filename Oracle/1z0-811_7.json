It's semantically correct, and often necessary to just want a finally block after a try.\nB. false. When an exception occurs within a try block, \n it will jump straight out to the catch block (if there isn't a catch block, it will jump into the finally block). And the compiler will deal with the unchecked exception if not within the try block.\nC false.

The catch block is responsible for handling the exception that may occur within the try block. If an exception occurs and there is no corresponding catch block, it will result in a compilation error.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1684912980.0","comment_id":"905596","poster":"CuriosityYen"}],"timestamp":"1684912620.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. All statements in a try block are executed, even if an exception occurs in the middle of the try block.\n\nIn Java, when an exception occurs within a try block, the remaining statements within that try block are skipped, and the program control immediately transfers to the appropriate catch block. However, it's important to note that the finally block (if present) will still be executed before the control moves to the catch block."}],"unix_timestamp":1684912620,"question_text":"Which statement is true about exception handling?","timestamp":"2023-05-24 09:17:00","answer":"B","topic":"1"},{"id":"U06J3x4dLK3A6oTj4P75","isMC":true,"question_text":"Given the code fragment:\n//IMG//\n\nWhat is the result?","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-10-21 01:44:00","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1300684","timestamp":"1729467840.0","content":"Observation: There is no space between pipes \"||\"","poster":"brunojee","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/149909-exam-1z0-811-topic-1-question-44-discussion/","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-811/image55.png"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1729467840,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"false\nfalse","A":"true\ntrue","B":"true\nfalse","D":"false\ntrue"},"exam_id":401,"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","question_id":32},{"id":"3XoDmWHDcpHCPG2n4PGz","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1729468620,"choices":{"C":"calculatebill","B":"calculateBill","A":"BillCalculator","D":"Calculator"},"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/149910-exam-1z0-811-topic-1-question-48-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Which method identifier is correct according to Java naming conventions?","answer":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729468620.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAccording to Java naming conventions, the correct method identifier from the options provided is:\n\nB. calculateBill\n\nHere's a breakdown of the naming conventions in Java:\n\n Classes should be named using PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase), where each word starts with a capital letter (e.g., BillCalculator or Calculator). So A and D are valid class names, not method names.\n\n Methods should be named using camelCase (also known as lowerCamelCase), where the first word is lowercase and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter (e.g., calculateBill). Thus, B is correct.\n\n C. calculatebill uses all lowercase letters for the second part of the identifier, which does not follow the camelCase convention, making it incorrect.\n\nSo, B is the only correct answer for a method identifier according to Java naming conventions.","comment_id":"1300685","poster":"brunojee","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":401,"question_id":33,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-10-21 01:57:00"},{"id":"keR9QjZjypY6ZIIKC6g4","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1695042180,"exam_id":401,"topic":"1","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-811/image63.png"],"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2023-09-18 15:03:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/120912-exam-1z0-811-topic-1-question-49-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct answer","comment_id":"1010616","timestamp":"1726664580.0","poster":"mac_mac2023","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_text":"Given the contents of Student.java:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich statement is true?","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"The commands:\njavac Student.java\njava Student Richard William Java\nthrow an error about a missing Course.class file.","C":"The commands:\njavac Student.java\njava Student Richard William Java\nare used to print Richard William is studying Java.","B":"The commands:\njavac Course.java\njavac Student.java\njava Course\njava Student “Richard William” Java\nare used to print Richard William is studying Java.","D":"The commands:\njavac Student.java\njava Student “Richard William” Java\nare used to print Richard William is studying Java."},"question_id":34},{"id":"7QXq7MlQmql528VY7bq6","answer":"C","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"Given:\n//IMG//\n\nAnd the code fragment:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich code fragment can be inserted at line n1 to enable the code to print All the best?","exam_id":401,"question_id":35,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-811/image3.png","https://img.examtopics.com/1z0-811/image4.png"],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/oracle/view/91713-exam-1z0-811-topic-1-question-5-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1671117420,"choices":{"C":"writeMsg();","D":"m.writeMsg();","B":"Messenger.writeMsg();","A":"void writeMsg();"},"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is option C.","comment_id":"1364201","timestamp":"1740968940.0","poster":"PLSnoob"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is option C.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1342280","timestamp":"1737137400.0","poster":"facudtd"},{"comment_id":"1328377","timestamp":"1734515760.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"electri","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the only correct answer, beaucse line n1 is inside the class \"Messenger\", it will call the local class function of the instance.
