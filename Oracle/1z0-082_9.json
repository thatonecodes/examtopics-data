Oracle does not support taking substrings directly from DATE data types. The date must be converted to a string using TO_CHAR before SUBSTR can be used. Furthermore, subtracting 10 from a substring of a date does not make sense unless the substring represents a number, which is not the case here since join_date is a date and not a string of numbers. Therefore, explicit conversion is necessary, and the query itself is somewhat nonsensical without additional context or correction.
