There's no way to be A or C because the first line of the 2 answers makes an operation useless because String is immutable, you would have to assign the operation to a variable. The letter D is wrong because you don't compare a String with \"==\", because String is not a primitive variable and even being equal it will give false, to get around this you have to use the \"equals\" method that will compare the substrings of the String, which is what is done in answer B."}],"exam_id":399,"unix_timestamp":1665258060,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04353/0018100002.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04353/0018200001.jpg"],"question_id":76,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Option B","C":"Option C","A":"Option A","D":"Option D"}},{"id":"BcL4WgWqVm16MEzEAv8V","topic":"1","question_text":"Given the code fragment:\n//IMG//\n\nWhat is the result?","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (64%)","C (36%)"],"unix_timestamp":1560106380,"discussion":[{"poster":"SSJ5","comment_id":"316701","upvote_count":"11","timestamp":"1616365500.0","content":"correct answer is C"},{"comment_id":"44344","timestamp":"1580322780.0","content":"Agree, the correct answer C\npublic class Test {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n String[][] arr = { { \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" }, { \"D\", \"E\"} };\n for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {\n System.out.print(arr[i][j] + \" \");\n if (arr[i][j].equals(\"B\")) {\n break;\n }\n }\n continue;\n }\n }\n}","comments":[{"content":"Interestingly your code is wrong, but giving right answer.
