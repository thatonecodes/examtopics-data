This is a system-level permission and not specific to objects within a user's schema.\nB. Execute a procedure in another schema.\nTrue. To execute a procedure in another schema, a user would need the EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE system privilege. While direct object privileges can be granted to execute a specific procedure, the system privilege is broader and not restricted to a single schema.\nC. Log in to a database instance.\nTrue.
