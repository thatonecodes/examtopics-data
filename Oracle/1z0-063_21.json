A file section is a contiguous range of blocks in a file. This type of backup is called a multisection backup.\nThe purpose of multisection backups is to enable RMAN channels to back up a single large file in parallel\n***\nBackup piece size is an issue in those situations where it exceeds the maximum file size of the file system or media management software. Use the MAXSETSIZE parameter of the CONFIGURE CHANNEL or ALLOCATE CHANNEL command to limit the size of backup pieces.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"112982","comments":[{"comment_id":"125473","poster":"mihanik","content":"And after few tests we got answer A\nSECTION SIZE parameter is used to parallelize backup of big datafile but it does not forces parallelism","timestamp":"1593770280.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"timestamp":"1592463660.0","content":"I mean C, C is the correct answer","poster":"mihanik"}],"poster":"mihanik","timestamp":"1592463600.0","comment_id":"112980"},{"comments":[{"content":"Wrong.
