Two of the subnets contain application servers and the third subnet contains a DB System.\nThe application requires a shared file system so you have provisioned one using the file storage service (FSS).\nYou also created the corresponding mount target in one of the application subnets. The VCN security lists are properly configured so that both application servers and the DB system can access the file system. The security team determines that the DB System should have read-only access to the file system.\nWhat change should you make to satisfy this requirement?","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"6","content":"A is correct","comment_id":"317432","poster":"Mohamed79","timestamp":"1616438520.0"},{"content":"Please ignore my previous comment, the correct answer is \"A\" , I came back after reviewing the videos and notes to take my initial answer back.","poster":"Davar39","comment_id":"263355","timestamp":"1610208420.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"timestamp":"1645672200.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"KirSol","comment_id":"555047","content":"A IS CORRECT"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"shaw2000","timestamp":"1643397120.0","comment_id":"534905","content":"Selected Answer: A\nNFS export options enable you to create more granular access control than is possible using just security list rules to limit VCN access. You can use NFS export options to specify access levels for IP addresses or CIDR blocks connecting to file systems through exports in a mount target. Access can be restricted so that each clientâ€™s file system is inaccessible and invisible to the other, providing better security controls in multi-tenant environments.\n\nUsing NFS export option access controls, you can limit clients' ability to connect to the file system and view or write data. For example, if you want to allow clients to consume but not update resources in your file system, you can set access to Read Only. You can also reduce client root access to your file systems and map specified User IDs (UIDs) and Group IDs (GIDs) to an anonymous UID/GID of your choice.
