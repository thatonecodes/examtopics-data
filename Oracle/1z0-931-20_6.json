And Why the system needs more CPU ? to allow for more concurrent processes to run.\nSo A is false because the number of CPUs changed and are displayed.\nand E is false because the point of the incresed CPU is to allow more processes to run, thus more concurrency, which is not the same as higher Level of parallelism. concurrency is more independent processes. Parallelism is on slaves running the same query. \nThe optimizer still keeps the same parameter setting for parallel","comment_id":"592019"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1645661880.0","comment_id":"554970","content":"ABD IS THE ANSWER","poster":"camiicamacho"},{"timestamp":"1645441380.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"LUISGAR","content":"bce IS THE ANSWER","comment_id":"552772"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"BCE is the answer","timestamp":"1644921900.0","comment_id":"547685","poster":"mpkwan"},{"comment_id":"544637","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BCE\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/autonomous-auto-scale.html#GUID-27FAB1C1-B09F-4A7A-9FB9-5CB8110F7141","poster":"Rodrigoef","timestamp":"1644505020.0"},{"timestamp":"1641842700.0","comment_id":"521078","content":"Answer = BCE\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/autonomous-auto-scale.html#GUID-27FAB1C1-B09F-4A7A-9FB9-5CB8110F7141\n\nEnabling auto scaling does not change the concurrency and parallelism settings for the predefined services.\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/monitor-performance-intro.html#GUID-54CCC1C6-C32E-47F4-8EB6-64CD6EDB5938\n\nRead the CPU section.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Stu_Dent"},{"content":"BCE is the answer\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/autonomous-auto-scale.html#GUID-27FAB1C1-B09F-4A7A-9FB9-5CB8110F7141","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"517761","poster":"Tanat","timestamp":"1641410400.0"},{"comment_id":"504178","upvote_count":"1","poster":"dapdomma","content":"Many Thanks","timestamp":"1639827780.0"},{"poster":"RayhanShafiullah","comment_id":"495870","timestamp":"1638872220.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"BCE is correct"},{"poster":"oracle1239","timestamp":"1637785980.0","content":"With auto scaling enabled the database can use up to three times more CPU and IO resources than specified by the number of OCPUs currently shown in the Scale Up/Down\nBCE do not change","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"486240"},{"comment_id":"472529","timestamp":"1636031520.0","content":"Amount of storage NO CHANGES.\nThe correct answer is B,C,E","upvote_count":"1","poster":"RicardoRomero"},{"poster":"exam67","content":"BCE are correct, because the amount of storage (B) does not depend on auto-scaling.\nAD are incorrect because the the number of OCPU displayed (A) may change if this is the number displayed in the Monitoring page.","comment_id":"458809","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1633619400.0"},{"poster":"TanTran","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1632022020.0","comment_id":"447372","content":"Agree, ACE is correct"},{"comment_id":"381229","upvote_count":"3","content":"A and D can change ..
