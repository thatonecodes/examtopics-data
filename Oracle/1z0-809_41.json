The moment assertion is enabled, this happens:\nIn the code, the condition in the assert statement is b >= 1. This condition is false because b is assigned the value -1. Therefore, when the JVM encounters this assert statement (with assertions enabled via the \"ea\" option), it throws an AssertionError with the message \"Invalid Denominator\".\nAssertions are disabled by default in Java.

In Java, this is done by adding an assert statement, followed by a condition. When assertions are disabled, these statements are ignored completely, but when enabled, the JVM throws an error if the condition turns out to be false. This can be used to check whether the program works as expected. An example of an assert statement in Java:\n\n int i = 25; assert i < 24;\nWhen assertions are enabled with the -ea option, the preceding code will result in a java.lang.Error instance thrown by the JVM once the assert statement runs.
