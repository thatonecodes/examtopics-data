Next, you can compile standalone subprograms that reference the packages. You need not fully define the package bodies until you are ready to complete the application.”\n\n“Package public variables and cursors can persist for the life of a session. They can be shared by all subprograms that run in the environment. They let you maintain data across transactions without storing it in the database. ”\n\n“The first time you invoke a package subprogram, Oracle Database loads the whole package into memory.
