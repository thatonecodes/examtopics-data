T-shirt sizing is typically used in agile when estimating detailed requirements during sprint planning.\n\nT-shirt sizing is an estimation technique used in agile development that involves assigning t-shirt sizes (e.g. XS, S, M, L, XL) to user stories or other requirements based on their relative complexity or effort. This approach is often used during sprint planning to help teams estimate the level of effort required for each requirement and ensure that they can realistically commit to completing the work within the sprint timeframe. Option A (Rationalism), option B (Trading), and option C (Visioning) are not commonly used estimation techniques in agile development.","poster":"Djtomip"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"CFT","timestamp":"1706119440.0","comment_id":"786768","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct - T-Shirt sizing is incredibly common in agile sprint planning, whereas rationalism is not. Sprint planning estimation is done by the opposite of rationalism - empiricism, resulting in a T-shirt size to understand the complexity of the task."}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-01-24 19:04:00","answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/96763-exam-prince2-agile-foundation-topic-1-question-49-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which is typically used in agile when estimating detailed requirements during sprint planning?","question_id":36,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Visioning","D":"T-shirt sizing","B":"Trading","A":"Rationalism"},"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1674583440,"exam_id":195},{"id":"Sp5s76qtJZmRRAQQENrr","isMC":true,"exam_id":195,"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/122828-exam-prince2-agile-foundation-topic-1-question-5-discussion/","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"The project board should attend regular project progress meetings","B":"The project board should make decisions based on the Agilometer risks","C":"A project board member should fulfill the product owner role within a delivery team","D":"The project board should increase the stage-level time tolerance"},"unix_timestamp":1696737120,"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (67%)","B (33%)"],"question_images":[],"question_id":37,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.prince2primer.com/directing-a-project-3/","timestamp":"2023-10-08 05:52:00","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1735895940.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nthe project board should have a way to access the level of risk within the project","comment_id":"1335960","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AGILECLI"},{"content":"Chatgpt also says A","comment_id":"1213202","upvote_count":"1","poster":"husnus","timestamp":"1731924300.0"},{"timestamp":"1712548320.0","comment_id":"1027706","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption A, \"The project board should attend regular project progress meetings,\" is the correct statement about the 'directing a project' process in PRINCE2.

Agile acknowledges that it is difficult, if not impossible, to fully understand a complex project at the beginning, and that new information and requirements may emerge as the project progresses.\n\nBy avoiding too much detail at the start, agile allows for more flexibility in responding to changes and new information that may emerge during the project. Agile methodologies typically involve breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable pieces, and delivering incremental value to the customer at each stage. This allows for frequent opportunities to re-evaluate and adjust the project's goals and requirements based on new information and changing circumstances.","poster":"darthhansie","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"mumblejumble","timestamp":"1677702300.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTable 8.1: \"The agile way of working addresses many risk areas such as avoiding too much detail at the start of a project...\"","comment_id":"558999"}]},{"id":"NCCCi6DCVUIL8Tw405n3","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/96769-exam-prince2-agile-foundation-topic-1-question-55-discussion/","answers_community":["A (75%)","B (25%)"],"question_images":[],"question_id":39,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"1 and 2","C":"3 and 4","D":"1 and 4","B":"2 and 3"},"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-01-24 20:47:00","answer_description":"","answer":"A","question_text":"Which TWO statements about the typical tailoring of a checkpoint report in an agile environment are CORRECT?\n\n1.

Therefore, PRINCE2 Agile is most appropriate when delivering new products, services, or systems that are complex, uncertain, or where there is a significant degree of innovation involved. It can also be used in situations where there is a need for ongoing maintenance or enhancement of an existing product or service, as long as there is a requirement for agility and flexibility in the delivery process."},{"comment_id":"786922","poster":"CFT","timestamp":"1690223100.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Why is this not A?
