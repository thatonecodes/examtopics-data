Quality assurance is therefore independent of the project.\n\nProject assurance is the project board's responsibility to assure itself that the project is being conducted correctly. The project board members each have a specific area of focus for project assurance, namely business assurance for the executive, user assurance for the senior user(s) and supplier assurance for the senior supplier(s). Project assurance is therefore independent of the project manager but not independent of the project.\n\nSo D is the correct answer.","poster":"Jasonbahr","comment_id":"333323","comments":[{"comment_id":"648987","timestamp":"1724074200.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Excellent explanation, thank you for that","poster":"KeanoD"}],"timestamp":"1681220520.0","upvote_count":"17"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","answers_community":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following statements about quality assurance and Project Assurance is true?","question_id":6,"choices":{"C":"Project Assurance may be delegated within a project; quality assurance must be undertaken by the Project Board","D":"Project Assurance ensures compliance to standards within the project environment; quality assurance ensures compliance across the organization","B":"Project Assurance is independent of the Project; quality assurance is only independent of the Project Manager","A":"Project Assurance is the responsibility of the corporate organization; quality assurance is the responsibility of the Project Board"}},{"id":"KeTkn8d3xA8f1BY2sIJO","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":196,"choices":{"C":"Project Support","D":"Project Manager","B":"Project Assurance","A":"Quality assurance"},"timestamp":"2023-04-11 11:36:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1681205760,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Who carries out audits that are independent of the project?","answer":"A","question_id":7,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/105909-exam-prince2-foundation-topic-1-question-106-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"Firey","upvote_count":"1","content":"In summary, quality assurance is responsible for carrying out audits that are independent of the project.
