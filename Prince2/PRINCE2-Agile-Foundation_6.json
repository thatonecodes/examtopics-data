By flexing what is produced to stay in control and deliver value.\n\nIn an Agile context, the \"tailor to suit the project\" principle is applied by flexing what is produced to stay in control and deliver value. This means that the Agile approach is tailored to the specific needs of the project, rather than trying to force a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto emphasizes the importance of responding to change and delivering working software frequently, which requires a flexible and adaptable approach. This means that the Agile team must be able to adjust their approach to suit the specific needs of the project and respond to changing requirements and priorities.\n\nBy tailoring the Agile approach to the project, the team can stay in control of the project and ensure that they are delivering value to the customer. This may involve adjusting the Agile ceremonies, such as Sprint Planning or Daily Scrum, to better suit the needs of the project, or incorporating additional practices or tools to address specific project requirements.","timestamp":"1727014320.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Djtomip"},{"content":"for quality Prince2 training in Pakistan, visit this trainer’s website:\nhttps://www.javedpmp.com/prince2-certification-training.php","timestamp":"1709269320.0","comment_id":"825532","upvote_count":"1","poster":"user0044"},{"timestamp":"1704670860.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"The correct answer is C as agreed with the comment below.
