The major products that are to be developed in a plan\n\nExplanation:\n\nA Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) is a hierarchical diagram that identifies and decomposes the major products (deliverables) of a project into smaller, manageable components. It focuses on what needs to be delivered, rather than the order of creation or resources required.\n\nIt helps in defining scope clearly.\n\nIt supports planning and estimating efforts.\n\nIt is different from a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which includes activities and tasks.","poster":"collinspipi","timestamp":"1739803800.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"MarkNeedsToGo","comment_id":"1330238","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1734833100.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCome on guys, it's C"},{"comment_id":"1323965","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe PBS outlines the major products (deliverables) that will be developed in the project.

It outlines what products are to be developed without detailing how they will be produced or the order in which they will be created.\n\nHere’s why the other options are incorrect:\n\n A: Management stages, major products and control points is incorrect because the PBS specifically focuses on the products, not on management stages or control points.\n B: In which order the products should be created is incorrect as the PBS does not address the sequencing of product creation; that is handled by the planning processes.\n D: The resources that are required to develop the products is incorrect because the PBS does not provide information on the resources needed; it only details the products themselves.\n\nThus, C: The major products that are to be developed in a plan accurately reflects what is shown in a Product Breakdown Structure.

With hierachy its shown to to have several products, each product having its \"sub products\" (for example to set up a conference you need a venue, attendees, speakers etc.), and each sub products have their own sub items. So in that way its hierarchical. But being hierarchical doesnt mean there a certain order of products that need to be done first. This can be shown in a flow chart, based on the product breakdown (which products are interdependent, which need to be created first etc.).","timestamp":"1629816960.0","poster":"S4L4LMF","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer should be B.
