Consider the impact of alternative options for resolution\n\nExplanation:\nDuring the 'assessing issues' step in PRINCE2, the project manager evaluates the issue in detail to understand its potential impact on the project. This includes considering alternative options for resolution and their effects on project scope, time, cost, quality, risk, and benefits. Once the assessment is complete, the project manager can recommend an appropriate course of action.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1351948","poster":"selimbeyhan","timestamp":"1738769640.0"},{"timestamp":"1732086600.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Consider the impact of alternative options for resolution\n\nIn this step, the project manager assesses the issue and considers various options to resolve it, including evaluating their potential impacts on the project’s scope, cost, quality, and schedule.

Tolerances provide boundaries for time, cost, quality, scope, risk, and benefits, and enable the Project Board and other stakeholders to monitor the project’s progress without intervening unless these limits are exceeded. This control allows the Project Manager to manage day-to-day progress while keeping the Project Board informed about any deviations."},{"poster":"bes_i","timestamp":"1721589780.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Tolerances\n\nIn PRINCE2, tolerances are essential for managing progress. They define the permissible limits for deviations from the project's plan and are used to monitor and control performance. Tolerances help determine when an issue should be escalated to the next level of management if deviations exceed the allowed limits. This allows for effective management of progress and ensures that the project remains on track.","comment_id":"1252670","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"867514","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ameli8222","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. \n\nTo be following PRINCE2, a project must, as a minimum:\n\n•define its approach to controlling progress in the PID\n\n•be managed by stages (PRINCE2’s manage by stages principle)\n\n•set tolerances and be managed by exception against them (PRINCE2’s manage by exception principle)\n\n•review the business justification when exceptions are raised (PRINCE2’s continued business justification principle)\n\n•learn lessons (PRINCE2’s learn from experience principle).","timestamp":"1681233240.0"},{"poster":"Darkvirusk","comment_id":"837770","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1678696620.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nTolerances is not a control"}],"choices":{"B":"Tolerances","A":"A project plan","C":"An issue register","D":"Highlight reports"},"answers_community":["B (75%)","D (25%)"],"question_text":"Which control must be used as a minimum requirement for applying the ‘progress’ theme?","answer_description":"","exam_id":196,"isMC":true},{"id":"dJFKoBzpvKOupuL6eLed","topic":"1","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"skillfulsatellite","comment_id":"1315091","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe Progress theme focuses on monitoring and controlling project performance, ensuring that it stays within agreed tolerances (such as time, cost, and quality), and forecasting future performance to ensure that the project can achieve its objectives and remain viable.","timestamp":"1732086720.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Kjennset","timestamp":"1730189460.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe 'Progress' theme in PRINCE2 provides mechanisms to control the project against baselines by monitoring and forecasting the project's objectives and continued viability.
