Initiating a project typically involves gathering information and setting up the project, and it's an appropriate time to seek lessons from past projects that can inform the current one. Therefore, statement B is not correct because seeking lessons when initiating a project is indeed a recommended practice.","poster":"ravi_aws","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1022433"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nTo my opinion the keyword here is SOUGHT. Lessons shall be sought by everyone in the project team at any moment during the project lifecycle (so also during Initiation Stage). Conversely, it has no more sense to search for lessons as the project closes. At project closure, Learn from Experience principle focuses on passing on (to the Organization) the project's lessons learned.","poster":"PieroBe","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"963844","timestamp":"1690382520.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"DaveLitten","content":"Tricky question - B is correct (reference page 21/22 of the Manual).

Project assurance is responsible for providing independent assurance on the viability and correctness of the stage plans. Reviewing product descriptions as part of the stage plan for stage 3 falls within this remit, ensuring that the descriptions are clear, complete, and meet the project's quality requirements.\n\nD.
