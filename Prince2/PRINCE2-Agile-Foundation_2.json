But when doing this, the short-term effect is often to extend the schedule as new team members get up to speed with the project. This is why, in PRINCE2 Agile, cost tolerance (which often translates to human resources) is set at zero."},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1014095","timestamp":"1711118280.0","content":"C. It prevents compromising the overall quality level of the product.\n\nThe statement that is correct about the 'keep teams stable' target is that it prevents compromising the overall quality level of the product.\n\nThe 'keep teams stable' target is a key principle of agile development, which emphasizes the importance of stable, cross-functional teams that can work together effectively over the long term. By keeping teams stable, the organization can build trust, foster collaboration, and improve communication among team members. This, in turn, can help to prevent compromising the overall quality level of the product.\n\nThe tolerance for cost is set to zero as part of the 'value-driven' target, which emphasizes the need to deliver maximum value with minimum waste. This target is not directly related to the 'keep teams stable' target.","poster":"Djtomip"},{"comment_id":"989581","poster":"czmshote","timestamp":"1708828080.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCheck the guide in 6.4.4","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1706985000.0","comment_id":"971308","poster":"strykebrett","content":"See 6.4.4.

The delivery milestones should be reviewed and re-planned\n\nThis option directly addresses the need to adjust the project plan and schedule to accommodate the new detailed requirements within the timebox. It is a standard practice in project management to review and re-plan when changes occur to ensure that the project remains on track. Option A (removing similar-level effort requirements) is a potential strategy within this re-planning process, but it doesn't encompass the entire process of assessing and adjusting the project plan, which is covered by option C."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA as per negative selection:\nB) The well-known \"keep teams stable\" doesn't allow me to choose B\nC) Time is fixed.\nD) Formal change control is not applied for detailed requirements as per PRINCE2 Agile","comment_id":"944573","poster":"Gepro","timestamp":"1720265100.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nIf the new requirements cannot be accommodated within the existing timebox without compromising the delivery of other requirements, then it may be necessary to remove requirements of a similar level of effort in order to make room for the new requirements.

It can result in the early delivery of a minimum viable product\n\nExplanation:\nThe target of 'accept that the customer doesn't need everything' in Agile methodologies focuses on delivering the most valuable and essential features first. By prioritizing the most critical requirements and acknowledging that not all initially identified features are necessary for the product's success, teams can deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) earlier. This approach allows the customer to start using the product sooner and provides valuable feedback for future iterations.\n\nA. It gives confidence on the progress of the project: While it can contribute to overall project confidence, this statement does not directly capture the essence of the target.\nC. It allows misunderstandings to be dealt with appropriately: This is more about communication and clarification rather than prioritizing and delivering essential features.\nD.
