To estimate the costs of improvement: While cost estimation is part of the overall business case, it's not the primary focus of benefits management. Benefits management emphasizes the value created, not just the cost.\n4. To define the reason for delivering the improvement: This is closely related to the project's objectives and the business case, which should already exist. Benefits management focuses on how those improvements will be measured and confirmed.\nKey takeaway: A benefits management approach is essential for ensuring that projects deliver real value and achieve their intended outcomes. It's about defining how benefits will be measured and confirming their realization throughout the project lifecycle.","poster":"Examcollectorthanos","timestamp":"1731247080.0","comment_id":"1309469","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Examcollectorthanos","content":"Ok, so what is it?
