The register includes key details about each risk or opportunity, such as its description, impact, probability, and planned responses, making it the correct place to record the impact assessment for a business opportunity.","comment_id":"1317595","timestamp":"1732549200.0"},{"comment_id":"1313752","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731880500.0","content":"After more study, I go with C. \nThe correct answer is C. Risk register.\n\nHere's why:\n\nRisk Register: The risk register is a central document in PRINCE2 for managing and tracking risks throughout the project. It includes information about each identified risk, including its description, potential impact, probability, and planned responses.\nOpportunities: In PRINCE2, opportunities are considered positive risks. They are uncertain events that, if they occur, could have a beneficial impact on the project.\nRecording Impact Assessment: When assessing a business opportunity (a positive risk), the project manager needs to evaluate its potential impact on the project's objectives. This impact assessment should be recorded in the risk register along with other details about the opportunity.","poster":"Examcollectorthanos"},{"comment_id":"1313237","upvote_count":"1","content":"I say its A; Here’s why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. Issue register: Incorrect. The Issue Register is used to log all identified issues at a summary level. It tracks the status of issues but does not include detailed impact assessments or evaluations for specific issues.\n\nC. Risk register: Incorrect. Opportunities can be recorded in the Risk Register if identified during risk management, but once an opportunity materializes or needs assessment, it is handled as an issue and documented in an Issue Report.\n\nD. Quality register: Incorrect. The Quality Register is used to track planned and completed quality activities. It is unrelated to assessing business opportunities or issues.","timestamp":"1731790140.0","poster":"Examcollectorthanos"},{"poster":"3578791","content":"B. Issue register is the management product used to record any issues that arise during the project, including business opportunities or threats that require attention. An impact assessment for a specific business opportunity would typically be recorded in the Issue register because it’s something that needs to be tracked and managed. Issues can include things like risks, concerns, changes in scope, or business opportunities, all of which need to be assessed, tracked, and addressed.","timestamp":"1731081600.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1308859"}],"question_text":"The project manager needs to record the impact assessment for a specific business opportunity.\n\nIn which management product should the project manager record this?","question_id":293,"unix_timestamp":1731081600,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer":"C","exam_id":196,"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Issue register","D":"Quality register","A":"Issue report","C":"Risk register"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/151019-exam-prince2-foundation-topic-1-question-522-discussion/"},{"id":"l0C9BJxmot3Mw5xuZ1Kr","unix_timestamp":1731791820,"answer":"A","question_images":[],"question_text":"The project manager needs to document how risk management will be undertaken during the project.\n\nIn which step of the ‘risk management’ technique should the project manager document this?","choices":{"B":"Identify: identify threats and opportunities","D":"Assess: combine risk profile","A":"Identify: define context and objectives","C":"Assess: prioritize risks"},"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-11-16 22:17:00","exam_id":196,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731791820.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1313261","poster":"Examcollectorthanos","content":"Answer A is correct.

Assess: prioritize risks: This step involves assessing the probability and impact of risks.\nD. Assess: combine risk profile: This step involves creating an overall risk profile for the project.\nKey takeaway: The \"Identify: define context and objectives\" step of the PRINCE2 risk management technique is where the project manager documents how risk management will be undertaken during the project.
