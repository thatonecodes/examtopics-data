No, because the issues raised by project support are a cause for concern and should be reflected in the highlight report.\n\nIn PRINCE2, a highlight report is used to provide the Project Board with a summary of the stage status at regular intervals. This includes information on all major aspects of the project, such as the progress of work packages, risks, issues, and quality.\n\nIn this scenario, while the checkpoint reports indicate that products are being completed on schedule, project support has raised issues regarding quality reviews not being completed as agreed. This is a significant concern that could impact the quality and success of the project.
