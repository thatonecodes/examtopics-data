Project plan.\n\nHere's why:\n\nProject Plan: The project plan is a key document created during the \"starting up a project\" process. It outlines the overall approach for the project, including how it will be managed, controlled, and executed.\nApprovals: The project plan includes information on how management products (like reports, plans, and other key documents) will be approved throughout the project. This ensures that there is a clear and consistent process for reviewing and authorizing these products.\nEarly Definition: By defining the approval process in the project plan, the project establishes a framework for governance and decision-making from the outset. This helps to ensure that decisions are made efficiently and effectively throughout the project lifecycle.","poster":"Examcollectorthanos","comment_id":"1312714","timestamp":"1731688260.0"},{"content":"It's B: \n\nQuality planning: involves identifying the major products of the project and documenting\nthem in terms of user’s expectations and acceptance criteria.
