Create user and supplier groups: In PRINCE2, if a project involves multiple users and suppliers, creating user and supplier groups is a way to streamline communication and decision-making. These groups allow the project to represent the interests of various users and suppliers without expanding the size of the Project Board. The group leaders can then provide input to the Project Board, ensuring it remains manageable while still considering the needs of all stakeholders.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1284874","timestamp":"1726506540.0"},{"comment_id":"845366","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mr_alok","timestamp":"1679356380.0","content":"There can be only ONE Project Board for a project"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Create user and supplier groups","A":"Create a separate Project Board to manage the supplier elements of the project","B":"Create multiple smaller Project Boards during the process of Starting up a Project, one for each of the project's stages.","D":"Appoint corporate quality assurance to perform the Project Assurance role for all members of the Project Board"},"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1679356380,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/103426-exam-prince2-foundation-topic-1-question-48-discussion/","question_id":263,"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"exam_id":196},{"id":"6aDbLC8F6ICaAK61qmdA","question_id":264,"exam_id":196,"timestamp":"2024-11-16 15:07:00","question_text":"Which TWO are objectives of the ‘closing a project’ process?\n\n1.
