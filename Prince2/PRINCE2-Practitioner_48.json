No, because the PRINCE2 project lifecycle should not include project work after the project has closed\n\n In PRINCE2, project closure marks the end of all project activities, and remaining work, such as support or maintenance, is transferred to the normal operation of the organization or managed as part of another project or program. Including an additional step in the course development model to manage post-project work contradicts the principle of closing a project clearly and completely."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"A\n\nThe ‘tailor to suit the project’ principle in PRINCE2 allows for flexibility and adaptation to different project environments. In this case, the project manager is tailoring the standard course development model to include a warranty period, which is a part of the contract with the external consultancy. This tailoring is done to ensure that any faults in the course can be fixed after it is in operational use, which is a specific requirement of this project. Therefore, this is an appropriate application of the ‘tailor to suit the project’ principle as it aligns with the customer/supplier environment. It’s important to note that tailoring doesn’t mean omitting parts of the method but adapting it to suit the project’s environment, scale, complexity, importance, capability and risk.","poster":"ravi_aws","comment_id":"1027453","timestamp":"1696689660.0"}],"answers_community":[]},{"id":"vYiba42j20mjUOXNSgKU","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\n\nORGANIZATION -\nWhen preparing the communication management approach, the project manager considered how best to communicate with the internal marketing department.\nThe marketing department is currently focused on promoting other existing ABC Company courses.\nHere are three items of information that will be included in the communication management approach.\nUnder which heading (A-F) should they be recorded?\nChoose only ONE heading for each item of information.

No, because the supplier needs to understand the link between the outputs they are producing and the project benefits.\n\nIn PRINCE2, it’s important for all parties involved in a project to understand how their work contributes to the overall benefits of the project. This includes suppliers, who need to understand how the outputs they are producing (in this case, the e-learning course) contribute to the project’s benefits. This understanding helps ensure alignment and coherence in working towards the project’s objectives.

No, because the risk effect on the project objectives is unclear.\n\nIn PRINCE2, a risk description should clearly articulate both the cause of the risk and its potential impact on the project’s objectives. In this case, while the cause of the risk (“the ‘delivered pilot courses’ takes place during stage 4”) is stated, the specific effect of this risk on the project’s objectives is not clear. It mentions that “some of the feedback from the pilot could contradict feedback received from other participants,” but it does not clarify how this contradiction could impact the project’s objectives. Therefore, this risk description is not appropriate as it stands.
