To confirm to the project board that there are no products outstanding for the stage: At the end of each stage, the project manager needs to confirm to the project board that all planned products (deliverables) for that stage have been completed and approved. This ensures that the stage is truly finished and that there are no loose ends before moving on to the next stage.   \n\n4. To request the project board to approve work to start on the next stage: The project manager needs to formally request the project board's authorization to start the next stage of the project. This is a key control point in PRINCE2, allowing the project board to review progress, assess the project's continued viability, and make a decision about whether to proceed."}]},{"id":"2IxBTC5KlVKKPo0Nx2jU","question_id":282,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/151440-exam-prince2-foundation-topic-1-question-507-discussion/","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"The project manager needs to plan the reviews to confirm whether the expected measurable improvements have been achieved.\n\nWhich management product should the project manager produce?","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Quality management approach","A":"Benefits management approach","B":"Business case","D":"End project report"},"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1731782220,"exam_id":196,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct; Why the other options are not correct:\n\nB.
