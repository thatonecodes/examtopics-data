This provides the Project Board with more frequent decision points to monitor progress, review risks, and ensure continued business justification.

The defined tolerances must be aligned to the project board's risk attitude\n\nWhen planning a risky and complex project in order to meet the minimum requirements for applying the 'plans' theme in PRINCE2, it's essential to ensure that the defined tolerances are aligned with the project board's risk attitude. This means that the project's tolerance levels should be set in a way that is consistent with the project board's willingness to accept and manage risk. This alignment helps in risk management and ensures that the project is planned in a way that is compatible with the organization's risk appetite and the specific circumstances of the project.","timestamp":"1697453460.0","poster":"fgtfgtet4r56y","comment_id":"1044880"},{"comment_id":"535341","upvote_count":"1","poster":"KANDUUR","timestamp":"1643447760.0","content":"9.2 recommendation."}],"answer_description":""},{"id":"DU98u3ypLAUD9sLRvUk1","question_id":195,"unix_timestamp":1643810100,"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"628325","content":"I would say C","timestamp":"1657191300.0","poster":"jj0097","upvote_count":"7"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
