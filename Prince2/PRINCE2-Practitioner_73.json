If tolerances are threatened, it indicates a significant deviation that may affect the project's objectives, and this requires the attention and decision-making authority of the Project Board. The Project Board can then decide on the necessary corrective actions or escalate the issue further if needed.\n\nOptions B (Project Manager) and D (Executive) are not correct because, while the Project Manager is responsible for day-to-day management and the Executive is a key member of the Project Board, it is the Project Board as a whole that needs to be informed and take action on tolerance breaches.

This process involves defining the project's scope, objectives, and how it will be controlled and governed. Part of this involves setting the tolerances for each stage, which are agreed upon to ensure that the project stays on track and within acceptable limits.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Controlling a Stage: This process involves managing and monitoring the day-to-day activities within a stage, not setting tolerances.\nC. Managing a Stage Boundary: This process is about reviewing the current stage and planning for the next stage, but the tolerances would already have been set during the initiation.\nD.
