Whether a risk may alter the project's business justification.\n\nHere's why this is a minimum requirement for the Risk theme in PRINCE2:\n\nContinued Business Justification: PRINCE2 has a strong emphasis on ensuring that the project remains a worthwhile investment throughout its lifecycle. This is called \"continued business justification.\"\nRisk Impact: Risks have the potential to derail a project or significantly reduce its value. Therefore, it's crucial to assess whether a risk, if it occurs, could impact the project's business case (the reason for doing the project in the first place).\nExamples:\nA risk might increase costs to the point where the project is no longer financially viable.","comment_id":"1309399"}],"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/151061-exam-prince2-foundation-topic-1-question-259-discussion/","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1731234900,"answer":"D","question_text":"As a minimum requirement for applying the risk theme, what must specifically be assessed?","choices":{"A":"Whether a risk may cause the project to exceed its cost tolerance","D":"Whether a risk may alter the project's business justification","B":"Whether a risk may affect the project-level quality tolerances","C":"Whether a risk may impact the underlying technical assumptions"}},{"id":"IhX7fpSY7v3257nmYRJN","unix_timestamp":1634362800,"answers_community":[],"choices":{"C":"Closing a Project","A":"Managing a Stage Boundary","B":"Managing Product Delivery","D":"Controlling a Stage"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":196,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/64176-exam-prince2-foundation-topic-1-question-26-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"The Closing a Project process is triggered towards the end of the final stage when all assigned work has been completed.

It emphasizes the importance of clearly defining and understanding the project's products (deliverables) and their quality criteria. When changes are proposed, they need to align with the agreed-upon product descriptions and quality requirements, and this principle helps ensure that changes are properly assessed and agreed upon.","poster":"fgtfgtet4r56y","comment_id":"1044761"},{"timestamp":"1675361520.0","poster":"lferolm","comment_id":"796313","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"KopytinaN","content":"B is correct","comment_id":"169694","timestamp":"1598751120.0"}]}],"exam":{"id":196,"numberOfQuestions":336,"isBeta":false,"name":"PRINCE2-Foundation","provider":"Prince2","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":28},"__N_SSP":true}
