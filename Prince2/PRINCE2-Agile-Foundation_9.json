The Scrum master: A common role in agile is that of the Scrum master, who provides servant leadership (see section 10.5.1). The Scrum master facilitates and coaches the Scrum process while removing impediments identified by the team working at the delivery level. It could be said that there is no equivalent role in PRINCE2. The team manager is the most obvious candidate, but in Scrum and in many agile belief systems the team does not need to be ‘managed’ per se; it needs to be ‘led and coached’. When using agile in a PRINCE2 environment there will need to be a team manager or equivalent who is accountable to the project manager for the delivery of a team’s products, but this will need to be handled appropriately (see section 10.4.1).","poster":"KayBatah","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1055399","timestamp":"1730029440.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct, a scrum master is a servant-leader and is not responsible for the product backlog.
