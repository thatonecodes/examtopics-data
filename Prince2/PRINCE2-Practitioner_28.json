Amend entry 1 to read ‘This document contains the controls and reporting to be established for the project management team’.\n\nThe reason is that the Communication Management Strategy is a functional strategy that provides focus and direction to the corporate communication function. It should include communication procedures, tools and techniques, records, reporting, timings, roles and responsibilities and analysis. The original entry 1 is too vague and does not reflect the content of the document. The proposed amendment B clarifies the purpose and scope of the document. The amendment C is incorrect because it does not mention the controls and reporting aspects of the strategy."}],"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1696589400,"answer_description":"","exam_id":197,"answers_community":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"UcKxhULQtQNOSlowR0ZC","answer":"D","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which product should show that the photos could be used for other promotional material for the company?","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2021-05-04 21:09:00","topic":"17","unix_timestamp":1620155340,"discussion":[{"comments":[{"poster":"ravi_aws","upvote_count":"1","content":"Sorry, A. The answer is A. Benefits Review Plan.\n\nAccording to PRINCE2, the Benefits Review Plan is a document that describes how and when the benefits of the project will be measured and reviewed1. It also identifies any benefits that can be realized after the project is closed1. Therefore, if the project is closed prematurely, the Benefits Review Plan should show that the photos could be used for other promotional material for the company, as this could be a potential benefit that can be achieved after the project closure.
