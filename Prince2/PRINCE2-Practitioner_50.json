Incorrect. While user acceptance should indeed be obtained at the end of each sprint, identifying follow-on action recommendations is still appropriate and necessary.

In an agile approach, products are often handed over incrementally, and users start using and maintaining them as soon as they are delivered. Identifying follow-on actions for maintenance aligns with ensuring that the products continue to deliver value post-project and that users are aware of their responsibilities.","comment_id":"1250327","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mcesarlara","timestamp":"1721301780.0"},{"content":"The answer is B. Yes, because the users have taken on ongoing ownership of the products handed over.\n\nIn PRINCE2, the ‘Report Management Stage End’ activity involves reviewing the stage and documenting lessons learned, including any follow-on action recommendations. In this case, the Project Manager has identified some recommendations relating to the maintenance of the booking procedures that had been handed over. This is an appropriate action because it ensures that any necessary actions for maintaining the delivered products are clearly communicated to those who will be responsible for them after the project ends.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ravi_aws","timestamp":"1697031120.0","comment_id":"1040691"}],"answer":"B"},{"id":"PyFlAnXE7Buhrj7fHre4","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/98791-exam-prince2-practitioner-topic-21-question-45-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1676122260,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":197,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"content":"No, because the project board should request an exception plan and reset the tolerances for the remainder of the project","comment_id":"1027980","timestamp":"1696770420.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ravi_aws","comments":[{"comment_id":"1040700","poster":"ravi_aws","timestamp":"1697031600.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"A Project board can't set project level tolerances."}]},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\npage150","timestamp":"1676122260.0","poster":"MortenC","comment_id":"805238","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-02-11 14:31:00","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"21","choices":{"B":"Yes, because the delay to the 'e-learning course' has caused the work package time tolerances to be exceeded","C":"No, because the external supplier should fund the overspend on the 'planned pilot courses' work package","A":"Yes, because project cost tolerances are forecast to exceed the limits set out by corporate management","D":"No, because the project board should request an exception plan and reset the tolerances for the remainder of the project"},"question_text":"ABC Company has set an overall budget for the Health and Safety Training Project.
