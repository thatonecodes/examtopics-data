Why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. A schedule-driven: This describes a dependency where the timing of one product is driven by the schedule of another, but it doesn't necessarily mean the project team has control over both.\nC. An external: An external dependency is a relationship between a product within the project and something outside the project's control (e.g., a supplier delivering a component).\nD. A resource-driven: This describes a dependency where the availability of resources affects the delivery of products, but it doesn't necessarily mean the project team has control over both products.\nKey takeaway: An internal dependency in PRINCE2 is a relationship between two products within the project's control.

Planning benefit reviews during the project\n\nExplanation:\nIn PRINCE2, the senior user is responsible for ensuring that the project’s outputs will deliver the intended outcomes and benefits. One of the key aspects of managing this is to plan benefit reviews during the project to track the realization of benefits and ensure the outputs are used effectively to achieve those benefits. These reviews help ensure the project stays aligned with its business objectives.","timestamp":"1732547820.0","comment_id":"1317575"},{"poster":"Examcollectorthanos","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731781800.0","content":"Very very poorly written question.

While aligning products with business objectives is important, this activity is more closely related to the overall management of the business justification and governance rather than directly ensuring effective use of outputs.\n\nB. The business case lifecycle: Incorrect. The business case lifecycle involves developing and maintaining the business justification throughout the project but does not specifically focus on the use of outputs and benefit realization.\n\nC.
