This requires identifying potential deviations and escalating them appropriately.   \nProject Manager's Role: The project manager is responsible for monitoring the overall progress of the stage and checking if it's staying within the agreed tolerances for time, cost, quality, scope, risk, and benefits.\nTeam Manager's Role: The team manager is responsible for managing a team to deliver a work package within a stage. They also monitor their work package's progress and check if it's staying within tolerance.\nIdentifying Exceptions: Both the project manager and the team manager are in positions to identify potential or actual breaches of tolerances. The team manager might identify an issue within their work package that could lead to a stage-level tolerance breach, and the project manager might identify a broader issue affecting the whole stage.","comment_id":"1313007","poster":"Examcollectorthanos","timestamp":"1731748020.0"}],"exam_id":196,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","question_images":[],"question_id":275}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":336,"provider":"Prince2","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"PRINCE2-Foundation","id":196,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":55},"__N_SSP":true}
