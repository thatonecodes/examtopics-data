It reduces testing in order to meet deadlines.\n\nThe statement about the target 'be on time and hit deadlines' for flexible delivery is that it reduces testing in order to meet deadlines.\n\nThis target is a key principle of agile development, which emphasizes the importance of delivering working software on time and responding to changing requirements. In order to meet deadlines, some teams may reduce the amount of testing that is performed on the software. While this can help to speed up the delivery process, it can also increase the risk of defects and other issues that may impact the quality of the software.\n\nSetting the project baseline at the correct level and enabling team dynamics to remain the same are not directly related to the target 'be on time and hit deadlines'. These targets are related to other aspects of agile development, such as managing project scope and fostering teamwork."},{"poster":"Gepro","timestamp":"1720266360.0","comment_id":"944595","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA is really wrong here.
