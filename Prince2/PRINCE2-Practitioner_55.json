Amend entry 21 to “appearance - 12 photos each showing different member of staff”. This statement is correct because it makes the acceptance criterion more specific and measurable. It also aligns with the purpose of the calendar project, which is to promote staff engagement and recognition.\nE. Delete entry 24 because this is NOT a suitable acceptance criteria for this project. This statement is correct because entry 24 describes a requirement that is not related to the quality or functionality of the calendar product. Therefore, it should be deleted from the PPD, as it is not a relevant criterion.\nThe other statements are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nD. Move entry 23 to derivation because data protection act already exists. This statement is incorrect because entry 23 describes a security requirement that the product must comply with, not a source product that informs its design.","poster":"ravi_aws","timestamp":"1696777980.0","comment_id":"1028089"},{"poster":"timedout","timestamp":"1632213600.0","comment_id":"448767","upvote_count":"1","content":"A - Because the original entry is not measurable?"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"timedout","timestamp":"1632100020.0","content":"Can anyone confirm here please?","comment_id":"447926"}],"answer_ET":"AC"},{"id":"VwXPrZRfy0PvIE44E3nw","choices":{"A":"The SLA must extend for the full duration of the service contract.","B":"Any changes to the SLA must be managed through formal change control.","C":"External consultants are to assist in the creation of the SLA.","D":"The selected service provider should be located locally."},"answer":"A","exam_id":197,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1028090","content":"B. Any changes to the SLA must be managed through formal change control.\n\nThis is because the web page context mentions that MFH has a quality management system that does not include change management, which implies that change control is a requirement for the SLA.

Add ‘PRINCE2 change control procedures will be used to manage any changes to baselined products’.\n\nThe Quality standards section should include the standards that will be applied to the project products and processes. Entry 4 is relevant because it specifies the industry standards for the outsourced services. Entry 5 is also relevant because it specifies the MFH document standards for the project documentation. Entry C is not relevant because it is already covered by the Roles and responsibilities section, where it states that the DIT will check the employment contracts. Entry D is relevant because it specifies how the project will manage any changes to the baselined products, which is an important aspect of quality management.
