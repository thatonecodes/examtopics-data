Raise an issue (off-specification).\n\nExplanation:\n\nAccording to the PRINCE2 project management methodology, an issue is any relevant event that has happened, was not planned, and requires management action. An off-specification is a type of issue that means something that should be provided by the project is not, or is not likely to be, provided. In this case, the service level agreement does not follow the MFH document standards, which is a requirement stated in the Quality Management Strategy. Therefore, this is an off-specification issue that needs to be raised and resolved. The other options are not appropriate because:\n\nD. No action required is not a valid option because it means ignoring the issue and continuing with the project as if nothing happened. This could lead to further problems and risks in the future, and damage the projectâ€™s reputation and credibility.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"D"},{"id":"d5EJnAISfxnZN7LLpaid","topic":"25","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/122884-exam-prince2-practitioner-topic-25-question-7-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Record an action to request that Project Assurance identify a proof-reader who can, within the next 2 days, complete the check for typographical errors.","B":"Ask the reviewers present at the meeting to conduct a proof-reading exercise and pass any comments to the author within 2 days.","C":"Contact Project Assurance to find appropriate resources to come into the review.","D":"No action required."},"question_text":"None of the reviewers have proof-reading skills.","answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-10-08 17:27:00","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1028102","upvote_count":"1","content":"The correct answer is A. Record an action to request that Project Assurance identify a proof-reader who can, within the next 2 days, complete the check for typographical errors.\n\nThis is because the Quality Management Strategy states that Project Assurance will provide assurance on the implementation of the Quality Management Strategy, which includes ensuring that the project documents are free of errors. Therefore, Project Assurance is responsible for finding a suitable proof-reader who can check the draft Quality Management Strategy for typographical errors and report them to the author.
