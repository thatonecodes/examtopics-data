The statement to delete is \"Delete entry 8 because the results of quality reviews are recorded in the Quality Register.\" This is because entry 8 mentions that approval records for products that require them will be stored in the quality database. However, this conflicts with the fact that the Quality Register will be maintained to record the planned quality events and the actual results from the quality activities, as mentioned in entry 6. Therefore, it would be appropriate to delete entry 8 to avoid duplication of effort and ensure that all relevant quality information is recorded in the Quality Register","timestamp":"1696779540.0"}],"answers_community":[],"answer":"C","question_text":"Which statement applies to the Records section?","question_id":276},{"id":"T5ZneDGfMVqkU2DlKoEK","question_id":277,"topic":"25","unix_timestamp":1696779660,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-10-08 17:41:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1028116","content":"The Roles and responsibilities section should include the roles and responsibilities of the project team members and stakeholders in relation to quality management. Entry 9 is relevant because it specifies the DIT’s role in ensuring the employment contracts comply with the law. Entry 10 is also relevant because it specifies the Team Managers’ role in providing details of quality checks. Entry 11 is also relevant because it specifies the Team Managers’ role in updating the Quality Register with the names of reviewers. Entry 12 is not relevant because it specifies the Senior User’s role in reviewing the Product Descriptions, which is not a quality management activity. The responsibility of reviewing the Product Descriptions should belong to supplier assurance, which is part of Project Assurance.
