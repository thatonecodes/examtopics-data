Cost tolerance can be fixed or flexed.\n\nIn an Agile context, the setting of the cost tolerance for a project can be fixed or flexed, depending on the specific circumstances of the project.\n\nAgile methodologies, such as Scrum, emphasize the importance of flexibility and responding to change, and this is reflected in the concept of cost tolerance. Cost tolerance refers to the amount of deviation from the planned budget that can be tolerated without requiring a change to the project baseline.","comment_id":"1014167","poster":"Djtomip","timestamp":"1727012940.0"},{"poster":"Gepro","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis must be corrected.
