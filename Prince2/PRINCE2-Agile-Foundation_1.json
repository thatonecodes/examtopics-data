Therefore, while option 3 may have some representation from the senior supplier, it is not their primary focus.

Information radiator\n\nExplanation:\nAn information radiator is a visual display that provides information to project teams and stakeholders in a readily accessible format. It typically includes items such as task boards or Kanban boards, which show the status of tasks, what work needs to be completed, and what work is in progress. The term \"information radiator\" emphasizes the idea that information is radiated or broadcasted to everyone in the vicinity, making it easy for team members to stay informed about the project's status.\n\nA. Work in progress limit: This term refers to a constraint in Kanban systems that limits the number of tasks that can be in progress at any one time.\nC. Highlight report: This is a report used in PRINCE2 to summarize the status of the project for senior management, but it is not a board displaying work to be completed.\nD. Glad! Sad!

What the MVP is\n\nExplanation:\nThe business case should clearly define what the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is. This involves specifying the core features and functionalities that must be included in the MVP to ensure that it delivers sufficient value to users and stakeholders, and to validate the project concept. This clarity helps stakeholders understand the minimum scope of the project and sets expectations for what the initial product will deliver.\n\nA. When the MVP will be defined: This might be included in a project plan or schedule, but the business case should focus on the definition and purpose of the MVP rather than its timing.\nB. That the MVP must go into operational use: While operational use might be a goal, the business case should first clarify what the MVP includes.\nD. That the MVP is the same as project viability: This is not accurate. The MVP is a part of the project that helps determine its viability, but it is not synonymous with overall project viability.","timestamp":"1731925200.0","poster":"husnus","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1213216"},{"content":"Correct answer is C","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716215220.0","poster":"SD1978","comment_id":"1075594"},{"content":"Correct Answer is B: \nDefinition: Minimum viable product\nIt is important to note that an MVP is about learning; it may not go into operational use and may be in the form of a simple experiment or prototype.","poster":"szt9","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1025184","timestamp":"1712266020.0"},{"poster":"Djtomip","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1014093","timestamp":"1711118160.0","content":"C. What the MVP is.\n\nThe business case should state what the minimum viable product (MVP) is. The MVP is the smallest set of features that will deliver value to the customer. It is the product that contains just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. The MVP is a key concept in agile development and is used to help teams focus on delivering value early in the project.\n\nThe business case should also state when the MVP will be delivered and what benefits it will bring to the organization. However, it is not necessary for the business case to state that the MVP must go into operational use, as this will depend on the specific project and its objectives. Finally, the MVP is not necessarily the same as project viability, although it is an important factor in determining whether the project is viable or not.\nWhy I have to pay to correct your answer!!!"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is C. The business case should state what the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is.\n\nThe Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a key concept in Agile project management. It refers to the smallest possible product or feature set that can be developed to satisfy the needs of the customer. The MVP is developed iteratively, with additional features and functionality added over time based on customer feedback.\n\nThe business case should clearly state what the MVP is and why it is important. It should also explain how the MVP fits into the overall project strategy and how it will be developed and tested.
