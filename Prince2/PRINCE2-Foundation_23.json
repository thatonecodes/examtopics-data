A minimum requirement for applying this theme is to define the actions needed to confirm that the project's benefits are realized. This ensures that the project delivers value and justifies the investment. The other options (A, B, and D) are related to monitoring and reporting but are not the minimum requirement for applying the Business Case theme.","comment_id":"1347981","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1125871","poster":"TaiH","timestamp":"1721301240.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI would go with C as well"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
