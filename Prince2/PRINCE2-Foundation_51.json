Project plan: Incorrect. The Project Plan is mandatory because it provides the overall baseline for the project, including the schedule, costs, and key deliverables.\n\nB. Stage plan: Incorrect. Stage Plans are mandatory for each management stage to provide detailed information on how the work for that stage will be carried out and controlled.\n\nC. Exception plan: Incorrect. Exception Plans are mandatory when a tolerance (time, cost, scope, etc.) is forecasted to be breached, as they replace the existing plan for managing the project or stage.\n\nThe Team Plan is optional because PRINCE2 allows flexibility in how work packages are managed, depending on the complexity and scale of the project.","poster":"Examcollectorthanos"},{"comment_id":"1304356","timestamp":"1730191980.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn PRINCE2, the minimum requirements for the plans theme include the necessity of a project plan and stage plans. Exception plans are created as needed when tolerances are exceeded.

The Project Plan is also updated to include any new planning information from the next Stage Plan and perhaps other forecast information.\nAt the end of the project, the Project Plan is updated by the Project Manager.
