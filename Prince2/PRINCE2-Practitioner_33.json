This was not resolved during the 'starting up the project process'.

Incorrect. The process does require a justifiable reason for the project, which seems to be provided by the identified business opportunity and the agreed need for the capability to provide health and safety training. The specific details of the project's execution can be refined during the initiation stage.\n\nB. Correct. The decision to have the 'capability to provide health and safety training' provides a clear direction and outcome for the project. This clarity allows the project to move forward into the initiation stage where the specifics of whether ABC Company will just create the course or also deliver it can be resolved. This is a reasonable application of the 'starting up a project' process as it sets a clear goal and allows for further details to be elaborated during the initiation stage.","poster":"mcesarlara","comment_id":"1250384","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721305500.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1026773","content":"B\n\nThe answer is B. Yes, because the outcome to have the ‘capability to provide health and safety training’ is clear.\n\nIn the ‘Starting up a Project’ process of PRINCE2, the aim is to do the minimum necessary just to see if it is worthwhile doing the Initiation stage. The project mandate is usually the only document that exists when this process starts, and this is not enough information for the Project Board to make the decision to start the ‘Initiating a Project’ process. Therefore, the purpose of this process is to provide the Project Board with the necessary information to judge if the project is worthwhile.\n\nIn this case, even though it was unclear whether ABC Company would just create the course or deliver it as well, the project board did agree on the need to have the ‘capability to provide health and safety training’. This clear outcome aligns with the purpose of the ‘Starting up a Project’ process in PRINCE2, making it an appropriate application of this process","timestamp":"1696606980.0","poster":"ravi_aws"}]},{"id":"ShEeLr1XPJKxtTaiGPTN","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/122700-exam-prince2-practitioner-topic-18-question-31-discussion/","answers_community":[],"question_id":164,"unix_timestamp":1696607700,"isMC":false,"timestamp":"2023-10-06 17:55:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1026778","content":"Exec, senior user, senior user","timestamp":"1696607700.0","poster":"ravi_aws"}],"exam_id":197,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04245/0028300002.jpg"],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04245/0028300001.jpg"],"answer":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\n\nDIRECTING A PROJECT -\nHere are three actions taken during the 'directing a project' process.\nWhich role (A-F) is responsible for each action?\nChoose only ONE role for each action.
