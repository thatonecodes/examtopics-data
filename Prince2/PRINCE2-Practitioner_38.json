The project will deliver “capability to provide health and safety training”, including the materials needed for classroom-based training and e-learning. The expected benefits for construction companies include a reduction in lost days and legal costs due to accidents.\nThe e-learning course will be developed by a specialist external consultancy. The materials for classroom-based training will be delivered by ABC Company’s development team. All course materials will be piloted before they are used. ABC Company will deliver training to its customers and also hopes to sell the course materials to other training companies as part of their operational business. ABC Company will use their own sales and marketing departments to promote the courses.\nThe legislation requires construction companies to comply with the new legislation within two years. The course materials and trainers have to be accredited by a government agency before courses can be delivered. ABC Company is planning to deliver pilot courses within five months of starting the project.\nThe ABC Company standard development model for new courses recommends the following stages:\n//IMG//\n\nEnd of the Project scenario.\nAdditional Information:\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) founded the company five years ago. Under her leadership, ABC Company has grown quickly into a successful training company. It delivers a range of accredited professional training.\nThe Finance Director is also a founder member of ABC Company and is responsible for authorizing budgets for the Operations and Development Teams. She authorizes all large contracts personally.\nThe Purchasing Manager reports to the Finance Director and is responsible for managing and monitoring supplier contracts.\nThe Operations Director is responsible for the delivery of all training and for the training development budget. His department organizes courses, venues and trainers. They work with the Product and the Sales teams to provide a comprehensive training schedule. ABC Company’s IT manager reports to the Operations Director.\nThe Business Development Director has recently been appointed to identify new training needs and propose new products. She will work with the Operations Director to ensure a cost-conscious approach and that appropriate development technologies are used for the health and safety course.\nThe Training Development Manager reports to the Business Development Director and is responsible for developing training materials and gaining accreditation, in accordance with the standard course development model. Course developers in his team have skills in a range of development technologies and are allocated to projects as needed.\nThe Training Delivery Manager, who reports to the Operations Director, is responsible for ensuring that internal and external trainers deliver ABC Company training courses to the required standard. He also checks course materials to ensure they are fit for purpose and of the required quality.\nThe Central Services Director has responsibility for corporate communications, facilities management and configuration management.

She helped establish the company’s document management system and now operates it across the business. She manages a team of administrators and contracts staff when workload is high.\nThe Sales Director joined ABC Company two months ago and is keen to establish himself by suggesting new markets for the courses and material. All account managers and the marketing team report to him. They promote existing training courses to other training companies and existing customers.\nEnd of the additional information.\nThe 'e-learning course' is being delivered by an external consultancy. The team manager has advised the project manager that their plan is confidential and will be displayed on their team board as a list of requirements.
