PRINCE2 is product/output/process-oriented and not work/activity-oriented.\n3.6 ''Under the principle of focus on products, PRINCE2 requires projects to be output oriented rather than work oriented. PRINCE2 calls these outputs ‘products’.An output-oriented project is one that agrees and defines the project product prior to undertaking the activities required to produce it. The set of agreed products defines the scope of a project and provides the basis for planning and control.....it reduces the risk of user dissatisfaction and acceptance disputes by agreeing, at the start, what will be produced by the project.''","timestamp":"1708592280.0","comment_id":"1156253"},{"timestamp":"1678695060.0","poster":"Darkvirusk","content":"Should be A","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"837753"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/102477-exam-prince2-foundation-topic-1-question-382-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1678695060,"question_text":"Which approach is proposed by the 'focus on products' principle?","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Relevant previous experience should be considered","D":"Stakeholder interests in the outputs should be represented at each management level","A":"Project outputs should be agreed and aligned with the business justification","B":"The project should be activity orientated to control the delivery of outputs"},"question_id":213,"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (75%)","B (25%)"],"timestamp":"2023-03-13 09:11:00","exam_id":196,"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1"},{"id":"DA3FnvCJDaRC34dmwTB9","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Authorizing an exception plan after an exception report","A":"Authorizing a request for change during a stage","D":"Authorizing a concession following an off-specification","B":"Authorizing implementation of the next delivery stage"},"question_text":"Which project board decision supports the 'manage by stages' principle?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/prince2/view/102517-exam-prince2-foundation-topic-1-question-383-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-03-13 18:20:00","exam_id":196,"question_id":214,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://prince2.wiki/principles/manage-by-stages/#:~:text=A%20PRINCE2%20Project%20is%20planned,%E2%80%9D)%20by%20the%20Project%\n20Board.&text=The%20Project%20Board%20has%20greater,also%20gives%20them%20more%20work","unix_timestamp":1678728000,"answer":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731437460.0","poster":"Examcollectorthanos","upvote_count":"1","content":"B is correct .
