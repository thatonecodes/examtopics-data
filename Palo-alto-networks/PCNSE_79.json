In both cases, decrypt a few URL Categories, listen to user feedback, run reports and check Decryption logs to ensure that decryption is working as expected, and then gradually decrypt a few more URL Categories, etc. Plan to make decryption exclusions to exclude sites from decryption if you can’t decrypt them for technical reasons or because you choose not to decrypt them.\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/decryption-best-practices/decryption-best-practices/plan-ssl-decryption-best-practice-deployment","comment_id":"764170","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_text":"An administrator is assisting a security engineering team with a decryption rollout for inbound and forward proxy traffic.
