These approaches share a common problem,\nhowever: they lack consistent and predictable performance when security services are enabled. Specifically, the base firewall functions can perform at high throughput and low latency, but when added security functions are enabled, performance decreases while latency increases. More importantly, these traditional approaches to integration limit security capabilities because a “sequence of functions” approach is inherently less flexible than one in which all functions share information and enforcement mechanisms.\nPalo Alto Networks Single-Pass Architecture addresses these performance and flexibility challenges with a unique single-pass approach to packet processing, delivering better\nperformance and security.\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/whitepapers/single-pass-parallel-processing-architecture","comment_id":"948243","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"yet_another_user","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1703707440.0","comment_id":"935680","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIs one of PANW distinguishing feature against competitors"},{"timestamp":"1701380640.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"junkicert","content":"Selected Answer: C\nsee definition of Single Pass Architecture.
