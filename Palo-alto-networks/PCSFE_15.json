The plug-in can monitor the EC2 instances in the VPC, collects the attributes assigned to the EC2 instances, and create IP-to-Tag mappings which can then be used for dynamic address groups. The plug-in polls the attributes of all the EC2 instances, not the VPCs. However... you configure the the plug-in to watch VPCs for EC2, not the EC2 instances themselves.
