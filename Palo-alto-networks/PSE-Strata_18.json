(Choose two.)","unix_timestamp":1664629500,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nExplanation:\n\n Active/Active High Availability (HA):\n Active/Active HA enables both firewalls in an HA pair to process traffic simultaneously. This setup supports scenarios like asymmetric routing, where return traffic might not follow the same path. In such cases, both firewalls are aware of the session state.\n\n Non-SYN First Packet:\n This feature allows the firewall to handle and create sessions for non-SYN packets. In asymmetric routing, the first observed packet might not be a SYN packet because the SYN could have been processed by another firewall. Enabling this ensures session establishment and proper handling of such traffic.\n\nIncorrect Options:\n\n A. Multiple Virtual Systems:\n This is used for segmentation and multi-tenancy, not for asymmetric routing.\n\n D. Asymmetric Routing Profile:\n There is no specific \"asymmetric routing profile\" feature in Palo Alto Networks firewalls. Instead, asymmetric routing is supported by configuring features like Active/Active HA and enabling non-SYN first packet processing.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"admripper","timestamp":"1733739480.0","comment_id":"1323982"},{"comment_id":"1210582","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715564100.0","content":"Selected
