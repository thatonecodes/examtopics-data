It watches a separate threat ID (failed auth attempt, which is an alert by default), and has a time event that if that monitored threat ID is triggered x times in y seconds by the same source IP, then the brute force threat is triggered, and can then take a different action such as block IP.\n\nYou would create a custom spyware profile to do the same; trigger when x has occurred y times in z seconds.\n\nA correlation object does not trigger anything.
