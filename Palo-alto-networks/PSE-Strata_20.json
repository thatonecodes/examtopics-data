Provided there's no error within the configuration to be pushed, the push will succeed.\nExplanation:\n\nThe Master Key on Panorama and managed firewalls does not affect the ability to push configuration changes. Panorama uses secure communication channels to manage firewalls, but the Master Key is specific to encrypting sensitive data (such as passwords and private keys) within a device.\n\nAs long as there are no configuration errors, Panorama can push configurations successfully, even if the Master Key values differ between Panorama and the managed firewalls. However, the Master Key settings themselves are not pushed from Panorama to the managed firewalls during configuration pushes.","comment_id":"1323434","timestamp":"1733644620.0","poster":"admripper"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721678940.0","poster":"44d0262","comment_id":"1253260","content":"A is correct.\nNo, this would not result in a commit error.\n\nThe study guide mentions that \"Administrators can commit or revert changes they make in a Panorama configuration independently of changes made by other administrators.\" This means that even if the master keys are not synced, the configuration push itself will not fail. The only issue would be that encrypted settings would not be updated.\n\nThe commit would be successful, but the desired changes to the encrypted settings would not take effect on the managed firewalls until the master keys are synced."},{"poster":"freepotatoes","timestamp":"1678356420.0","comment_id":"833819","upvote_count":"2","content":"A is correct"}],"answers_community":["B (50%)","A (50%)"],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/paloaltonetworks/comments/onz15y/what_is_the_result_if_a_panorama_administrator/","timestamp":"2023-03-09 11:07:00","answer_images":[],"question_id":99,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/101981-exam-pse-strata-topic-1-question-8-discussion/","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"8fdOl5nwwtI7MdJW700L","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721933820.0","poster":"MaxG","content":"Selected Answer: BDE\nOptions A and C are less likely correct in this context.
