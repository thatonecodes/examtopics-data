The problem is likely related to the firewall's security rules, as it is not allowing the necessary traffic for the update process to complete. By creating a security policy rule that allows the \"PaloAlto-updates\" application, the firewall will be able to connect to the update servers and download the current version of the software. Other options like static route or scheduler for timed downloads of PAN-OS software might also help but most likely security rule is the root cause.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"evdw","content":"Correct answer is D","timestamp":"1672321500.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"761075"},{"comment_id":"752597","timestamp":"1671643140.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"B is the correct answer.
