Any traffic that uses UDP or ICMP is seen will have session end reason as aged-out in the traffic log. This is because unlike TCP, there is there is no way for a graceful termination of UDP session and so aged-out is a legitimate session-end reason for UDP (and ICMP) sessions.\nLink: https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000PMjLCAW","timestamp":"1682503020.0","comment_id":"704556","upvote_count":"7","poster":"Alex48694"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1217012","poster":"cjace","content":"When investigating a log entry for a session that is allowed and has the end reason of “aged-out”, the following two fields could help in determining if this is normal:\n\nIP Protocol: The protocol used can give insight into whether an “aged-out” session end reason is expected or not12. For example, it’s normal for UDP and ICMP sessions, which are stateless protocols, to have an “aged-out” session end reason12.\nPackets sent/received: This can help determine if packets are correctly leaving the firewall1. If the ‘Packets Sent’ count in the traffic log is high, but there’s no corresponding ‘Packets Received’, it could indicate an issue such as the destination server not having an open port for the requested service, asymmetric routing, or a network path issue1.\nSo, the correct options from your list would be A.

This is because there are no such fields as \"packets sent / packets received\" in the detailed log view of a session. But the fields for \"Action\" and \"Protocol\" does exist.

When techniques such as DGA/DNS tunneling detection and machine learning are used, threats hidden within DNS traffic can be proactively identified and shared through an infinitely scalable cloud service. Because the DNS signatures and protections are stored in a cloud-based architecture, you can access the full database of ever-expanding signatures that have been generated using a multitude of data sources. This list of signatures allows you to defend against an array of threats using DNS in real-time against newly generated malicious domains. To combat future threats, updates to the analysis, detection, and prevention capabilities of the DNS Security service will be available through content releases.
