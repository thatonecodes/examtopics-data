The determination is made based on either policy or the flow’s inability to be inspected (i.e., encrypted traffic). If the flow is deemed unfit for inspection, it is offloaded to the Smart NIC, saving the need for the firewall to analyze it, which reduces load on the firewall and increases performance.","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":276,"isMC":true,"question_id":95,"answers_community":["C (75%)","A (25%)"],"answer":"C","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-04-04 06:16:00","topic":"1","question_text":"What is the correct sequence of events for offloading by the Intelligent Traffic Offload (ITO) service?","unix_timestamp":1712204160,"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/137871-exam-pcsfe-topic-1-question-93-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"PCSFE","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":276,"provider":"Palo-alto-networks","numberOfQuestions":101},"currentPage":19},"__N_SSP":true}
