Inbound decryption is where you are decrypting traffic to your internal server. You don't use a Root CA, you load that server's cert and private key.

Root certificate imported into the firewall with \"Trust\" enabled\n\nExplanation:\n\nInbound decryption on a Palo Alto Networks firewall involves decrypting traffic that is sent to servers behind the firewall (e.g., HTTPS traffic to a web server). For this to work, the firewall must have the appropriate root certificate imported and marked as \"Trusted\".\nIf the root certificate is not imported or not trusted, the firewall cannot validate the server's certificate, leading to decryption failures.","poster":"Nico1973","timestamp":"1742032200.0"},{"comment_id":"1353913","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFrom Palo Alto's TechDocs:\n\"HSM clients integrated with Palo Alto Networks firewalls and Panorama enable enhanced security for the private keys used in SSL/TLS decryption (both SSL forward proxy and SSL inbound inspection).
