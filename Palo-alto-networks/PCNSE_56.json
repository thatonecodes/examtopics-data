A syslog listener is a feature that enables the firewall or Panorama to receive syslog messages from other systems and parse them for IP address-to-username mappings. A syslog listener can collect user mapping information from a variety of sources, such as network access control systems, domain controllers, MDM solutions, VPN gateways, wireless controllers, proxies, and more. A syslog listener can also support multiple platforms and operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Therefore, a syslog listener can provide a comprehensive and flexible solution for User-ID deployment in a large-scale network.

However, you can categorize an application:\n\n1. Application override - It matches your application using source and destination address, ports, etc.\n2. Custom application - You can define a custom application with a admin-defined signature for the app id engine to match. You would have to create a security policy rule using this custom app to allow the traffic, but you won't identify the application with a security policy rule, to identify the app's patterns and create a signature you should perform a pcap.\n3.
