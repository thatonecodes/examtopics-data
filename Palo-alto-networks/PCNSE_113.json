How is that a fair comparison ? I think the comparison should be at the same security level, which is 256-bit keys ECDSA vs 3072-bit keys RSA.","comments":[{"content":"If NGFW resources are an issue, use stronger decryption for higher-priority traffic and use less processor-intensive decryption for lower-priority traffic until you can increase the available resources. For example, you could use RSA instead of ECDHE and ECDSA for traffic that isn’t sensitive or high-priority. This preserves NGFW resources for PFS-based decryption of higher priority, sensitive traffic. (You’re still decrypting and inspecting the lower-priority traffic, but trading off consuming fewer computational resources with using algorithms that aren’t as secure as PFS.)","comments":[{"content":"The above state what palo alto said, but I still think this is a stupid problem.\n\nEven though ECDSA uses large keys, they are significantly smaller than in the case of RSA. For ECDSA to reach the 128-bit security standard, it’s enough to use 256-bit keys. In comparison, RSA needs at least 3072-bit keys to match the same standard. Regardless of the smaller keys in use, ECDSA provides the same level of security as RSA. The smaller key size also makes ECDSA a perfect algorithm for mobile applications because they require less bandwidth.","comment_id":"1359411","poster":"JackyCCK","timestamp":"1740075540.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"JackyCCK","timestamp":"1740075540.0","comment_id":"1359410"}],"comment_id":"1359409","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JackyCCK"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAn administrator has a Palo Alto Networks NGFW.
