Some applications, however, require the firewall to dynamically open pinholes to establish the connection, determine the parameters for the session and negotiate the ports that will be used for the transfer of data; these applications use the application-layer payload to communicate the dynamic TCP or UDP ports on which the application opens data connections. For such applications, the firewall serves as an Application Level Gateway (ALG), and it opens a pinhole for a limited time and for exclusively transferring data or control traffic. The firewall also performs a NAT rewrite of the payload when necessary.\n\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/app-id/application-level-gateways#","comment_id":"136912"},{"upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"119894","timestamp":"1608941400.0","content":"Correct: A,C\n\n\"Signatures are then applied to allowed traffic to identify the application based on unique application properties and related [transaction characteristics].
