The ability to exclude entries from an external dynamic list gives you the option to enforce policy on some (but not all) of the entries in a list. This is helpful if you cannot edit the contents of an external dynamic list (such as the Palo Alto Networks High-Risk IP Addresses feed) because it comes from a third-party source.","poster":"khaled_ellaboudy","timestamp":"1676513460.0","comment_id":"810193","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"809779","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSelect up to 100 entries to exclude from the list and click Submit or manually Add a list exception.","poster":"DlaEdu_Ex","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676481000.0"},{"comment_id":"798541","timestamp":"1675560600.0","poster":"83KG","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/policy/use-an-external-dynamic-list-in-policy/exclude-entries-from-an-external-dynamic-list","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_text":"An administrator is trying to enforce policy on some (but not all) of the entries in an external dynamic list.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of entries that they can be excluded?","answer_images":[],"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":414,"id":273,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Palo-alto-networks","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"name":"PCNSA","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":37},"__N_SSP":true}
