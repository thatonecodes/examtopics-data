This is a fundamental design of the firewall's architecture to ensure clear and logical traffic segmentation.\n\nZones are used to group interfaces for applying security policies, and each interface must belong to exactly one zone to ensure proper policy enforcement. Traffic between zones is inspected and controlled based on security rules, while traffic within the same zone does not require a policy unless intra-zone security rules are defined.","poster":"mirko1976","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1331569"},{"poster":"mirko1976","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn a Palo Alto Networks firewall, an interface can only be assigned to one zone at a time.
