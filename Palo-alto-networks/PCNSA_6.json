Multiple applications and multiple application filters can be combined into an application group. One or more application groups then also can be combined into one application group.

For example, if you want to allow all audio streaming applications, you could create an application filter that includes the subcategory of audio-streaming, which automatically would add all applications to the filter from the App-ID database that are subcategorized as audio-streaming. The filter then would be added as an application to a Security policy rule. Application filters simplify the process of ensuring that all applications that meet any attribute automatically are added to a Security policy.","timestamp":"1685031840.0","poster":"H3kerman","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"486853"}],"timestamp":"2021-11-20 01:32:00","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"An Application Group is a static way of grouping applications and cannot be configured as a nested member of Application Group.","D":"An Application Filter is a static way of grouping applications and can be configured as a nested member of an Application Group.","B":"An Application Group is a dynamic way of grouping applications and can be configured as a nested member of an Application Group.","C":"An Application Filter is a dynamic way to group applications and can be configured as a nested member of an Application Group."},"question_id":26,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/66367-exam-pcnsa-topic-1-question-122-discussion/","exam_id":273,"question_images":[],"question_text":"How are Application Filters or Application Groups used in firewall policy?","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1637368320,"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"kBUw2V08tvvBDLsrqUXw","topic":"1","question_text":"Which tab would an administrator click to create an address object?","choices":{"D":"Policies","A":"Objects","B":"Monitor","C":"Device"},"discussion":[{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722562260.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.","comment_id":"1138083"},{"poster":"H3kerman","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1653495900.0","content":"To create an address object, perform the following steps:\n1.
