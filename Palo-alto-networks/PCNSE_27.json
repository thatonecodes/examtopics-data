You can create an SSL/TLS service profile to define the <<server certificate>>, SSL/TLS protocol versions, and ciphers supported for connections to these services. Cipher suites are automatically selected based on the protocol versions chosen. However, you can disable individual ciphers as needed. If a service request involves a protocol version outside the specified range, the firewall or Panorama appliance downgrades or upgrades the connection to a supported version. To activate an SSL/TLS service profile, attach the profile to the settings for a specific service.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I think the grammar is the confusing bit.

In most cases, PAN-OS systems should use a certificate obtained from an Enterprise Certificate Authority (CA), or a trusted external CA, like VeriSign. Since the certificate is trusted already, it simplifies the certificate setup on connector systems. You can also export the certificate from the PAN-OS system and import it into all systems running the connector.
