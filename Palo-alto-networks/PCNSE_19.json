By default Panorama will share ALL objects whether or not they are used by members of the device group. Ticking the option above DISABLES that function forcing Panorama to only send objects that are used by the members of service groups. I swear a lot of PAN articles need proper grammar checks as they confuse learners. Even the aforementioned phrase should be changed to something like:\n\n\"DISABLE sharing unused address and service objects with devices\"\n\nSee how much more clear that option now is? I think I will contact PAN customer support to factor this change.
