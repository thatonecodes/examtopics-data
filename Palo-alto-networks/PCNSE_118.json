The active firewall, which then synchronizes to the passive firewall\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen pushing a configuration from Panorama to a pair of firewalls configured in an active/passive High Availability (HA) pair, the following process occurs:\n\nPanorama sends the configuration to the active firewall:\nPanorama communicates directly with the active firewall in the HA pair and pushes the new configuration to it.\nThe active firewall synchronizes the configuration to the passive firewall:\nAfter receiving the configuration, the active firewall automatically synchronizes the configuration to the passive firewall to ensure both devices have the same settings.\nThis approach ensures consistency between the active and passive firewalls and avoids configuration mismatches that could cause issues during failover.","comment_id":"1398805"},{"comment_id":"1138833","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722621960.0","poster":"scanossa","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI set up a lab with an HA pair, both devices received the configuration in their respective template stack and then, performed a commit.
