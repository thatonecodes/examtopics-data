Specify files to be forwarded for analysis based on application, file type, and transmission direction (upload or download). Files or email links matched to the profile rule are forwarded to either the WildFire public cloud or the WildFire private cloud (hosted with a WF-500 appliance), depending on the analysis location defined for the rule. If a profile rule is set to forward files to the WildFire public cloud, the firewall also forwards files that match existing antivirus signatures, in addition to unknown files.","poster":"gabbar","comment_id":"1212362","timestamp":"1731756240.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"2024-05-16 11:24:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Advanced threat prevention","C":"WildFire analysis","D":"Content-ID","B":"Vulnerability profile"}},{"id":"AwtA7UIJDXGD3ahkHQ2R","exam_id":273,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["ACD (54%)","ABC (46%)"],"timestamp":"2024-05-10 00:02:00","unix_timestamp":1715292120,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/140243-exam-pcnsa-topic-1-question-392-discussion/","topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_id":323,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"ACD","question_text":"In which three places on the PAN-OS interface can the application characteristics be found?
