There are no public IP addresses available, resulting in the server sharing NAT IP 198.51.100.88 with another DMZ serve that uses IP address 192.168.197.60. Firewall security and NAT rules have been configured. The application team has confirmed that the new server is able to establish a secure connection to an external database with IP address 203.0.113.40.\n\nThe database team reports that they are unable to establish a secure connection to 198.51.100.88 from 203.0.113.40. However, it confirms a successful ping test to 198.51.100.88.\n\nReferring to the NAT configuration and traffic logs provided how can the firewall engineer resolve the situation and ensure inbound and outbound connections work concurrently for both DMZ servers?\n\n//IMG//","discussion":[{"poster":"af67d32","timestamp":"1739390580.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA: irrelevant\nB: works --> \nStatic IP—The same address is always used for the translation and the port is unchanged. For example, if the source range is 192.168.0.1—192.168.0.10 and the translation range is 10.0.0.1—10.0.0.10, address 192.168.0.2 is always translated to 10.0.0.2.

Antivirus updates only address known threats that have already been analyzed and added to the signature database. Even with frequent updates, there’s always a time gap between the discovery of new malware and its inclusion in the database, leaving the network vulnerable to zero-day threats.\n\nEnabling Hold Mode goes a step further by providing proactive protection. It delays file delivery until WildFire has completed its real-time analysis, ensuring that even newly discovered malware is blocked before it can pass through. This makes Hold Mode far more effective at addressing unknown or rapidly spreading threats than simply relying on frequent antivirus updates.\n\nIn short, while antivirus updates are important for overall protection, they don’t offer the same level of real-time defense against new threats that Hold Mode and WildFire provide."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729757340.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\na","poster":"omgt2k2","comment_id":"1302363"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA- this can be configured with real-time wildfire\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/advanced-wildfire/administration/configure-advanced-wildfire-analysis/enable-hold-mode-for-real-time-signature-lookup","timestamp":"1727471340.0","poster":"xinu72","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1290362"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1726572480.0","poster":"apiloran","comment_id":"1285169","content":"Selected Answer: A\nYou can configure the NGFW to hold the transfer of a sample while the real-time signature cloud performs a signature lookup.
