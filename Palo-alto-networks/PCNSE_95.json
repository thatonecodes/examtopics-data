Hello messages are sent from one peer to the other at the configured Hello Interval to verify the state of the firewall. The heartbeat is an ICMP ping to the HA peer over the control link, and the peer responds to the ping to establish that the firewalls are connected and responsive. By default, the interval for the heartbeat is 1000 milliseconds. A ping is sent every 1000 milliseconds and if there are three consecutive heartbeat losses, a failovers occurs.
