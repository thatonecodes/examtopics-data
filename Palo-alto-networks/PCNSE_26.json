GlobalProtect.\n\nGlobalProtect is a VPN solution that provides secure remote access to corporate networks. When a user connects to GlobalProtect, their identity is verified against an LDAP server. This ensures that all IP address-to-user mappings are explicitly known.\n\nThe other options are not as secure as GlobalProtect.\n\nOption A, LDAP Server Profile configuration, allows for the configuration of multiple LDAP servers. This can make it difficult to track all IP address-to-user mappings.\nOption C, Windows-based User-ID agent, relies on the Windows operating system to provide user identity. This can be less secure than using an LDAP server, as the Windows operating system is more susceptible to attack.\nOption D, PAN-OS integrated User-ID agent, uses a local database to store user mappings. This database can be easily compromised, making it less secure than using an LDAP server."},{"comment_id":"843355","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

If you are using the User-ID Agent to parse AD security event logs, syslog messages, or the XML API to obtain User-ID mappings, then WMI probing should be disabled.
