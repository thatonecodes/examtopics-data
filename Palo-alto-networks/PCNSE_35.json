Option D is not true because Zone Protection Profiles protect System (Firewall) Resources within the complete zone on which it's applied (remember ZP is granular, you decide where and where not to place it).\n\nOption C could be true, but assuming the question, the admin already has fws in the perimeter area, if he didn't, the SE wouldn't suggest to put the fws close to the servers and organizational systems.\n\nRegards.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1305535"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B.
