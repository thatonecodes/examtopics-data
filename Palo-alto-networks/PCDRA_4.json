This type of communication allows data transfers in real-time by keeping sessions for a longer durations. When you perform one of these critical response actions from the Cortex XDR management console, the Cortex XDR instance establishes a session between the instance itself and the targeted endpoint. Then, the session is kept alive even after the response action is complete. Live Terminal is among these response actions.","poster":"9smiles","timestamp":"1732607040.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"907090"}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"when the Cortex XDR agent uploads alert data","D":"when the Cortex XDR agent establishes a bidirectional communication channel","C":"when the Cortex XDR agent connects to WildFire to upload files for analysis","A":"when the Cortex XDR agent downloads new security content"},"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/110272-exam-pcdra-topic-1-question-25-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_id":18,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-26 07:44:00","unix_timestamp":1685079840,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"D3BCa3gKkufc1lVt5juK","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/110282-exam-pcdra-topic-1-question-26-discussion/","exam_id":272,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"With a Cortex XDR Prevent license, which objects are considered to be sensors?","question_id":19,"topic":"1","answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-05-26 09:52:00","unix_timestamp":1685087520,"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Third-Party security devices","D":"Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls","A":"Syslog servers","C":"Cortex XDR agents"},"discussion":[{"poster":"Chiquitabandita","timestamp":"1727100180.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://pupuweb.com/pcdra-exam-question-answer-cortex-xdr-prevent-license-objects-sensors/","comment_id":"1180997","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1700992320.0","content":"Answer I think is: C\n\nSyslog Collector is not included in XDR Prevent, only Pro Pr.
