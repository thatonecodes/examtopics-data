It provides services such as flow control, error correction, and quality of service management.\n PDU in the Transport Layer: At the Transport layer, the PDU is called a packet. This packet contains the data sent from the upper layer (such as the Application layer) and adds control information necessary to ensure proper delivery and handling of the data.\n\n Data Link Layer: In contrast to the Transport layer, the PDU at the Data Link layer is called a frame. This layer is responsible for data transmission over a physical link between two devices on a local network.\n\n Network Layer: At the Network layer, the PDU is referred to as a datagram.
