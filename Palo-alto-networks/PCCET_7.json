This approach is known as the \"Waterfall\" method, where development and testing phases were completed first, and security checks were performed just before deployment.

An IPsec VPN requires compatible VPN client software to be installed on the endpoint device. A group password or key is required for configuration. Client-server IPsec VPNs typically require user action to initiate the connection, such as launching the client software and logging in with a username and password. A security association (SA) in IPsec defines how two or more entities will securely communicate over the network using IPsec. A single Internet Key Exchange (IKE) SA is established between communicating entities to initiate the IPsec VPN tunnel. Separate IPsec SAs are then established for each communication direction in a VPN session. An IPsec VPN can be configured to force all of the user’s internet traffic back through an organization’s firewall, thus providing optimal protection with enterprise-grade security but with some performance loss. Or split tunneling can be configured to allow internet traffic from the device to go directly to the internet, while other specific types of traffic route through the IPsec tunnel, for acceptable protection with much less performance degradation.","timestamp":"1725828060.0","comments":[{"poster":"blahblah1234567890000","content":"Secure Sockets Layer: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an asymmetric encryption protocol used to secure communication sessions. SSL has been superseded by Transport Layer Security (TLS), although SSL still is the more commonly used terminology. An SSL VPN can be deployed as an agent-based or agentless browser-based connection. An agentless SSL VPN requires users only to launch a web browser, open a VPN portal or webpage using the HTTPS protocol, and log in to the network with their user credentials. An agent-based SSL client is used within the browser session, which persists only while the connection is active and removes itself when the connection is closed. This type of VPN can be particularly useful for remote users that are connecting from an endpoint device they do not own or control, such as a hotel kiosk, where full client VPN software cannot be installed. SSL VPN technology has become the de facto standard and preferred method of connecting remote endpoint devices back to the enterprise network, and IPsec is most commonly used in site-to-site or device-to-device VPN connections, such as connecting a branch office network to a headquarters location network or data center.","timestamp":"1725828180.0","comment_id":"664004","upvote_count":"1"}]}],"poster":"blahblah1234567890000","timestamp":"1725827940.0"}]}]},{"id":"1KeVzaxXkgJqXbthOcj3","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"It provides prevention, detection, response, and investigation of attacks and threats by gathering and integrating all security data.","B":"It helps with the coordination, execution, and automation of tasks between people and tools for faster response to cybersecurity attacks.","A":"It records, monitors, correlates, and analyzes the security events in an IT environment in real time.","C":"It collects, integrates, and normalizes your security data to simplify your security operations."},"question_id":34,"question_text":"What is the function of SOAR?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/105000-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-152-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nShould be B","comment_id":"1263824","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723357680.0","poster":"vosicma"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree with Syfusion, also Study guide p211\nKey Idea (of SOAR)\nSOAR tools ingest aggregated alerts from detection sources (such as SIEMs, network security tools, and mailboxes) before executing automatable, process-driven playbooks to enrich and respond to these alerts.","comment_id":"955259","timestamp":"1689677400.0","poster":"Blender808"},{"timestamp":"1687214940.0","poster":"Syfusion","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B\nStudy Guide page 263 definition of SOAR\n\"Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR): Technology that helps\ncoordinate, execute, and automate tasks between various people and tools, allowing\ncompanies to respond quickly to cybersecurity attacks and improve their overall security\nposture.
