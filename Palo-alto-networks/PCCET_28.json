Endpoint antivirus software\n\nEndpoint antivirus software is designed to scan and detect viruses and malware on individual devices (endpoints) such as computers and mobile devices. It provides an additional layer of defense beyond the perimeter firewall by actively scanning files, processes, and network activity on the endpoint itself. This helps to identify and block threats that may bypass the perimeter firewall's initial inspection.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not specifically focused on antivirus protection and do not address the need to block viruses that might evade the perimeter firewall.","comment_id":"1056803","timestamp":"1714386480.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nEncryption doesn't block viruses.

Dynamic routing is considered easy to configure on large networks, and also, it is more intuitive than static routing at a selection of the best route, detection of the route changes, and also a discovery of the remote networks."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA static routing protocol requires that routes be created and updated manually on a router or other network device. If a static route is down, traffic can’t be automatically rerouted unless an alternate route has been configured. Also, if the route is congested, traffic can’t be automatically rerouted over the less congested alternate route. Static routing is practical only in very small networks or for very limited, special-case routing scenarios (for example, a destination that’s used as a backup route or is reachable only via a single router). However, static routing has low bandwidth requirements (routing information isn’t broadcast across the network) and some built-in security (users can route only to destinations that are specified in statically defined routes).","timestamp":"1694117760.0","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"timestamp":"1694444340.0","comment_id":"666225","poster":"blahblah1234567890000","content":"The answer could be both a and d since both apply here but its asking specifically about which is quicker so I choose A.","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"blahblah1234567890000","comment_id":"662857"}],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1662581760,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_id":138,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"4nqUZVhowxxnAwU03KPz","timestamp":"2022-09-11 17:04:00","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/81690-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-82-discussion/","answer_images":[],"exam_id":270,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nExamples of serverless environments include Amazon Lambda and Azure Functions. Many PaaS offerings, such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry, also are effectively serverless even if they have not historically been marketed as such.
