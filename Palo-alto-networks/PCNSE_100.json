Profile will classify traffic and apply bandwidths. QoS is always applied to egress interface(s). Pay attention to answer E. QoS on the egress interface for the traffic flows <------ it says \"for traffic flows\" (not flow-it's plural). Session is two flows...from client/initiator to responder/server is one flow and return traffic from responder/server to client/initiator is second flow. For traffic from client to server egress interface will usually be external facing interface. For return traffic from server to client egress interface will be other, usually internal facing interface. They are both egress interfaces depending on the direction of the traffic.

If you don't want to tamper with the ALG of the SIP application, you can always configure an app-override policy for the networks of VoIP devices that are experiencing issues. With this approach, you can reduce the volume of VoIP traffic by avoiding sudden disconnections and their subsequent connection attempts.\nC: To monitor the bandwidth consumed by VoIP applications (SIP and RTP), you can configure a Quality of Service (QoS) profile and define a class for these applications.\nD: To view the bandwidth consumed by VoIP applications (SIP and RTP), you need to enable QoS on the input interface to be able to see QoS statistics and monitor in real-time the bandwidth used by these applications.
