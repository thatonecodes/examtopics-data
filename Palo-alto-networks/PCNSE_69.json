When the egress guaranteed bandwidth is exceeded, the firewall passes traffic on a best-effort basis. Bandwidth that is guaranteed but is unused continues to remain available for all traffic. Depending on your QoS configuration, you can guarantee bandwidth for a single QoS class, for all or some clear text traffic, and for all or some tunneled traffic.\nExample:\nClass 1 traffic has 5 Gbps of egress guaranteed bandwidth, which means that 5 Gbps is available but is not reserved for class 1 traffic. If Class 1 traffic does not use or only partially uses the guaranteed bandwidth, the remaining bandwidth can be used by other classes of traffic. However, during high traffic periods, 5 Gbps of bandwidth is absolutely available for class 1 traffic. During these periods of congestion, any Class 1 traffic that exceeds 5 Gbps is best effort\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/quality-of-service/qos-concepts/qos-bandwidth-management","comment_id":"972792","poster":"Betty2022","timestamp":"1707127560.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706663700.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI'm leaning towards B. Here's why:\n\nA seems irrelevent. The question is about classes 3,5, and 7.

Although I believe this would only be dropped in times of congestion since the traffic above the guaranteed bandwidth is still forwarded as best effort. \n\nC isnt accurate. Egress max is the most a class can forward. This makes it sound as if guaranteed or not.\n\nD Nothing is hitting the egress max so this seems irrelevant.","poster":"sov4","comment_id":"967576"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1687346160.0","content":"Answer B:\n325+470+330 > 1000 Egress Max","poster":"Kaspinas","comment_id":"752338"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB as per @confusion","timestamp":"1687316880.0","comment_id":"751888","poster":"19216855"},{"comment_id":"733207","comments":[{"content":"Should be B, no unused bandwidth, the 3 classes already exceeded the interface maximum so QoS will kick in","timestamp":"1686589860.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"obatel","comment_id":"743232"}],"poster":"mz101","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1685654820.0","content":"Should be C.
