In CI, developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, and automated build and test processes are triggered to ensure the code integrates properly and does not break existing functionality. This allows for early detection of issues, faster feedback, and smoother integration of changes.\nContinuous deployment (CD) goes a step further than continuous integration by automatically deploying code to production after passing automated tests. However, continuous integration focuses primarily on testing and integrating code changes and doesn’t necessarily involve direct deployment to production, making it the best fit for the description of replacing manual checks with automated testing.","comment_id":"1309350","upvote_count":"2","poster":"PurpleRain28","timestamp":"1731228840.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"stxc","comment_id":"1305540","timestamp":"1730395020.0","content":"I think it might be \"Continuous Integration\"."}],"answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"question_id":76,"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1730395020,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"xxxl83vLg18sumsszX4p","topic":"1","answer":"D","timestamp":"2024-10-26 22:30:00","exam_id":270,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/150329-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-237-discussion/","question_id":77,"choices":{"D":"Block outbound command-and-control (C2) communications.","A":"Gain visibility into all network traffic.","C":"Restrict the attackers’ lateral movement within the network.","B":"Effective end-user security awareness training."},"isMC":true,"question_text":"What is the key to breaking the cyberattack lifecycle during the installation phase?","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1729974600,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1303417","upvote_count":"1","poster":"stxc","content":"Correct answer: C (Restrict the attackers' lateral movement within the network.","timestamp":"1729974600.0"}],"answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"9qQnXo4gV5K5L78nW6Vm","choices":{"D":"Zero-day threat","A":"Breach time","B":"Dwell time","C":"Exposure window"},"question_id":78,"question_text":"The vulnerability time period from when a new, unknown threat occurs until security vendors release a signature file or security patch is known as what?","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-10-16 03:26:00","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1298496","timestamp":"1729041960.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\ncorrect is C","upvote_count":"2","poster":"vriper"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1729041960,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/149586-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-239-discussion/","exam_id":270,"answer":"C"},{"id":"piQoV2FNT8iafO5pvIJk","exam_id":270,"question_images":[],"question_id":79,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725163920.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/security-operations-automation","poster":"error_909","comment_id":"558607","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"Systems that allow for accelerated incident response through the execution of standardized and automated playbooks that work upon inputs from security technology and other data flows are known as what?","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1646115120,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/72191-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-24-discussion/","choices":{"A":"XDR","B":"STEP","C":"SOAR","D":"SIEM"},"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-03-01 07:12:00","answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","answer_images":[]},{"id":"FiifxkCI1BrJsGSddyW0","answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":270,"question_id":80,"question_text":"Which of these features is part of Prisma Access security services?","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-10-16 03:29:00","unix_timestamp":1729042140,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/149587-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-245-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1315924","content":"Note: I found that Both B.
