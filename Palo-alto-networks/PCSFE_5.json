Protecting this traffic flow is critical as it can prevent external threats from entering the network and block outbound communication to malicious sites.\n\nInbound traffic (C): This includes traffic coming into the network from external sources. By inspecting and securing inbound traffic, zero-day threats can be stopped before they reach internal resources.\n\nEast-west traffic (E): This is the traffic that moves laterally within a data center or network. Protecting east-west traffic helps prevent the spread of threats once they have entered the network, limiting the damage that zero-day attacks can cause within the internal environment.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: ACD\nOf the listed options, only inbound traffic flow inspection can directly protect against zero-day attacks.\n\nHere's why the other options are less effective:\n* Outbound: This inspects traffic leaving the network, which wouldn't necessarily catch malicious code entering from outside.\n* North-south: This refers to traffic between the internet and the internal network, which includes both inbound and outbound traffic. While inbound traffic is part of north-south flow, it's not the only component.\n* Internal: This inspects traffic within the internal network, useful for malware detection but not specifically zero-day attacks at the entry point.\n* East-west: Similar to internal traffic, this focuses on communication between devices within the network, not necessarily catching external threats.\n\nTherefore, the most relevant option for zero-day protection is \"C\": Inbound\n\nBy inspecting inbound traffic, firewalls can potentially identify and block suspicious activity even if it exploits an unknown vulnerability (zero-day).","poster":"Doobiedoo","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I choose \"\"Outbound\", \"Inbound\", and \"Internal\" because those are terms used with the official IronSkillet object tags and security profile names.
