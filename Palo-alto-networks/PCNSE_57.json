This API call should trigger the commit process in Panorama to save all configuration changes. This step should be scheduled to occur before or after the scheduled Config Push, depending on your specific workflow.\n\nThis combination of scheduled Config Push and a separate API call to commit changes allows you to control and automate the process of ensuring that all configurations are committed and pushed to the devices at the desired time.
