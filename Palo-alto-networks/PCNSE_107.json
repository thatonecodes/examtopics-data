Source NAT changes the source IP address of a packet as it traverses the firewall, typically to allow internal hosts to access the internet using a public IP address.\n\nBy filtering the session table with “filter nat source”, the administrator can see the original source IP address, the translated source IP address, and other details about the active NAT sessions. This information is useful for troubleshooting NAT-related issues, monitoring traffic patterns, and analyzing the utilization of NAT resources.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1235961","timestamp":"1719168780.0","poster":"nebulanerd"},{"comment_id":"1226082","timestamp":"1717759260.0","poster":"Cro13","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA because D is not a valid command"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA) shows all source sessions, correct answer\nB) shows oversubscription ratio, number of allocates etc.\nC) shows the nat policy configuration\nD) \"nat-rule-source\" doesn't exist, but show session all filter nat-rule-source <policy> would show sessions only for one policy","timestamp":"1712395680.0","poster":"findkeywordcommand","comment_id":"1190324"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1188885","poster":"[Removed]","content":"https://theworldsgonemad.net/2022/palo-sessions/","timestamp":"1712175060.0"},{"comment_id":"1185295","timestamp":"1711702080.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nshow session all filter nat source","poster":"JohnnyCambodia"}],"unix_timestamp":1711702080,"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"exam_id":274,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-03-29 09:48:00","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Palo-alto-networks","isBeta":false,"name":"PCNSE","id":274,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":619},"currentPage":107},"__N_SSP":true}
