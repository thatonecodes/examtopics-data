It operates in a passive mode, where it copies traffic for analysis without impacting the original traffic. This means you can gain visibility into segment X without changing the routing or IP configurations.\n\nMinimum Service Interruptions: Since the TAP interface is passive and does not actively participate in routing or affecting traffic, it minimizes service interruptions. It won't introduce any routing changes or disruptions to segment X.\n\nNo IP Changes: The administrator wants to avoid making IP changes, and configuring a TAP interface allows you to do just that.
