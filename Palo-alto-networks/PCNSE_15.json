Each router has a [data plane], which holds the information, and a [control plane], which tells the data where to go. Where data flows is typically determined by a network engineer or administrator who writes rules and policies, often manually, for each router on the network – a process that can be time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nSD-WAN separates the control and management processes from the underlying networking hardware, making them available as software that can be easily configured and deployed. A centralized control pane means network administrators can write new rules and policies, and then configure and deploy them across an entire network at once.\n\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-sd-wan","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ChiaPet75","timestamp":"1607805600.0","comment_id":"108919"}],"question_id":71,"unix_timestamp":1589902920},{"id":"zS9QZgnOlTcjVo3JzJwu","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/47742-exam-pcnse-topic-1-question-163-discussion/","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Updates to dynamic user group membership are automatic therefore using dynamic user groups instead of static group objects allows you to:","choices":{"C":"respond to changes in user behaviour or potential threats without automatic policy changes","B":"respond to changes in user behaviour or potential threats without manual policy changes","D":"respond to changes in user behaviour and confirmed threats with manual policy changes","A":"respond to changes in user behaviour or potential threats using manual policy changes"},"question_images":[],"answer":"B","answer_description":"","exam_id":274,"unix_timestamp":1616177940,"discussion":[{"content":"common sense question, B","timestamp":"1641021180.0","comment_id":"395537","poster":"Prutser2","upvote_count":"6"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1722013320.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1132790","poster":"Marshpillowz"},{"comment_id":"706394","timestamp":"1682681160.0","poster":"lol12","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB\nCommon sense"},{"timestamp":"1671686760.0","comment_id":"620128","poster":"UFanat","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is a correct answer","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"315073","poster":"mmed","upvote_count":"3","content":"CORRECT B \nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-new-features/user-id-features/dynamic-user-groups","timestamp":"1632068340.0"}],"question_id":72,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2021-03-19 19:19:00"},{"id":"FwtWqGkzXkFckvA7uo9m","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/47744-exam-pcnse-topic-1-question-164-discussion/","exam_id":274,"discussion":[{"poster":"mmed","timestamp":"1632068520.0","comment_id":"315076","upvote_count":"7","content":"confirm c \nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-new-features/globalprotect-features/identification-and-quarantine-of-compromised-devices.html"},{"comment_id":"558551","upvote_count":"5","content":"After you identify a device as compromised (for example, if a device has been infected with malware and is performing command and control actions), you can manually add the device’s Host ID to a quarantine list and configure GlobalProtect to prevent users from connecting to the GlobalProtect gateway from a quarantined device.
