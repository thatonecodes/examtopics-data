An administrator is using DNAT to map two servers to a single public IP address. Traffic will be steered to the specific server based on the application, where Host A (10.1.1.100) receives HTTP traffic and Host B (10.1.1.101) receives SSH traffic.\n//IMG//\n\nWhich two Security policy rules will accomplish this configuration?

Understanding DNAT in this scenario:\nPublic IP (1.1.1.100) is mapped to two different private IPs based on the destination port.\nHTTP (Port 80) → 10.1.1.100\nSSH (Port 22) → 10.1.1.101\n\n2. How security policies evaluate traffic in DNAT?\nSecurity policies use post-NAT (translated) IP addresses when defining the destination.\nHowever, in some cases, you may also need to define rules for pre-NAT addresses depending on the firewall behavior.\n\nChecking Answer Choices:\n\nA. Incorrect – Uses 1.1.1.100 (pre-NAT) as the destination, but for SSH, the correct post-NAT IP is 10.1.1.101.\nB. Incorrect – The destination should be DMZ, not Untrust.\nC. Incorrect – Uses Untrust to Untrust, which is incorrect. The policy should be from Untrust to DMZ.\nD. Correct – Covers traffic from Untrust to DMZ, allowing SSH (for 10.1.1.101) and Web Browsing (for 10.1.1.100).\nE. Correct – Covers web-browsing (Port 80) but uses 1.1.1.100 (pre-NAT). Some firewall configurations require allowing traffic to the public IP before NAT is applied.","timestamp":"1739183100.0","comment_id":"1354414"},{"timestamp":"1732539660.0","poster":"de7cdfd","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA, E are correct","comment_id":"1317482"},{"comment_id":"1235434","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1719066540.0","content":"A, E are correct","poster":"Janhattal"},{"timestamp":"1688371500.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nTo define Destination, Security policy uses Post-NAT zone and Pre-NAT address","poster":"DlaEdu_Ex","comment_id":"941614","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"Selected Answer: DE\nIf we check DNAT, HTTP is for 1.1.1.100 so answer E\nAnd answer E is for the 2 DNAT and correct ports","timestamp":"1687699440.0","poster":"skaez","comment_id":"933630","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"898977","comments":[{"timestamp":"1684224240.0","content":"i was worng sorry","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"898981","poster":"blu_gandalf"}],"timestamp":"1684224120.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"i think its D , E","poster":"blu_gandalf"},{"poster":"ntir","comment_id":"809506","timestamp":"1676464740.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"A and E"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Oteslar","comment_id":"743872","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA and E are correct answers.","timestamp":"1670926380.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"779773","comments":[{"poster":"blahblah1234567890000","timestamp":"1674032100.0","content":"Nevermind I misread the IP.","comment_id":"779774","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1674032100.0","content":"I dont understand how a could possibly be correct since the other server is supposed to get the SSH traffic.","poster":"blahblah1234567890000","upvote_count":"1"}]}]},{"id":"dyjXEySjR9YeLanQgAS2","timestamp":"2022-12-13 11:24:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Slicklinton","timestamp":"1723627980.0","comment_id":"1150153","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct."},{"timestamp":"1686644640.0","poster":"Oteslar","content":"Selected Answer: B\nVulnerability Protection Security Profiles protect against threats entering the network. For example, Vulnerability Protection Security Profiles protect against buffer overflows, illegal code execution, and other attempts to exploit system vulnerabilities. The default Vulnerability Protection Security Profile protects clients and servers from all known critical-, high-, and medium-severity threats.
