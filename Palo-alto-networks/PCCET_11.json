The attacker’s goal is to trick victims into connecting to their fake access point rather than the legitimate one. Once connected, the attacker can intercept and potentially redirect the victim's web traffic, serving content from a web server they control. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing login credentials or injecting malware.\nMeddler-in-the-middle: This is not a commonly recognized term for a specific attack. It seems like a play on \"Man-in-the-Middle\" (MitM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between two parties. While a \"Meddler-in-the-middle\" could conceptually refer to an attacker in a similar role, it's not a standard term for a Wi-Fi attack."}],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":270,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"Uj5qTQV327l1hXiWWOox","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/116230-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-182-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-07-23 21:41:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"IaaS","D":"PaaS","A":"SaaS","B":"FWaaS"},"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Web 2.0 applications provide which type of service?","topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":270,"question_id":53,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732363140.0","comment_id":"1316652","upvote_count":"1","poster":"3fd692e","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSaaS makes the most sense in the context of the question.
