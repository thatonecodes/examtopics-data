The Application Override Policy Match is indeed a part of the application identification process in the packet flow within Palo Alto’s PAN-OS12345.\n\nApplication Override policies are used when you want to override the application that the firewall has identified2. These policies bypass layer 7 processing and threat inspection and instead use less secure stateful layer 4 inspection2. They prevent the firewall from performing layer 7 application identification and layer 7 threat inspection and prevention2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A. pattern based application identification and B. application override policy match."},{"timestamp":"1732250520.0","comment_id":"1215364","content":"During the packet flow process, the two processes that are performed in application identification are:\n\nA.

Untrust (any) to DMZ (10.1.1.100), web browsing - Allow\n\nExplanation:\n1. Destination NAT (DNAT) is configured to map 1.1.1.100 (public IP) to 10.1.1.100 (private IP of the web server in DMZ).\n2. When external users from the Untrust zone (e.g., 1.1.1.250) try to access the web server using 1.1.1.100, the firewall translates this destination to 10.1.1.100.\n3. Security policies always evaluate traffic after NAT has been applied. So, the destination in the security policy should match 10.1.1.100.\n4. The correct security policy should allow traffic from Untrust (any) to DMZ (10.1.1.100).\n\nWhen configuring security policies for Destination NAT (DNAT) on a Palo Alto firewall:\n- The pre-NAT IP is used in NAT rules.\n- The post-NAT IP is used in security policies."},{"timestamp":"1732458060.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","poster":"de7cdfd","comment_id":"1317073"},{"poster":"Jallic","timestamp":"1727538120.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI believe the answer here is B, as the NAT is done on the untrusted side therefore the security policy has to untrusted (any) to untrusted (DNAT), within the NAT configuration the real address would be mapped and so would the DMZ zone.","comment_id":"1290691","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1165742","timestamp":"1709565180.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Russ_A7x","content":"Pre IP > post zone for incoming traffic"},{"timestamp":"1691030640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kvant","content":"https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/networking/nat/nat-configuration-examples/destination-nat-exampleone-to-one-mapping#ide8f6a4b3-f875-4855-acb5-5fd9ad918d04","comment_id":"970697"},{"comment_id":"914925","poster":"Grace_Shu","content":"Answer is D:\nZone: After NAT\nAddress: Before NAT","timestamp":"1685914020.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"891883","poster":"Aaron_0801","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1683531240.0","content":"Answer is D\n\"It then evaluates and applies any security policies that match the packet based on the original (pre-NAT) source and destination addresses, but the post-NAT zones\".\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/networking/nat/nat-policy-rules/nat-policy-overview#:~:text=It%20then%20evaluates%20and%20applies%20any%20security%20policies%20that%20match%20the%20packet%20based%20on%20the%20original%20(pre%2DNAT)%20source%20and%20destination%20addresses%2C%20but%20the%20post%2DNAT%20zones"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"869539","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAs @Surfside92 mentioned, according to CBT Nuggets video (watched the same) answer should be B.\n\nHowever, @ntir shared the link which shows literally this situation.
