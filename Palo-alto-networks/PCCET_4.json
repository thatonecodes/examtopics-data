Router\n\nRouters operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and are responsible for forwarding data packets between different network segments or subnets. They make routing decisions based on IP addresses, and one of their primary functions is to segment networks and separate broadcast domains. This segmentation helps control broadcast traffic and can enhance network performance and security.\n\nLayer 2 switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) and segment networks at the data link layer by creating multiple collision domains but do not separate broadcast domains.","timestamp":"1730231280.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1703838600.0","comment_id":"760781","poster":"dax","content":"Answer: C\nSwitches are multi-port bridges and are used to break up collision domains. Hubs are weaker than switches as hubs pass all traffic to all devices. Switches create broadcast domains due to the fact that all ports receive all broadcast transmissions. VLANs and routers are used to break up broadcast domains.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1694604360.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"667935","poster":"blahblah1234567890000","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe Answer is C.\n\nA layer 2 switch will break up collision domains but not broadcast domains.
