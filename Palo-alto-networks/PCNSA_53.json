DoS Protection profiles protect specific devices (classified profiles) and groups of devices (aggregate profiles) against SYN, UDP, ICMP, ICMPv6, and Other IP flood attacks. Configuring Flood Protection thresholds in a DoS Protection profile is similar to configuring Flood Protection in a Zone Protection profile, but Zone Protection profiles protect entire ingress zones, while DoS protection profiles and policy rules are granular and targeted, and can even be classified to a single device (IP address). The firewall measures the aggregate number of connections-per-second (CPS) to a group of devices (aggregate profile) or measures the CPS to individual devices (classified profile).","timestamp":"1710852600.0","comment_id":"843749","upvote_count":"2","poster":"baccalacca"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nDOS Generates an alert when the attck vol.
