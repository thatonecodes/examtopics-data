The rule number determines the order in which the firewall applies the rule.\nThe universally unique identifier (UUID) for a rule never changes even if you modify the rule, such as when you change the rule name. The UUID allows you to track the rule across rule bases even after you deleted the rule.","timestamp":"1685892600.0","comment_id":"735288"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","timestamp":"1722693120.0","comment_id":"1139400","poster":"Marshpillowz","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2022-12-04 18:30:00","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1670175000,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/89994-exam-pcnse-topic-1-question-414-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"Which benefit do policy rule UUIDs provide?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"Cloning of policies between device-groups","B":"The use of user IP mapping and groups in policies","C":"An audit trail across a policyâ€™s lifespan","A":"Functionality for scheduling policy actions"},"question_id":351,"answer":"C","topic":"1","exam_id":274},{"id":"Be3lEHGj77iD57Wb4gml","choices":{"A":"Add the tool IP address to the reconnaissance protection source address exclusion in the DoS Protection profile.","D":"Change the TCP port scan action from Block to Alert in the Zone Protection profile.","B":"Add the tool IP address to the reconnaissance protection source address exclusion in the Zone Protection profile.","C":"Remove the Zone Protection profile from the zone setting."},"question_id":352,"topic":"1","exam_id":274,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"chrisy042","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/zone-protection-and-dos-protection/configure-zone-protection-to-increase-network-security/configure-reconnaissance-protection","comments":[{"content":"To further clarify it is B:\n\nThere is no such section in DoS Protection Profiles\nThe other options can open the gates to non-approved reconnaissance.","comment_id":"745371","timestamp":"1671042780.0","poster":"myname_1","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1669401240.0","comment_id":"727021"},{"comment_id":"1282994","poster":"Cro13","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB because :\nZone protection defends network zones against flood attacks, reconnaissance attempts, packet-based attacks, and attacks that use non-IP protocols.
