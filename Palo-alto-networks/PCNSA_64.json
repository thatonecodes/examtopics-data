The mapping is not port based, which makes this a one-to-one mapping as long as the session lasts.....\n\nStatic IP: Use this translation type to translate a single source address to a specific public address. This is typically used to expose a server (email, web or any application) externally using a translated address that will not change. Use the Static IP mapping type to translate an entire address range to a specific address range, a one-to-one mapping. The number of source IPs using this policy must exactly match the translated range. This is typically used to resolve overlapping IP ranges when merging networks.
