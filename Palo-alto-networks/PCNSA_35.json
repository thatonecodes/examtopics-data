Then the firewall determines if the packet matches one of the NAT rules that have been defined, based on source and/or destination zone. It then evaluates and applies any security policies that match the packet based on the original (pre-NAT) source and destination addresses, but the post-NAT zones. Finally, upon egress, for a matching NAT rule, the firewall translates the source and/or destination address and port numbers.\n- FW supports NAT also on Vwire interfaces.\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/networking/nat/nat-policy-rules/nat-policy-overview","upvote_count":"3","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1726743780.0"},{"comment_id":"882756","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D","timestamp":"1698418560.0","poster":"MarkGrootaarts"},{"content":"Answer is D, but B is also viable!!","comments":[{"content":"in Vwire mode there is a nat capability so do not think B is viable","comment_id":"925794","timestamp":"1702800600.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"N1KH1L"}],"comment_id":"860048","timestamp":"1696344900.0","poster":"DatITGuyTho1337","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"840146","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D","poster":"LetsDiscuss23","timestamp":"1694794080.0"},{"comment_id":"810172","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the most relevent answer and has only one meaning.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"khaled_ellaboudy","timestamp":"1692143220.0"},{"timestamp":"1686164400.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Vijay_75","content":"A and D are true as below:\n1. the NAT rules are processed first before the security rules\n(https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClVHCA0)\n2. the NAT rules are processed from top down\n(https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/networking/nat/nat-policy-rules/nat-policy-overview)","comment_id":"738337","comments":[{"timestamp":"1691482620.0","comment_id":"801870","content":"A is not the answer as NAT \"evaluation\" happens before Sec Policy but actual \"translation\" happens after Sec Pol evaluation.\nAnswer is D","poster":"OhEmGee","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"PunkSp","timestamp":"1686083340.0","comment_id":"737257","comments":[{"content":"Agree, A is impossible to use\nAnswer D !","timestamp":"1689425340.0","poster":"sguerouate","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"776686"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/networking/nat/nat-policy-rules/nat-policy-overview"}],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":273,"topic":"1","question_text":"Which statement is true regarding NAT rules?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/90297-exam-pcnsa-topic-1-question-255-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-12-06 23:29:00","choices":{"A":"Translation of the IP address and port occurs before security processing.","B":"Firewall supports NAT on Layer 3 interfaces only.","D":"NAT rules are processed in order from top to bottom.","C":"Static NAT rules have precedence over other forms of NAT."},"isMC":true,"question_id":171,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1670365740,"answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"VHNtYpFIEsYefPExsxZ6","discussion":[{"comment_id":"805221","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nPalo Alto Networks firewall protection is based on application intelligence, so in the case of TCP, a TCP session must be established before the application can be discovered. However, after a TCP session has been established, silent dropping of packets without sending a TCP reset can be dangerous. The “drop” action could break the application and cause it to misbehave. An application might hang, continue to send packets, or unnecessarily hold system resources open. Therefore, the default “deny” action defined for more than half of the applications recognized by the firewall is to send a TCP reset. \n[Palo Alto Networks]","timestamp":"1723374720.0","poster":"DlaEdu_Ex"},{"timestamp":"1723105500.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"860057","poster":"DatITGuyTho1337","content":"I disagree on the DROP option, if selected, the application will misbehave and most likely keep the sockets open as well as continually send packets seeking a response.","timestamp":"1727967960.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"comment_id":"801875","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nThe question is about 'generally' preserving the resources, without spelling out server side or client side.
