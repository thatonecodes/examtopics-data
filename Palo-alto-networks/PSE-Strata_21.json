Do they want to protect the access to the new web from the outside or the headquarters users? Technically, WildFire is for unknow zero exploits discovery and reporting, is ideally to have it in both locations but again you do not need a license for it and still get the protection, Advanced URL filtering is just for web -traffic , if we are referring to protect user's web -browsing searching then this will be ideal but the question is too \"vague\" to assuming... Then, we have DNS security for new unregistered domains and known malicious domains, that can also be ideal for both locations... I would vote for Threat prevention... again is too vague."},{"poster":"f143c37","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI would say C, URL filtering makes more sense when protecting end users.
