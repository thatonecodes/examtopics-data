CA certificate\nThe CA certificate is used to validate the client certificates presented during the authentication process. It ensures that the certificates are issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.\n\nD. Certificate Profile\nThe Certificate Profile specifies the trusted Certificate Authorities and the certificate validation criteria for client certificates used in the authentication process.\n\nA. Server certificate: While important for establishing secure connections, it is not specifically required for configuring certificate-based authentication to the web UI itself. The server certificate is more related to securing the web interface rather than authenticating administrators.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Moadil_001"},{"poster":"apiloran","comment_id":"1277515","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nRequirements are CA cert, Cert profile, and Client cert for each admin account.","timestamp":"1725362340.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1274575","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nRequirements are CA cert, Cert profile, and Client cert for each admin.\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-admin/firewall-administration/manage-firewall-administrators/configure-administrative-accounts-and-authentication/configure-certificate-based-administrator-authentication-to-the-web-interface","timestamp":"1724944980.0","poster":"kaymorr","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2024-08-28 08:54:00","answer":"BD","answer_ET":"BD","choices":{"C":"SSL/TLS Service Profile","A":"Server certificate","D":"Certificate Profile","B":"CA certificate"}},{"id":"iLksoi3rGJYxe1hiHwCt","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1724828160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/146593-exam-pcnse-topic-1-question-613-discussion/","exam_id":274,"discussion":[{"poster":"krzyb","comment_id":"1292715","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727944860.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nPhase 2 SAs (Security Associations) are synchronized over HA2 links.
