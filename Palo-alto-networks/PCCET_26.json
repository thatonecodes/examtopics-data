Enforce governance policies to ensure that users and resources behave only as intended and do not introduce risk to the environment.\n● Access management: Ensure least-privileged access to cloud resources and infrastructure, and decouple user permissions from workload permissions.\n● Machine identity: Decouple workload identity from IP addresses. Leverage tags and metadata to assign a logical identity to applications and workloads, and then use it to enforce ID-based micro-segmentation and security policies that adapt to your dynamic environments.\n● UEBA: Continuously analyze the behavior of users and resources in your cloud to detect and prevent anomalous behavior, such as an admin logging in from an unknown location or a container accessing a file it should not be able to access.","timestamp":"1674001500.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"526197"}],"answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04362/0000600002.png"],"question_id":126,"exam_id":270,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nMatch the Identity and Access Management (IAM) security control with the appropriate definition.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","timestamp":"2022-01-18 01:25:00","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04362/0000600001.png"],"answers_community":[],"answer":""},{"id":"yfLIpOEsrXzW441AwPGr","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"blahblah1234567890000","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDevSecOps takes the concept behind DevOps that developers and IT teams should work together closely, instead of separately, throughout software delivery and extends it to include security and integrate automated checks into the full CI/CD pipeline.
