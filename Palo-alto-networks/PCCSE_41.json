Without access to those hooks, container Defenders canâ€™t monitor and protect resources in those environments. Instead, embed an app-embedded Defender directly inside your workload running in the container to establish a point of control. You can manually embed the Defenders or use automated workflows to embed Defenders using Fargate or Dockerfile.\n\nUsing Dockerfile, you deploy one app-embedded Defender per container.
