Without access to those hooks, container Defenders can’t monitor and protect resources in those environments. Instead, embed an app-embedded Defender directly inside your workload running in the container to establish a point of control. You can manually embed the Defenders or use automated workflows to embed Defenders using Fargate or Dockerfile.\n\nUsing Dockerfile, you deploy one app-embedded Defender per container. Using Fargate, you deploy one app-embedded Defender per task."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/prisma-cloud/securing-aws-fargate-tasks/","timestamp":"1711621860.0","comment_id":"1184698","upvote_count":"2","poster":"FS9"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1183290","poster":"FS9","timestamp":"1711455180.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis is about vulnerabilities, not defend runtime.\n\nhttps://docs.prismacloud.io/en/classic/compute-admin-guide/vulnerability-management/registry-scanning/configure-registry-scanning"},{"timestamp":"1686146040.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nShould be B.\n\nApp-Embedded Defenders for Fargate monitor and protect your Fargate tasks to ensure they execute as designed.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Spippolo","comment_id":"917268"},{"comment_id":"798477","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675552920.0","poster":"Redrum702","content":"B: \nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/install/install_defender/install_app_embedded_defender_fargate"},{"poster":"HARRY","timestamp":"1675335600.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/install/install_defender/install_app_embedded_defender_fargate","comment_id":"795973","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"588249","timestamp":"1650380640.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/defender_types","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Joe27"}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-04-19 17:04:00","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/73862-exam-pccse-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (64%)","A (36%)"],"answer_description":""},{"id":"78IJs5oCa0rl3PX0D807","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/72985-exam-pccse-topic-1-question-59-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which container image scan is constructed correctly?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","answer_description":"","exam_id":271,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"ominator","comment_id":"573331","upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1679535540.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\n--container is not a flag.
