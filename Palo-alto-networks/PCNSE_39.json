It’s asking about authentication, not access. For authentication you need a Certificate Profile and a CA certificate, not a server certificate. When a username is entered that requires Certificate-based authentication, the firewall checks whether the certificate presented by the client is signed by the CA configured in the Certificate Profile. Nowhere in the authentication process is the firewall’s own server certificate involved.
