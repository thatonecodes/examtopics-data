Since the actual server resides in the Trust-L3 zone (192.168.15.47), the NAT rule should translate the destination IP from Untrust-L3 to Trust-L3.\nB correctly translates the destination IP address 172.16.15.1 (given by DNS) to 192.168.15.47 and sets the destination zone to Trust-L3, where the web server resides.\nSecurity Rule:\nA uses 172.16.15.1 as the destination IP in the security rule. However, after NAT translation, the destination IP will be 192.168.15.47. This mismatch will result in the traffic being denied because the security rule won't match the translated IP.\nB uses 192.168.15.47 as the destination IP in the security rule, which matches the post-NAT translated IP, ensuring the rule correctly allows the traffic.\nConclusion:\nOption B correctly sets the NAT rule to translate the external IP to the internal IP within the Trust-L3 zone and uses the correct translated IP in the security rule to allow the traffic.
