For example, an application that previously was categorized under web-browsing now might be categorized under its own unique App-ID. Categorization of applications into more specific applications enables more granularity and control of applications within Security policy rules. Because the new App-ID no longer will be categorized as web-browsing, no Security policy rule now will contain this new App-ID. Consequently, the new App-ID will be blocked.","timestamp":"1695823980.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1018873"},{"timestamp":"1685843160.0","comment_id":"914042","poster":"MEDO162","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct."},{"content":"control plan (A)","poster":"Viga1991","comment_id":"836321","timestamp":"1678555920.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"baccalacca","upvote_count":"1","content":"Threat Intelligence Cloud Gathers, analyzes, correlates, and disseminates threats to and from the network and endpoints located within the network.\nNext-Generation Firewall Identifies and inspects all traffic to block known threats\nAdvanced Endpoint Protection - Inspects processes and files to prevent known and unknown","timestamp":"1678024560.0","comment_id":"829946"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"829754","poster":"all_nicknames_are_taken","timestamp":"1678005120.0","content":"A is correct"},{"poster":"Wing123","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis is bug but C","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1670571420.0","comment_id":"739882"},{"poster":"Freakezoid","timestamp":"1660553940.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","comment_id":"647088","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"error_909","timestamp":"1647151740.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer A is Correct","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"566577"},{"poster":"Cyril_the_Squirl","comment_id":"464651","timestamp":"1634646900.0","content":"A is Correct.\nManagement plane = Log, Report, Configure\nData Plane = AV, exploits, UF, Spyware, VPN, QoS, NAT, CC#, etc","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1625804100.0","poster":"jc1515","comment_id":"402401","upvote_count":"2","content":"A is correct."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/57510-exam-pcnsa-topic-1-question-2-discussion/"},{"id":"srTnXubTP65Xsq51y3Rd","unix_timestamp":1629911160,"exam_id":273,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Cyril_the_Squirl","content":"A & D are correct","timestamp":"1714148340.0","upvote_count":"9","comment_id":"468155"},{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"567394","timestamp":"1726283880.0","poster":"error_909","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA & D are correct"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727017320.0","comment_id":"573097","poster":"LordScorpius","content":"\"He knew implicitly without having to ask\". \"She produced a long list of verbal explicative.\"\n\"I trust you implicitly\". \"Clicking the button produces the explicit result\"."},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"567787","timestamp":"1726325460.0","poster":"Raimz","content":"A & D is correct -according to Firewall 10.1 Essentials: Configuration and Management Version B"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"gg87","comment_id":"431646","content":"https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/blogs/what-is-application-dependency/ba-p/344330","timestamp":"1708887960.0"}],"answer_ET":"AD","question_id":110,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-08-25 19:06:00","question_text":"What are two differences between an implicit dependency and an explicit dependency in App-ID?
