Thus, in New App Viewer, at times we get to see numbers under 'Apps Allowed' whereas on the other hand this column contains 'Any'. Moreover, the New Apps Allowed functionality requires PA Application Cloud Engine (ACE) SaaS subscription to get the App info from cloud DB. The Rules Without Apps Control is on-the-box functionality. Here's the definition from firewall's help page;\nNew App Viewer—New cloud applications downloaded from the Application Control Engine if the firewall has a SaaS Security subscription.\nRules Without App Controls—Rules that have the application set to any, so you can identify port-based rules to convert to application-based rules.","poster":"OhEmGee","comment_id":"799408","timestamp":"1675658400.0","comments":[{"content":"Cont....\nSince the question is asked in simple way without details like conversion of applications (e.g. web-browsing to specific cloud based app), we can safely assume that it is not about New App Viewer.\n\nPS: You can read about Rules Without Apps Control from the link in the original post and for New App Viewer, go to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/app-id/cloud-based-app-id-service/new-app-viewer-policy-optimizer.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"799409","poster":"OhEmGee","timestamp":"1675658460.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1681159620.0","comment_id":"866615","poster":"drogadotcom","content":"I think you are right since by default the column \"Application\" is displayed in \"New App Viewer\", here in the screenshot it is not present (verified in PanOS 11 lab).
