Although\npublic cloud providers strive to ensure isolation between their various customers, the infrastructure and resources in the public cloud are shared. Inherent risks in a shared environment include misconfigurations, inadequate or ineffective processes and controls,\nand the “noisy neighbor” problem (excessive network traffic, disk I/O, or processor use can\nnegatively impact other customers sharing the same resource). In hybrid and multicloud\nenvironments that connect numerous public and/or private clouds, the delineation becomes blurred, complexity increases, and security risks become more challenging to address.","comment_id":"662853","upvote_count":"3","poster":"blahblah1234567890000"},{"timestamp":"1722507960.0","comment_id":"640556","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPage 190 of the study guide:\n \"Multitenancy is a key characteristic of the public cloud, and an important risk\"","poster":"Merlin0o"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1659349560,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Dedicated Hosts","A":"Multi-tenancy","B":"Dedicated Networks","D":"Multiplexing"},"timestamp":"2022-08-01 12:26:00","answer":"A","exam_id":270,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/77873-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-75-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_id":131,"question_images":[]},{"id":"AD2hB9YFW5uQuSRSJGuE","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":270,"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Application, Presentation, and Session","C":"Physical, Data Link, Network","D":"Data Link, Session, Transport","A":"Session, Transport, Network"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"blahblah1234567890000","comment_id":"662855","timestamp":"1725739560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nApplication (Layer 4 or L4): This layer loosely corresponds to Layers 5 through 7 of the OSI model.\nTransport (Layer 3 or L3): This layer corresponds to Layer 4 of the OSI model.\nInternet (Layer 2 or L2): This layer corresponds to Layer 3 of the OSI model.\nNetwork Access (Layer 1 or L1): This layer corresponds to Layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model","comments":[{"timestamp":"1726066380.0","comment_id":"666218","content":"The 7 layers of the OSI model.

Port scanning\n\nPort scanning is a method used to exploit vulnerabilities, services, and applications. It involves scanning a target system or network to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. Attackers use port scanning as a reconnaissance technique to discover entry points into a system that can be exploited. Once open ports and services are identified, attackers can attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the services or applications running on those ports. This makes port scanning an essential step in the process of identifying and potentially exploiting security weaknesses in a target system."},{"comment_id":"658953","upvote_count":"1","poster":"blahblah1234567890000","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"blahblah1234567890000","comment_id":"658954","content":"Port scanning would be use to identify services prior to exploitation so it would be in tandem but none of these options are actually used for exploitation.","timestamp":"1693804380.0"}],"content":"Attack communication traffic is usually hidden with various techniques and\ntools, including:\n● Encryption with SSL, SSH (Secure Shell), or some other custom or proprietary encryption\n● Circumvention via proxies, remote access tools, or tunneling.
