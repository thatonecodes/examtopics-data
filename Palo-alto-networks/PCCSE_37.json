Older Defenders fully protect your nodes using the policies and settings most recently cached before upgrading Console. They can emit audits to Console and local logs, including syslog. However, they cannot access any API endpoint other than the upgrade endpoint, and they cannot share any new data with Console. No new policies or settings can be pushed from Console to older Defenders. When Defender is in this state, its status is shown as 'Upgrade needed' in Manage > Defenders > Manage. To restore older Defenders to a fully operation state, upgrade them so that their versions match Console’s version.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733518980.0","poster":"Spippolo"},{"content":"D\nWhen version mismatches, Older Defenders fully protect your nodes using the policies and settings most recently cached before upgrading Console.
