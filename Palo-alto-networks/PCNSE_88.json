The SSL Forward Proxy Decryption policy is configured on the firewall to decrypt the SSL traffic and inspect it for threats. If the firewall fails over, the existing session is transferred to the active firewall, which continues to decrypt the SSL traffic and inspect it for threats. This ensures that there is no disruption in the traffic flow and the security of the network is maintained. Option B is incorrect because dropping the session would result in disruption of the traffic flow and could lead to security issues. Option C is incorrect because sending the session to fastpath would bypass the SSL Forward Proxy Decryption policy, which defeats the purpose of having the policy in place. Option D is incorrect because allowing the session without decrypting it would also defeat the purpose of having the SSL Forward Proxy Decryption policy in place.","poster":"nguyendtv50"},{"comment_id":"776081","comments":[{"comments":[{"poster":"PaloSteve","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706246880.0","comment_id":"963309","content":"The 11.0 doc says, \" The firewall does not resume decrypted SSL Forward Proxy, SSL Inbound Inspection, or SSH Proxy sessions.\" So this supports Answer B.\nMostly likely this question was dropped if the default action is different.\nSomeone would have to dig through Release Notes to see if this is a Default Action change."}],"poster":"PaloSteve","timestamp":"1706246340.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"The following points to Answer D, though this is from PAN-OS 9.1 docs, \"In these cases, when a failover occurs, the passive device allows transferred sessions without decrypting them.
