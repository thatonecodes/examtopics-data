Panorama is a centralized management tool for Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and it allows administrators to configure and manage both pre-rules and local device rules for managed firewalls.\n\nC. Pre-rules are part of the security policy and can be viewed on managed firewalls. They define policies for traffic before it is matched against security policy rules.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pre-rules are typically managed and modified in Panorama, not on individual firewalls. Panorama administrators can modify pre-rules, but the local administrator on a firewall usually doesn't modify pre-rules directly.\n\nOption D is incorrect because pre-rules can be modified in Panorama, and local device rules can also be modified in Panorama for centralized management. Local device rules are specific to the individual firewall but can still be managed through Panorama.","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"1087642","poster":"leipeG","timestamp":"1717498200.0"},{"timestamp":"1731821880.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1212681","content":"Options B and C"},{"comment_id":"1201388","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nbc\n.\n.","timestamp":"1729775220.0","poster":"5e9ebb0"}],"question_text":"Which two statements correctly describe how pre-rules and local device rules are viewed and modified?
