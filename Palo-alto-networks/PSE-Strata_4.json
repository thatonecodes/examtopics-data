When a virtual router has multiple routes to the same destination, it chooses the route with the lowest metric. This allows for flexibility in network design and ensures that traffic is routed efficiently.\n\nThe other options are not used to determine the best path:\n\nSource zone: The source zone is the zone from which traffic originates. It is not used to determine the best path for routing.\nAdministrative distance: Administrative distance is a measure of the trustworthiness of a routing protocol. It is used to determine which routing protocol to prefer when multiple protocols are advertising the same route. However, it is not used to determine the best path within a single routing protocol.\nPath monitoring: Path monitoring is used to monitor the health of a route. It is not used to determine the best path for routing.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"44d0262","comment_id":"1253861"},{"poster":"GohanF2","comments":[{"comment_id":"1187822","content":"So, It is option A.","timestamp":"1712029020.0","poster":"GohanF2","upvote_count":"2"}],"comment_id":"1178996","content":"The ideal question will be what to do in case of having multiple dynamic routing protocols taking to the same destination then... it will be the administrative distance.
