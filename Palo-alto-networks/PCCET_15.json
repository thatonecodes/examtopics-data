DevOps encourages the use of automation, collaboration, and continuous integration and delivery pipelines, allowing software to be developed, tested, and deployed in smaller, incremental changes. This leads to faster and more frequent releases, which are typically deployed gradually rather than all at once, reducing risk and improving reliability.\nC. Automatic scaling: While automatic scaling can be part of a DevOps culture, especially in cloud-native environments using containerization (e.g., Kubernetes), it is not a direct outcome of DevOps itself. Automatic scaling is a feature of cloud services and infrastructure management, not a core principle of DevOps.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"PurpleRain28","timestamp":"1731227280.0","comment_id":"1309342"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/151058-exam-pccet-topic-1-question-224-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_id":73,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-11-10 09:28:00","topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":270,"question_text":"What is an outcome of DevOps?","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Automatic scaling","B":"Gradual delivery","A":"Decreased reliability","D":"Manual practices"}},{"id":"5wNvT1gGiUnhgZqGnhIR","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1317464","timestamp":"1732536840.0","poster":"3fd692e","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nI think C and D make more sense than anything else.
