You can configure integrations in Cortex XSOAR to fetch event data from various sources, such as a SIEM, EDR, a firewall, and other security systems and services.\n\nStage Two: Incident Object Creation\nCortex XSOAR uses the event data fetched by an integration to create an incident object and populates it with raw event data.\n\nStage Three: Classification\nCortex XSOAR identifies the type of incident based on the classifier object selected in the integration configuration settings. If you have not selected any classifier, then the integration uses the default classifier of the integration. Cortex XSOAR will identify an incident as Unclassified if no default classifier exists or if the type of an incident cannot be identified.\n\nStage Four: Mapping\nThe raw event data ingested by an integration gets mapped to existing fields in Cortex XSOAR. The fields display incident data to analysts in the Cortex XSOAR graphical user interface (GUI).\nIngestion >> Incident Creation >> Classification >> Mapping is the 100% correct answer"},{"timestamp":"1681665780.0","poster":"randomnametester","content":"This is wrong","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"586902"}],"unix_timestamp":1650129780,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03898/0002100001.png"],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03898/0002000001.png"],"question_id":82,"timestamp":"2022-04-16 19:23:00","exam_id":275,"topic":"1","answer":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nArrange these steps in the order that they occur during an incident fetch.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/palo-alto-networks/view/73743-exam-pcsae-topic-1-question-35-discussion/","answer_ET":""},{"id":"aALH7gmKU2e43M0alrAn","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"An engineer deployed two different instances of Active Directory for each organization site.
