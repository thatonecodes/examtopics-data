Anti-spyware profile is a type of security profile that is typically used to prevent spyware and other malicious software from being installed on a network's endpoints. It may not be the best solution to detect and prevent malware that has already infected a host and is attempting to communicate with a C2 server.\n\nIn this case, an antivirus profile (C.), which specifically detects and prevents the spread of viruses and other malicious software, would be more appropriate.
