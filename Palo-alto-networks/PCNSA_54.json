By operating cloud-based detection engines, you can access a wide array of detection mechanisms that are updated and deployed automatically without requiring the user to download update packages or operate process intensive, firewall-based analyzers which can sap resources. Inline cloud analysis for your firewall Vulnerability Protection profile supports two analysis engines: SQL injection and Command injection. Additional analysis models are delivered through content updates, however, enhancements to existing models are performed as a cloud-side update, requiring no firewall update. Inline cloud analysis is enabled and configured using the Vulnerability Protection profile and requires an active Advanced Threat Prevention license.","comment_id":"843896","timestamp":"1679240940.0","poster":"baccalacca"}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"With the PAN-OS 11.0 Nova release, which two attack options can new inline deep learning analysis engines detect and prevent?
