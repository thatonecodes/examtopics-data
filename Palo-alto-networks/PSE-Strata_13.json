Specifically, it effectively prevents the following four stages:\n\n- Breach the Perimeter: By using advanced threat prevention mechanisms, the platform can stop initial attempts to penetrate the network perimeter. \n\n- Lateral Movement: Once inside the network, attackers often try to move laterally to access more systems. The platform uses network segmentation and advanced monitoring to detect and prevent such movements.\n\n- Exfiltrate Data: Data exfiltration is the process of unauthorized data transfer out of the network. The platform employs data loss prevention (DLP) technologies to detect and block such attempts.\n\n- Deliver the Malware: The platform can prevent malware delivery through its threat prevention capabilities, including anti-malware, anti-spyware, and sandboxing technologies.\n\nThese steps cover critical phases where the platform can intervene to stop attacks before they cause significant damage.","comment_id":"1245511","timestamp":"1720618680.0"},{"comment_id":"1210727","timestamp":"1715579100.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ck19","content":"Disagree with scanossa.
