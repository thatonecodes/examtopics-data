In option D, the first Security policy rule allows web-browsing traffic on the HTTPS service (service-https), which is not applicable in this scenario since the web server is configured to host its contents over HTTP(S) and is listening on TCP port 443 for incoming connections.\n\nIf we allow the web-browsing application traffic using the HTTPS service, the firewall will forward the traffic to the web server without decrypting it, since it is HTTPS traffic. However, the web server is hosting its contents over HTTP(S), so the firewall needs to decrypt the traffic before forwarding it to the web server.\n\nTherefore, the correct service to be used in the first Security policy rule is service-http instead of service-https. This will allow the firewall to decrypt the traffic before forwarding it to the web server and also allow web-browsing traffic from the Trust zone to the DMZ zone.\nHence, option B is the correct answer.","comment_id":"887644","timestamp":"1683042900.0","poster":"hz78","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"Frightened_Acrobat","content":"I agree D.
