DoS policy rules allow you to control the number of sessions between interfaces, zones, addresses, and countries based on aggregate sessions or source and/or destination IP addresses. There are two DoS protection mechanisms that the Palo Alto Networks firewalls support.\nFlood Protection—Detects and prevents attacks where the network is flooded with packets resulting in too many half-open sessions and/or services being unable to respond to each request. In this case, the source address of the attack is usually spoofed. See DoS Protection Against Flooding of New Sessions.\nResource Protection— Detects and prevent session exhaustion attacks. In this type of attack, a large number of hosts (bots) are used to establish as many fully established sessions as possible to consume all of a system’s resources.","poster":"Xuzi"},{"poster":"Omid2022","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI go for C since you can enable it globaly on the firewall and a zone protection profile is a component that enables you to configure firewall resource protection settings for a zone.

The Turst cert should fall into the COC. If this was a self-signed cert (as I have also labbed) you can simple have that on the FW without a COC.","poster":"Biz90","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"FS68","timestamp":"1633627500.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"A. because FWDtrust has a chain but it's not present in the firewall.","comment_id":"458861"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"bluejl","content":"A.
