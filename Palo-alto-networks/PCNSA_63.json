The first step is to enter the route and netmask for the destination network, such as 192.168.2.2/24 for an IPv4 address or 2001:db8:123:1::1/64 for an IPv6 address. The second step is to enter the IP address for the specific next hop, such as 192.168.56.1 or 2001:db8:49e:1::1. The third step is to specify the outgoing interface for packets to use to go to the next hop, such as ethernet1/1. The fourth step is to add an IPv4 or IPv6 route by name, such as route11.
