A and C could be both technically true, but which is more accurate? A indicates that \"after app has been identified\", so we can interpret that in the Flow Diagram as the step in App-ID which says \"Pattern based application identification\" however, considering the Packet Flow Sequence, after the app is identified, there are still several steps that don't lead directly to Content ID. First it checks for policy matches that will allow it (so it might still get dropped). Then it will check if there are any Security Profiles (ContentID) that will be applicable. QoS and SSL Decryption also might occur at this point. My point is there's a whole bunch of stuff still going on between the \"app being identified\" and content inspection. \n\nMy conclusion is that whenever content inspection is performed it's always before packet forwarding.
