Memorize this: you have three types of decryption actions \n\n1. SSL Forward Proxy (acts as a proxy between the client and the server, so the client's certificate and the fw cert mus be the same).\n2. SSL Inbound Inspection (for your servers exposed to the internet, the fw acts as if it were the server, so you import the server's cert and its private key).\n3. SSH Proxy for SSH and SSH Tunnel (this last should be blocked as a BP).\n\nBesides, you can also forward decrypted traffic to an external appliance through decryption mirror, so you would need to ask for a license in the csp and configure your fw to send the clear text traffic to your appliance.\n\nA says \"ssl outbound PROXYLESS...\" so it basically results in completely the opposite of that ssl forward proxy does lmao. Kind of the same with D since you act as the server, meaning you could be \"proxying\" the session but thats not how it's called by PANW.","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"BCE \nThe firewall provides three types of Decryption policy rules: SSL Forward Proxy to control outbound SSL traffic, SSL Inbound Inspection to control inbound SSL traffic, and SSH Proxy to control tunneled SSH traffic.
