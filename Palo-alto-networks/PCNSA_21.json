In the wildcard mask, a zero (0) bit indicates that the bit being compared must match the bit in the IP address that is covered by the 0. A one (1) bit in the mask is a wildcard bit, meaning the bit being compared need not match the bit in the IP address that is covered by the 1. Convert the IP address and the wildcard mask to binary. To illustrate the matching: on binary snippet 0011, a wildcard mask of 1010 results in four matches (0001, 0011, 1001, and 1011).","comment_id":"795641","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706834760.0"},{"poster":"ARWANGSH","comment_id":"779809","timestamp":"1705570200.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWildcard objects can be used only in the Security policy rule."},{"comment_id":"754064","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1703322000.0","poster":"Miho_GG","content":"Wildcard objects can be used only in the Security policy rule."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/objects/objects-addresses","comment_id":"708154","poster":"Najmmm","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698720660.0"},{"poster":"Alex48694","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"704492","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSecurity policy rule","timestamp":"1698306600.0"},{"poster":"stickboy","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/objects/objects-addresses","comment_id":"684536","timestamp":"1696207320.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Robert_99","content":"The correct answer is You can use an address object of type IP Wildcard Mask only in a Security policy rule.\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/objects/objects-addresses IP\nWildcard Mas","comment_id":"683804","timestamp":"1696098840.0"}],"question_id":101,"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"y2qjDWnaTQfycR35dQF1","topic":"1","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-09-20 12:31:00","choices":{"A":"Anti-Spyware Profile","C":"Antivirus Profile","D":"Vulnerability Protection Profile","B":"Data Filtering Profile"},"answer_ET":"A","question_id":102,"question_text":"You receive notification about a new malware that infects hosts.
