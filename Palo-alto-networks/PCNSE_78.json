This suggests the firewall is configured for Layer 3 routing in this scenario.\n 1. The routing table explicitly shows a default route (0.0.0.0/0) with a nexthop of 10.46.40.1 via ethernet1/3.\n 2. The mention of the source IP (192.168.111.3) further supports that routing decisions are being applied, which is not typical in a pure vWire setup.\n 3. This appears to be a hybrid configuration, where routing overrides the default vWire behavior for external traffic.\n\nThe traffic ingressing on ethernet1/7 with a destination of 10.46.41.113 will egress via ethernet1/3, based on the routing table.
