There are two types of admission controllers: built-in and dynamic. Prisma Cloud implements a dynamic admission controller.\nDynamic admission controllers are built as webhooks. After registering to intercept admission requests, they assess requests against policy, and then accept or reject those requests. In Kubernetes terms, these are known as validating admission webhooks.\n\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/access_control/open_policy_agent","poster":"Spippolo","timestamp":"1718117340.0","comment_id":"920790"},{"content":"C\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/access_control/open_policy_agent","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"772941","comments":[{"comment_id":"781974","timestamp":"1705737240.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/","poster":"poiuytr"}],"timestamp":"1705011540.0","poster":"Redrum702"}],"question_text":"Which component of a Kubernetes setup can approve, modify, or reject administrative requests?","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","question_id":70,"timestamp":"2023-01-11 23:19:00","exam_id":271}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"id":271,"numberOfQuestions":247,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Palo-alto-networks","name":"PCCSE"},"currentPage":14},"__N_SSP":true}
