I asked chat gpt\n\nIn Snowflake, it is generally not recommended to add additional privileges to the system-defined roles because doing so can potentially compromise the security and integrity of the system. Instead, it is recommended to create custom roles and grant specific privileges to those roles as needed.\n\nHowever, if you do need to add additional privileges to a system-defined role, the recommended way to do so is by using the \"GRANT\" statement.

Modifying the privileges of these roles can cause unexpected behavior and can impact the security of your Snowflake environment. Additionally, system-defined roles cannot be deleted or modified, which means that any changes you make to these roles will be permanent and cannot be undone.\n\nInstead, Snowflake recommends that you create custom roles and grant the necessary privileges to those roles. This approach allows you to grant precise privileges to users, while maintaining the security and integrity of your Snowflake environment. You can also modify and delete custom roles as needed, providing greater flexibility and control over your Snowflake environment.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1680629880.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview","upvote_count":"1","poster":"jtm22","timestamp":"1679869200.0","comment_id":"851539"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAlthough additional privileges can be granted to the system-defined roles, it is not recommended.\nIf additional privileges are needed, Snowflake recommends granting the additional privileges to a custom role and assigning the custom role to the system-defined role.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"835898","poster":"ShagunMittal","timestamp":"1678534380.0"}],"exam_id":167,"answer":"A","question_text":"A user wants to add additional privileges to the system-defined roles for their virtual warehouse.\n\nHow does Snowflake recommend they accomplish this?","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1678480740,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_id":744,"choices":{"A":"Grant the additional privileges to a custom role.","D":"Grant the additional privileges to the ORGADMIN role.","C":"Grant the additional privileges to the SYSADMIN role.","B":"Grant the additional privileges to the ACCOUNTADMIN role."},"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (58%)","C (42%)"]},{"id":"zKDg5eLcq8uq4ckvjgPN","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/102218-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-535-discussion/","exam_id":167,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"835421","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nAB - correct","poster":"EmiB","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1725993600.0"},{"comment_id":"874745","timestamp":"1729345980.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nCorrect","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MultiCloudIronMan"}],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-03-10 21:40:00","unix_timestamp":1678480800,"question_images":[],"question_text":"How does Snowflake store a table's underlying data?
