Clustering keys are used to group related rows physically together in a table, which can improve query performance by minimizing the amount of data that needs to be scanned or skipped during query execution. However, clustering keys should be chosen carefully based on the access patterns of the table, and the type of queries that will be run against it.\n\nDefining a clustering key on every table may not always be necessary or beneficial. For example, in some cases, tables may be small or may not have well-defined access patterns, making clustering unnecessary. In other cases, tables may be loaded in a specific order or partitioned in a certain way that obviates the need for clustering.\n\nTherefore, it is not a best practice to define a clustering key on every table in Snowflake, but rather to carefully consider the access patterns and usage of each table, and to choose clustering keys judiciously based on those factors.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"SteveCrown","timestamp":"1682527920.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct.

Those IP addresses are allowed access to the Snowflake account as Snowflake applies the allowed IP address list first.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Snowflake's network policy configuration, the allowed IP address list takes precedence over the blocked IP address list. If an IP address is listed in both the allowed and blocked lists, Snowflake applies the rule from the allowed list, allowing access. The allowed list is processed before the blocked list, and if a match is found in the allowed list, the access is granted.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Those IP addresses are allowed access to the Snowflake account as Snowflake applies the allowed IP address list first.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1128183","poster":"Sunnyb"},{"comment_id":"1116831","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720451520.0","poster":"DR369","content":"Answer - B"}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-01-08 18:12:00","answer":"B"},{"id":"6aSWvSijwIN6vHSfbox1","question_id":1183,"unix_timestamp":1704738360,"question_text":"For directory tables, what stage allows for automatic refreshing of metadata?","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1125670","timestamp":"1721288520.0","poster":"tidz","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-auto"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"DR369","timestamp":"1720455960.0","content":"Answer D\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-dirtables","comment_id":"1116878"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-01-08 19:26:00","question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/130613-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-931-discussion/","exam_id":167,"choices":{"A":"User stage","C":"Named internal stage","D":"Named external stage","B":"Table stage"},"answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"XC7ciOyK5YtciiOzymL8","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1205318","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt's C - https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location\n\nCOPY INTO <location>\nUnloads data from a table (or query) into one or more files in one of the following locations:\n\nNamed internal stage (or table/user stage).
