Similar to shared-disk architectures, Snowflake uses a central data repository for persisted data that is accessible from all compute nodes in the platform. But similar to shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake processes queries using MPP (massively parallel processing) compute clusters where each node in the cluster stores a portion of the entire data set locally. This approach offers the data management simplicity of a shared-disk architecture, but with the performance and scale-out benefits of a shared-nothing architecture.\n\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-key-concepts","comment_id":"1143610"},{"timestamp":"1712587500.0","poster":"Heetec","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC correct","comment_id":"1028069","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1697791440.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","comment_id":"875417","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect"},{"timestamp":"1692350580.0","poster":"muks86","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSnowflake architecture base question","comment_id":"812891"}],"question_id":827,"exam_id":167,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"It reorganizes loaded data into internal optimized, compressed, and row-based format.","A":"It uses a local data repository for all compute nodes in the platform.","B":"It is a blend of shared-disk and shared-everything database architectures.","C":"It is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk and shared-nothing database architectures."},"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/99781-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-609-discussion/","question_text":"Which statement accurately describes Snowflake's architecture?","answer":"C","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1676719380,"timestamp":"2023-02-18 12:23:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"anoC7ejax6Bg9OhjYGRw","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Set the Minimum Clusters and Maximum Clusters settings to the different values","B":"Set the Warehouse type to ג€Autoג€","C":"Set the Minimum Clusters and Maximum Clusters settings to the same value","A":"Configure the Maximum Clusters setting to ג€Auto-Scaleג€"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/69297-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-61-discussion/","answer":"D","question_text":"To run a Multi-Cluster Warehouse in auto-scale mode, a user would:","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-01-02 23:29:00","answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"poster":"moon2351","timestamp":"1641162540.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIf you set the minimum cluster count less than the maximum cluster count, then the warehouse runs in Auto-scale mode.","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"515254"},{"timestamp":"1744045260.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nmax and min are different vales","poster":"jeny12138","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1558663"},{"content":"D is Correct","poster":"Mallikharjuna452","timestamp":"1721315760.0","comment_id":"1250495","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mayuri917233","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","comment_id":"894751","timestamp":"1683790980.0"},{"comment_id":"738009","poster":"Tapasgup007","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1670426280.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is correct as per \nAuto-scale: \nThis mode is enabled by specifying different values for maximum and minimum number of clusters.
