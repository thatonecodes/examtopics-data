When staging regular data sets, we recommend partitioning the data into logical paths that include identifying details such as geographical location or other source identifiers, along with the date when the data was written.\n\nOrganizing your data files by path lets you copy any fraction of the partitioned data into Snowflake with a single command. This allows you to execute concurrent COPY statements that match a subset of files, taking advantage of parallel operations.\n\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-stage.html#organizing-data-by-path","timestamp":"1703836260.0"},{"poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorrect","comment_id":"957782","timestamp":"1721490780.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1702926960.0","poster":"Rob__C","comment_id":"749111","content":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-stage.html#organizing-data-by-path"},{"poster":"paknadeem","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1702595100.0","content":"The correct answer is A","comment_id":"745517"},{"content":"The answer is A","poster":"halol","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"745292","timestamp":"1702572480.0"}]}],"exam":{"name":"SnowPro Core","provider":"Snowflake","numberOfQuestions":1259,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"id":167,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":107},"__N_SSP":true}
