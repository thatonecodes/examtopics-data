A virtual warehouse consumes Snowflake credits while it runs. You can use a resource monitor to monitor credit usage by virtual warehouses and the cloud services needed to support those warehouses. You can also set up a resource monitor to suspend a user-managed virtual warehouse when it reaches a credit limit."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mallikharjuna452","comment_id":"1249756","timestamp":"1721231400.0","content":"B.
