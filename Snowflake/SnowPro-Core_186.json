Enforcing MFA adds an extra layer of protection for such accounts.\nACCOUNTADMIN: This role can manage account settings, users, and billing. MFA helps safeguard these critical administrative controls.\nWhile not explicitly mentioned in the minimum recommendation:\n\nSYSADMIN: The SYSADMIN role has full control over the Snowflake account.
