Any objects that have been dropped (for example, tables) remain unaffected.\n\nFor example, if you have a schema s1 with a 90-day retention period and table t1 is in schema s1, table t1 inherits the 90-day retention period. If you drop table s1.t1, t1 is retained in Time Travel for 90 days. Later, if you change the schemaâ€™s data retention period to 1 day, the retention period for the dropped table t1 is unchanged. Table t1 will still be retained in Time Travel for 90 days.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel#specifying-the-data-retention-period-for-an-object:~:text=through%20Time%20Travel.-,Note,-If%20you%20change"},{"timestamp":"1714248240.0","poster":"Heetec","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB correct","comment_id":"1055810","upvote_count":"3"}],"exam_id":167,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":""},{"id":"t0H8wAONFfu8gEFKxgp0","answers_community":["BC (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Snowpark provides libraries for which programming languages?
