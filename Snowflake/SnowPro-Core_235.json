Reader\n\nA Reader Account in Snowflake allows a data provider to securely share data with consumers who do not have their own Snowflake account. This enables the consumer to access and query the shared data without needing to set up or manage a Snowflake account.\n\n\nWhy Not the Other Options?\n\nA. Data provider:\n\nThis refers to the Snowflake account or entity sharing the data, not the account type used by the consumer.\n\n\nB. Data consumer:\n\nThis refers to a standard Snowflake account used to consume shared data. It requires the consumer to have their own Snowflake account.\n\n\nD.

OAuth: OAuth is a widely used industry-standard protocol for authorization. It allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. Snowflake supports OAuth for securing REST API interactions, providing a robust mechanism for authentication and authorization without exposing user credentials.\n\nB. Key pair authentication: This method involves using a public-private key pair for authentication. In Snowflake, users generate a key pair, register the public key with their Snowflake user account, and use the private key to sign authentication tokens.
