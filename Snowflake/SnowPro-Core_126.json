You can grow and shrink the environment dynamically. The data storage grows and shrinks as you add or remove data, while the compute nodes can be ramped up or down, or turned off, as you require. You are not forced to pay for capacity up front, or kick other workloads off, or plan downtimes when ramping up your data warehouse capacity. That is the promise of cloud.
