Based on the user's selections, the system generates the SQL queries needed to fetch the data for the report. First it gets the customers that meet the given query parameters (on average 1000 customer records for each report run), and then it loops the customer records sequentially. Inside that loop it runs the generated SQL clause for the current customer to get the detailed data for that customer number from the sales data table.\nWhen the Data Engineer tested the individual SQL clauses, they were fast enough (1 second to get the customers, 0.5 second to get the sales data for one customer), but the total runtime of the report is too long.\nHow can this situation be improved?","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","exam_id":166,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/126382-exam-snowpro-advanced-data-engineer-topic-1-question-53/","answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"Rewrite the report to eliminate the use of the loop construct.","C":"Define a clustering key for the sales data table.","B":"Increase the number of maximum clusters of the virtual warehouse.","A":"Increase the size of the virtual warehouse."},"answer_description":""},{"id":"tH6LH4USfohhH9Mns2kg","unix_timestamp":1700158920,"timestamp":"2023-11-16 19:22:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1072663","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731781320.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA makes sense. \nD is definitely wrong.
