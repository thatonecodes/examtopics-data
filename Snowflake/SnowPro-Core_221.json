Partitions scanned: This statistic indicates the number of data partitions (or micro-partitions in Snowflake's terms) that were actually accessed during the execution of a query. Efficient query pruning will reduce the number of partitions scanned because it avoids reading data that does not match the query's filters. A lower number compared to the total available partitions can show that query pruning has effectively reduced the dataset that needed to be scanned.\n\nC. Bytes scanned: This statistic shows the volume of data scanned to fulfill the query. Just like with partitions scanned, effective query pruning should reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned, as it skips over blocks of data that are determined (via metadata inspection) not to contain relevant data. This can significantly enhance query performance, especially in large datasets.","timestamp":"1716484320.0"},{"comment_id":"1040381","poster":"Heetec","timestamp":"1697013780.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nAB - correct\n\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile"}],"answer_ET":"AB","answers_community":["AB (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_id":1105,"answer":"AB"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":1259,"isBeta":false,"id":167,"name":"SnowPro Core","provider":"Snowflake","isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":221},"__N_SSP":true}
