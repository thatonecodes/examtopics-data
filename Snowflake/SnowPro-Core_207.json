As a result, the query processing engine will start spilling the data to local disk. If the local disk space is not sufficient, the spilled data is then saved to remote disks.\n\nThis spilling can have a profound effect on query performance (especially if remote disk is used for spilling). To alleviate this, we recommend:\n\nUsing a larger warehouse (effectively increasing the available memory/local disk space for the operation), and/or\n\nProcessing data in smaller batches.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732491300.0","comment_id":"1217838","poster":"ahadh7621"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nIt's B and C","comments":[{"poster":"ea2023","timestamp":"1739540700.0","content":"How can you choose and answer that use the word \"Only\" instead of the fact that the question ask two answer?\n\nso i'm not ok with the B","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1356450"}],"timestamp":"1730300160.0","comment_id":"1204572","poster":"Lematthew31"},{"timestamp":"1723672440.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nThe spilling can't always be avoided, especially for large batches of data, but it can be decreased by:\n\nReviewing the query for query optimization especially if it is a new query.\nReducing the amount of data processed.
