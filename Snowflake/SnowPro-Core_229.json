As a result, the query processing engine will start spilling the data to local disk. If the local disk space is not sufficient, the spilled data is then saved to remote disks.\n\nThis spilling can have a profound effect on query performance (especially if remote disk is used for spilling). To alleviate this, we recommend:\n\nUsing a larger warehouse (effectively increasing the available memory/local disk space for the operation), and/or\n\nProcessing data in smaller batches."},{"poster":"BobFar","timestamp":"1714422060.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer A is correct!\nAdjusting the available memory of a warehouse can improve performance because a query runs substantially slower when a warehouse runs out of memory, which results in bytes “spilling” onto storage.\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-warehouse","comment_id":"1057168"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA correct - https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Performance-impact-from-local-and-remote-disk-spilling","timestamp":"1712838960.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Heetec","comment_id":"1040642"}],"choices":{"B":"Increasing the virtual warehouse maximum timeout limit","A":"Using a larger virtual warehouse","D":"Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) instead of a temporary table","C":"Increasing the amount of remote storage for the virtual warehouse"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":""},{"id":"bak7lUvYzB9kramB0pD4","question_text":"Which user preferences can be set for a user profile in Snowsight?
