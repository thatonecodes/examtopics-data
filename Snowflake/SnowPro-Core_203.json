Larger warehouses can process more files in parallel, enabling faster data loading.\n\nWhy not A?\nSnowflake recommends moderately sized files (100 MB to 1 GB compressed) to maximize performance and efficiency. Creating very small files leads to high overhead due to metadata management and increases processing time.\n\nKey Snowflake Best Practices for Data Loading:\n\n1. Optimize File Size: Use file sizes between 100 MB and 1 GB (compressed) for efficient parallel loading.\n\n\n2. Utilize Virtual Warehouse Scaling: Use larger virtual warehouses to increase parallelism and processing capacity.\n\n\n3. Batch Data: Minimize small file uploads; batch files into recommended sizes before staging.","comment_id":"1330967","poster":"Mitchdu","timestamp":"1734994860.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726473900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree w A","comment_id":"1284547","poster":"wisemango"},{"comment_id":"1150599","poster":"0e504b5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD\nThe number of data files that can be processed in parallel is determined by the amount of compute resources in a warehouse. \nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-plan","comments":[{"poster":"yaho5","content":"... Unless you are bulk loading a large number of files concurrently (i.e. hundreds or thousands of files), a smaller warehouse (Small, Medium, Large) is generally sufficient.

It can also help reduce the queuing that occurs if a warehouse does not have enough compute resources to process all the queries that are submitted concurrently. Note that warehouse resizing is not intended for handling concurrency issues; instead, use additional warehouses to handle the workload or use a multi-cluster warehouse (if this feature is available for your account).\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723669440.0","comment_id":"1150601","poster":"0e504b5"},{"comment_id":"1050395","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFor query complexity Scale Up , for concurrency and query load tuning scale out","timestamp":"1713776760.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Heetec","timestamp":"1712856660.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1048358","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1048790","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Heetec","timestamp":"1713617100.0","content":"yep, it seems you have right, so really A i think"}],"poster":"kayuhanbiduk","timestamp":"1713586140.0","content":"I thin it's A, because scale out is for handle concurrency. scale up is for handle large and complex query"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC correct - https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-multicluster","comment_id":"1040974"},{"comments":[],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA correct - https://dzone.com/articles/snowflake-performance-tuning-top-5-best-practices","timestamp":"1712752800.0","comment_id":"1039500","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Heetec"}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Scale out the virtual warehouse.","A":"Scale up the virtual warehouse.","C":"Enable standard warehouse scaling.","D":"Enable economy warehouse scaling."},"answer_description":""},{"id":"NpW17nQSdAy8zvrphmpk","answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1647385920,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/72847-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-78-discussion/","choices":{"C":"There are no users logged into Snowflake.","B":"The last query using the Warehouse completes.","A":"All Snowflakes sessions using the Warehouse are terminated.","D":"The Warehouse is inactive for a specified period of time."},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722851700.0","comment_id":"1261013","poster":"hotflake","content":"Auto suspend turns off a virtual warehouse after a specified amount of idle time."},{"content":"D is correct","poster":"Mallikharjuna452","comment_id":"1250532","timestamp":"1721317860.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","comment_id":"894778","poster":"Mayuri917233","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1683791520.0"},{"poster":"SV1122","timestamp":"1672019280.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is D\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-overview.html#auto-suspension-and-auto-resumption","comment_id":"756130"},{"timestamp":"1670480700.0","comment_id":"738687","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","poster":"Tapasgup007","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1663431240.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Hi could you please add or update it some more questions.
