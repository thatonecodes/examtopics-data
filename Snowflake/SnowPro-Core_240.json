Inefficient pruning\nE. Object does not exist or not authorized\n\nExplanation:\n\nA Query Profile in Snowflake is designed to provide insights into the performance characteristics of a specific query. Common query problems that can be identified by the Query Profile include:\n\nB. Inefficient pruning: It can reveal whether pruning (filtering) of data during query execution is being performed efficiently. Inefficient pruning may result in the query scanning more data than necessary.\n\nE. Object does not exist or not authorized: The Query Profile can identify issues related to missing or unauthorized objects in the query. This includes situations where tables or columns referenced in the query do not exist or the user does not have the necessary privileges.\n\nSyntax errors (A), ambiguous column names (C), and queries too large to fit in memory (D) are typically identified during the parsing and compilation phases and may not be specifically addressed by the Query Profile.","timestamp":"1721592480.0","comment_id":"1128204","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Object does not exist or not authorized.
