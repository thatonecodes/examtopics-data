External tokenization allows the preservation of analytical values after de-identification.\n\nExternal tokenization typically involves using a separate service or system to tokenize sensitive data.

These are:-\n\nResult Cache: Which holds the results of every query executed in the past 24 hours. These are available across virtual warehouses, so query results returned to one user is available to any other user on the system who executes the same query, provided the underlying data has not changed.\nLocal Disk Cache: Which is used to cache data used by SQL queries. Whenever data is needed for a given query it's retrieved from the Remote Disk storage, and cached in SSD and memory.\nRemote Disk: Which holds the long term storage.
