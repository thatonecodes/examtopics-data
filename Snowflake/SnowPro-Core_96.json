This enables efficient scanning of individual columns; only the columns referenced by a query are scanned.\n\nSo \n- A is False (3rd point)\n- D is False because the sort is decided from \"how the data is inserted\"\n- E is False (1st point)"},{"timestamp":"1724747820.0","poster":"_yyukta","comment_id":"1160441","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nBC are correct"},{"poster":"Marge23","content":"Selected Answer: BC\ncorrect","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1010960","timestamp":"1710816600.0"},{"timestamp":"1705171680.0","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nCorrect","comment_id":"950869","poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Micro-partitions can overlap.\nNo relationship to Time Travel.\nSort is based on Data\nAns = \nC\nD (Though rows are mapped not not sorted)","timestamp":"1703786100.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"936858","poster":"Franzoz"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB & C\n\nA.CAN OVERLAP\nD.micropartitions are created based on the order of the data loaded/inserted.
