COPY INTO\n\nIn Snowflake, the \"COPY INTO\" command is used to unload data from a Snowflake table into a file in a stage. The stage acts as an intermediate storage location for the unloaded data, and the data can then be transferred to an external storage location such as Amazon S3 or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.\n\nThe syntax for the \"COPY INTO\" command is as follows:\n\nCOPY INTO [table_name] FROM [stage_name] FILE_FORMAT = [file_format];\n\nWhere [table_name] is the name of the Snowflake table from which data is being unloaded, [stage_name] is the name of the stage where the unloaded data is stored, and [file_format] is the format of the unloaded data files (such as CSV or Parquet).","timestamp":"1691578080.0","comment_id":"803226","upvote_count":"2","poster":"markpumc"},{"timestamp":"1687953600.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"759907","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAs illustrated in the diagram below, unloading data to a local file system is performed in two, separate steps:\n\nStep 1\nUse the COPY INTO <location> command to copy the data from the Snowflake database table into one or more files in a Snowflake stage. In the SQL statement, you specify the stage (named stage or table/user stage) where the files are written.\n\nRegardless of the stage you use, this step requires a running, current virtual warehouse for the session if you execute the command manually or within a script. The warehouse provides the compute resources to write rows from the table.\n\nStep 2\nUse the GET command to download the data files to your local file system.\n\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-unload-snowflake.html","poster":"SV1122"}],"timestamp":"2022-12-28 15:00:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"WRITE","A":"COPY INTO","B":"GET","D":"EXTRACT INTO"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Which command is used to unload data from a Snowflake table into a file in a stage?"},{"id":"o9jKpOrghSH1MkI1lhce","answer_ET":"CE","answer":"CE","exam_id":167,"timestamp":"2022-12-09 08:34:00","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["CE (50%)","BC (25%)","DE (19%)","6%"],"discussion":[{"poster":"yaho5","comment_id":"1188046","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nCD - correct answers.\nThe question ask about the advantage of clones OVER tables created with a statement CREATE TABLE AS SELECT ...\nBoth tables (clone and the one created with the statement) do not copy the underlaying data, so there is NO advantage of a clone over the other table.","timestamp":"1727873880.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CE\nC and E are correct.","timestamp":"1708380120.0","poster":"singhks","comment_id":"985419","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"873802","timestamp":"1697643360.0","poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nCorrect"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694519580.0","poster":"EmiB","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nC - Cloning is fast, but not instantaneous, particularly for large objects (e.g. tables). - so ALMOST is correct","comments":[{"timestamp":"1694520120.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"EmiB","comment_id":"837085","content":"D - Incorrect - Time travel data is not available for table T1_CLONE.
