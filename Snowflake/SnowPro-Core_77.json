The key difference between standard and personalized listings is the ability to access the data share. Personalized listings allow you to control which consumers can access the data.\n\nA standard listing provides instant access to a published data set. To access the data consumers need to click Get Data button which allows you to create a Database with this dataset and will be added to Databases available. This can be done only by the Account Admin role.\n\nA personalized listing allows customers to request specific data sets. To access data from a personalized listing, consumers must submit a request by clicking the Request button, and provide their contact information. Once a request is submitted, the data provider is notified. The provider then contacts the consumer after which a personalized data set is created and shared with the consumer.","timestamp":"1697380440.0","comment_id":"1044226"},{"poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","timestamp":"1689255960.0","comment_id":"950704","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nhttps://www.bing.com/search?pglt=41&q=What+types+of+data+listings+are+available+in+the+Snowflake+Data+Marketplace%3F&cvid=cd2c6f4d98264386b6b9dd2e423468a1&aqs=edge..69i57j69i11004.2174j0j1&FORM=ANNAB1&PC=U531"},{"poster":"srj_mehta","comment_id":"926814","upvote_count":"1","content":"only E\n\nhttps://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/collaboration-listings-about#types-of-listings","timestamp":"1687108260.0"},{"poster":"muks86","upvote_count":"2","content":"The Snowflake Data Marketplace offers two types of data listings, Standard Data Listings and Personalized Data Listings","timestamp":"1676879520.0","comment_id":"814972"},{"comment_id":"780382","content":"Selected Answer: E (other options don't match)\nMarketplace listings can be free listings, paid listings, or personalized listings tailored to specific consumers.\nhttps://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/collaboration-listings-about.html#types-of-listings\nUnder MarketPlace Listing","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1674072240.0","poster":"sonu10906997"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"777593","timestamp":"1673867520.0","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nby this doc: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/snowflake-data-marketplace-minzhen-yang?trk=articles_directory\nThe right answer id D,E","poster":"BigDataBB"},{"comment_id":"774583","poster":"BigDataBB","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1673620800.0","content":"I don't find an official name as standard for the listing what I found on the documentation is:\nThe pricing status of each data listing is indicated on the listing: Free, Paid, or Purchased.\n\n\"https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/consumer-listings-exploring.html\""},{"comment_id":"730338","timestamp":"1669722600.0","poster":"stornati","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nThe Snowflake Marketplace offers two types of data listings which define how data is shared and consumed.
