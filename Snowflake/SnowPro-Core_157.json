Any difference in syntax, including lowercase versus uppercase, or the use of table aliases, will inhibit 100% cache reuse. For example, consider the following queries, run in succession:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT(severity) FROM weather_events;\nSELECT DISTINCT(severity) FROM weather_events;\nSELECT DISTINCT(severity) FROM weather_events we;\nselect distinct(severity) from weather_events;\nThe first query will populate the cache, and the identical second query will benefit from 100% cache reuse.
