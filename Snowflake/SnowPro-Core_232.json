For example, you can define a policy for an email address once and apply it to 1000s of email columns across databases and schemas.\n\n-Masking policy conditions can be expressed using Conditional Expression Functions and Context Functions or by querying a custom entitlement table. You can use the context functions INVOKER_ROLE and INVOKER_SHARE for use with views and shares, respectively.\n\n-Masking functions can be any of the built-in functions (e.g. REGEXP_REPLACE, SHA2 , SHA2_HEX), User-Defined Functions Overview, or Writing External Functions (for de-tokenization using an external tokenization provider).","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1107373"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA masking policy consists of a single data type, one or more conditions, and one or more masking functions","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1086965","poster":"junaid2107","timestamp":"1717427940.0"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":167,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/124991-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-907-discussion/","answer_description":"","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1698719640,"question_text":"What does a masking policy consist of in Snowflake?","timestamp":"2023-10-31 03:34:00"},{"id":"303UxpJ1MphpA0guI6jD","answers_community":["DE (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-10-27 22:19:00","answer_description":"","exam_id":167,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736848500.0","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nAgreed","comment_id":"1340262"},{"poster":"Kumaravelu2006","upvote_count":"3","content":"DE is right","comment_id":"1116201","timestamp":"1720381980.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1056045","timestamp":"1714290840.0","poster":"Pradeep_7869","content":"DE is correct"},{"timestamp":"1714249140.0","comment_id":"1055817","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nDE correct","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Heetec"}],"choices":{"D":"Executing the SELECT statement on a shared table","A":"Cloning a shared table","C":"Using Time Travel on a shared table","B":"Modifying the data in a shared table","E":"Joining the data from a shared table with another table"},"unix_timestamp":1698437940,"isMC":true,"answer":"DE","question_id":1157,"question_text":"What actions can be performed by a consumer account on a shared database?
