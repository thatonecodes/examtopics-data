This allows you to select specific rows based on certain conditions.\nB: When you define the structure of the target table in Snowflake using CREATE PIPE, you can specify the order of columns. This means you can control the order in which incoming data columns are mapped to the target table.\nC: Similar to reordering columns, you can specify only the columns from the incoming data that you want to copy into the target table.
