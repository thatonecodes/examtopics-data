Initiating user sessions: Federated authentication allows users to initiate their sessions in Snowflake using credentials managed by an external identity provider.

Logging into Snowflake: This is the primary activity enabled by federated authentication. Users log into Snowflake using SSO capabilities provided through federated authentication with an IdP, such as Okta, Azure AD, or any other SAML 2.0 compliant provider.
