When Snowflake warehouse cannot fit an operation in memory, it starts spilling (storing) data first to the local disk of a warehouse node, and then to remote storage.\n\nIn such a case, Snowflake first tries to temporarily store the data on the warehouse local disk. As this means extra IO operations, any query that requires spilling will take longer than a similar query running on similar data that is capable to fit the operations in memory.\n\nAlso, if the local disk is not sufficient to fit the spilled data, Snowflake further tries to write to the remote cloud storage, which will be shown in the query profile as \"Bytes spilled to remote storage\".","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1067322","poster":"BigDataBB","timestamp":"1699629000.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731479400.0","content":"Has anyone taken this certificate recently? are the questions here still relevant?
