Scaling rhythmically\nB. Scaling max\nC. Scaling out\nD. Scaling up\n\nThe correct answer is B. Scaling max.\n\nScaling max refers to increasing the maximum limit of resources that can be allocated to a system or application. In the context of a Multi-Cluster Warehouse, increasing the maximum number of clusters would require more resources to be allocated to the system in order to accommodate the additional clusters. This is an example of scaling max because it involves increasing the maximum limit of resources that can be allocated to the Multi-Cluster Warehouse.\n\nScaling rhythmically, on the other hand, refers to increasing or decreasing resources in a gradual and predictable manner based on the workload of the system. Scaling out involves adding more instances of a system or application to distribute the workload across multiple nodes. Scaling up involves increasing the resources of a single node in order to handle a larger workload.","comment_id":"877400"},{"comment_id":"867385","timestamp":"1681222560.0","content":"Correct answer : C\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations#scaling-up-vs-scaling-out\n\nSnowflake supports two ways to scale warehouses:\n1.
