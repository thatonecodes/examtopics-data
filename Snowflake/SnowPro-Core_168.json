Similar to shared-disk architectures, Snowflake uses a central data repository for persisted data that is accessible from all compute nodes in the platform. But similar to shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake processes queries using MPP (massively parallel processing) compute clusters where each node in the cluster stores a portion of the entire data set locally. This approach offers the data management simplicity of a shared-disk architecture, but with the performance and scale-out benefits of a shared-nothing architecture.","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674388980.0","poster":"ajay_1233456","comment_id":"784258","content":"C is correct"},{"poster":"sonu10906997","upvote_count":"1","content":"C is correct","comment_id":"779031","timestamp":"1673966100.0"},{"content":"Was on exam Dec 31st, 2022","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"762958","timestamp":"1672523100.0","poster":"SV1122"},{"timestamp":"1671180420.0","poster":"baig123","comment_id":"746976","content":"B is correct, snowflake is share disk and share nothing architecture, shared disk a common persistent storage data shared across all compute node, where as share nothing architecture, snowflake process data using MPP engine, where each virtual warehouse stores data locally.","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Tapasgup007","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","comment_id":"738012","timestamp":"1670426340.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1662699360.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"664231","content":"C is correct","poster":"jveag"},{"comment_id":"646751","poster":"Percy2112","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMulti-Cluster and Shared Data.","timestamp":"1660483080.0"},{"comment_id":"642656","poster":"vkc12","timestamp":"1659656580.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"626131","content":"Answer is B because it's Snowflake's database architecture. if it was Snowflake's architecture it would be C.","timestamp":"1656763920.0","poster":"chadli123","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"619743","poster":"sachinsvt","timestamp":"1655804160.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSnowflake is known as Multi-Cluster and Shared Data."},{"content":"C is the correct Answer","timestamp":"1655605920.0","comment_id":"618495","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sauby2021"},{"timestamp":"1654031580.0","comment_id":"609907","poster":"learnazureportal","upvote_count":"1","content":"C is the correct Answer."},{"content":"C is the answer\nBuilt from the ground up for the cloud, Snowflake’s unique multi-cluster shared data architecture delivers the performance, scale, elasticity, and concurrency today’s organizations require.","timestamp":"1652110260.0","comment_id":"599106","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Graghu"},{"timestamp":"1649818680.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1652739240.0","comment_id":"602703","content":"I’m changing my answer to shared data and multi luster (as per snowflake training materials )","poster":"Surbin"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nSnowflake architecture is described as shared disk and shared nothing .
