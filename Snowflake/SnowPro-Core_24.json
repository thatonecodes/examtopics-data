Workloads that include on-demand data analyses\nWorkloads that include on-demand data analyses: These types of workloads often involve complex queries that need to be executed quickly and efficiently.

When it is enabled for a warehouse, it can improve overall warehouse performance by reducing the impact of outlier queries, which are queries that use more resources than the typical query. The query acceleration service does this by offloading portions of the query processing work to shared compute resources that are provided by the service.\n\nExamples of the types of workloads that might benefit from the query acceleration service include:\n\nAd hoc analytics.
