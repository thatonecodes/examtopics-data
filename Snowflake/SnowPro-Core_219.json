Concurrency is the primary benefit when scaling out by adding clusters to a multi-cluster warehouse.\n\nBy adding more clusters, you increase the number of compute resources available, which allows the warehouse to handle more queries and users concurrently. This can help prevent bottlenecks and improve overall query performance, but the primary goal of adding clusters is to increase concurrency.\n\nB. Performance can also improve as a result of scaling out, but it is not the primary benefit. The main focus is on improving concurrency by enabling more users and queries to be processed simultaneously.","comment_id":"881326"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"fahfouhi94","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1708335540.0","comment_id":"813915"},{"comment_id":"756123","timestamp":"1703554260.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SV1122","content":"Concurrency is correct"},{"poster":"lhstudylh","comment_id":"558192","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1677602760.0","content":"Correct answer"}],"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Performance","A":"Concurrency"},"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1646066760,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/72171-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-85-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"When scaling out by adding clusters to a multi-cluster warehouse, you are primarily scaling for improved:","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2022-02-28 17:46:00","topic":"1"},{"id":"cDCW5h2CaLibliPG9QCh","question_id":1093,"answer_ET":"AD","choices":{"C":"Increase the MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL parameter.","D":"Increase the warehouse size.","A":"Reduce queuing.","B":"Allow memory spillage.","E":"Suspend the warehouse frequently."},"timestamp":"2023-10-10 21:56:00","exam_id":167,"unix_timestamp":1696967760,"answer":"AD","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730304300.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1058009","content":"AD is correct.\nOptimizing Warehouses for Performance:\n1-Reduce queues (if WH is not multi cluster make it multi cluster else add another WH)\n2-Resolve memory spillage ( scale up or convert it to Snowpark-optimized WH)\n3-Increase warehouse size (Scale up)\n4-Trying Query Acceleration - set ENABLE_QUERY_ACCELERATION = true\n5-Optimizing the Warehouse Cache (by increasing Auto-suspension)\n6-Limiting Concurrently Running Queries (Decrease the MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL)\n\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-warehouse","poster":"BobFar"},{"comment_id":"1039833","timestamp":"1728590160.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nAD correct - https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/performance-query-warehouse","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Heetec"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/123186-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-850-discussion/","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["AD (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"What strategies can be used to optimize the performance of a virtual warehouse?
