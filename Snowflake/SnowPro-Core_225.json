Snowflake doesn't have direct access to the data format or schema within those files.\nTo query the data, you need to first load it into a Snowflake table using the COPY INTO command. This process reads the data from the external stage, parses it based on the specified format definition, and populates the target table within Snowflake.\nOnce the data is loaded into a Snowflake table, you can then use standard SQL queries to access and analyze it.\nIn essence, external stages serve as a staging area for data before it's brought into Snowflake for processing and querying.","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"A is correct","comment_id":"1136246","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722374640.0","poster":"Bujji1234"},{"comment_id":"1072879","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTrue:\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/querying-stage","upvote_count":"2","poster":"oscarglob","timestamp":"1715894520.0"},{"poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","timestamp":"1705313640.0","comment_id":"952159","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect"},{"comment_id":"894794","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mayuri917233","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1699696620.0"},{"timestamp":"1686222600.0","poster":"Tapasgup007","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","comment_id":"739087"},{"comment_id":"651568","comments":[{"poster":"oscarglob","timestamp":"1715894460.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Yes, source: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/querying-stage","comment_id":"1072878"}],"content":"Snowflake supports using standard SQL to query data files located in an internal (i.e. Snowflake) stage or named external (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure) stage.
