True\n\nOnce a micro-partition is created in Snowflake, it cannot be modified. Micro-partitions are immutable, meaning that after data is written to them, they cannot be altered or updated directly. However, Snowflake automatically manages data storage and optimization. If data in a micro-partition needs to be updated, the system will create new micro-partitions with the updated data, and older partitions will eventually be marked for deletion during data maintenance operations like vacuuming.\n\nThis immutability helps Snowflake maintain its performance and data consistency over time."},{"content":"A.True","timestamp":"1721373480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mallikharjuna452","comment_id":"1250958"},{"timestamp":"1698651660.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nImmutable","comment_id":"1057436","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nmicro partition can be changed but not deleted.","poster":"Thaiya","comment_id":"1004376","timestamp":"1694392500.0"},{"poster":"ifmateus","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1711625280.0","content":"In reclustering context, reorganizing doesn't mean that anything changes in existing micro-partitions' structure - instead the new micro-partitions are created with the same keys as in old micro-partitions before reclustering but reorganized to fit the clustering requirements.
