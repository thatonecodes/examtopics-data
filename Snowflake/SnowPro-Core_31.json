In Snowflake, data sharing is not limited to sharing data with only a single data consumer. Snowflake allows data providers to share data with multiple data consumers or even make data publicly accessible, depending on the configured sharing settings.\n\nWith Snowflake's secure data sharing capabilities, data providers can share specific datasets or entire databases with one or more data consumers. Data consumers can be given read-only access to the shared data, allowing them to query and analyze the data without being able to modify or change it. This flexible data sharing model enables collaboration and data exchange between different organizations or teams within an organization.\n\nFurthermore, Snowflake also provides granular access controls and permissions, allowing data providers to define who can access their shared data and what level of access each data consumer has. This ensures data privacy and security while enabling effective data sharing and collaboration."},{"comment_id":"894832","comments":[{"timestamp":"1684151640.0","upvote_count":"5","poster":"akhandelwal680","comments":[{"comment_id":"953543","poster":"Rajivnb","timestamp":"1689530280.0","content":"Sorry Mayuri.
