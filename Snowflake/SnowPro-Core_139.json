The difference between them is that UNION ALL simply concatenates inputs, while UNION does the same, but also performs duplicate elimination.\n\nA common mistake is to use UNION when the UNION ALL semantics are sufficient. These queries show in Query Profile as a UnionAll operator with an extra Aggregate operator on top (which performs duplicate elimination).","timestamp":"1692322200.0","upvote_count":"5","poster":"sjndds","comment_id":"812606"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1166466","timestamp":"1725536760.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. UNION without ALL","poster":"_yyukta"},{"timestamp":"1721594760.0","content":"Option C. In a Query Profile, a UnionAll operator with an extra Aggregate operator on top typically signifies a UNION without ALL in the query. In SQL, a UNION operation combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. When you use UNION without the ALL keyword, it automatically removes duplicate rows from the result set. This deduplication process requires an aggregation step to identify and eliminate duplicates, which is why the Aggregate operator appears on top of the UnionAll operator in the query profile.","poster":"lotus24","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1128226"},{"timestamp":"1713214200.0","poster":"BobFar","content":"The correct answer is C.\nCommon Query Problems Identified by Query Profile:\n\n1)Joining tables without providing a join condition (Solution: adding join condition) \n2)UNION without ALL (elimination duplicates too Large to fit in memory) (solution: Using a larger warehouse or Processing data in smaller batches).\n3)Inefficient Pruning : pruning is only effective if the data is stored in a way that is correlated with the query's filter attributes (solution: cluster key, Materialized view)\n\n\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile#common-query-problems-identified-by-query-profile","comment_id":"1044435","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","content":"Selected Answer: C\ncorrect","timestamp":"1705879500.0","comment_id":"958973","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694365320.0","poster":"EmiB","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile","comment_id":"835333"}],"exam_id":167,"unix_timestamp":1676691000,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/99740-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-488-discussion/","answer_description":""},{"id":"kg2Rk60Qhk3QkOjb34jd","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1330160","timestamp":"1734806280.0","poster":"Mitchdu","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhile Snowflake primarily employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ABAC can be implemented to enhance data security and governance.\n\nImplementing ABAC in Snowflake:\n\n1. Row Access Policies:\n\nSnowflake's row access policies enable row-level security by defining conditions under which specific rows in a table are visible to users based on their attributes.\n\nThese policies evaluate attributes such as user roles, departments, or locations to control data visibility.\n\n2. Dynamic Data Masking:\n\nThis feature allows for the masking of sensitive data elements based on user attributes, ensuring that only authorized users can view unmasked data.\n\nIt supports ABAC by dynamically adjusting data visibility without altering the underlying data.\n\n3. Integration with External Tools:\n\nThird-party platforms like Immuta provide advanced ABAC capabilities for Snowflake, enabling policy creation based on user attributes and other criteria.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"damaldon","comment_id":"1269660","content":"Ans.
