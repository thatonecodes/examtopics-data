To validate the files that have been loaded earlier using the COPY INTO command:\n\nThis option is incorrect. The VALIDATE function is used to check for errors in the data loading process, not to validate files that have already been loaded.\n\nB. To fix errors that were made during the execution of the COPY INTO command:\n\nThis option is incorrect. The VALIDATE function does not fix errors; it only identifies and reports them.\n\nD. To identify potential issues in the COPY INTO command before it is executed:\n\nThis option is incorrect. The VALIDATE function is used after the COPY INTO command has been executed to check for errors, not to identify potential issues beforehand.\n\nThe correct options are:\n\nC.
