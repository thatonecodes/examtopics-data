If you have a large number of files to load, it can be time-consuming and less efficient to list them all explicitly. Additionally, if new files are added frequently, you would need to update the list regularly.\n\n\nOn the other hand, option B allows you to load all files with a common path or prefix, which means you can load multiple files in a single operation without needing to specify each file individually. This approach is more scalable and efficient for bulk data loading, especially when dealing with large datasets or frequent data updates."},{"poster":"MultiCloudIronMan","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhat is generally the FASTEST way to bulk load data files from a stage?","comment_id":"953071","timestamp":"1689488340.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/115443-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-719-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Using the Snowpipe REST API","B":"Loading by path (internal stages) / prefix","A":"Specifying a list of specific files to load","D":"Using pattern matching to identify specific files by pattern"},"question_text":"What is generally the FASTEST way to bulk load data files from a stage?","timestamp":"2023-07-16 08:19:00","question_images":[],"answer":"A","exam_id":167,"unix_timestamp":1689488340},{"id":"dxssYLF8SRr2tXvUz5DU","question_text":"True or False: Users are able to see the result sets of queries executed by other users that share their same role.","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"True","B":"False"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/70091-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-72-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2022-01-16 01:13:00","topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"11","comment_id":"524511","timestamp":"1642291980.0","poster":"rsmurugan","content":"Answer is B\n\nViewing Query Results\n\nA user cannot view the result set from a query that another user executed.
