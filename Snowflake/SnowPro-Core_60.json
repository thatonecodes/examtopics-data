I addressed it as for dynamic tables, which is a mistake. On the other hand, in variant A , it is about a 7 day Time Travel period which cannot be kept, as it is not by default value. In addition, C is not right, because cloning transient table to permanent table cannot be cloned into permanent tables.

By default, dynamic table data is retained for 7 days in fail-safe storage. For dynamic tables with high refresh throughput, this can significantly increase storage consumption. Therefore, you should make a dynamic table transient only if its data doesn’t need the same level of data protection and recovery provided by permanent tables.\" I would say A","timestamp":"1738671540.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1738042500.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDimension tables often store relatively small amounts of data but can change frequently due to updates, inserts, or deletes.
