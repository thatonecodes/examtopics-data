Ultimately, query performance is the best indicator of how well-clustered a table is:\n->If queries on a table are performing as needed or expected, the table is likely well-clustered.\n-> If query performance degrades over time, the table is likely no longer well-clustered and may benefit from clustering.\n\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-micropartitions\n\nThe images are exactly from that link, which also states \"The diagram is not intended to represent an actual table.
