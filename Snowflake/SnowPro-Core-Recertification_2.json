Prevent the user from executing additional queries is not the correct answer is because Snowflake's network policies are designed to enforce security by immediately terminating sessions that do not comply with the policy rules. When a user's IP address does not match the user-level network policy, Snowflake logs the user out to prevent any potential security risks12.\n\nPreventing the user from executing additional queries while allowing them to remain logged in could still pose a security threat, as the user would still have an active session.
