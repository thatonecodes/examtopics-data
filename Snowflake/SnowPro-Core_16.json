Cast using a SELECT statement\n\nExplanation:\n\nCast using a SELECT statement: When using the COPY INTO [table] command, you can include a SELECT statement that performs various transformations, including casting data types. This allows you to transform the data as it is loaded into the target table. For example, you can convert string data to a date format or change the data type of a column during the load process.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733624280.0","poster":"cybe001"},{"poster":"nexerSnow","comment_id":"1181059","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727105520.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe COPY command supports:\nColumn reordering\ncolumn omission\ncasts using a SELECT statement\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-transform"}],"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":167,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-03-23 18:32:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1711215120,"topic":"1","question_id":76,"choices":{"A":"Filter using a WHERE clause","D":"Order using an ORDER BY Clause","C":"Cast using a SELECT statement","B":"Filter using a LIMIT keyword"}},{"id":"L16AgHumxnPWPYkzZAky","timestamp":"2024-03-23 18:49:00","question_images":[],"question_id":77,"exam_id":167,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/137014-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-1067-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Review the granted privileges to the database object.","C":"Query the ACCESS_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema.","D":"Query the REPLICATION_USAGE_HISTORY view in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema.","B":"Review the row access policy for the database object."},"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"nexerSnow","comment_id":"1181070","timestamp":"1727106540.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://theinformationlab.nl/2022/10/04/history-access-in-snowflake/"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1711216140,"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"How can a Snowflake administrator determine which user has accessed a database object that contains sensitive information?","answer_images":[]},{"id":"aObDXjpcEr30GAJxNY24","question_id":78,"topic":"1","question_text":"How does conditional data masking work in Snowflake?","unix_timestamp":1711349820,"exam_id":167,"answer":"D","choices":{"D":"It selectively masks a column value based on another column.","C":"It masks all values in a given column.","B":"It selectively masks multiple columns.","A":"It selectively masks plain text data."},"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-03-25 07:57:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/137154-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-1068-discussion/","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Cecenceto","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI also thin the right answer is A.","comment_id":"1299882","timestamp":"1729313460.0"},{"timestamp":"1712736000.0","comment_id":"1192810","poster":"yaho5","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnd I think it is C.

It selectively masks plain text data - because conditional data masking does involve selectively masking data based on certain conditions or criteria. However, it's important to clarify that these conditions are often related to user roles or other security measures rather than the content of the data itself. The key feature of conditional data masking is its ability to dynamically display either the original data or a masked version of the data based on the evaluation of these conditions.","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (67%)","C (17%)","A (17%)"]},{"id":"PeqbuNJyjgDgsLf0a7wG","topic":"1","question_id":79,"question_text":"If a virtual warehouse runs for 61 seconds, shuts down, and then restarts and runs for 30 seconds, for how many seconds is it billed?","unix_timestamp":1713527400,"exam_id":167,"answer":"D","choices":{"C":"120","A":"60","B":"91","D":"121"},"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-04-19 13:50:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/139175-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-1069-discussion/","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD - virtual warehouse are always billed for the entire minute after they are started even if they are shut down earlier","timestamp":"1737558060.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MatthieuDN","comment_id":"1344816"},{"poster":"56d43d6","comment_id":"1333758","content":"D: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations#how-are-credits-charged-for-warehouses","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735510140.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD\nFrom doc. :\n\"The minimum billing charge for provisioning compute resources is 1 minute (i.e. 60 seconds).\n\nThere is no benefit to stopping a warehouse before the first 60-second period is over because the credits have already been billed for that period.\n\nAfter the first 60 seconds, all subsequent billing for a running warehouse is per-second (until all its compute resources are shut down).
