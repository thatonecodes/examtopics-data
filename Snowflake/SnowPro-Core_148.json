This is because, when you share data, no actual data is copied, so there is no additional storage required and therefore no associated additional cost. Even the process of creating the share and granting privileges for databases and other supported database objects (schemas, UDFs, tables, and views) to a share does not incur any direct cost since these are metadata operations and are thus part of Cloud Services. Snowflake credits are used to pay for the usage of the cloud services that exceeds 10% of the daily usage of the compute resources. Usage for cloud services is charged only if the daily consumption of cloud services exceeds 10% of the daily usage of the compute resources.\n\nIf data is shared outside the region where the Snowflake account is hosted then will be additional storage costs for replication.","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1689622680.0","poster":"Venkat_ithakota"},{"comment_id":"930576","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Leinho","timestamp":"1687440300.0","content":"There is ne additional fee for datashare itself"},{"timestamp":"1683790740.0","comment_id":"894743","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","poster":"Mayuri917233"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThere is no extra cost in a share","poster":"piconcomeback","comment_id":"882677","timestamp":"1682601960.0"},{"poster":"c0d3g","timestamp":"1677994980.0","comment_id":"829658","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNo additional cost for share.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"826013","poster":"Josa2","timestamp":"1677684120.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAs documentation there are no additional costs for the share"},{"comment_id":"801999","upvote_count":"1","poster":"KarBiswa","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSharing is free as it within Snowflake accounts","timestamp":"1675858800.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ajay_1233456","timestamp":"1674388740.0","comment_id":"784254","content":"B is correct"},{"poster":"aalonso","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B.
