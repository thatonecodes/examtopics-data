That procedure will contain a DELETE statement that includes a filter (a WHERE clause) to control which data can be deleted through the filter.\nIf you need an owner’s rights stored procedure to perform actions on a table, view, or function that the caller has the privileges to access, you can have the caller pass a reference to that table, view, or function.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730130540.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"943678","timestamp":"1688556840.0","content":"Answer is C and is validated","poster":"hillcat111"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/stored-procedures-rights#choosing-between-owner-s-rights-and-caller-s-rights","comment_id":"871764","upvote_count":"3","poster":"serg_khar","timestamp":"1681649880.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nTested and C is the correct answer","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"867418","timestamp":"1681224660.0","poster":"callipso21"}],"answer_description":"","exam_id":165,"answer":"C","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/105948-exam-snowpro-advanced-architect-topic-1-question-41/","choices":{"A":"Create a stored procedure that runs with caller’s rights, including the appropriate \"> 5 years\" business logic, and grant USAGE on this procedure to ORDER_ADMIN.
