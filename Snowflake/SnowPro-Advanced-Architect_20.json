It's widely used in data warehousing to optimize for query performance and ease of understanding for end-users. Snowflake supports this model well due to its columnar storage and performance optimization features.\nD: Inmon/3NF: This model, proposed by Bill Inmon, focuses on a normalized structure (Third Normal Form) which is more flexible and reduces redundancy. Snowflake’s capabilities support the normalized model, ensuring data integrity and reducing storage costs.\nF: Data Vault: This modeling approach is designed to provide long-term historical storage of data from multiple operational systems. It supports agile and scalable data integration and changes. Snowflake’s support for semi-structured data and its efficient storage makes it a good fit for the Data Vault methodology.","comment_id":"1241528","poster":"MSIDDIQUI18"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["BDF (100%)"],"choices":{"E":"Bayesian hierarchical model","B":"Dimensional/Kimball","A":"Graph model","D":"Inmon/3NF","C":"Data lake","F":"Data vault"},"timestamp":"2024-07-03 18:27:00","answer_ET":"BDF","answer":"BDF","isMC":true,"question_id":97,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/143243-exam-snowpro-advanced-architect-topic-1-question-88/","unix_timestamp":1720024020,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":165,"question_text":"Which data models can be used when modeling tables in a Snowflake environment?
