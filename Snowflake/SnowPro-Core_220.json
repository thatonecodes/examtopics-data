Account: The MINS_TO_BYPASS_NETWORK_POLICY setting is an account-level parameter in Snowflake. This setting configures the duration, in minutes, that users can bypass network policies applied to the account. Typically, it's used to provide temporary access to Snowflake through network policies that would otherwise restrict access based on IP whitelisting or other network-based controls. This parameter is crucial for situations where temporary exceptions to stringent network policies are necessary, such as for maintenance, troubleshooting, or specific authorized tasks.\n\nA. User: Incorrect because MINS_TO_BYPASS_NETWORK_POLICY is not set at an individual user level. User settings typically involve configurations like default roles, default warehouses, or other user-specific preferences and constraints.","poster":"cybe001","timestamp":"1732388340.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1216761"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA correct","timestamp":"1712823180.0","poster":"Heetec","comment_id":"1040355","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1712822700.0","poster":"Heetec","comment_id":"1040344","upvote_count":"1","content":"A correct - https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/desc-user#:~:text=The%20user%20object%20property%20MINS_TO_BYPASS_NETWORK_POLICY%20defines%20the%20number,temporary%20workaround%20to%20allow%20user%20access%20to%20Snowflake."},{"poster":"Amitsnowflake","content":"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/desc-user\nA","comment_id":"1040302","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712820480.0"}],"question_id":1098,"unix_timestamp":1697009280,"choices":{"A":"User","C":"Account","D":"Organization","B":"Role"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/123246-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-855-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-10-11 09:28:00","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_images":[]},{"id":"hTfFND4YmRxm3d0AX7EL","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","exam_id":167,"timestamp":"2023-10-11 10:12:00","choices":{"B":"EMPTY_FIELD_AS_NULL","D":"ESCAPE_UNENCLOSED_FIELD","C":"NULL_IF","A":"SKIP_BYTE_ORDER_MARK"},"question_text":"When unloading the data for file format type specified (TYPE = 'CSV'), SQL NULL can be converted to string ‘null’ using which file format option?","question_id":1099,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/123252-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-856-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1058095","content":"C correct \nNULL_IF\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-unload-considerations#empty-strings-and-null-values","timestamp":"1730309520.0","poster":"BobFar"},{"comment_id":"1040352","poster":"Heetec","timestamp":"1728634320.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC correct - https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-unload-considerations","upvote_count":"2"}],"unix_timestamp":1697011920,"topic":"1"},{"id":"FzM3uJvgBRZxUT3t7tg7","question_id":1100,"exam_id":167,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/123253-exam-snowpro-core-topic-1-question-857-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-10-11 10:25:00","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"COMPLETE_TASK_GRAPHS","C":"CURRENT_TASK_GRAPHS","B":"TASK_DEPENDENTS","A":"TASK_HISTORY"},"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1697012700,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which table function should be used to view details on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) run that is presently scheduled or is executing?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCURRENT_TASK_GRAPHS\nReturns the status of a graph run that is currently scheduled or is executing.
