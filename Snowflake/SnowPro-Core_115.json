They are separate from the storage layer, where the actual data is stored in micro-partitions, and the compute layer, where query execution takes place.\n\nVirtual warehouses are isolated compute resources that can be scaled up or down as needed to meet changing query performance requirements. When a query is executed, Snowflake automatically selects a virtual warehouse to run the query based on its current workload and available resources.\n\nInfrastructure management, metadata management, query parsing and optimization, and permanent storage of micro-partitions are not responsibilities of Snowflake's virtual warehouses.
