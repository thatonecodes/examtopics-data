However, if developers need to work with production data that has specific columns masked (potentially using different views or transformations), a direct copy of the data may be necessary to apply these transformations without affecting the original production data.\nC: When developers require a separate Snowflake account for development and testing purposes, especially in scenarios where they need to work independently and may need to modify the data structure or content significantly, a copy of the production data into the development/testing account ensures isolation and control over their own environment. Zero-copy cloning does not provide this level of isolation between different Snowflake accounts.","poster":"MSIDDIQUI18","comment_id":"1241565","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720027800.0"}],"choices":{"E":"The release process requires pre-production testing of changes with data of production scale and complexity.
