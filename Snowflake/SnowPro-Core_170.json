Snowflake runs queries on its servers, and Snowsight is simply an interface for interacting with Snowflake's services. Exiting Snowsight does not affect the execution of the query itself.\n\nOnce a query is submitted to Snowflake, it continues to run until completion, cancellation, or until it reaches a timeout limit, regardless of whether the user remains connected to the Snowsight interface. The user can check the status or results of the query later by reconnecting to Snowsight or by accessing the Snowflake web interface or other client tools. Snowflake also provides options to monitor and manage long-running queries through its web interface or using SQL commands.","poster":"Lematthew31","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1203977","timestamp":"1730207640.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726511400.0","poster":"SSahar","comment_id":"1175265","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI executed a query with snowsight verified th session ID then logged out, when I loged in the previous query continued to execute.
