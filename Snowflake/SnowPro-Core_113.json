VARIANT “null” values are not the same as SQL NULL values: In Snowflake, a VARIANT type can store semi-structured data like JSON. A JSON null is distinct from an SQL NULL. JSON null is treated as a valid value in Snowflake, while SQL NULL represents the absence of a value.\n\nB. It is recommended to do frequent, single row DMLs: This is false. Snowflake is optimized for bulk operations, and frequent single-row DMLs (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are not recommended as they can lead to inefficiencies and higher costs.\n\nC. It is recommended to validate the data before loading into the Snowflake target table: This is true. Validating data before loading ensures data quality and avoids errors or inconsistencies in the target table.\n\nD. It is recommended to use staging tables to manage MERGE statements: This is true. Staging tables are often used to prepare and validate data before applying MERGE operations, which helps ensure data integrity and efficiency.\n\nCorrect Choices: A, C, D","comment_id":"1358139","poster":"Sudhansu21","timestamp":"1739855880.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721311740.0","content":"ACD are correct","poster":"Mallikharjuna452","comment_id":"1250445"},{"timestamp":"1708698900.0","comment_id":"1157193","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: ACD\nACD are correct","poster":"_yyukta"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"894710","poster":"Mayuri917233","content":"Selected Answer: ACD\nACD are correct","timestamp":"1683789900.0"},{"comment_id":"890294","poster":"dmitriypo","content":"Variant NULL values:\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/semistructured-considerations#label-variant-null","timestamp":"1683316020.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"ACD is correct answer.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1680545400.0","comment_id":"860222","poster":"alanhuangjob"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nThe result must be deterministic for merge so source can be any reference data source only constraint it should create/modify unique rows","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675857060.0","poster":"KarBiswa","comment_id":"801959"},{"poster":"Tapasgup007","content":"Selected Answer: ACD\nACD are correct","timestamp":"1670308020.0","comment_id":"736571","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1658895660.0","poster":"Antz83","comment_id":"637784","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: ACD\nFrequent Single rows on any MPP like Snowflake has always been a no no!\nFunction of an OLTP DB"},{"timestamp":"1647384060.0","poster":"MinuteMaid","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: ACD\nFrequent single row DML?
