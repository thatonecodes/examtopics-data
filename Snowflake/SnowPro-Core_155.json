Transient\n\nHere's why:\n\nTemporary tables: These tables are visible within the session but cannot have the same name as permanent tables in the same schema. They are dropped automatically at the end of the session.\nLocal tables: This type doesn't exist in Snowflake. There might be confusion with temporary tables, but Snowflake doesn't have a concept of \"local\" tables.\nUser tables: This concept doesn't exist in Snowflake's table types. Ownership of tables is associated with users, but there's no specific \"user\" table type.\nTransient tables: These tables fulfill all the criteria mentioned in the question:\nVisibility: Only visible to the user who creates them.\nNaming: Can have the same name as permanent tables within the schema (unlike temporary tables).","timestamp":"1712652720.0","poster":"Alex_Ovidiu","comments":[{"comment_id":"1268605","timestamp":"1724067600.0","content":"Correct answer is A, Temporary. \nAs you can read in the documentation:\n\"Snowflake supports creating temporary tables for storing non-permanent, transitory data (e.g. ETL data, session-specific data). Temporary tables only exist within the session in which they were created and persist only for the remainder of the session. As such, they are not visible to other users or sessions.
