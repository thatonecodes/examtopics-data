Take in consideration the below presentation:\nI am reanalyzing.\nLink is: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-clone\nCloning and foreign key constraints\n\nCloning operations require time to complete, particularly for large tables. During this period, DML transactions can alter the data in a source table. Subsequently, Snowflake attempts to clone the table data as it existed when the operation began.\nMy comment: the key word in the message from SNOW FLAKE link is the word \"operation\". Cloning is the \"operation\". Hence, it seems that in the second phrase, \"when the operation began\" is referring to \"when the cloning operation began\". Hence, Snowflake tries (attempts) to clone without the DML changes occurring during cloning. But, will Snowflake do it?\n Apparently YES, if we take in consdieration the proposed answer as C.","comment_id":"1349675","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1738357860.0"}]}],"topic":"1","question_id":230,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1736463060}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"name":"SnowPro Core","isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":167,"numberOfQuestions":1259,"provider":"Snowflake"},"currentPage":46},"__N_SSP":true}
