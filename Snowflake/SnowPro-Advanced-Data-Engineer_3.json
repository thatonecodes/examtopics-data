When TABLE with FLATTEN is acting like a sub-query executed for each returned row.\n\nThe TABLE with FLATTEN combination is typically used when you want to treat the result of the FLATTEN function as a table that can be further joined or manipulated. This is particularly useful when you need to perform additional operations on each row returned by the FLATTEN function. The LATERAL FLATTEN combination is used when the FLATTEN function references other tables or sources in the FROM clause, and it allows for correlated subqueries.","comment_id":"1121991","upvote_count":"1","poster":"prshntdxt7"},{"comment_id":"1096481","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBy my opinion, \nas is wrote here: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/flatten\nthe answer should be: Flattens (explodes) compound values into multiple rows.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"BigDataBB","timestamp":"1718362920.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/flatten","timestamp":"1716033600.0","poster":"Snow_P","comment_id":"1074032","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":166,"question_id":13,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (67%)","D (33%)"],"choices":{"A":"When TABLE with FLATTEN requires another source in the FROM clause to refer to.","D":"When TABLE with FLATTEN is acting like a sub-query executed for each returned row.","B":"When TABLE with FLATTEN requires no additional source in the FROM clause to refer to.","C":"When the LATERAL FLATTEN combination requires no other source in the FROM clause to refer to."},"timestamp":"2023-11-18 15:00:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/126523-exam-snowpro-advanced-data-engineer-topic-1-question-20/","topic":"1","question_images":[]},{"id":"m4ahpwMVXRWUpOIg87Mk","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731938460.0","poster":"Snow_P","comment_id":"1074035","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_clustering_information\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_clustering_depth","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1058221","timestamp":"1730316600.0","poster":"stopthisnow","content":"Selected Answer: A\naverage depth is common"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":166,"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1698694200,"timestamp":"2023-10-30 20:30:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/124974-exam-snowpro-advanced-data-engineer-topic-1-question-21/","question_id":14,"question_text":"Which output is provided by both the SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH function and the SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION function?","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"average_overlaps","D":"total_partition_count","A":"average_depth","B":"notes"}},{"id":"fN6eiE1QIHksz23PnCJz","unix_timestamp":1700316300,"question_text":"A Data Engineer needs to ingest invoice data in PDF format into Snowflake so that the data can be queried and used in a forecasting solution.\nWhat is the recommended way to ingest this data?","exam_id":166,"answer":"D","question_id":15,"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/snowflake/view/126525-exam-snowpro-advanced-data-engineer-topic-1-question-22/","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-11-18 15:05:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1074040","timestamp":"1731938700.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nUsing python or java libraries so I guess D","poster":"Snow_P","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Use Snowpipe to ingest the files that land in an external stage into a Snowflake table.","B":"Use a COPY INTO command to ingest the PDF files in an external stage into a Snowflake table with a VARIANT column.","C":"Create an external table on the PDF files that are stored in a stage and parse the data into structured data.","D":"Create a Java User-Defined Function (UDF) that leverages Java-based PDF parser libraries to parse PDF data into structured data."}}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Snowflake","id":166,"name":"SnowPro Advanced Data Engineer","numberOfQuestions":65,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":3},"__N_SSP":true}
