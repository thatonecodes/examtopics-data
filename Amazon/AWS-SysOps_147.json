Create an IAM EC2 role for the EC2 instances and grant the role permission to read the Systems Manager parameters.\nIt is the most secure way because it allows you to grant permissions to resources and not to users or groups which can reduce the risk of accidental or malicious use of credentials.

You could have your developers store AWS credentials directly within the EC2 instance and allow applications in that instance to use those credentials. But developers would then have to manage the credentials and ensure that they securely pass the credentials to each instance and update each EC2 instance when it's time to rotate the credentials. That's a lot of additional work.\nInstead, you can and should use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that run on an EC2 instance. When you use a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a user name and password or access keys) to an EC2 instance. Instead, the role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use when they make calls to other AWS resources. When you launch an EC2 instance, you specify an IAM role to associate with the instance. Applications that run on the instance can then use the role-supplied temporary credentials to sign API requests.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"377609","content":"Correct Answer: A\nAWS Best Practice is creating a role and assigning it to the instance.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"TroyMcLure","timestamp":"1667116620.0"},{"poster":"RicardoD","timestamp":"1666936500.0","content":"A is the answer","comment_id":"362789","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"A.
