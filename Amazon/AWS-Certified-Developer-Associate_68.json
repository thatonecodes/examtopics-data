By configuring reserved concurrency for the Lambda function, you can control the number of requests sent to the legacy system at the same time, preventing overload.\n\nAdditionally, you can increase the number of asynchronous invocation retry attempts and the maximum event age for the Lambda function. This helps ensure that failed invocations are retried and that events remain in the system for a longer period, giving the Lambda function more time to process them.\n\nOption A, configuring provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function, does not directly address the issue of limiting the number of requests to the legacy system.

Set the provisioned concurrency to the desired number of maximum simultaneous function calls.\n\nProvisioned concurrency allows you to configure a specific number of instances of a function to handle incoming requests at any given time. By setting the provisioned concurrency to the desired number of maximum simultaneous function calls, it will ensure that at any time, the number of requests to the legacy system does not exceed that limit, thus preventing the system from being overwhelmed.
