The question is which service can both model AND provision, so in my opinion the answer is CloudFormation. which not only allows users to model AWS resources using YAML or JSON templates but also handles the provisioning and management of those resources in an automated and consistent manner. While AWS CDK offers a higher-level abstraction and allows users to model resources using programming languages, the actual provisioning is orchestrated by CloudFormation based on the generated templates.\n\nSource: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html\nThe AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation."},{"poster":"petercorn","comment_id":"1088099","upvote_count":"2","content":"The AWS CDK lets you build reliable, scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud with the considerable expressive power of a programming language\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html","timestamp":"1701736560.0"},{"comment_id":"1082446","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1701168660.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAWS CDK is an open-source software development framework that helps you model cloud application resources using familiar programming languages, and then provision your infrastructure using CloudFormation directly from your IDE","poster":"Rinkans"}],"question_id":127,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"D":"AWS Systems Manager","A":"AWS CloudFormation","B":"AWS CodePipeline","C":"AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)"},"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (68%)","A (32%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/127409-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-topic-1/","question_text":"Which AWS service allows users to model and provision AWS resources using common programming languages?","timestamp":"2023-11-28 11:51:00","topic":"1","answer":"C","exam_id":19},{"id":"xun4b7zNvavI1dB2uPTB","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (88%)","13%"],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1700050440,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1399127","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSpot Instances: Get up to 90% discount compared to On demand","poster":"alokdixit2006","timestamp":"1742098860.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735139160.0","comment_id":"1331610","poster":"teegee","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"poster":"ShaiTay","comment_id":"1311279","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731504420.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Spot Instances.\nThe Amazon EC2 instance pricing model that can provide discounts of up to 90% is the \"Spot Instances\" pricing model. With Spot Instances, you can bid for unused EC2 capacity, and if your bid price exceeds the current Spot price, your instances will be terminated. This model allows you to take advantage of unused capacity at significantly reduced prices compared to On-Demand instances.
