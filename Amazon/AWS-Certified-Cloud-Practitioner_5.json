It allows you to securely and quickly transfer large amounts of data to and from AWS. In this scenario, where the company needs to transfer 60 TB of data within a limited timeframe, AWS Snowball would be the most suitable choice. The company can request a Snowball appliance from AWS, which will be shipped to their location. They can then load their data onto the Snowball appliance, ship it back to AWS, and AWS will transfer the data into an S3 bucket. This method ensures fast and efficient data transfer, even with large amounts of data.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1689311100.0"},{"poster":"ESAJRR","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
