When Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name that is associated with an ALIAS record, Route 53 responds with the IP address of the resource that is specified in the record. An ALIAS record can be used to map an apex domain name to an Application Load Balancer. In this case, the ALIAS record points to the DNS name of the Application Load Balancer.\n\nA CNAME record is a type of DNS record that points one domain name to another. However, CNAME records cannot be used to map an apex domain name to an Application Load Balancer.\n\nAn SOA (Start of Authority) record is a DNS record that specifies authoritative information about a DNS zone, such as the email address of the person responsible for managing the zone.\n\nA TXT record is a type of DNS record that is used to associate some arbitrary text with a DNS record.

One possible cause of the DELETE_FAILED state is that the stack contains nested stacks, and the deletion of the parent stack cannot proceed until the nested stacks are manually deleted first.

When a parent stack is deleted, CloudFormation will attempt to delete the nested stacks, but if there are any issues, the parent stack deletion will fail.\n\nE.
