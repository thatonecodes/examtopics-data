In short, it allows you to scale in or out the number of shards (horizontal scaling) versus scaling up or down the node type (vertical scaling). This means that Cluster Mode can scale to very large amounts of storage (potentially 100s of terabytes) across up to 90 shards, whereas a single node can only store as much data in memory as the instance type has capacity for.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/work-with-cluster-mode-on-amazon-elasticache-for-redis/","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"498598","timestamp":"1639138440.0","poster":"2025flakyt"}],"question_text":"A gaming company has implemented a leaderboard in AWS using a Sorted Set data structure within Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.
