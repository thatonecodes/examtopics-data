The company’s architecture contains several interface VPC endpoints for AWS services, including Amazon CloudWatch Logs and AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The endpoints are configured to use a shared security group. The security group is not used for any other workloads or resources.\n\nAfter a security review of the environment, the company determined that the shared security group is more permissive than necessary. The company wants to make the rules associated with the security group more restrictive. The changes to the security group rules must not prevent the resources in the VPC from using AWS services through interface VPC endpoints. The changes must prevent unnecessary access.\n\nThe security group currently uses the following rules:\n\n• Inbound - Rule 1\n\nProtocol: TCP -\n\nPort: 443 -\n\nSource: 0.0.0.0/0 -\n\n• Inbound - Rule 2\n\nProtocol: TCP -\n\nPort: 443 -\n\nSource: VPC CIDR -\n\n• Outbound - Rule 1\n\nProtocol: All -\n\nPort: All -\n\nDestination: 0.0.0.0/0 -\n\nWhich rule or rules should the company remove to meet with these requirements?","answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"topic":"1","exam_id":15,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ashk123456","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrected answer","comment_id":"1416612","timestamp":"1743493620.0"},{"poster":"kaerarune","content":"Selected Answer: B\n\"Outbound - Rule 2\" is missing.

With a Connect attachment, the routes are propagated to a transit gateway route table by default. With a VPC, you must create static routes to send traffic to the transit gateway. With a VPN connection, routes are propagated from the transit gateway to your on-premises router using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). With a Direct Connect gateway, allowed prefixes are originated to your on-premises router using BGP. With a peering attachment, you must create a static route in the transit gateway route table to point to the peering attachment.","timestamp":"1738455420.0","poster":"woorkim"},{"poster":"jfedotov","timestamp":"1737496620.0","comment_id":"1344403","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/create-prefix-list-reference.html"},{"poster":"kowal_001","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737022920.0","comment_id":"1341636","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. \nb -> won't work here\nc - > can break internet facing VPCs\nd -> also won't work"}],"unix_timestamp":1737022920,"question_id":182,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/154670-exam-aws-certified-advanced-networking-specialty-ans-c01/","topic":"1","answer":"A","exam_id":15,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Turn on default route table association for the transit gateway route tables.
