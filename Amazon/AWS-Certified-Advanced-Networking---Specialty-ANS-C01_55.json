The application servers run in a VPC subnet. Each server is associated with an Elastic IP address.\n\nThe company has a new requirement for firewall inspection of all traffic from the internet before the traffic reaches any EC2 instances. A security engineer has deployed and configured a Gateway Load Balancer (GLB) in a standalone VPC with a fleet of third-party firewalls.\n\nHow should a network engineer update the environment to ensure that the traffic travels across the fleet of firewalls?","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"A":"Deploy a transit gateway. Attach a GLB endpoint to the transit gateway. Attach the application VPC to the transit gateway. Update the application subnet route table's default route destination to be the GLB endpoint. Ensure that the EC2 instances' security group allows traffic from the GLB endpoint.","D":"Instruct the security engineer to move the GLB into the application VPC. Create a gateway route table. Associate the gateway route table with the application subnet. Add a default route to the gateway route table with the GLB as its destination.
