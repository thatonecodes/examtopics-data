It also performs a health check on the instances, terminates unhealthy instances, and launches healthy instances to maintain the current instance level. Scaling provides you with options, outside of scaling policies, to override attributes from the instance and use the values that you need. For example, you can override the instance type using AWS CLI commands.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/create-lc-with-instanceID.html","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAuto Scaling policies are responsible for automatically adjusting the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group based on predefined rules and conditions.
