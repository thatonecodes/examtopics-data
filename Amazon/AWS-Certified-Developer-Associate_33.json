Implement a conditional put by using the attribute_not_exists(transactionID) condition expression.\n\nBy using the attribute_not_exists condition expression in the PutItem operation, you can ensure that a new item is only added to the table if the item with the specified primary key does not already exist in the table. This approach is cost-effective because it eliminates the need to call GetItem to confirm that the record does not exist, which incurs additional read capacity units (RCUs).\n\nOption B is not a solution to prevent PutItem from updating an existing record. It is used to automatically delete expired items in a DynamoDB table.\n\nOption C is also a possible solution, but it requires additional read capacity units (RCUs) to check if the record exists before inserting a new item.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most efficient and cost-effective solution to prevent PutItem from updating an existing record.\nBy: GPT","comment_id":"880887","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1682458980.0","poster":"OtavioC"},{"poster":"JuanFe","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"846186","content":"It's clearly option D.","timestamp":"1679419140.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1676069820.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"811229","poster":"pancman","timestamp":"1676592540.0","content":"That wouldn't be the most cost-effective option.

When applicable, repeat the ListObjectsV2 API call by using NextContinuationToken.\n\nTo handle any number of returned results from the ListObjectsV2 API call, the developer can use pagination. Amazon S3 supports pagination of responses through the use of a continuation token, which enables the listing of more objects beyond the number specified in the initial request. The NextContinuationToken is a token that is returned in the response of the ListObjectsV2 API call when there are more objects to retrieve. The token can be used to retrieve the next set of objects until all the objects in the bucket have been listed.\n\nTherefore, the developer should modify the code to repeat the ListObjectsV2 API call, using the NextContinuationToken returned in each response until all the objects have been listed. The max-keys parameter should be set to a reasonable value that is less than or equal to the expected number of returned objects.
