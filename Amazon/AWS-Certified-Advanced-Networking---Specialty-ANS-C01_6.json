The flow logs show the following:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe network engineer must recommend a solution that will give the data scientists the ability to transfer data from the on-premises data center.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"exam_id":15,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1736161740.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1337088","poster":"46f094c","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFirst the NACL is evaluated (stateless), and then if the traffic is allowed the SG will be evaluated (statefulll).\nThe first packet arrives and is allowed, so NACL ok and SG OK, but the second packet returning is denied.\nThis discard the problem in a SG, because the SG being stateful would allow the traffic.\nAnd so must be the NACL denying"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1321362","timestamp":"1733230260.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct. because NACL is stateless so thus need to add permit!","poster":"woorkim"},{"poster":"Newbies","upvote_count":"1","content":"Ans is A - B:Modifying the outbound ACL wouldn't address the inability to initiate data transfer from the on-premises side.","comment_id":"1185787","timestamp":"1711764600.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1185790","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Newbies","content":"Sorry D is the answer","timestamp":"1711765020.0"}]},{"timestamp":"1707958980.0","comment_id":"1150670","poster":"Marfee400704","content":"I think that it's correct answer is C according to SPOTO products.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1707903000.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOnly ACL can add rules for CIDER range.
