CloudFront is CDN service and is not designed for real-time data processing or analytics. While using Lambda to process data can be an option, it may not be most efficient solution for processing large volumes of clickstream data.\n\nTherefore, collecting the data from Kinesis Data Streams, using Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit it to S3 data lake, and loading it into Redshift for analysis is the recommended approach. This combination provides scalable, real-time streaming solution with storage and analytics capabilities that can handle high volume of clickstream data.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"929413","timestamp":"1687346940.0","poster":"cookieMr"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Rahulbit34","comment_id":"886804","content":"Clickstream is the key - Answer is D","timestamp":"1682981340.0"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1688668560.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"juanrasus2","timestamp":"1697472480.0","content":"Also the Kinesis family is related to real time or near real time services.
