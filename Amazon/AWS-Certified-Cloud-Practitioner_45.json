It allows you to compare the costs of running applications on-premises with the costs of running them in the AWS Cloud. By using Migration Evaluator, the company can get insights into potential cost savings, which helps in making informed decisions about migrating to AWS.\n\nThe tool provides a detailed cost comparison, taking into account various factors such as hardware, software, data center costs, and AWS service costs. It helps the company understand the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of their current infrastructure and how it compares to the TCO of running the same workload on AWS. This allows the company to evaluate the financial benefits of migration and make an informed decision about moving its infrastructure to the AWS Cloud.","comment_id":"963433","timestamp":"1690351800.0"},{"comment_id":"936339","timestamp":"1687941120.0","poster":"ESAJRR","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

There are no upfront cost commitments\n\nThe AWS Cloud pricing model differs from traditional on-premises storage pricing primarily in terms of upfront cost commitments. With traditional on-premises storage, organizations typically need to make significant upfront investments in hardware, software licenses, and infrastructure operating costs. In contrast, AWS Cloud pricing is based on a pay-as-you-go model, where customers only pay for the resources they consume on an hourly or usage-based basis, without any upfront commitments. This allows for greater flexibility and cost efficiency, as customers can scale resources up or down based on their needs without incurring long-term financial commitments. While AWS resources do incur costs, there are no upfront cost commitments, and customers only pay for what they use."},{"comment_id":"1143933","timestamp":"1707354660.0","content":"At best, B is up to interpretation since operating costs are still being paid by the user based on computing, memory, storage, etc. C is a concrete situation. If you're On-Premise with your operations, you're literally paying for all the hardware and licensing that comes with it. With AWS, the typical method for small businesses and individuals is On-Demand, which means you're paying as you go at the end of each monthly cycle. If you're purchasing RI, you can do partial payments for a year (or more), pay at the end of the year, or even if you decide to pay it all upfront to get a bit of a discount, you're paying for a year's worth instead of buying an entire infrastructure for your business.
