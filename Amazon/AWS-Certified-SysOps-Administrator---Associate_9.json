Normally, CloudFormation proceeds with stack creation after the instance has been successfully created. However, you can use a CreationPolicy so that CloudFormation proceeds with stack creation only after your configuration actions are done. That way you’ll know your applications are ready to go after stack creation succeeds.\n\nA CreationPolicy instructs CloudFormation to wait on an instance until CloudFormation receives the specified number of signals. This policy takes effect only when CloudFormation creates the instance.\n \nRef link: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/use-a-creationpolicy-to-wait-for-on-instance-configurations/\nRef link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html","timestamp":"1698872100.0","poster":"wooyourdaddy","comment_id":"886634","upvote_count":"8"},{"comment_id":"1113220","timestamp":"1720042500.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"B is correct","poster":"tamng"},{"timestamp":"1686543720.0","comment_id":"742455","poster":"michaldavid","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nbbbbbbb"},{"timestamp":"1684484160.0","poster":"Raynor","comment_id":"721925","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ko_kr/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html","upvote_count":"4"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/87976-exam-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-topic-1/","exam_id":34,"answer":"B","question_id":41,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"w3M3AzHZz8yitDH7qi1P","answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"A company runs workloads on 90 Amazon EC2 instances in the eu-west-1 Region in an AWS account.
