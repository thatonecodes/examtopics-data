Normally, CloudFormation proceeds with stack creation after the instance has been successfully created. However, you can use a CreationPolicy so that CloudFormation proceeds with stack creation only after your configuration actions are done. That way youâ€™ll know your applications are ready to go after stack creation succeeds.\n\nA CreationPolicy instructs CloudFormation to wait on an instance until CloudFormation receives the specified number of signals.
