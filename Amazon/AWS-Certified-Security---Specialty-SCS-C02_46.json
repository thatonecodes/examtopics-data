The security engineer needs to isolate a target instance to block any traffic to and from the target instance, except for traffic from the company's forensics team. Each of the company's EC2 instances has its own dedicated security group. The EC2 instances are deployed in subnets of a VPC. A subnet can contain multiple instances.\nThe security engineer is testing the procedure for EC2 isolation and opens an SSH session to the target instance. The procedure starts to simulate access to the target instance by an attacker. The security engineer removes the existing security group rules and adds security group rules to give the forensics team access to the target instance on port 22.\nAfter these changes, the security engineer notices that the SSH connection is still active and usable. When the security engineer runs a ping command to the public IP address of the target instance, the ping command is blocked.\nWhat should the security engineer do to isolate the target instance?"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"id":30,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":288,"isImplemented":true,"name":"AWS Certified Security - Specialty SCS-C02","provider":"Amazon"},"currentPage":46},"__N_SSP":true}
