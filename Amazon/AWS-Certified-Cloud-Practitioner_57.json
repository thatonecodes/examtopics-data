The AWS account root user has access to all resources in the account and should be used only for account management tasks that cannot be performed by IAM users.\n\nTo ensure security best practices and the principle of least privilege, the AWS account root user's access keys should be deleted and replaced with IAM users.

Delete the keys and create IAM users.\n\nAs a best practice, AWS recommends not using the root user for everyday tasks or granting long-term access keys to the root user. The root user has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account, making it a security risk if the access keys were to fall into the wrong hands.\n\nInstead, it is advisable to create Individual IAM (Identity and Access Management) users for different users who require access to the AWS account. By creating IAM users, you can assign specific permissions to each user based on their role and responsibilities. IAM users provide better security controls, allowing you to grant only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.\n\nIn summary, you should delete the root user access keys and create IAM users with appropriate permissions for each user who needs to access AWS services. This ensures better security and access control for your AWS resources.","comment_id":"964481","poster":"huanghaiyao","timestamp":"1690444200.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"960576","timestamp":"1690126140.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer D.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices-root-user.html","poster":"Gulsah","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"elsie2023","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices-root-user.html","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689510480.0","comment_id":"953302"},{"timestamp":"1681749180.0","poster":"Guru4Cloud","comment_id":"872891","upvote_count":"2","content":"The recommended best practice is D.
