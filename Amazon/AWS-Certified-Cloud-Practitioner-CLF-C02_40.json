Snowball Edge can process data locally, run edge-computing workloads, and transfer data to or from the AWS Cloud.\n\nEach Snowball Edge device can transport data at speeds faster than the internet. This transport is done by shipping the data in the devices through a regional carrier. The appliances are rugged, complete with E Ink shipping labels.\n\nSnowball Edge devices have three options for device configurations—Storage Optimized, Compute Optimized, and Compute Optimized with GPU. When this guide refers to Snowball Edge devices, it's referring to all options of the device. When specific information applies only to one or more optional configurations of devices (such as how the Snowball Edge with GPU has an on-board GPU), it is called out specifically.","timestamp":"1729493760.0"},{"timestamp":"1709346780.0","poster":"Felicia_T","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the correct answer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1163872"},{"comment_id":"1135007","timestamp":"1706536080.0","poster":"Siyuansdsd","content":"Selected Answer: D\nDDDDDDDD","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"BShelat","timestamp":"1705182900.0","comment_id":"1122066","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/whatisedge.html","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1108445","timestamp":"1703835900.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"bab5fb1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nfor me the best answer si D due to issue connectivity"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
