Allow access to an Amazon EC2 instance through only a specific port.\n\nSecurity groups in AWS are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from Amazon EC2 instances. They act as virtual firewalls for your instances. You can define rules in a security group to allow specific traffic based on protocols, ports, and IP address ranges. Therefore, using security groups, you can allow access to an Amazon EC2 instance through only a specific port, effectively controlling the traffic that is permitted.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Aghajee","comment_id":"1116512","timestamp":"1720423500.0"},{"timestamp":"1719774600.0","comment_id":"1109997","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Lyn","content":"Answer should be A."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A","comment_id":"1109881","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719763500.0","poster":"[Removed]"}],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which task can a company perform by using security groups in the AWS Cloud?","isMC":true,"exam_id":19,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"eSmuxnUjdN9GmxJO8aD7","answer":"AB","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/123758-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-topic-1/","topic":"1","question_text":"Which tasks are customer responsibilities, according to the AWS shared responsibility model?
