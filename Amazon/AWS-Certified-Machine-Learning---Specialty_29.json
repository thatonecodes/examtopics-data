It provides several built-in rules that can detect and diagnose common issues that can occur during training. In this case, the data scientist suspects that the training is not converging and that resource utilization is not optimal. The vanishing_gradient and LowGPUUtilization rules can help to identify these issues."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Use the SageMaker Debugger vanishing_gradient and LowGPUUtilization built-in rules to detect issues and to launch the StopTrainingJob action if issues are detected.\n\nThe SageMaker Debugger is a built-in tool that helps with debugging and profiling machine learning models trained in SageMaker. In this scenario, the data scientist suspects that there are issues with the training process, so using the SageMaker Debugger is the most appropriate solution. The vanishing_gradient and LowGPUUtilization built-in rules can detect common training issues such as a vanishing gradient problem or low GPU utilization, which could affect the training convergence and resource utilization. By launching the StopTrainingJob action if issues are detected, the training job can be stopped early, which can help to save resources and time. This approach requires the least development effort, as it is built-in to SageMaker and does not require the data scientist to create custom metrics or configure CloudWatch alarms.","timestamp":"1708466280.0","poster":"AjoseO","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"815921"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/debugger-built-in-rules.html","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1707976560.0","comment_id":"809167","poster":"Jerry84"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"SmE8iL4ZtWmz3rbA5W1w","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A bank wants to launch a low-rate credit promotion campaign.
