The development team can then access and deploy these pre-approved resources on demand through the Service Catalog. This approach ensures that the resources being deployed are scalable, reusable, and adhere to the company's guidelines.","comment_id":"929967","poster":"albert_kuo","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"I think the answer is C. \n\"AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier application architectures. AWS Service Catalog allows you to centrally manage deployed IT services and your applications, resources, and metadata. This helps you achieve consistent governance and meet your compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need.\" --- https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/","comment_id":"410565","timestamp":"1666018080.0","poster":"hou0220","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1626825660,"answer_ET":"D","answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2021-07-21 02:01:00","exam_id":36,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/58266-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-338-discussion/"},{"id":"pU9h6FfDu6G26SPDg4zU","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/6866-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-339-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","exam_id":36,"question_id":267,"question_text":"An application hosted on AWS is going through an external compliance assessment.
