AWS Storage Gateway\n\nAWS Storage Gateway is a service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage infrastructure. It allows the company to store data backups in the cloud while caching a copy locally for low-latency access.\nThere are different options of Storage Gateway, but two types that could be used for this use case are:\n\nFile Gateway (NFS) - allows to store and retrieve files as objects in Amazon S3 and access them through a file interface.\nVolume Gateway (iSCSI) - allows to create storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from on-premises application and access them as locally attached disks.\nBoth options provide a cloud-based storage that is locally cached, which meets the company's requirement.","upvote_count":"7","poster":"NotMeAnyWay"},{"comment_id":"1066134","timestamp":"1699508160.0","poster":"MiniYang","content":"The correct Answer is D.Amazon EFS is a cloud file storage service that replaces local storage with cloud-based but locally cached storage.

AWS Budgets\n\nAWS Budgets is a service that allows customers to set custom budgets for their AWS costs and usage, and to receive alerts when actual costs or usage exceed or are forecasted to exceed those budgets. With AWS Budgets, customers can set budgets for different cost dimensions such as service, tag, or linked account, and can also forecast costs for the next quarter or year.\nAWS Budgets also allows customers to view the breakdown of costs and usage by service, linked account, or tag, and provides detailed information on the costs incurred by different parts of the workload. This allows customers to identify areas of cost optimization and to make more informed decisions about their AWS usage and costs.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1716292380.0","content":"I'm afraid darn is right the correct answer is C AWS Cost Explorer","upvote_count":"1","poster":"2BCloud","comment_id":"1214901"},{"content":"thanks for explaining me what AWS Budgets is but the correct answer is C","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"864817","timestamp":"1680968940.0","poster":"darn"}],"upvote_count":"7","poster":"NotMeAnyWay"},{"poster":"2BCloud","timestamp":"1716292500.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1214902","content":"C.
