There is enough provisioned capacity for the expected workload tor the new fiscal year benefit enrollment period plus some extra overhead\nEnrollment proceeds nicely for two days and then the web tier becomes unresponsive, upon investigation using CloudWatch and other monitoring tools it is discovered that there is an extremely large and unanticipated amount of inbound traffic coming from a set of 15 specific IP addresses over port 80 from a country where the benefits company has no customers. The web tier instances are so overloaded that benefit enrollment administrators cannot even SSH into them.\nWhich activity would be useful in defending against this attack?","topic":"1","exam_id":32,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2020-05-13 01:20:00","answer_description":"Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control who in your organization has permission to create and manage security groups and network ACLs\n(NACL).
