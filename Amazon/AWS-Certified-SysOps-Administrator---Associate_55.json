Setting the function’s reserved concurrency to a lower limit prevents the function from scaling concurrently beyond that limit. It does not prevent the recursion, but limits the resources consumed as a safety mechanism.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"969028","content":"If you trigger a recursive invocation loop accidentally, you can press the “Throttle” button in the Lambda console to scale the function concurrency down to zero and break the recursion cycle.","timestamp":"1722513000.0"}]},{"timestamp":"1720571820.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"B.
