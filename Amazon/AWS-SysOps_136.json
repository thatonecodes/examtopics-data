For information about enabling and disabling termination protection for an instance, see Enabling Termination Protection for an Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. \n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/UsingAlarmActions.html","timestamp":"1664894820.0","poster":"Ka"},{"content":"B is correct. as for C, Trusted advisor can't have automated tasks to be executed to resources, it is just monitoring system.","comment_id":"26421","timestamp":"1664730120.0","poster":"white_shadow","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"24600","timestamp":"1664441520.0","poster":"awsnoob","content":"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/start-stop-lambda-cloudwatch/","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1574776560,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/9169-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-714-discussion/"}],"exam":{"name":"AWS-SysOps","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":36,"provider":"Amazon","numberOfQuestions":928,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":136},"__N_SSP":true}
