Question is about low latency and HPC, therefore D is the right placement option (so, no E). Furthermore, cluster placement will use a single availability zone, hence multi-AZ NLB is useless (so, no B). Finally, regarding ASG in a single subnet isn't resilient. Below I paste directly from AWS docs:\n\n\"If you try to add more instances to the placement group later, or if you try to launch more than one instance type in the placement group, you increase your chances of getting an insufficient capacity error.\"\n\nSo in case of a failed health check, ASG might try to spin up a new instance but receive an InsufficientInstanceCapacity (which is an AZ-specific error).
