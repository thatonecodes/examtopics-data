In question AMQP is mentioned and Amazon on his doc page about MQ is providing such information:\n\"Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that provides compatibility with many popular message brokers. We recommend Amazon MQ for migrating applications from existing message brokers that rely on compatibility with APIs such as JMS or protocols such as AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.\"\nI cannot be coincidence that documentation is mentioning about AMQP.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/welcome.html","timestamp":"1718130180.0"},{"poster":"sandordini","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1203103","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI'd go for A.\nAlthough the ideal solution and least modification would require B, with heavy rework the application can be (most likely) adopted to ECS+SQS.
