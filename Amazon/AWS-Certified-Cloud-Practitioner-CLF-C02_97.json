Its purpose is to optimize compute-heavy tasks by providing a fast file system that can process large-scale data, not to serve as a storage gateway solution for seamlessly storing and retrieving data from S3 via NFS.\n\nThe correct answer was C. AWS Storage Gateway file gateway, because AWS Storage Gateway file gateway is specifically designed to allow companies to use NFS (or SMB) protocols to store and retrieve data directly in S3. It acts as a bridge between on-premises environments and Amazon S3, enabling easy integration for businesses that want to store their files as objects in S3."},{"poster":"Kilobay1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAmazon FSx for Lustre is a managed file system that provides a high-performance file system optimized for compute-intensive workloads. It supports the Network File System (NFS) protocol and can be linked to Amazon S3. When you create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, you can link it to an S3 bucket, enabling you to access objects in S3 using the NFS protocol.\nAWS Storage Gateway file gateway might seem like a good candidate due to its support for NFS, but itâ€™s important to note that Amazon FSx for Lustre provides a more integrated and performant solution for linking file systems with S3, particularly for use cases requiring high-performance compute.","timestamp":"1726252620.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1283320"},{"content":"c is correct. \n\nplease help with discussion on 534 ~ 540","timestamp":"1721412780.0","poster":"Meow7","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1251377"},{"poster":"Marley","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
