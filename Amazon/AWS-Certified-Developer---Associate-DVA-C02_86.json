This approach enables a wait-and-retry mechanism, which is ideal for workflows where the state machine needs to wait for a confirmation record to appear in the DynamoDB table.\nB is wrong.\nBecause while this could work, it adds unnecessary complexity. The redrive execution command involves restarting the state machine, which is not ideal for workflows designed to wait for an event.","comment_id":"1338969","poster":"Arad","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736540160.0"}]},{"id":"7oV0lZ7eF6k4lvDQsdxf","discussion":[{"poster":"italiancloud2025","comment_id":"1357688","timestamp":"1739782980.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nsar un presigned URL con expiración de 15 minutos es la forma más sencilla de dar acceso temporal a objetos en un bucket privado de S3."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/156657-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c02-topic-1/","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":24,"question_id":428,"answer":"B","choices":{"A":"Copy the documents to a separate S3 bucket that has a lifecycle policy for deletion after 15 minutes.","B":"Create a presigned S3 URL using the AWS SDK with an expiration time of 15 minutes.","C":"Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS) and download the documents using HTTPS.","D":"Modify the S3 bucket policy to only allow specific users to download the documents.
