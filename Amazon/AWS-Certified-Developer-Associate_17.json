Set the Origin Protocol Policy setting to Match Viewer: This ensures that the communication between CloudFront and the ALB uses the same protocol as the viewer (HTTPS in this case), providing end-to-end encryption.\n\nBy combining these settings, the developer can ensure that customer data is encrypted both in transit from the viewer to CloudFront (using HTTPS) and in transit from CloudFront to the ALB (matching the viewer's protocol).

Restrict viewer access by using signed URLs: While signed URLs can be used to control access to content and provide additional security measures, they do not specifically address the requirement of encrypting customer data in transit. Signed URLs are more relevant for controlling access to specific resources rather than securing data in transit.\n\nC. Enable field-level encryption: Field-level encryption is a feature that allows specific fields within a response to be encrypted, but it does not directly address the requirement of encrypting customer data in transit. Field-level encryption focuses on protecting specific data fields at rest or during storage, not during transit.\n\nD. Enable automatic object compression: Automatic object compression is a feature that reduces the size of content transferred from CloudFront to viewers by compressing the objects. While it can improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage, it does not directly address the requirement of encrypting customer data in transit.","timestamp":"1684646820.0","comment_id":"902903","upvote_count":"5"}],"timestamp":"1684646760.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1217934","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nField-level encryption primarily safeguards specific data fields while they are at rest or stored, rather than during transit.","poster":"Lucky4Life","timestamp":"1716602220.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"51b1f29","comment_id":"1173502","content":"B and E.\n\nField-level encryption is an additional layer of security that is done at @Edge so C is not correct i believe.","timestamp":"1710428640.0"},{"poster":"dostonbekabdullaev","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nCE is correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1126487","timestamp":"1705646100.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"NaghamAbdellatif","timestamp":"1696217820.0","comment_id":"1022776","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nCloudFront Configuration**"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BE\nYES CORRECT","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1690432740.0","poster":"1176","comment_id":"964335"},{"content":"B and E","poster":"MrTee","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1682476200.0","comment_id":"881042"},{"poster":"Krok","comment_id":"858061","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB+E.
