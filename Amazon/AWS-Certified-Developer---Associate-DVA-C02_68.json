The components of the application have different request rates. The user interactions and transactions are important to trace, but they are low in volume. The background processes such as application health checks, polling, and connection maintenance generate high volumes of read-only requests.\n\nCurrently, the default X-Ray sampling rules are universal for all requests.

This ensures that the system resources are conserved for more critical user interactions and transactions.\n\nHigher Sampling Rate for User Interactions: By sampling at a higher rate for requests that handle user interactions or transactions, you can ensure that these important requests are traced more comprehensively. This allows for better monitoring and troubleshooting of the application where it matters most.\n\nSelective Tracing: This approach allows you to selectively trace and monitor requests based on their importance and volume. High-volume background tasks are sampled minimally or not at all, while low-volume but critical user interactions and transactions are sampled more frequently.","poster":"Mo_1981"}],"unix_timestamp":1721494320,"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (58%)","D (42%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/144274-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c02-topic-1/","question_id":340,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-07-20 18:52:00","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":24}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"id":24,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","name":"AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02","provider":"Amazon","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":551},"currentPage":68},"__N_SSP":true}
