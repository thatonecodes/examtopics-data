CloudTrail records API calls made within your AWS account and delivers them as log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nBy integrating CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs, the API activity logs can be streamed to a CloudWatch Logs log stream in near real-time. This enables centralized log management and analysis, allowing you to monitor and gain insights into the API activity and changes happening within your AWS account.","timestamp":"1719193620.0","comment_id":"932091"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Flaviu6373","timestamp":"1676983200.0","content":"Correct D.

These rules can be based on protocols, ports, IP ranges, and other parameters.

Network ACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic by evaluating rules based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.","poster":"albert_kuo","comment_id":"932093","timestamp":"1719193680.0"},{"poster":"Flaviu6373","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"555447","timestamp":"1677260880.0","content":"correct C"}]},{"id":"Ocx3q8LyIDJDbO9qIr19","timestamp":"2021-04-06 20:02:00","question_id":369,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1617732120,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/49430-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-431-discussion/","exam_id":36,"answer_description":"Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for out-bound traffic (and vice versa).\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Network ACLs are _______.","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"612106","poster":"Finger41","timestamp":"1733456820.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html"},{"timestamp":"1712899500.0","comment_id":"329840","content":"The answer is BBBB","poster":"aws_queen","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","choices":{"C":"asynchronous","A":"stateful","D":"synchronous","B":"stateless"},"question_images":[]},{"id":"IjxIA0GGIIJ7dCj2X0G8","exam_id":36,"choices":{"D":"Yes, it can be done by using the put-metric-data command.","A":"Yes, but only if the data is aggregated.","B":"No, it is not possible.","C":"No, metrics are in-built and cannot be defined explicitly."},"question_images":[],"question_text":"Is it possible to publish your own metrics to CloudWatch?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/17384-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-432-discussion/","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1585085880,"question_id":370,"timestamp":"2020-03-24 22:38:00","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"You can publish your own metrics to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an API.

When you publish a custom metric, you can define it as either standard resolution or high resolution. When you publish a high-resolution metric, CloudWatch stores it with a resolution of 1 second, and you can read and retrieve it with a period of 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or any multiple of 60 seconds.\n\nHigh-resolution metrics can give you more immediate insight into your application's sub-minute activity. Keep in mind that every PutMetricData call for a custom metric is charged, so calling PutMetricData more often on a high-resolution metric can lead to higher charges.
