Create individual IAM users: It is recommended to create individual IAM users for each person or entity accessing your AWS resources. This allows for better accountability and control over access permissions. Each user should have a unique set of credentials to access the AWS account.\n\nE. Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users: Groups in IAM allow you to group users with similar roles and responsibilities together and assign permissions to the group.
