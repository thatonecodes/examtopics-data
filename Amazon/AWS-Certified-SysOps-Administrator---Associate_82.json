Enable termination protection for the CloudFormation stacks: Termination protection prevents the deletion of CloudFormation stacks, which in turn protects the DynamoDB tables created by the stack. \n\nC. Enable point-in-time recovery for the DynamoDB tables: Point-in-time recovery (PITR) allows you to restore DynamoDB tables to any point in the last 35 days. If tables are accidentally deleted, PITR minimizes data loss by enabling recovery up to the moment before the deletion.","poster":"Aresius","comment_id":"1327877"},{"timestamp":"1733588160.0","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nDynamo DB now has Delete protection.","comment_id":"1323183","poster":"numark","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Albanki","content":"I think it's A & C.","timestamp":"1732457460.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1317070"},{"timestamp":"1730118900.0","poster":"siheom","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nvote B, C","comment_id":"1303951"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1303722","timestamp":"1730057580.0","content":"Shouldn't it be A and C?...

Amazon Aurora allows the creation of read replicas to scale out beyond the capacity of a single database for read-heavy database workloads.By pointing the reporting application to the reader instance, the write operations remain unaffected on the writer instance, ensuring that the regular application use is not impacted by the increased load due to the report generation process.
