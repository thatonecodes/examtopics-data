By turning off RI sharing in the HR department’s production account, the RI benefits (such as the discounted rate) are applied only to instances within that account, preventing other accounts, even within the same organization, from accessing these discounts. This directly addresses the requirement.\n\nOption C suggests using the organization’s management account to turn off RI sharing for the HR department’s production AWS account.

To form a network between multiple accounts, each with their own VPCs, you can use VPC peering or Transit Gateway. But VPC peering is only suitable for a few acounts, and we have many, so we need to create a TGW (A). Then we need to associate it with the VPCs across all acounts, we do this through RAM, and we need to configure the route tables in all accounts to use the TGW, which is done through prefixes (D).\n\nSee https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/integrate-third-party-services/architecture-3-1.html\n\nThe question is a bit weird because the answer could allow accounts to manage the network inside their own VPCs, so probably some SCP policies are needed to prevent this. But the accounts cannot edit the TGW routing, so probably that's what they were trying to suggest.","timestamp":"1722257640.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1257488"},{"comment_id":"1185795","timestamp":"1711765620.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rapatajones","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB E correta"},{"content":"BE com certeza","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1185792","poster":"rapatajones","timestamp":"1711765560.0"},{"comment_id":"1175110","poster":"gofavad926","timestamp":"1710607140.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nBD, as mentioned in other comments"},{"poster":"GibaSP45","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1087086","timestamp":"1701633480.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1080911","timestamp":"1701020280.0","content":"BE is good","poster":"abeb"},{"content":"B & D correct","comment_id":"1060225","upvote_count":"1","poster":"senthilsekaran","timestamp":"1698897060.0"},{"comment_id":"1019681","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"Do you really need Management account to share the resources among the accounts?

VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 help in this.","timestamp":"1674583080.0"},{"comment_id":"779117","timestamp":"1673975760.0","poster":"masetromain","content":"Selected Answer: A\nYou are correct. Option A: Enable IAM database authentication on the Aurora DB cluster. Change the IAM role for the Lambda function to allow the function to access the database by using IAM database authentication. Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPC is the best solution.\n\nIt is a combination of measures that work together to meet the requirements:\n\n- IAM database authentication for the Aurora DB cluster allows for secure and centralized management of access to the database, and eliminates the need to store user credentials in the database.\n\n- Deploying a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 ensures that data does not travel across the internet and is protected by VPC security.\nChanging the IAM role for the Lambda function allows it to access the database securely via IAM database authentication.\n\n- By implementing the above steps, you can ensure that the data is protected in transit and at rest, and that the impact of a compromise of the database credentials is minimized.","comments":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1673975820.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"masetromain","comment_id":"779120","content":"Option D: Save the database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.

Secrets Manager allows for password rotation on the credentials, which means that the credentials can be automatically rotated on a schedule to minimize the impact of a compromise. Additionally, the IAM role for the Lambda function can be changed to allow the function to access Secrets Manager, so that the function can retrieve the credentials securely.\n\nEnforcing HTTPS on the connection to Amazon S3 during data transfers also ensures that the data is transmitted securely and does not travel across the internet.\n\nOption A does not include a way to securely store and rotate the database credentials, and Option B does not include a way to securely retrieve the credentials from the Lambda function. Option C does not include a way to encrypt the data transfer to S3."}],"answer":"A","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Save the database credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
