A steady-state workload that requires a particular EC2 instance configuration for a long period of time.\n\nAmazon EC2 Reserved Instances are ideal for workloads that require a specific instance type and are expected to run for a long time. They offer a significant discount compared to On-Demand instances, making them cost-effective for steady-state workloads that can be planned in advance. They are not suitable for short-term workloads that can be interrupted or stopped, as the discount is applied only for instances that are running for the entire duration of the reservation."}],"unix_timestamp":1681832820,"answer":"A"},{"id":"SVjvXvPFVvfgpZet3CMj","exam_id":18,"unix_timestamp":1681991340,"answer":"A","question_text":"Which AWS service provides a highly accurate and easy-to-use enterprise search service that is powered by machine learning (ML)?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Economies of scale\n\n\"Benefit from massive economies of scale â€“ By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.\"\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html","comment_id":"972872"},{"poster":"Madbo","content":"C. Economies of scale refer to the cost advantage experienced by a company when it increases its output. The same principle applies to AWS since it has a large user base that generates significant demand for cloud computing resources. AWS can take advantage of this by purchasing and operating resources in bulk, which results in lower costs per unit. AWS passes these savings on to customers in the form of lower prices, making it an attractive option for companies looking to optimize their usage costs.","timestamp":"1683063780.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"887940"},{"poster":"Guru4Cloud","comment_id":"873774","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1681829940.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe benefit of the AWS Cloud that helps companies achieve lower usage costs because of the aggregate usage of all AWS users is \"Economies of scale\""}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"No need to guess capacity","C":"Economies of scale","B":"Ability to go global in minutes","D":"Increased speed and agility"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-04-18 16:59:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/106620-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-727/","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1681829940,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","question_text":"Which benefit of the AWS Cloud helps companies achieve lower usage costs because of the aggregate usage of all AWS users?","question_id":698,"answer":"C","exam_id":18},{"id":"IYwicFlKTuC1ql6L2wK9","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/106619-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-728/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Which AWS service or feature is associated with a subnet in a VPC and is used to control inbound and outbound traffic?","timestamp":"2023-04-18 16:58:00","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":18,"question_id":699,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Network ACLs","D":"VPC Flow Logs","A":"Amazon Inspector","C":"AWS Shield"},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB for sure","comment_id":"1009778","poster":"atom101","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694952900.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are associated with subnets in a VPC and provide a firewall-like protection layer to control inbound and outbound traffic from and to the subnet. NACLs operate at the subnet level, allowing or denying traffic to and from the subnets in a VPC based on rules that can be configured to specify the allowed source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports. VPC security groups, on the other hand, are associated with AWS resources such as EC2 instances, and they control the traffic that is allowed to reach a particular resource, rather than to an entire subnet.","timestamp":"1681829880.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1681829880,"answer":"B"},{"id":"BwNHcHKQlNFczb6FqM6T","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-04-18 16:57:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/106618-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-729/","question_text":"A company needs to securely store important credentials that an application uses to connect users to a database.\n\nWhich AWS service can meet this requirement with the MINIMAL amount of operational overhead?","answer":"C","isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_id":700,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"AWS Secrets Manager","D":"Amazon GuardDuty","B":"AWS Config","A":"AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)"},"exam_id":18,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1681829820,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1691229780.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
