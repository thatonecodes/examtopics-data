By breaking down the monolithic application into smaller, independent services with well-defined APIs, the company is aiming to reduce dependencies between services, making them easier to develop, deploy, and scale independently.

Implement loosely coupled dependencies: The best practice of implementing loosely coupled dependencies aligns with the company's plan to migrate the monolithic on-premises application to AWS and divide it into microservices. Microservices architecture emphasizes the use of loosely coupled, independently deployable components that can be developed and maintained separately. Implementing loosely coupled dependencies, promotes the decoupling of services, allowing for greater agility, scalability, and ease of maintenance in a microservices architecture.\n\nThe other options are not as directly related to the described scenario:\n\n Option A is related to testing practices.\n Option B focuses on automation in deployment.\n Option C refers to deploying the application to multiple locations, which may be a part of a broader strategy but is not specifically addressing the benefits of microservices architecture.","comment_id":"1130835","upvote_count":"3","poster":"TheFivePips"},{"timestamp":"1699545660.0","comment_id":"1066522","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD: Loose Coupling is main advantage of moving from monolithic to microservices","poster":"TBone43","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1699516860.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct answer","upvote_count":"2","poster":"demo4422","comment_id":"1066233"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1065877","poster":"asdfcdsxdfc","timestamp":"1699471140.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD looks correct"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"lunamuller","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer D is Correct.","comment_id":"1058123","timestamp":"1698688140.0"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-10-15 17:02:00","question_text":"A company is running a monolithic on-premises application that does not scale and is difficult to maintain.
