If you don't have a snapshot already, one will be created while creating the AMI (Note, you cannot reference a source snapshot when creating a Windows AMI image, that only works with Linux. Windows AMIs must be created from a running instance. However, the process of creating a Windows AMI still creates a snapshot of the running Windows instance's root volume and any other EBS volumes that are attached to the instance at the time. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Creating_EBSbacked_WinAMI.html#process-creating-a-windows-ami-ebs )\nD is incorrect. The EBS volume that was used to create the snapshot exists only in a specific AZ.

Generally, if the user uses the instances around 30-40% of the year annually it is recommended to use RI. Here as the instance runs only for 1 hour 50 minutes daily, or less than 8 percent of the year, it is not recommended to have RI as it will be costlier. At its highest potential savings, you are still paying 25 percent of an annual cost for a reserved instance you are you using less than 2 hours a day, (or less than 8 percent of each year) you are not saving money. Even a scheduled reserved instance has a key limitation, which is that it cannot be stopped or rebooted, only manually terminated with a possibility that it could be restarted. You would have to terminate and restart it within the 1 hour 50-minute window, otherwise you would need to wait until the next day. For a critical daily process, this is likely not an option. Spot Instances are not ideal because the process is critical, and must run for a fixed length of time at a fixed time of day. Spot instances would stop and start based on fluctuations in instance pricing, leaving this process potentially unfinished. The user should use on-demand with EBS in this case. While it has the highest cost, it also has the greatest flexibility to ensure that a critical process like this is always completed.\nReference:\nhttp://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/11534-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-01-06 16:44:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"53336","poster":"Jshuen","timestamp":"1634051100.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"C may not be the good choice, because from the link, it says \n\nThe minimum required utilization is 1,200 hours per year.\n\nmeans need to use at least 3.3hr per day, but actually batch just need to run around 2hr, we have to pay extra hours if we use scheduled reserved instance.\nSo, D seems a better choice"},{"timestamp":"1636300260.0","comment_id":"447309","poster":"nodogoshi","upvote_count":"3","content":"D. \nC is not available now. \nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-scheduled-instances.html"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Scheduled reserved are no longer available it became On-Demand capacity reserve.
