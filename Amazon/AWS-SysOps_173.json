Amazon CloudWatch alarms are used to notify when an error occurs with a Lambda function; this notification does not give any specifics about the error. For scenarios where you need specificity on the error in the notification, you can use a CloudWatch Logs subscription. CloudWatch Logs subscriptions let you match entries with a particular error pattern in your log and be notified with those error details. This saves you an extra step to parse through the logs and take necessary action. You can also use this as a blueprint to build automated reactive measures when that error pattern is detected in your Lambda function.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/get-notified-specific-lambda-function-error-patterns-using-cloudwatch/","timestamp":"1664882100.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"binhdt2611"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/51954-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-879-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"B"},{"id":"z1tkYDBhxra9yRd2thLo","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"D","question_id":863,"exam_id":36,"timestamp":"2020-03-04 00:31:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/15359-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-88-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1664958420.0","content":"D.

The DNS is still pointing to the ALB instead of the CloudFront distribution. If the DNS is still pointing to the ALB, then the traffic would not be routed through CloudFront, and the load on the web servers would not decrease. The DNS should point to the CloudFront distribution to ensure that requests are served by CloudFront.\n\nD. The default, minimum, and maximum Time to Live (TTL) are set to 0 seconds on the CloudFront distribution. If the TTL values are set to 0, CloudFront would not cache the responses and would forward every request to the ALB, resulting in no change in the load on the web servers. The TTL values should be increased to enable caching in CloudFront.\n\nOption A is not likely because the Origin Access Identity (OAI) is used when the origin of the CloudFront distribution is an S3 bucket. Option C is not likely because CloudFront does not send requests to the ALB; instead, the ALB serves as the origin for the CloudFront distribution. Option E is not likely because sticky sessions determine how requests from a client are routed to targets in the target group, but they do not affect how requests are routed between CloudFront and the ALB.","timestamp":"1733505840.0"},{"comment_id":"966107","poster":"albert_kuo","timestamp":"1706512140.0","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB. The DNS is still pointing to the ALB instead of the CloudFront distribution.\n\nExplanation: When you set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an ALB as the origin, you need to ensure that the DNS (Domain Name System) is configured to point to the CloudFront distribution's domain name (e.g., d12345abcdefg.cloudfront.net) instead of directly to the ALB's endpoint (e.g., my-alb.example.com). If the DNS is still pointing directly to the ALB, requests will bypass CloudFront, and the load will not be reduced on the web servers.\n\nD. The default, minimum, and maximum Time to Live (TTL) are set to 0 seconds on the CloudFront distribution.\n\nExplanation: The Time to Live (TTL) settings in CloudFront control how long CloudFront caches objects before fetching a fresh copy from the origin server (in this case, the ALB). If the TTL settings are set to 0 seconds, it effectively disables caching in CloudFront, and every request will go directly to the ALB, resulting in no reduction in web server load.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1691425680.0","poster":"gulu73","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nI vote for B and E","comment_id":"801269"},{"timestamp":"1651818720.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"436977","content":"B & E are correct.\nB.
