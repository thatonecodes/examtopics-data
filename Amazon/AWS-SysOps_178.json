There are three major storage classes: Standard, Reduced Redundancy Storage and Glacier.\nStandard is for AWS S3 and provides very high durability. However, the costs are a little higher. Glacier is for archival and the files are not available over the internet. Reduced Redundancy Storage is for less critical files. Reduced Redundancy is little cheaper as it provides less durability in comparison to S3. In this case since the log files are not mission critical files, RRS will be a better option.","answer":"A","question_id":886,"timestamp":"2021-05-04 04:29:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/51757-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-90-discussion/","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1620095340,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_text":"An application is generating a log file every 5 minutes.
