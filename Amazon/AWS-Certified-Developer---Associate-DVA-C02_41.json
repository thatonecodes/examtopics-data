The web application can be accessed through Amazon CloudFront from https://www.example.com. After a successful rollout, the company wants to host three more client-side web applications for its remaining subsidiaries on three separate S3 buckets.\nTo achieve this goal, a developer moves all the common JavaScript files and web fonts to a central S3 bucket that serves the web applications.

Use Lambda layers to package and load dependencies.\n\nLambda layers are a way to manage your function's dependencies separately, reducing the size of the deployment package that needs to be uploaded when the function's code changes. By moving the large module or other dependencies to a Lambda layer, only changes to the function's own code need to be uploaded during deployment, which can significantly speed up the deployment process. This approach allows for more efficient management of libraries and dependencies, making deployments quicker and more streamlined without altering the function's memory size, which would not directly impact deployment speed, or relying on external services like Amazon S3 or AWS CodeDeploy in a way that doesn't specifically address deployment speed for large dependencies.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1709742180.0","poster":"Abdullah22","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1167342","content":"Selected Answer: B\nLambda layers allow packaging shared dependencies outside the function code, resulting in smaller deployment packages for subsequent updates.
