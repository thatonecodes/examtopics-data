This is a prerequisite for setting up an SAP HANA system.\n\nNext, you need to upload the unextracted SAP HANA software to an Amazon S3 bucket. AWS Launch Wizard will use the software from this S3 bucket for the deployment.\n\nLastly, you need an AMI for the operating system. You can either use the BYOI model or purchase a subscription for the operating system AMI from AWS Marketplace.\n\nAWS Launch Wizard does not require a pre-existing CloudFormation template (option B), nor does it need you to upload the SAP HANA software to an FTP server (option C). Launch Wizard creates necessary AWS resources, like the SAP file system, as part of the deployment process, so you don't need to create the SAP file system using Amazon EBS before the deployment (option F).","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"969986","timestamp":"1690968360.0","poster":"kaishin0527"},{"content":"Selected Answer: ADE\nvoting A,D,E","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"958876","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1689969060.0"},{"poster":"JavaAWSLopez","comment_id":"937107","upvote_count":"1","content":"the company already have a HANA DB on premise, why using launch wizard? it will build a NEW Hana deployment, what about data from HANA on prem? no backup/restore?","timestamp":"1687983000.0"},{"timestamp":"1677105060.0","content":"Selected Answer: ADE\nADE I think","poster":"ohcn","comment_id":"818499","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"814230","timestamp":"1676822220.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"SMALLAM","content":"ADE for me"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1676696520.0","comment_id":"812660","poster":"everydaysmile","content":"Selected Answer: ADE\nmy answer"},{"comment_id":"802591","content":"Selected Answer: ABD\ncloudformation template is needed","poster":"Balki","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1675893180.0"},{"comment_id":"792510","poster":"kk8s","timestamp":"1675062900.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nAE.\nC wrong, not FTP\nD wrong, no need to extract\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/launchwizard/latest/userguide/launch-wizard-sap-setting-up.html"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/97209-exam-aws-certified-sap-on-aws-specialty-pas-c01-topic-1/","answer_ET":"ADE","question_text":"A company is planning to move its on-premises SAP HANA database to AWS.
