Amazon Aurora Serverless\n\nExplanation: Amazon Aurora Serverless is the best choice for this company as it offers minimal resource management and automatically scales based on demand. With Aurora Serverless, there is no need to provision or manually manage database instances. Instead, Aurora Serverless adjusts automatically based on the incoming query volume. This significantly reduces administrative overhead for the company while providing a scalable solution for its database infrastructure."},{"poster":"chalaka","timestamp":"1713485100.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Amazon Aurora Serverless.\n\nAmazon Aurora Serverless is a fully managed relational database service that automatically scales compute capacity up or down based on the application's needs. It is ideal for workloads with unpredictable or intermittent usage patterns, as it automatically starts and stops database instances based on demand. This means the company doesn't need to provision or manage the database instance themselves, resulting in minimal management overhead. Additionally, Aurora Serverless offers the benefits of Aurora's high performance and durability, making it a suitable choice for migrating the PostgreSQL database with minimal management effort.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1198239"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is D.\n\nAurora Serverless can handle resource capacity more flexibly, thus being less overhead to manage\n\n. In Amazon RDS, a deployed database server is not scaled to a larger instance type unless its configuration is explicitly updated to a different size, which can result in up to five minutes of downtime. RDS does offer auto scaling for read replicas, but the process takes a few minutes to execute since it has to deploy additional RDS instances. Aurora Serverless' automatic scaling results in much faster deployment times, typically within 30 seconds.","poster":"517d694","comment_id":"1183539","timestamp":"1711479540.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1708465920.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B\nFrom ChatGPT:\nFor a company that wants to migrate its PostgreSQL database to AWS with minimal management overhead, Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a suitable solution.
