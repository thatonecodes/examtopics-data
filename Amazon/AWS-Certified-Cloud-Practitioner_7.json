It helps identify areas where improvements can be made to optimize the workload for factors such as security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and operational excellence.\n\nBy conducting a Well-Architected review, organizations can gain insights into potential design gaps, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that their architecture aligns with AWS best practices. This review process helps validate the architecture's adherence to AWS guidelines and provides recommendations for optimization, risk mitigation, and cost savings.\n\nThe review is not mandatory for workloads to run on AWS, nor does it replace ongoing auditing and compliance requirements. Instead, it serves as a valuable tool in the cloud design process, assisting organizations in creating robust, well-architected solutions on AWS.","poster":"man5484","timestamp":"1689315000.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html","poster":"et_learner","comment_id":"843449","timestamp":"1679202060.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.","timestamp":"1674093180.0","poster":"Saif93","comment_id":"780634"},{"comment_id":"739821","upvote_count":"2","content":"ashif says answer is a please vote guys","poster":"JAMTARA","timestamp":"1670564580.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nvote for B","poster":"Agil09","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1670182320.0","comment_id":"735393"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1669553460.0","comment_id":"728216","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer","poster":"N9"},{"poster":"myan2492","content":"D.\nNEC has conducted AWS Well-Architected Framework Reviews on various projects to improve the quality of integration.
