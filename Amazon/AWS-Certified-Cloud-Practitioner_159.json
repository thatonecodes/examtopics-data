Operational excellence\n\n\"Perform operations as code: In the cloud, you can apply the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to your entire environment. You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can implement your operations procedures as code and automate their run process by initiating them in response to events. By performing operations as code, you limit human error and achieve consistent responses to events.\"\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-design-principles.html"},{"timestamp":"1682331780.0","comment_id":"879226","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework that includes the design principle of defining workloads, applications, and infrastructure as code (IaC) is \"Operational Excellence.\"\n\nOperational excellence is one of the five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. It focuses on the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. Defining workloads, applications, and infrastructure as code (IaC) is a key design principle of operational excellence that enables the company to provision and manage infrastructure, applications, and services using code and automation. This approach can help increase consistency, reduce errors, and enable faster and more reliable deployments.","poster":"Guru4Cloud","upvote_count":"2"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/107295-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-811/","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Operational excellence","B":"Reliability","D":"Security","C":"Performance efficiency"},"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which pillar of the AWS Well Architected Framework includes the design principle of defining workloads, applications, and infrastructure as code (IaC)?","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-24 12:23:00","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"jLPxkKCi6eA2QU3IQKfs","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-04-24 12:25:00","exam_id":18,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1691579820.0","comment_id":"976549","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

You can use Spot Instances for various stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications such as big data, containerized workloads, CI/CD, web servers, high-performance computing (HPC), and test & development workloads.

Spot instances.\nSince the application is sometimes idle for months, spot instances are the most cost-effective option for this use case. Spot instances allow users to bid on unused EC2 capacity, and the price is determined by supply and demand. When demand for EC2 capacity increases, the spot instance price goes up, and when demand decreases, the spot instance price goes down. This makes spot instances ideal for workloads that are flexible and can be interrupted, such as batch processing jobs, data analysis, and testing environments. Since the application can recover gracefully from interruptions, spot instances are a cost-effective option that can save the company money when the instances are available.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Madbo","comment_id":"887871","timestamp":"1683058380.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nSpot Instances is the correct choice","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"880166","timestamp":"1682414700.0","poster":"Odba19c2021"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"879227","content":"Selected Answer: B\nFor this use case, the most cost-effective EC2 instance purchasing option is Spot Instances.\n\nSpot Instances are spare EC2 instances that AWS offers at a discount of up to 90% compared to On-Demand pricing. Spot Instances are a good fit for this use case because the application is sometimes idle for months, and the company can afford to have the instances terminated with two minutes' notice. Spot Instances can be terminated at any time when the spot price exceeds the maximum price specified by the company. However, the company has developed a distributed application that recovers gracefully from interruptions, which means that it can handle the sudden termination of EC2 instances without any significant impact on its operations.","timestamp":"1682331900.0","poster":"Guru4Cloud"}],"unix_timestamp":1682331900,"answer_description":"","question_text":"A company has developed a distributed application that recovers gracefully from Interruptions.
