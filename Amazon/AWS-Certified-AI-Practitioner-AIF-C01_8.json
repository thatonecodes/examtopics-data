Continuous pre-training\n\nTo keep a foundation model (FM) updated with the most recent data on a regular basis, you need a training approach that continually integrates new information. Continuous pre-training fits this requirement because it periodically (or even continuously) retrains or fine-tunes the model with the latest data, ensuring relevance and improved performance.\n\nHere's why the other options are less suitable:\n\nA. Batch learning: Trains in large, discrete batches and may introduce significant delays between training cycles, potentially causing the model to become stale.\nC. Static training: Trains the model once and does not update it with new data, leading to outdated predictions.\nD.
