This marking indicates that the instance is not functioning correctly or is not responding properly to the health check requests.\n\nAuto Scaling continuously monitors the health of instances within the Auto Scaling group using health checks performed by the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). When an instance is marked as unhealthy, Auto Scaling takes appropriate actions based on its defined policies. These actions can include terminating the instance, replacing it with a healthy one, or triggering scaling activities to maintain the desired capacity.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the specific action taken by Auto Scaling is not mentioned.
