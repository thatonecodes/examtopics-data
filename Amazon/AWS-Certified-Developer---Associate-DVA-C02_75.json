Publish a new version: Lambda's versioning mechanism allows you to deploy updated code without affecting the currently running version. This is a crucial first step.\n\nC. Create an alias and configure weighted routing: API Gateway doesn't directly support weighted routing to different Lambda function versions. However, creating an alias allows you to point to multiple versions of a function. You can then configure the API Gateway to use this alias, allowing for weighted routing between the versions through the alias. This provides a controlled rollout of the updated function.","poster":"examuserss"},{"timestamp":"1730986560.0","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nAC -----","comment_id":"1308371","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Saudis"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":374,"answer_ET":"AC","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/150942-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c02-topic-1/","question_text":"A company has a serverless application that uses an Amazon API Gateway API to invoke an AWS Lambda function.
