In this case, both VIFs have an AS_PATH value of 65000.\nPriority : Since both VIFs have the same AS_PATH value, AWS will use the AS_PATH value of VIF 2 (65000 65000 65000) as a priority for routing traffic to destinations in the 172.16.1.0/24 network range.\nFirst Match Wins : When there are multiple paths available from the same source, AWS uses the first match rule that is more specific and has fewer AS_PATH attribute values. In this case, VIF 2 is a subset of VIF 1, so it will be used for routing traffic to destinations in the 172.16.1.0/24 network range.","poster":"AzureDP900"},{"content":"B is right\nThe AS_PATH attribute value in VIF 1 only includes one value (65000), indicating that the route for 172.16.0.0/16 is directly connected to the data center and not learned from another BGP peer. In contrast, the AS_PATH attribute value in VIF 2 includes three values (65000, 65000, 65000), indicating that the route for 172.16.1.0/24 is learned from another BGP peer with an additional ASN of 65000. Because the route for 172.16.1.0/24 includes an additional ASN, it will be preferred over the route for 172.16.0.0/16 when routing traffic within the data center. Therefore, AWS will route all traffic destined for the 172.16.1.0/24 network range by using VIF 2","poster":"AzureDP900","timestamp":"1735436760.0","comment_id":"1333248","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1228219","timestamp":"1718075280.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

In this scenario, there are two VIFs advertising routes for different portions of the 172.16.0.0/16 network:\n\nVIF 1 advertises the 172.16.0.0/16 network.\nVIF 2 advertises the more specific subnet 172.16.1.0/24 within the 172.16.0.0/16 network.\nSince VIF 2 advertises a more specific route (172.16.1.0/24), AWS will prefer this route for traffic destined for the 172.16.1.0/24 network.
