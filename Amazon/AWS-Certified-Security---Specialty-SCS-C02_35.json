Verify that the 0.0.0.0/0 route in the route table for the web server subnet points to the virtual security appliance.\nSince the architecture specifies that traffic between the web servers and the internet must flow through a virtual security appliance, the route table for the web server subnet should direct traffic to this appliance. If the route is incorrect or missing, traffic will not be properly forwarded to the appliance and will be blocked, causing the web server to be unreachable.\nD.
