First, AWS replaces upfront capital expenditures with pay-as-you-go costs. Instead of purchasing and maintaining hardware, software, and facilities, users pay only for the computing resources they actually use. Second, AWS uses economies of scale to continually reduce prices, resulting in lower costs for users over time. This is possible because AWS has a large global infrastructure, which enables it to negotiate better prices for hardware and software, and to spread the costs of its operations over a large number of customers.
