This would not change the key material that is being used to encrypt the data and would not meet the compliance requirement to rotate the keys on an annual basis.\n\nThe correct option would be D. Create a new CMK, and change the application to point to the new CMK. This would involve creating a new CMK and updating the application to use the new key for encryption.
