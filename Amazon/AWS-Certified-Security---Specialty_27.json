You simply have to opt in to a yearly rotation schedule for your CMK. When the CMK is due for rotation, a new backing key is created and marked as the active key for all new requests to protect information. The old backing key remains available for use to decrypt any existing ciphertext values that were encrypted using this key. To rotate CMKs more frequently, you can also call UpdateAlias to point an alias to a new CMK, as described in the next section. The UpdateAlias method works for both customer-managed CMKs and CMKs with imported key material.
