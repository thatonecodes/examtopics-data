Using CloudWatch Logs Insights, you can design and run queries to filter logs based on specific hosts. This provides a quick and efficient way to analyze and monitor AWS WAF logs centrally.\n\nOptions C and D involve additional steps such as exporting logs to S3 or using Amazon Redshift Spectrum, which may introduce additional complexity and operational overhead. Option A suggests using Amazon Redshift directly, which may not be the most efficient option for log analysis in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most operationally efficient solution for analyzing and filtering AWS WAF access logs in a central location.","comment_id":"1121719","timestamp":"1720873200.0","poster":"vikasj1in","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"1098252","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB indeed.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718542080.0","poster":"3633f8f"},{"timestamp":"1718526840.0","comment_id":"1098075","poster":"WeepingMaplte","content":"Selected Answer: B\nLog Insights: Provides a powerful query interface for searching and analyzing WAF logs based on various criteria like IP addresses, user agents, and rule IDs.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree.
