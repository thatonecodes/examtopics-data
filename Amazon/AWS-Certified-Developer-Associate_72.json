The AWS CodeBuild specification allows developers to define build commands and output artifacts for their build projects. By including a phase to run unit tests in the build specification, developers can ensure that their code passes automated tests before it moves to the next stage of the pipeline. This approach ensures that only working code is deployed, reducing the risk of errors or issues in production.","timestamp":"1679063040.0","poster":"dp8719823"},{"comment_id":"815541","poster":"GD_ZH","timestamp":"1676910960.0","content":"B should be the right one.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1674072960.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBBBBBB","poster":"ayoubmk","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"780393"},{"timestamp":"1672940100.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the right answer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"766878","poster":"ayoubmk"},{"timestamp":"1671504120.0","poster":"smica9","comment_id":"750416","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB should be the correct answer?","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"tsampaio","timestamp":"1670369460.0","content":"Answer B","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"737280"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nANS: B","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Justu","timestamp":"1654753500.0","comment_id":"613640"},{"poster":"JP_PA","timestamp":"1643767560.0","comment_id":"538315","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nANS: B"},{"content":"B\n\nYou can specify the unit tests in either the build or the post_build sequence in the buildspec.yml file.","comment_id":"452372","poster":"jc966","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1635008340.0"},{"poster":"Juanlufr","content":"Answer B","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1634724840.0","comment_id":"438829"},{"content":"answer D is correct","timestamp":"1634679780.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"429010","poster":"santhoshmj"},{"comment_id":"194809","poster":"Chinta","upvote_count":"1","content":"B is correct","timestamp":"1633611360.0"},{"content":"answer: B","upvote_count":"2","poster":"requiem","comment_id":"160057","timestamp":"1633584960.0"},{"poster":"jodeepak","comment_id":"159663","upvote_count":"3","content":"Answer B","timestamp":"1633579260.0"},{"timestamp":"1633018740.0","content":"B is the correct answere","poster":"saeidp","comment_id":"157780","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"Chintoo","timestamp":"1632524340.0","content":"Answer should be B","comment_id":"156514","upvote_count":"7"}],"exam_id":25,"timestamp":"2020-08-12 16:31:00","choices":{"A":"Create a separate CodePipeline pipeline to run unit tests","B":"Update the AWS CodeBuild specification to include a phase for running unit tests","C":"Install the AWS CodeDeploy agent on an Amazon EC2 instance to run unit tests","D":"Create a testing branch in AWS CodeCommit to run unit tests"},"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/28287-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-1-question-42/","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"A Company runs continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for its application on AWS CodePipeline.
