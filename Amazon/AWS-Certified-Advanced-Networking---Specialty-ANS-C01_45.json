Disabling the private DNS name of the interface endpoint ensures that DNS resolution of the endpoint is restricted to the Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone.

This is because the S3 gateway endpoint uses Amazon's private network to transfer data between the VPC and S3, which is not charged for data transfer.
