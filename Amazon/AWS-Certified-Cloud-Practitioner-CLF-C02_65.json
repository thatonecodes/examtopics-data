MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors (typically something they know, like a password, and something they have, like a temporary MFA code from a hardware token or mobile app) before gaining access. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if login credentials are compromised.","comment_id":"1046459","timestamp":"1697590440.0","poster":"felixlugo06","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1697396460.0","poster":"Anyio","comment_id":"1044396","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe answer is C."}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":19,"question_text":"A company is setting up AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) on an AWS account.\nWhich recommendation complies with IAM security best practices?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"Avoid rotating credentials to prevent issues in production applications.","A":"Use the account root user access keys for administrative tasks.","B":"Grant broad permissions so that all company employees can access the resources they need.","C":"Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security during the login process."},"question_id":323,"question_images":[]},{"id":"aOCH2foDYuSgxQBDOOgC","answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/138048-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-topic-1/","question_text":"A company is in the process of finding correct Amazon EC2 instance types and sizes to meet its performance and capacity requirements.
