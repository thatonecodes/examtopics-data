CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances and then use this data to de-termine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money. In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics.\nWith CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application perfor-mance, and operational health.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html","topic":"1","question_id":364,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":36,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1580799540,"question_text":"Which of the following is true of Amazon CloudWatch?","answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719193500.0","poster":"albert_kuo","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption A accurately describes Amazon CloudWatch.
