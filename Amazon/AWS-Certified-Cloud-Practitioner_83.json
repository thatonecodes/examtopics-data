In the cloud practitioner course states that in a microservices approach, application components are loosely coupled. In this case, if a single component fails, the other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other.

Loosely couple components\nExplanation:\n\nLoosely coupling components means that each component in the system operates independently of others, allowing them to fail or scale without affecting the entire system. In the AWS Cloud, this architecture design principle helps isolate failures between dependent components, improving system reliability and fault tolerance.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n A. Use a monolithic design: Monolithic designs tightly couple components, meaning that if one component fails, the entire system may be affected. This is the opposite of isolating failures.\n\n B. Design for automation: While automation is important for managing infrastructure, it doesn’t directly address isolating failures.\n\n C. Design for single points of failure: This is incorrect because it's better to avoid single points of failure, which could bring down an entire system.","timestamp":"1726588620.0","poster":"LogicLoom","comment_id":"1285347","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Reidy","comment_id":"1129382","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Loosely couple components.","comment_id":"969759","poster":"Pranava_GCP","timestamp":"1690955880.0"},{"timestamp":"1688970180.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nLoose coupling is a design principle that emphasizes reducing dependencies between components in a system. In the context of the AWS Cloud, it means designing systems where components can function independently, with minimal reliance on other components.\n\nBy loosely coupling components, failures in one component are isolated and do not propagate to other components. This approach enhances the overall fault tolerance and resilience of the system. If one component fails, it does not bring down or impact other components, allowing the system to continue functioning or degrade gracefully.\n\nLoose coupling is achieved by using well-defined interfaces, decoupling communication mechanisms, and employing distributed system patterns such as message queues, event-driven architectures, and microservices.","poster":"man5484","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"947809"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
