This will allow the application to support 10,000 users concurrently and will provide a unique identifier for each user. By using Amazon Cognito, the company can authenticate users and then access DynamoDB with the authenticated users to store their preferences in a table. This approach will allow the company to control access to the DynamoDB table and to scale to any number of users. Creating a user cookie or deploying an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an OAI would not solve the problem because these solutions do not provide a way to uniquely identify users or control access to DynamoDB.
