Security group\n\n\"A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. When you launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups. If you don't specify a security group, Amazon EC2 uses the default security group for the VPC. You can add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time. New and modified rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group. When Amazon EC2 decides whether to allow traffic to reach an instance, it evaluates all of the rules from all of the security groups that are associated with the instance.\"\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html","poster":"Pranava_GCP","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1690458960.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1688012400.0","comment_id":"937490","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html","poster":"[Removed]"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/113614-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-968/","unix_timestamp":1688012400,"isMC":true,"question_id":965,"question_text":"A company needs to control inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.\n\nWhich AWS service or feature can the company associate with the EC2 instance to meet this requirement?","choices":{"C":"AWS WAF","A":"Network ACL","D":"VPC route tables","B":"Security group"},"timestamp":"2023-06-29 06:20:00","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":988,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Amazon","isImplemented":true,"name":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner","id":18},"currentPage":193},"__N_SSP":true}
