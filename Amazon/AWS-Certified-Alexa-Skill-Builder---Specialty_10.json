The conversation is tied to a specific intent representing the user's overall request. The questions and answers are intended to gather, validate, and confirm slot values. The conversation continues until all slots needed for the intent are filled and confirmed according to the rules defined in the dialog model.\n\nTo use the dialog model in your skill, return the Dialog.Delegate directive. Alexa then determines the next step and uses the defined prompts to ask the user for information. This lets you delegate the conversation to Alexa, rather than writing your own code to ask the user for slot values and confirmations.\n\nhttps://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/create-the-interaction-model-for-your-skill.html#about-dialogs","poster":"conmtia0214","timestamp":"1632911880.0"}],"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1607837400,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"topic":"2","question_images":[],"answer":"B","question_id":49,"choices":{"D":"Mark those six slots are required, fill in the necessary prompts, and in the backend code, use the Dialog.ElicitSlot directive until all slots are filled.","B":"Mark those six slots are required, fill in the necessary prompts, and in the backend code, use the Dialog.Delegate directive until all slots are filled.","A":"Keep track of what slots are filled in session attributes, and in the backend code, prompt the user for the missing slots using Dialog.ElicitSlot.","C":"Mark those six slots are required, fill in the necessary prompts, and in the backend code, use the Dialog.ConfirmSlot directive until all slots are filled"},"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/create-the-interaction-model-for-your-skill.html","exam_id":16},{"id":"UHHhTn8EnfQZaEgHLIMP","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"It should be A + C\nhttp://www.alexadevgroup.com/getting-your-skill-published-on-alexa/\n\nQ8: How do I make changes to my skill after it is published?\n\nA8: If you need to make changes in the Amazon Developer Console, such as adding utterances, slots, or changing the icon or description, you will need to re-submit for certification to Amazon.
