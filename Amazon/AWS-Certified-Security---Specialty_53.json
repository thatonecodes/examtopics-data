Then, add IAM principle to the boundary.\n- C: Sounds like good practice, isolate the role that can create other roles.\n- D: Sounds scalable, should be easy to determine who has access to what\n- E: Not really scalable, we want to avoid using groups (i.e, you create a new account, you need to recreate the groups)\n- F: Not scalable, creating IAM policies for each data classification and type, for *each* account?
