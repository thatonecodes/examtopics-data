Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying transformations like cropping, rotating, or altering color schemes to existing data. This can help create a more diverse, balanced dataset and reduce bias by ensuring the model sees a more representative set of examples.","poster":"Jessiii","comment_id":"1355363","timestamp":"1739327160.0"},{"comment_id":"1324275","timestamp":"1733789520.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nData augmentation for imbalanced classes\n\nData augmentation techniques can help mitigate bias in image generation models by artificially increasing the diversity of the training data. By applying transformations like rotations, flips, and color jittering to existing images, you can create new, synthetic images that are similar to the original ones.
