Increase the function’s reserved concurrency.\nReserved concurrency is a feature in AWS Lambda that allows you to allocate a specific amount of concurrency to a particular function. This ensures that the function has a dedicated amount of concurrency and is not affected by throttling due to high usage of other functions in your account. Increasing the reserved concurrency can help mitigate throttling issues, especially if the throttling is due to reaching account-level concurrency limits.\n\nE. Request a service quota change for increased concurrency.\nAWS Lambda has default service quotas (formerly known as limits) for the maximum number of concurrent executions across all functions in your account.
