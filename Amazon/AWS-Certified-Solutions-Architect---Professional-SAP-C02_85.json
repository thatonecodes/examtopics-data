Migrate the application to AWS Lambda functions. Create read replicas for the RDS for MySQL database. Use the read replicas for the read-intensive operations.\n\nHere's why the other options require more development effort:\n\nA. CloudFront with Multi-AZ RDS: This requires setting up CloudFront and configuring it to point to the EC2 instance. It also requires switching to a Multi-AZ RDS deployment, which might involve downtime.\nB. Auto Scaling with ELB and Aurora: This requires the most effort. You need to migrate the application to run on multiple EC2 instances managed by Auto Scaling, set up an ELB to distribute traffic, migrate the database to Aurora, and configure Aurora Replicas.\nC. Global Accelerator with Multi-AZ RDS: Similar to option A, this involves setting up Global Accelerator and requires a Multi-AZ RDS deployment.","poster":"4555894","comment_id":"1198935","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713586620.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1203258","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1714244880.0","content":"You are dangerously stupid.
