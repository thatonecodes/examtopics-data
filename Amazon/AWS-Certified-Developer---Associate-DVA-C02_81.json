It offers high throughput and low latency, making it suitable for applications requiring immediate processing of incoming data.\n\nParallel Processing: Kinesis Data Streams allows you to partition the data stream into shards. Each shard can be consumed by a single consumer (in this case, an EC2 instance). By creating multiple shards, you can distribute the processing load across multiple EC2 instances for parallel processing. This scales horizontally to accommodate increasing data volume and processing needs.","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":24,"choices":{"B":"Publish the data to Amazon Data Firehose.","A":"Publish the data to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).","C":"Publish the data to Amazon EventBridge.","D":"Publish the data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams."},"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A developer is building an application that processes a stream of user-supplied data.
