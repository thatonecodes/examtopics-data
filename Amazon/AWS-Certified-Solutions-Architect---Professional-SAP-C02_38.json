Occasionally, third-party tools ingest corrupted images into the S3 bucket. This image corruption causes a poor user experience in the application later. The company has successfully implemented and tested Python logic to detect corrupt images.\n\nA solutions architect must recommend a solution to integrate the detection logic with minimal latency between the ingestion and serving.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?","isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (97%)","3%"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"932510","upvote_count":"18","poster":"i_am_robot","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe requirement here is to catch and deal with the corruption at the time of ingestion. Hence, the logical place to put the check would be where the ingestion is actually happening, which is when the image is put into the S3 bucket. Amazon S3 can be configured to send an event notification when a new object is created (i.e., put into the bucket). This event can then trigger a Lambda function that uses the Python logic to check the image for corruption. This way, you are catching and dealing with any issues as soon as the image is ingested.","timestamp":"1687606920.0"},{"comment_id":"1335101","poster":"Peaches35","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1735698600.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption B would add unnecessary latency by running the detection logic every time an image is fetched from the origin"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBy using a Lambda@Edge function triggered by an origin-response event, you can inspect and process the images as soon as they are retrieved from the S3 bucket, before they are cached and served to the end-users.

Well API GW with Rest endpoint is a valid solution, since it's had DynamoDB proxy integration lately. We use it in production, and it's a good fit, if you want to have a lot of control and features in your API GW and no lambda functions in between, reason being VTL supports a big set of mutations which is enough to us. \nOn the flip side, since we're forced to use a combination, then CD is the right answer.\nIn terms of simplicity, it is the question, what you consider simple. API GW REST endpoint is considered simple, because it provides caching, api keys, usage plans, rate limiting, authorization, deployment stages etc. out of the box.
