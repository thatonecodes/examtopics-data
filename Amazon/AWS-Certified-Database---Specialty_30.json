Option D has a slight caveat. While, you could create a new DMS subnet group (within DMS console) with private subnets however, you can't attach this newly subnet group to an existing DMS instance. This isn't supported and I have tested that in AWS console. What this note (https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/dms-disable-public-access) is describing is slightly different than some of us are interpreting and choosing option D. As per this note, you could remove the public subnets and choose only the private subnets of an EXISTING SUBNET Group and I've tried this. I modified the existing subnet group of an existing DMS instance. I removed all public subnets and chose only 2 private subnets. This worked however, option D is not talking about modifying an existing subnet group.
