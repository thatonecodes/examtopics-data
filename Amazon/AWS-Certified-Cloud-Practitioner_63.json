AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that simplifies the deployment of applications. It allows developers to focus on their code while AWS automatically handles the provisioning and scaling of the underlying infrastructure. Developers can deploy web applications and services using various programming languages and platforms (such as Java, Python, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, etc.) without needing to manage the infrastructure details like EC2 instances, load balancers, or networking. Elastic Beanstalk abstracts much of the infrastructure complexity, making it easier to deploy and manage applications.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1693936200.0","poster":"fergarri","comment_id":"999768"},{"poster":"Pranava_GCP","comment_id":"953713","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
