AWS Config. AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources over time. It automatically records configuration changes to AWS resources and generates notifications of changes. You can use AWS Config to view the configurations of resources and relationships between them, and to see how a resource was configured at a point in time. This allows you to have a detailed history of resource configuration changes, which can help you identify security risks and troubleshoot issues."},{"timestamp":"1674529980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"786129","poster":"Saif93"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"783349","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC: is correct","timestamp":"1674309060.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1674309060},{"id":"Ey2XXG5QtOIy5oVX4RfF","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
