This can also help reduce RAM consumption on the writer node. Additionally, adding a replica can be done with minimal downtime, as it does not require any changes to the application, and data will be automatically replicated from the writer node to the new replica.","comment_id":"833786"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1677323280.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption C, taking a snapshot of the DB cluster and creating a new DB cluster with larger memory-optimized instances, will allow the SysOps administrator to increase the memory capacity of the instances without losing any data.
