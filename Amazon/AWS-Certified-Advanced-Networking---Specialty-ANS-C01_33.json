The current on-premises multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) network has strict controls that enforce network segmentation by using MPLS VPNs. The company has provisioned two 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connections to provide resilient, high-speed, low-latency connectivity to AWS.\n\nA security engineer needs to apply the concept of network segmentation to the AWS environment to ensure that virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) is logically separated for each of the company's software development environments. The number of MPLS VPNs will increase in the future. On-premises MPLS VPNs will have overlapping address space. The company's AWS network design must support overlapping address space for the VPNs.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?","choices":{"C":"Create a transit VPC that terminates at the AWS Site-to-Site VRF-aware IPsec VPN.
