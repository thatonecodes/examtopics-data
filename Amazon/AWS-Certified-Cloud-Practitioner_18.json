As a cloud service provider with a large customer base and high purchase volumes, AWS is able to achieve cost efficiencies through economies of scale. This means that AWS can negotiate better pricing with hardware and software vendors, optimize resource utilization, and spread infrastructure costs across a large customer base. These cost savings are then passed on to customers in the form of lower variable costs.\n\nOne of the ways AWS offers lower variable costs is through its pay-as-you-go pricing model. With this model, customers only pay for the resources they consume on an as-needed basis, without any upfront or long-term commitments.
