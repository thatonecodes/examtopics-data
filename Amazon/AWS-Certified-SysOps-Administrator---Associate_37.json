Thank you with your thorough explanation!!"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nFor starters, I believe it's a very tricky question and unclear. \n\nAlthough A looks plausible, I believe the right answer is C. In the question it says \n\n\"A SysOps administrator needs to create alerts that are based on the read and write metrics of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are attached to an Amazon EC2 instance.\"\n\nThe key take away here is \"EBS volumes\". DiskReadBytes, DiskWriteBytes refer to instance store volumes (see, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html). Instance store volumes are physically attached disks and not EBS volumes (which are network attached drives). \n\nThus, the metrics we monitor look wrong to me. Also, looks like that the metrics we want to monitor are VolumeReadBytes & VolumeWriteBytes. These metrics are included in the AWS/EBS namespace (so it's definitely not D) by default and the CloudWatch agent is not required to monitor them.\n\nFinally, SSM agent is irrelevant in this case.","timestamp":"1678360200.0","poster":"csG13","comment_id":"833887"},{"timestamp":"1704523380.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1114999","poster":"TareDHakim","content":"I vote (A) - Installing the Cloudwatch Agent, allows us to collect custom metrics that are not collected by default. \n\nWhy not D ?

The question is asking about \"volume metrics\". If the question were asking about alerting for used or free space in a file system on a volume, then you'd need the CloudWatch agent running on the OS to analyze things from the OS perspective, including I/O with the DiskWriteBytes metric. The VolumeWriteBytes and DiskWriteBytes metrics are basically looking for the same thing. It's like looking at a bucket from the inside or the outside to see what size it is. Both work. If you want to see inside of the bucket or what else is inside the bucket, then you, you need CloudWatch agent running on OS."},{"poster":"Vivec","comment_id":"834093","comments":[{"timestamp":"1678536000.0","content":"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ebs-cloudwatch-metrics-throughput-iops/","poster":"Vivec","comment_id":"835946","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"wrong, CloudWatch agent does collect EBS volume metrics.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Debugs_Bunny","comment_id":"1091369","timestamp":"1702077900.0"}],"timestamp":"1678374600.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe CloudWatch alarms are based on the DiskReadBytes metric and the DiskWriteBytes metric, which are not valid metrics for EBS volumes.
