Create an AWS CloudFormation template that defines the load test resources. Use the AWS CLI create-stack-set command to create a stack set in the desired Regions.\n\nAWS CloudFormation StackSets allow developers to deploy CloudFormation stacks across multiple AWS accounts and regions with a single CloudFormation template. By using the AWS CLI create-stack-set command, the developer can deploy the same CloudFormation stack to multiple regions without additional application code, thereby meeting the requirement for geographic load testing of an API.","upvote_count":"13","timestamp":"1684049040.0"},{"poster":"Untamables","timestamp":"1679575680.0","upvote_count":"8","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html\nhttps://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/2.1.30/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-set.html","comment_id":"848208"},{"poster":"sumanshu","timestamp":"1734885780.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"content":"D) Eliminated - the deploy command is designed for deploying a single CloudFormation stack in a specific region.
