Network ACLs\n\nNetwork Access Control Lists (Network ACLs) are a feature of Amazon VPC that act as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of a subnet. Network ACLs enable companies to create rules that allow or deny traffic to their Amazon EC2 instances based on IP protocol, port, and source or destination IP address range. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules.\n\nAWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits.\n\nAWS Shield is a service that provides DDoS protection for applications running on AWS.\n\nSecurity Groups are another feature of Amazon VPC that act as a firewall for controlling traffic to Amazon EC2 instances.

Network ACLs\n\n\"Security groups are tied to an instance whereas Network ACLs are tied to the subnet. Network ACLs are applicable at the subnet level, so any instance in the subnet with an associated NACL will follow the rules of NACL. That’s not the case with security groups, security groups have to be assigned explicitly to the instance. This means any instances within the subnet group get the rule applied.
