Create a VPC Peering connection between both VPCs.\n\nExplanation:\nTo establish network connectivity between the two subnets with CIDR block 10.10.1.0/24 and 10.40.1.0/24 in different VPCs, Mike should recommend creating a VPC Peering connection between the VPCs.\n\nHere's why the other options are not suitable:\n\nA. Create 2 Virtual Private Gateways and configure one with each VPC.\nVirtual Private Gateways (VGWs) are used for establishing VPN connections between on-premises networks and VPCs. They are not meant for connecting subnets within VPCs. Therefore, this option is not appropriate for establishing connectivity between the subnets.\n\nB. Create 2 Internet Gateways, and attach one to each VPC.\nInternet Gateways are used for enabling communication between VPCs and the internet. They are not designed for connecting subnets within different VPCs. Therefore, this option is not suitable for establishing connectivity between the subnets.","poster":"SkyZeroZx","comments":[{"comment_id":"928982","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1687315020.0","content":"C.
