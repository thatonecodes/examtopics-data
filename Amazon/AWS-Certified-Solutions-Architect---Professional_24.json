The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. Within this virtual private cloud, the user can launch AWS resources, such as an ELB, and EC2 instances. There are two ELBs available with VPC: internet facing and internal (private) ELB. For the internet facing ELB it is required that the\nELB should be in a public subnet. When the user registers a multi-homed instance (an instance that has an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) attached) with a load balancer, the load balancer will route the traffic to the IP address of the primary network interface (eth0).\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/gs-ec2VPC.html","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/21423-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/","unix_timestamp":1590544620,"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"content":"A.
