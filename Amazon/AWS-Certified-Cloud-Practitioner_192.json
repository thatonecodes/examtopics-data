They operate at the instance level and are associated with a specific instance or group of instances. Security groups allow you to define rules that specify the allowed inbound and outbound traffic based on protocols, ports, and IP addresses. They provide a stateful firewall, meaning that they track the state of a connection and automatically allow the return traffic for established connections."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
