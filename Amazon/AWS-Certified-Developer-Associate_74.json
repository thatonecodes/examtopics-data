With a resource-based policy, you can control access to the parameter, allowing IAM users or roles to retrieve the certificate as needed.\n\n E. Refactor the Lambda code to load the Root CA Cert from the Root CA Cert’s location.

By modifying the runtime trust store outside the Lambda function handler, you achieve flexibility and avoid the need to redeploy the Lambda functions.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kyoharo","comment_id":"1067525"},{"comment_id":"993756","content":"Quality of questions is pretty poor.","timestamp":"1693376460.0","poster":"gfalconia","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CE\nNot A because AWS Secrets Manager is not cost-effective.\nNot B because the cert is too big in size (AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store has a limit of less than 10 KB)","poster":"capesignalfreer","comment_id":"861905","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1680684420.0"},{"poster":"captainpike","timestamp":"1680259920.0","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nIMO all options requires change in the Lamda functions.
