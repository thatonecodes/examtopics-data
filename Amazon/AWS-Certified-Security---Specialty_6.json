The load balancer uses a server certificate to terminate the front-end connection and then to decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the targets. Note that if you need to pass encrypted traffic to the targets without the load balancer decrypting it, create a TCP listener on port 443 instead of creating a TLS listener. The load balancer passes the request to the target as is, without decrypting it.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html","comment_id":"1017007","poster":"Ernestokoro"},{"timestamp":"1688000520.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Using a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to pass through traffic on port 443 from the internet to port 443 on the instances is the most suitable approach in this scenario. NLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and allows for direct forwarding of traffic to the instances without terminating the SSL/TLS connection at the load balancer. This means that the SSL/TLS encryption and decryption are handled by the application servers themselves, reducing the exposure of the external certificate. By using this approach, the SSL/TLS encryption remains intact between the client and the application servers, protecting the data in transit.","comment_id":"937297","poster":"diego1984","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"ITGURU51","comment_id":"866447","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1681144980.0","content":"C is the best answer because AWS recommends using AWS Certificate Manager to create or import certificates to the Elastic Load Balancer."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C","timestamp":"1668186060.0","poster":"AdamWest","comments":[{"timestamp":"1685375160.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Since the question states that all traffic must be encrypted in traffic C is the only viable solution.
