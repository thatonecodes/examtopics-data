You can define your serverless resources in a YAML template and then use the AWS SAM CLI to package and deploy your application.\n\nAWS CloudFormation serverless intrinsic functions can also be used to define serverless resources in YAML, but they have some limitations compared to AWS SAM. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) that is not serverless specific, while the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an alternative to YAML-based templates that uses familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, and Java to define AWS infrastructure.","comments":[{"comment_id":"971861","content":"your explanation helps me a lot !","poster":"jipark","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1707044220.0"}],"timestamp":"1699954620.0","upvote_count":"21"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/","poster":"Untamables","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"849106","timestamp":"1695535920.0"},{"timestamp":"1734886440.0","comment_id":"1330474","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAWS SAM is specifically designed for serverless applications.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"sumanshu"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1326337","poster":"trieudo","content":"Selected Answer: C\n==> Discard A.
