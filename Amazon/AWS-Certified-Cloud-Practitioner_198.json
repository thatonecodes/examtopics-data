It assists in detecting drifts from the baseline and can help spot potential security vulnerabilities. From the perspective of maintaining a security posture and ensuring compliance, AWS Config aligns with the Security pillar.\nOperational Excellence Pillar: AWS Config also plays a role in the continuous monitoring and refinement of operations. Knowing the state of resources, understanding changes, and being able to trace these changes over time can support operational best practices. If the primary goal is to provide traceability, monitor changes, and ensure that the operations are running according to defined standards, then AWS Config can indeed be associated with the Operational Excellence pillar.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Mable777","comment_id":"1001828","timestamp":"1694110740.0"},{"poster":"tushmish","content":"Selected Answer: B\nsearch for AWS Config to find out its usage. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/wellarchitected-operational-excellence-pillar.pdf","timestamp":"1693681740.0","comment_id":"997085","comments":[{"poster":"tushmish","timestamp":"1694949900.0","comment_id":"1009760","content":"Its A, Changed mind\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/security.html\n\nMaintain traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time.
