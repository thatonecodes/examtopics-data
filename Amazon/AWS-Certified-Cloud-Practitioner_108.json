Amazon EventBridge\n\nAmazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect applications together using data from your own applications, SaaS applications, and AWS services. It allows you to create rules that automatically trigger an AWS Lambda function in response to specific events from supported sources, such as an S3 bucket.\n\nIn this case, the company could use EventBridge to create a rule that triggers the Lambda function processing data in the S3 bucket once a day at a specific time. The rule could be set to match the S3 bucket's \"Put\" or \"Update\" events, and include a schedule expression that defines the specific time of day when the function should be invoked. This would allow the company to easily set up a scheduled daily processing of data in the S3 bucket without having to run or manage any additional infrastructure.","timestamp":"1674313140.0","upvote_count":"15","comment_id":"783442","poster":"NotMeAnyWay"},{"poster":"ErnShm","timestamp":"1674316740.0","upvote_count":"9","content":"C - Use EventBridge Scheduler in your applications and platforms to provide scheduling services to your customers with reminders, delayed actions, or prompts to continue where they left off.","comment_id":"783509"},{"timestamp":"1690143660.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Pranava_GCP","comments":[{"content":"https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/#:~:text=Use%20EventBridge%20Scheduler%20in%20your%20applications%20and%20platforms%20to%20provide%20scheduling%20services%20to%20your%20customers%20with%20reminders%2C%20delayed%20actions%2C%20or%20prompts%20to%20continue%20where%20they%20left%20off.","timestamp":"1690143660.0","poster":"Pranava_GCP","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"960806"}],"comment_id":"960805","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
