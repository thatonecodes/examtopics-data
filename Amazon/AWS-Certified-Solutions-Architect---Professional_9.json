A silent push notification is a push message that is received by your application on a user's device that will not be seen by the user.\n\nQ: How do I use push synchronization?\nTo enable push synchronization you need to declare a platform application using the Amazon SNS page in the AWS Management Console.

The synchronize() method reads the latest version of the data available in the Amazon Cognito sync store and compares it to the local, cached copy. After comparison, the synchronize() method writes the latest updates as necessary to the local data store and the Amazon Cognito sync store. By default Amazon Cognito maintains the last-written version of the data. You can override this behavior and resolve data conflicts programmatically.
