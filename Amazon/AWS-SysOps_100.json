By querying the CloudTrail logs using a tool like Amazon Athena, you can search for events related to the creation of Elastic IP addresses. The CloudTrail logs will contain information such as the API calls made, the user or role that made the API call, and the timestamp of the event. By analyzing these logs, you can identify the user or role responsible for creating the Elastic IP addresses.\n\nTo accomplish this, you can set up an Amazon Athena database and table to query the CloudTrail logs.

When the SurgeQueueLength increases, it indicates that the load on the instances is high, and the load balancer is unable to immediately distribute the incoming requests to healthy instances. This can result in the occurrence of 5xx HTTP response errors.\n\nBy monitoring the SurgeQueueLength metric and triggering scaling actions when it exceeds a certain threshold, you can dynamically adjust the capacity of your Auto Scaling group to handle the increased load.
