The VPC includes two Availability Zones. The security engineer has provisioned each Availability Zone with one private subnet and one public subnet. The security engineer has created three route tables for use with the environment. One route table is for the public subnets, and two route tables are for the private subnets (one route table for the private subnet in each Availability Zone).\n\nThe security engineer discovers that all four subnets are attempting to route traffic out through the internet gateway that is attached to the VPC.\n\nWhich combination of steps should the security engineer take to remediate this scenario?
