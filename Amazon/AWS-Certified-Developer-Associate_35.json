Use Amazon Cognito identity pools to assign unique identifiers and provide user access.\n\nAmazon Cognito identity pools allow you to authenticate users and provide them with temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials. By using identity pools, you can assign unique identifiers to each user of your mobile application and control their access to the DynamoDB table.\n\nWith Amazon Cognito, you can set up fine-grained permissions and policies that restrict user access to their own data in the DynamoDB table. This approach ensures that users can only read and write their own data and are prevented from accessing or modifying data belonging to other users.","comment_id":"899875","timestamp":"1684312620.0","poster":"pranay_2406","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1677072060.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB, acccess to AWS service - cognito identity pool","poster":"ezeik","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"817855"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAsk: \"most\" secure\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/building-fine-grained-authorization-using-amazon-cognito-user-pools-groups/\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-scenarios.html#scenario-basic-user-pool","timestamp":"1670104620.0","poster":"DrCloud","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"734716"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1669444980.0","comment_id":"727334","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis is B","poster":"michaldavid"},{"comment_id":"726927","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Add the signature to an HTTP header that is named Authorization.\nD. Add the signature to a query string parameter that is named X-Amz-Signature.\n\nWhen using Signature Version 4, the calculated signature is typically added to the Authorization header of the HTTP request. This header contains the necessary authentication information for AWS services to verify the request. It is commonly used for AWS service-to-service communication.\n\nAdditionally, in some cases, the calculated signature can be added to a query string parameter with the name X-Amz-Signature. This allows the signature to be included directly in the URL when making requests to certain AWS services.\n\nTherefore, options A and D are the correct methods to complete a signed request using Signature Version 4.","timestamp":"1684312860.0","poster":"pranay_2406"},{"timestamp":"1669445100.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"michaldavid","comment_id":"727336","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-add-signature-to-request.html","upvote_count":"3","poster":"k1kavi1","timestamp":"1669392360.0","comment_id":"726929"},{"timestamp":"1669378500.0","comment_id":"726718","upvote_count":"3","poster":"kapil206001","content":"A&D\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-add-signature-to-request.html"}],"timestamp":"2022-11-25 13:15:00","answer_ET":"AD","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"exam_id":25,"topic":"1","answers_community":["AD (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1669378500,"question_id":172,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/88683-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-1-question-253/","answer":"AD","answer_description":""},{"id":"T2e65lo2LKN8yXG1rL8v","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-11-25 13:16:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":25,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Apply a bucket policy that allows anonymous users to download the content from the S3 bucket.","C":"Add a bucket policy that requires multi-factor authentication for requests to access the S3 bucket objects.","D":"Enable server-side encryption on the S3 bucket for data protection against the non-paying website visitors.","B":"Generate a pre-signed object URL for the premier content file when a paid subscriber requests a download."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/88684-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-1-question-254/","unix_timestamp":1669378560,"question_id":173,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"938457","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI totally agree, B is the correct answer.
