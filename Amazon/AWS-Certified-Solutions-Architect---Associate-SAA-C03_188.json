Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In): Adding or removing instances to distribute the load across multiple servers, improving availability and fault tolerance. Example: Using an Auto Scaling group with a load balancer to add more EC2 instances dynamically as demand increases.\n2. Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down): Increasing or decreasing the size (compute power, memory, etc) of a single instance, which is easier to implement for monolithic applications but has limitations (limited instance types). Example: Upgrading an instance from \"t3.medium\" to \"m5.large\".\n\nIf you can understand above, then A & E are perfect choices.\nB - The performance issue is still there!\nC - Auto Scaling and Load Balancers are used for horizontal scaling, not vertical scaling.\nD - Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances, not changing the instance type.","comment_id":"1336274","poster":"LeonSauveterre","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1735098240.0","comment_id":"1331338","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nit's truly difficult to answer as per the description. \nthere are two requirement: \n1. resolve performance issue => A: use compute optimizer to scale vertically, it can provides an immediate fix for high CPU utilization\n2. improve availability => B + D, B is the prerequisite for D , I prefer autoscaling if must choose only one","upvote_count":"1","poster":"EllenLiu"},{"poster":"Anyio","timestamp":"1735083000.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nThe correct answers are A,E.\n\nOption A: Correct. Using AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale vertically is an effective first step. This service analyzes your specific application workload patterns and recommends an appropriate EC2 instance type that provides better performance for the given CPU load. This approach allows you to choose a more powerful instance that can handle peak loads more effectively without immediately shifting to a horizontal scaling architecture.\n\nOption B: Incorrect by itself. Creating an AMI and a launch template is useful in setting up an Auto Scaling group or new instances but does not address the issue of CPU utilization or availability on its own.
