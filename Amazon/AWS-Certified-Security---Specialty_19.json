You cannot import different key material into a CMK. Also, AWS KMS cannot create key material for a CMK that is created without key material.\n\nTo reimport key material, use the same procedure that you used to import the key material the first time, with the following exceptions.\n\nUse an existing CMK, instead of creating a new CMK. You can skip Step 1 of the import procedure.\nIf the CMK contains key material, you must delete the existing key material before you reimport the key material.\nEach time you import key material to a CMK, you need to download and use a new wrapping key and import token for the CMK.
