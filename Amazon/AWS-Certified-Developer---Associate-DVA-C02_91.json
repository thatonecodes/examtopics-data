Once it has been validated as stable, it is gradually rolled out to the remaining instances. This approach provides the following benefits:\n\nMinimal performance impact: Issues with the new version can be identified early before it affects all users.\nMaximum availability: Problems can be quickly rolled back, minimizing downtime or service interruptions.\nFast delivery of features: By deploying incrementally, new features reach all users promptly after initial validation.","comment_id":"1330423","timestamp":"1734879300.0","poster":"YUICH","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"lht","comment_id":"1329200","timestamp":"1734651960.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nImmutable deployment creates a new set of instances with the updated version of the application.
