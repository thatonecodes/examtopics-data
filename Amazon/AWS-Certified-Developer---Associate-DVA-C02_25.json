This approach allows the developers to work on the new version of the API independently and avoid conflicts with the production environment.\n\nThe other options involve creating a new API or new endpoints, which could introduce additional operational overhead, such as managing multiple APIs or endpoints, configuring access control, and updating the frontend UI to point to the new endpoints or API.

Defining a development stage on the existing API Gateway API could potentially affect customers if not managed properly. It might introduce changes or issues to the existing API that customers are using.\n\nC. Implementing a query parameter in the API application code to determine the code version introduces complexity and potential risk, as it requires changes to the application code itself.
