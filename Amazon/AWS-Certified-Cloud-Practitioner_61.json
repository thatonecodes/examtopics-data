Ability to quickly change required capacity: With the AWS Cloud, users can easily scale their infrastructure up or down based on demand. This flexibility allows for rapid adjustment of resources to match application needs, enabling cost optimization and efficient resource utilization.\n\nC. High economies of scale: AWS operates at a large scale, serving millions of customers globally. This scale allows AWS to achieve cost efficiencies and pass on the benefits to customers. By leveraging AWS services, users can access enterprise-grade infrastructure and services without the need for significant upfront investment in hardware or infrastructure.","poster":"man5484","timestamp":"1688890500.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB.

The ability to rightsize resources as demand shifts\nE. How easily resources can be procured when they are needed\n\nElasticity in the AWS Cloud refers to the ability to quickly and easily scale resources up or down as demand shifts. It allows you to rightsize resources such as Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances, to meet the needs of your applications. This means that you can automatically or manually increase or decrease the number of resources as needed, and also you can automatically or manually increase or decrease the size of resources.\n\nAnother aspect of elasticity is how easily resources can be procured when they are needed. With AWS, you can quickly provision resources such as Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances, and you can also use services like Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to automatically scale your resources based on demand.\n\nIt's worth noting that Elasticity is a core feature of cloud computing, and it enables organizations to optimize costs, improve performance, and increase agility.","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","timestamp":"1674327420.0","comment_id":"783682"},{"timestamp":"1673044500.0","content":"Why BD?
