S3 Transfer Acceleration\n\nAmazon S3 Transfer Acceleration uses the AWS backbone network, a globally distributed network of edge locations, to reduce the latency of uploading and downloading files to and from Amazon S3. It enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and S3 bucket by using the AWS global network. This feature optimizes data transfer by routing data over the optimal network path and provides a URL that can be used to transfer data to and from Amazon S3.","timestamp":"1674326400.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","comment_id":"783668"},{"timestamp":"1669909560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html","poster":"N9","comment_id":"732783","upvote_count":"3"}],"choices":{"A":"S3 Cross-Region Replication","C":"S3 Event Notifications","D":"S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)","B":"S3 Transfer Acceleration"},"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-12-01 16:46:00","answer_ET":"B","question_id":286,"unix_timestamp":1669909560,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"Which Amazon S3 feature or storage class uses the AWS backbone network and edge locations to reduce latencies from the end user to Amazon S3?","answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"7IZpBuSEHwvGB3rW2S3n","question_id":287,"answers_community":["AC (100%)"],"answer_ET":"AC","topic":"1","question_text":"Which design principles of the AWS Well-Architected Framework help increase reliability?
