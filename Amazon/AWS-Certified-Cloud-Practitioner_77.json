AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS)\n\nAWS STS is the service that provides temporary security credentials. It enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. These credentials are ideal for users who are not typically in your AWS environment, but who need temporary access.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nA. IAM policies: IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. They don't grant temporary security credentials.\n\nB. IAM user groups: IAM user groups are a way of organizing IAM users to assign permissions to many users at one time. However, they also do not provide temporary credentials.\n\nD. AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On): AWS Single Sign-On is a cloud SSO service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications.
