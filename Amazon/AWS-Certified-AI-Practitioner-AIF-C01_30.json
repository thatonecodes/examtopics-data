Class imbalance refers to the situation where certain classes (or demographic groups, in this case) are underrepresented compared to others. If class imbalance exists, the model might learn to favor the majority class and perform poorly on minority classes, leading to biased predictions.","comment_id":"1355434","poster":"Jessiii"},{"timestamp":"1735730580.0","poster":"Moon","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Measure class imbalance on the training dataset. Adapt the training process accordingly: This is the correct answer. Class imbalance occurs when one class (e.g., loan approval) is significantly more represented in the training data than another. This can lead to biased models that favor the majority class. Measuring and addressing class imbalance (e.g., through resampling or weighting techniques) is crucial for building fair models.\n\nWhy not B?\nB.
