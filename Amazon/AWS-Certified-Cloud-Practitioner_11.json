As a best practice, it is recommended to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root user to add an extra layer of security. With MFA, users will be required to provide not just a password but also a unique authentication code generated by a device such as a hardware token or a smartphone app. This helps prevent unauthorized access to the AWS account, even if the password is compromised.\n\nIt is also recommended to avoid using the root user for everyday tasks and instead create IAM users with the necessary permissions. Access keys should not be used for the root user, as they provide long-term access to the AWS account and should be used with caution.
