Upgrade to a compute-optimized instance.\nThe issue here is that the current t3.large instance is hitting 90% CPU usage and experiencing significant performance latency, indicating that the workload is CPU-bound. So upgrading to a compute-optimized instance would likely provide more CPU power, which is what the application needs. Compute-optimized instances are designed for applications that require a higher ratio of vCPUs to memory.\n\nChanging the Amazon EBS volume to Provisioned IOPS (option A) would improve disk performance, but in this scenario, the bottleneck seems to be the CPU, not disk I/O.\n\nAdding additional t2.large instances (option C) would distribute the load but might not solve the underlying issue of the application being CPU-bound on a single instance.\n\nPurchasing Reserved Instances (option D) would save costs but wouldn't directly address the performance issue.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized","upvote_count":"2","poster":"joshnort"},{"timestamp":"1704851880.0","comment_id":"947606","content":"Since the application is CPU-heavy and can only be scaled vertically, the best option to alleviate the performance problem would be to upgrade to a compute-optimized instance.
