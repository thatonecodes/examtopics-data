By enabling job bookmarks, the ETL jobs can skip the processed data and only process the new, incremental data. This feature is designed specifically for this use case and requires minimal coding effort.\n\nOptions A, C, and D would require additional coding and operational effort. Option A would require creating a new ETL job and managing a DynamoDB table. Option C would involve setting up job metrics and CloudWatch, which doesn’t directly address processing incremental data. Option D would involve deleting data from S3 after processing, which might not be desirable if the original data needs to be retained.
