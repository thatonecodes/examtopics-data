These KPIs should be a measure of business value, not of the technical aspects of the operation of the service. This allows for automatic notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it’s possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.\n\n\nScale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability: Replace one large resource with multiple small resources to reduce the impact of a single failure on the overall workload. Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don’t share a common point of failure.","comment_id":"775725","poster":"Meeso","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: DE\ncheck Design principles","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"775722","timestamp":"1673713680.0","poster":"Meeso"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CE\nA is for operational excellent","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Kelland","comment_id":"769233","timestamp":"1673169600.0"},{"poster":"Patos","content":"I would say AE","comment_id":"768108","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"all4one","comment_id":"769882","content":"A is wrong because Infrastructure as code comes under Operational Excellence.","timestamp":"1673218260.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1673043540.0"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"CE","question_images":[],"choices":{"E":"Automatically recover from failure","A":"Perform operations as code","C":"Automatically scale to meet demand","D":"Deploy resources globally to improve response time","B":"Enable traceability"},"answer":"CE","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/94237-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-528/","topic":"1","answers_community":["CE (84%)","Other"],"answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"V6me99jlza0SAUIMCcv8","unix_timestamp":1672835100,"discussion":[{"poster":"Pranava_GCP","timestamp":"1691288100.0","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA.
