For example, you can create a Lambda function to modify your AWS security group rules based on security findings. If you receive a GuardDuty finding indicating one of your EC2 instances is being probed by a known malicious IP, you can address it through a CloudWatch Events rule, initiating a Lambda function to automatically modify your security group rules and restrict access on that port.","poster":"Josh11211"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1669715040,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true},{"id":"f5nx86aBBz03fkprz2Zj","topic":"1","answer":"C","question_text":"A company wants to analyze streaming user data and respond to customer queries in real time.\nWhich AWS service can meet these requirements?","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Amazon QuickSight","B":"Amazon Redshift","D":"AWS Data Pipeline","C":"Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"9","content":"Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to transform and analyze streaming data in real time using Apache Flink.","poster":"myan2492","timestamp":"1667239800.0","comment_id":"708635"},{"poster":"the_var","content":"Is this a Cloud Pracitioner question?","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1706791680.0","comment_id":"1137622"},{"timestamp":"1690349640.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAmazon Kinesis Data Analytics is a service that allows you to process and analyze streaming data in real-time.
