Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Moving assets to S3 Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days: This storage class automatically analyzes the access patterns of objects and moves them between frequent access and infrequent access tiers. Since the objects will be accessed frequently for the first 30 days, storing them in the frequent access tier during that period optimizes performance. After 30 days, when the access patterns become inconsistent, S3 Intelligent-Tiering will automatically move the objects to the infrequent access tier, reducing storage costs.\n\nB. Configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads: Multipart uploads are used for large objects, and incomplete multipart uploads can consume storage space if not cleaned up.
