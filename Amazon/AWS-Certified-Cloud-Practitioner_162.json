Instead, it simply involves adding a tag to each resource and configuring cost allocation tags, which is a relatively straightforward process. Once set up, the cost allocation tags will automatically generate detailed billing reports that are broken down by department, enabling each department to be charged only for the resources that it uses."},{"poster":"atom101","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer A: cost allocation tags\n\n\"A tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. You can use tags to organize your resources, and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed level. After you activate cost allocation tags, AWS uses the cost allocation tags to organize your resource costs on your cost allocation report, to make it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs. \"\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html","comment_id":"1007745","timestamp":"1694701440.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"909240","content":"Answer is A.","poster":"Maru86","timestamp":"1685351880.0"},{"poster":"JCTing","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt’s A.","comment_id":"886245","timestamp":"1682945520.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/107301-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-824/","answer":"A","choices":{"A":"Add a department tag to each resource and configure cost allocation tags.","D":"Use AWS Organizations to get a billing report for each department.","C":"Move each department resource to its own AWS account.","B":"Move each department resource to its own VPC."},"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-04-24 12:43:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"exam_id":18,"question_id":806,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"A company is running workloads for multiple departments within a single VPC.
