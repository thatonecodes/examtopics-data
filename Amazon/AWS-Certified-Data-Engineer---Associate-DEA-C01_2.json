In 2021, AWS announced Dual-Layer Server-Side Encryption (DSSE-KMS) for S3. This feature can be used with S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3) to provide an additional layer of security for your data.\n2) Two-layer encryption generally refers to applying two different encryption mechanisms within the same system or service.\nClient-side encryption encrypts data before it reaches S3, so S3 itself treats data as already encrypted. Therefore, SSE-KMS does not provide an additional layer of encryption for client-side encrypted data; it simply encrypts already encrypted data once more. This may not provide much of a practical security enhancement.\nDSSE-KMS, on the other hand, encrypts data twice within S3 using two different keys, effectively providing two layers of encryption.\nUsing client-side encryption together with SSE-KMS can provide an additional layer of security, but is not two-tier server-side encryption in the strict sense."}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"bakarys","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe solution that will meet these requirements is Option A: Use both server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) and the Amazon S3 Encryption Client.\n\nThis approach provides two layers of encryption. The first layer is the server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS), which encrypts the data at rest. The second layer is the client-side encryption using the Amazon S3 Encryption Client before the data is uploaded to S3. This way, the data is already encrypted when it arrives at S3 and then it gets encrypted again by S3, thus providing two layers of encryption.\n\nThe other options are not as suitable:\n\nOption B: Thereâ€™s no such thing as dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS).\nOption C: Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) only provides one layer of encryption.\nOption D: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) also only provides one layer of encryption","comment_id":"1241078"},{"timestamp":"1719248220.0","content":"Using dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (DSSE-KMS) applies two layers of encryption to objects when they are uploaded to Amazon S3.
