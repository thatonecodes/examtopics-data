For example, let's say that you have a web application that currently runs on two instances and you want the CPU utilization of the Auto Scaling group to stay at around 50 percent when the load on the application changes. This method is useful for scaling as traffic changes occur, when you don't know when the traffic will change. You can configure scaling policies to respond for you. There are multiple policy types (or a combination of them) that you can use to scale in response to traffic changes.
