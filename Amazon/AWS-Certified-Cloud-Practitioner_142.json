Elasticity","timestamp":"1690974960.0"},{"poster":"Madbo","comment_id":"887960","content":"C. Elasticity. The benefit of the AWS Cloud that describes the user's requirements is elasticity. Elasticity allows users to easily scale resources up or down based on demand, and to do so quickly with only a few minutes of notice. This means that users can access as many resources as they need, and only pay for what they use. Reliability refers to the ability of a system to perform consistently and correctly, while economy of scale refers to the cost advantages of using large-scale operations. Pay-as-you-go pricing is a billing model that charges users only for the resources they consume, rather than requiring upfront payment for a fixed amount of resources.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1683064740.0"},{"comment_id":"873765","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nElasticity is a key benefit of the AWS Cloud, as it provides the ability to easily scale resources up and down as needed.
