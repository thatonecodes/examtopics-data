The Lambda function sends the records to the legacy REST API.\n\nApproximately 10% of the records that the Lambda function sends from the Kinesis data stream have data errors and must be processed manually. The Lambda function event source configuration has an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) dead-letter queue as an on-failure destination. The DevOps engineer has configured the Lambda function to process records in batches and has implemented retries in case of failure.\n\nDuring testing, the DevOps engineer notices that the dead-letter queue contains many records that have no data errors and that already have been processed by the legacy REST API. The DevOps engineer needs to configure the Lambda function's event source options to reduce the number of errorless records that are sent to the dead-letter queue.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Increase the retry attempts.","D":"Decrease the maximum age of record.","C":"Increase the concurrent batches per shard.","B":"Configure the setting to split the batch when an error occurs."},"timestamp":"2023-11-23 10:02:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhen consuming records from a Kinesis data stream using AWS Lambda, the function can process records in batches. By default, if any record in the batch fails to process, the entire batch is sent to the dead-letter queue.\nTo avoid sending errorless records to the dead-letter queue, the Lambda function's event source options should be configured to split the batch when an error occurs. This setting is called batchWindow and can be configured in the event source mapping for the Lambda function.\nWhen batchWindow is set to TRIM_HORIZON, the Lambda function will split the batch at the first record that causes an error and send only the failed records to the dead-letter queue. The remaining errorless records in the batch will continue to be processed by the function.","comment_id":"1200856","comments":[{"timestamp":"1719375240.0","comment_id":"1237182","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Gomer","content":"Seemingly very good explanation, though I had trouble finding any references other than this:\n\"BisectBatchOnFunctionError\" \"If the function returns an error, split the batch in two and retry.
