Add an additional node to the ElastiCache cluster.\n\nAdding more nodes to the cluster increases the overall memory available for caching, reducing the likelihood of evictions. Each additional node adds more memory capacity, allowing more data to be stored in the cache without evicting existing items.\n\n\nC. Increase the individual node size inside the ElastiCache cluster.\n\nBy increasing the size of each node, you increase the amount of memory available in each node.
