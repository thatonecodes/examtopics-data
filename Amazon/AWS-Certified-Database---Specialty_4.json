The table is bulk-loaded with data infrequently, so it doesn't incur very much write activity. However, it does experience a high degree of read activity, which varies over time. By monitoring the Amazon CloudWatch metrics for ProductCatalog, you determine that the table requires 1,200 read capacity units (to avoid DynamoDB throttling read requests when activity is at its peak). You also determine that ProductCatalog requires 150 read capacity units at a minimum, when read traffic is at its lowest point.\n\nWithin the range of 150 to 1,200 read capacity units, you decide that a target utilization of 70 percent would be appropriate for the ProductCatalog table. Target utilization is the ratio of consumed capacity units to provisioned capacity units, expressed as a percentage. Application Auto Scaling uses its target tracking algorithm to ensure that the provisioned read capacity of ProductCatalog is adjusted as required so that utilization remains at or near 70 percent.\"","timestamp":"1646920980.0"},{"comments":[{"poster":"whn","content":"Remember for Provisioned with Auto-Scaling you are basically paying for throughput 24/7.
