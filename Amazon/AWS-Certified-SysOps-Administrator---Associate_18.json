However, this does make some presumptions on the utilization. However, I do believe B is probably the right answer (from researching AWS documentation)\n\"The rightsizing recommendations feature in Cost Explorer helps you identify cost-saving opportunities by downsizing or terminating instances in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Rightsizing recommendations analyze your Amazon EC2 resources and usage to show opportunities for how you can lower your spending. You can see all of your underutilized Amazon EC2 instances across member accounts in a single view to immediately identify how much you can save.

Federate the LDAP directory with IAM using SAML:\n\n By federating with IAM using SAML, you enable single sign-on (SSO) and allow users to authenticate using their existing LDAP credentials. This eliminates the need to manage separate IAM user accounts and passwords for AWS access.\n Different IAM roles can be created to correspond to different LDAP groups, and users can assume these roles to gain access to AWS resources.
