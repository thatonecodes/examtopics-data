This means that the Lambda function is caching the authorization decision and returning the cached result for subsequent requests with the same token, rather than re-evaluating the authorization policy for each request. If the developer's access token was issued before the Department attribute was updated in the IdP, then the cached authorization decision would still be based on the old attribute value. To fix this, the developer can either disable authorization caching on the custom Lambda authorizer or wait until the cache expires and try again with a fresh access token."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nEasy, the answer is A. A Lambda authorizer is an API Gateway feature that uses a Lambda function which controls access to the API. The problem here is that the developer has enabled caching. First time he tries accessing the API with department set to engineering, API gateway receives the information and caches it. The second time he tries to access the API, the information is not being checked again. So the department field doesn't get updated, because its value has been cached on the first try.","timestamp":"1676262780.0","comment_id":"807052","poster":"pancman","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1672817460.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"by116549","content":"Being the question states this: \"The developer has set up an attribute mapping to map an attribute that is named Department and to pass the attribute to a custom AWS Lambda authorizer\"\n\nIt rules out C and D leaving A or B.\n\nSeems A when checking this resource:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/configure-api-gateway-lambda-authorization-with-console.html","comment_id":"765342"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1670140980.0","poster":"k1kavi1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGoing with A","comment_id":"734930"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"michaldavid","content":"Difficult one.
