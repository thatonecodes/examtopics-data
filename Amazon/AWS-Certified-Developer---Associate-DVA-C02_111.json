Create a new API Gateway API for testing purposes. Update the integration of the new API with the new Lambda version. Use the new API for testing.","B":"Update the existing Lambda alias used by API Gateway to a weighted alias. Add the new Lambda version as an additional Lambda function with a weight of 10%. Use the existing API Gateway stage for testing.","A":"Create a new version of the Lambda function. Create a new stage on API Gateway with integration to the new Lambda version. Use the new API Gateway stage to test the Lambda function.","C":"Create a new version of the Lambda function. Create and deploy a second Lambda function to filter incoming requests from API Gateway. If the filtering Lambda function detects a test request, the filtering Lambda function will invoke the new Lambda version of the code. For other requests, the filtering Lambda function will invoke the old Lambda version. Update the API Gateway API to use the filtering Lambda function."},"answers_community":["A (91%)","5%"],"answer":"A","question_text":"A company has an AWS Lambda function that processes incoming requests from an Amazon API Gateway API. The API calls the Lambda function by using a Lambda alias. A developer updated the Lambda function code to handle more details related to the incoming requests. The developer wants to deploy the new Lambda function for more testing by other developers with no impact to customers that use the API.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1735296000.0","comment_id":"1332359","content":"Selected Answer: A\nExisting customers continue to use the current stage (e.g., prod), which is integrated with the old Lambda version. The new stage (e.g., test) can point to the new Lambda version without affecting the production stage.\n\nB) Eliminated - routing even 10% of traffic to the new Lambda version could cause issues for customers if the new version has any problems.\n\n\nC) Eliminated - This approach introduces an extra Lambda function to filter requests, increasing complexity.\n\nD) Eliminated - Creating a new API Gateway involves replicating configurations like authorizers, throttling, and endpoints. Maintaining two separate API Gateways adds long-term management overhead.","poster":"sumanshu"},{"poster":"rbryanben","comment_id":"1308271","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730965260.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHow not C"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"nbxyzd","timestamp":"1730537760.0","comment_id":"1306099","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt's hands-down A."},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe request is `Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST \"operational overhead\"?`, Therefore solution C is too crazy and the operation will be complex","poster":"queekao","comment_id":"1254067","timestamp":"1721789700.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"65703c1","timestamp":"1716408000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer.","comment_id":"1215991"},{"poster":"Alearn","timestamp":"1703457480.0","comment_id":"1104895","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption A requires creating a new stage on API Gateway, which might increase the operational overhead and complexity of managing multiple stages.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"poster":"Cerakoted","content":"Cuz of it -> new Lambda function for more testing by other developers with no impact to customers that use the API.","comment_id":"1026684","comments":[{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702165920.0","comment_id":"1092166","content":"Thank you for this...
