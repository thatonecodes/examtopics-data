While in transit, your network traffic remains on the AWS global network and never touches the public internet. This reduces the chance of hitting bottlenecks or unexpected increases in latency. When creating a new connection, you can choose a hosted connection provided by an AWS Direct Connect Delivery Partner, or choose a dedicated connection from AWS—and deploy at AWS Direct Connect locations around the globe. With AWS Direct Connect SiteLink, you can send data between AWS Direct Connect locations to create private network connections between the offices and data centers in your global network.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711170240.0","comment_id":"1180578","poster":"[Removed]"},{"poster":"BShelat","timestamp":"1705251420.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1122693","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html"},{"comment_id":"1121069","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCloudFront is CDN","timestamp":"1705088640.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"luchonana11"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCreate a dedicated network connection to AWS\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/","poster":"petercorn","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1119283","timestamp":"1704941040.0"},{"poster":"TCP_13","timestamp":"1704557220.0","comment_id":"1115294","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection from an on-premises data center to AWS.
