They are used for monitoring and logging network traffic, but they cannot be used for active traffic control.\n\nOption D (Create a new security group to block traffic to the external IP address and assign it to the entire VPC) is incorrect because, like in Option A, security groups are not meant to block traffic to specific external IP addresses.
