RFE starts with all features and then eliminates the least important ones until a desired number of features is reached. This can help to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve the model performance by removing irrelevant or redundant features. The Marketing team can then interpret the model by looking at the remaining features and their importance scores.","poster":"Mickey321"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nAC are the correct","timestamp":"1722545340.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"969408","poster":"kaike_reis"},{"poster":"earthMover","timestamp":"1716591780.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nHow can we add features to the dataset provided.... we can't make them up from thin air.

Add L1 regularization to the classifier and C. Perform recursive feature elimination are the methods that can be used to improve the model performance and satisfy the Marketing team's needs.\n\nExplanation:\nA. Adding L1 regularization to the logistic regression classifier can help to improve the model performance and reduce overfitting. This can also help to highlight the relevant features for churn prediction as L1 regularization can shrink the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero.\n\n\nC. Recursive feature elimination can be used to select the most relevant features for the model.

Adding L1 regularization can help to reduce overfitting by shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero, which can improve the model's generalization performance on the validation set.\n\nC. Recursive feature elimination is a feature selection technique that removes the least important feature at each iteration and trains the model on the remaining features until a desired number of features is reached. This method can be used to identify the most relevant features for the prediction task and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, leading to improved model performance and interpretability for the Marketing team.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"AjoseO","comment_id":"804697","timestamp":"1707594660.0"},{"poster":"wisoxe8356","content":"AC - \nKey: logistic regression model = non linear in terms of Odds and Probability, however it is linear in terms of Log Odds.\nKey: Large gap between training & validation = overfitting\n=> 5 techniques to prevent overfitting:\n1.
