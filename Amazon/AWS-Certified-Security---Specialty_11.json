It delivers all of your data in a reliable, timely, and simple manner. It also emits Amazon CloudWatch metrics to help you better monitor and troubleshoot the streaming process.\n\nBy default, records are parsed from each file based on the newline ('\\n') character. However, the agent can also be configured to parse multi-line records (see Agent Configuration Settings).\n\nYou can install the agent on Linux-based server environments such as web servers, log servers, and database servers.
