One can occur when Amazon S3 receives the copy request and the other can occur while\nAmazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.\nIf the copy is successful, you receive a response that contains the information about the copied object.","topic":"1","question_id":242,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/17378-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-316-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1585082700,"answers_community":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"Diiz73tbRO894HQlfUcU","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/17379-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-317-discussion/","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhen you create a snapshot of an EBS volume, it's stored in Amazon S3.
