Use the Amazon Redshift Data API to publish an event to Amazon EventBridge. Configure an EventBridge rule to invoke the Lambda function.\n\nExplanation:\nOption B leverages the Amazon Redshift Data API to publish events to Amazon EventBridge, which provides a serverless event bus service for handling events across AWS services. By configuring an EventBridge rule to invoke the Lambda function in response to events published by the Redshift Data API, the data engineer can ensure that the Lambda function is triggered whenever there is a new transaction data load in Amazon Redshift. This approach offers a straightforward and scalable solution for tracking table load statuses without relying on additional Lambda functions or services."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"MephiboshethGumani","comment_id":"1395673","timestamp":"1741975440.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nthe data engineer should use Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) to trigger the Lambda function based on a schedule or events that correspond to the completion of the data load process in Amazon Redshift."},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1733274060.0","comment_id":"1321607","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe statement in B is inaccurate.\nYou don't 'use Amazon Redshift Data API to publish' event to EventBridge. Redshift Data API has no function to write to EventBridge. Instead, the statement should be \"Use EventBridge to monitor Data API events...\" Perhaps this is a typo.\n\nBut if I assume there are no typos in all the statements, then I would go for D. Although not a perfect solution, the cloud trail events have more info than the Redshift Data API events.","poster":"altonh"},{"poster":"taxo","timestamp":"1724049060.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"This job doesnâ€™t need a real time check","comment_id":"1268439"},{"poster":"John2025","timestamp":"1719063600.0","comment_id":"1235417","upvote_count":"1","content":"Why not used SQS to keep API change in the Queue ?"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1226983","poster":"pypelyncar","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1269237","content":"It seems that Redshift Data API could directly publishing events in EventBridge (see first comment). For monitoring the Redshift Data API, you could use both EventBridge (near-real-time) or CloudTrail (stored in S3): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/data-api-monitoring.html\nBut both services are related to \"Data API\" not Redshift database itself.

The reason is due to either SQS or EventBridge has not direct connection natively speaking to Redshift Data API. There is no way to publish events by itself. So, this means either SQS / EventBridge eventually need a \"proxy\" (e.g lambda function) in order to publish events or process events to this 2 sources. In both services we need something to publish those events from Redshift. so Yes, we need a lamda function between Redshift Data API and (SQS|EB). so either B,C doesnt seem to be 100% right. I think this question its a good candidate to be \"Choose two options\" but none has 100% right. Both are valid considering that there is an adapter function between 2 solutions.","timestamp":"1717893000.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1705747680,"question_text":"A company loads transaction data for each day into Amazon Redshift tables at the end of each day.
