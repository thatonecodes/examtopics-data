Create an Amazon Cognito user pool and an app client. Configure the app client to use the user pool and provide the hosted web UI provided for sign-up and sign-in.\n\nHere's why this is the most suitable option:\n\nAmazon Cognito is a fully managed identity provider service that offers authentication and authorization capabilities. It is designed to handle user registration and authentication with ease.\n\nCreating an Amazon Cognito user pool allows you to securely manage user registration, sign-up, and sign-in processes for your application. It provides features like multi-factor authentication, password policies, and user attribute customization.","poster":"sara_exam_topics","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"rcaliandro","comment_id":"936564","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"rcaliandro","timestamp":"1687951980.0","comment_id":"936572","content":"Maybe I understood why, but I would like that someone explain me why A is correct.
