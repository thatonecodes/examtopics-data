The company’s data center is connected to the AWS Cloud by an AWS Direct Connect connection. The AWS environment includes VPCs that are connected together in a hub-and-spoke model by a transit gateway. The AWS environment has a transit VIF with a Direct Connect gateway for on-premises connectivity.\n\nThe company has a hybrid DNS model. The company has configured Amazon Route 53 Resolver endpoints in the hub VPC to allow bidirectional DNS traffic flow. The company is running a backend application in one of the VPCs.\n\nThe company uses a message-oriented architecture and employs Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to receive messages from other applications over a private network. A network engineer wants to use an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS for this architecture. Client services must be able to access the endpoint service from on premises and from multiple VPCs within the company's AWS infrastructure.\n\nWhich combination of steps should the network engineer take to ensure that the client applications can resolve DNS for the interface endpoint?
