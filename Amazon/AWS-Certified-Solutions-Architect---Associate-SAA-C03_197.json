Creating EMR runtime roles and configuring the cluster to use them is the correct solution.

Each role can have fine-grained permissions, allowing you to restrict access to only the AWS services each team needs. This provides a highly controlled environment where each team's workload operates under the principle of least privilege.\n\nIMDSv2 Access: When using runtime roles, you do not rely on the EC2 instance profile for service access, thereby minimizing the need for the workloads to access the Instance Metadata Service.
