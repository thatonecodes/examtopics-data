The probability of choosing a green marble is simply the ratio of green marbles to total marbles, which can be computed directly without needing a complex machine learning model.\nUsing a straightforward code implementation to calculate the probability based on the given numbers (6 red, 4 green, and 3 yellow marbles) will be the most efficient and have the least operational overhead.
