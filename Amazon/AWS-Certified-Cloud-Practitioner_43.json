This helps ensure that you have the correct number of instances running to handle the traffic to your application. Auto Scaling can be configured to use CloudWatch alarms to determine when to scale the number of instances, and it can also be configured to scale based on a schedule. This can be done by creating policies that increase or decrease the number of instances, based on CloudWatch metrics, schedule or even by using a custom metric.\n\nIt is important to mention that Auto Scaling groups can also scale the size of EC2 instances up or down, but this is not the only way to use it.","comment_id":"782438","timestamp":"1674230040.0"},{"poster":"JDKJDKJDK","comment_id":"717305","timestamp":"1668344160.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIts in and out","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"Fer200","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOther sites refer to EC2 Autoscale as In/Out\nex: https://spot.io/resources/aws-autoscaling/ec2-autoscaling-the-basics-and-4-best-practices/#a6","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"700404","timestamp":"1666311120.0"},{"poster":"mightyemay","comment_id":"696242","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. scale in/out","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1665924420.0"},{"poster":"vadiminski_a","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAll your explanation point to A as the answer.
