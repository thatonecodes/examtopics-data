Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides a fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system so that users can access their files over the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The Amazon FSx File Gateway allows access to the file shares from on-premises Windows environments or from Windows instances running in the AWS Cloud with low latency. This solution avoids the need for using AWS Direct Connect, which is more suitable for high-throughput workloads, and eliminates the need for using AWS DataSync to move data between the on-premises file servers and AWS, as the file shares are natively hosted on AWS. Amazon S3 File Gateway, on the other hand, is used for providing a file interface to S3 object storage and does not natively support the SMB protocol, making it unsuitable for this scenario.","upvote_count":"12","timestamp":"1707882180.0"},{"poster":"jipark","comment_id":"982375","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1723800960.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n\"Windows file shares for users on premises\" = AWS FSx file gateway"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1703995500.0","comment_id":"762470","content":"Selected Answer: D\nDdddddd","poster":"skiwili"},{"poster":"beznika","timestamp":"1702845840.0","content":"D should do.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"748403"}],"exam_id":34,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2022-12-17 21:44:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/91936-exam-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-topic-1/","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"qVxJBbsMF0ZBsgfYy3IN","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"6","poster":"Christina666","timestamp":"1721853420.0","comment_id":"962031","content":"A.

While it's a good practice to restrict access, this option alone does not enforce encryption on the connections.\n\nB. Encrypting the database using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key is a good practice for data-at-rest encryption, but it does not specifically enforce SSL connections for network communication between the application and the database.\n\nD. Patching the database with SSL/TLS by using a custom PostgreSQL extension is not the correct approach.

This can be achieved using a custom parameter group, which allows you to configure specific database settings.\n\nWhen you enforce SSL connections, the PostgreSQL server will require clients to use SSL when connecting.
