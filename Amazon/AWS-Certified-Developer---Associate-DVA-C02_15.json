To minimize these bugs, the developer wants to implement automated testing of Lambda functions in an environment that closely simulates the Lambda environment.\n\nThe developer needs to give other developers the ability to run the tests locally.

AWS SAM CLI is a tool designed for building, testing, and debugging serverless applications, and it includes the ability to locally test Lambda functions. The sam local invoke command allows you to invoke Lambda functions locally in a Docker container that simulates the Lambda execution environment. The sam local generate-event command can be used to generate sample events.
