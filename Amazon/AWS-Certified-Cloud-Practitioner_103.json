AWS Direct Connect\n\n\"AWS Direct Connect is a networking service that provides an alternative to using the internet to connect to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, data that would have previously been transported over the internet is delivered through a private network connection between your facilities and AWS. In many circumstances, private network connections can reduce costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections. All AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon DynamoDB can be used with AWS Direct Connect.\"\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/faqs/?nc=sn&loc=6"},{"comment_id":"889668","poster":"kevin2fly","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is B","timestamp":"1683238380.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.","comment_id":"786781","poster":"Saif93","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674584280.0"},{"timestamp":"1674416220.0","poster":"acts268","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB -AWS Direct Connect\nAWS Direct Connect is a high-speed, low-latency connection that allows you to access public and private AWS Cloud services from your local (on-premises) infrastructure.
