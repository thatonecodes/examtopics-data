Availability Zones contain multiple data centers.\n\n Here's why:\n\nA. Edge locations contain multiple AWS Regions: This is incorrect. Edge locations (also known as Outposts or Local Zones) are smaller deployments closer to specific customer populations and don't contain entire Regions.\nB. AWS Regions contain multiple Regional edge caches: This is also incorrect. Regions primarily consist of Availability Zones, not edge caches. Edge caches are typically distributed throughout specific regions, not contained within them.\nC. Availability Zones contain multiple data centers: This is correct. Each Availability Zone (AZ) is made up of several physically separate data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. This redundancy ensures high availability and fault tolerance for your applications.\nD. Each data center contains multiple edge locations: This is inaccurate. Data centers are part of Availability Zones, while edge locations are smaller, geographically dispersed deployments. One data center wouldn't hold multiple edge locations.","poster":"BobFar","timestamp":"1707789180.0"},{"poster":"HOYIITPUCO","comment_id":"1041770","timestamp":"1697117640.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
