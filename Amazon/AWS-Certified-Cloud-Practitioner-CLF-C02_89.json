In a traditional on-premises environment, organizations often need to invest in fixed infrastructure and resources, regardless of the actual usage or demand.

One of the benefits of the economies of scale in cloud computing is the ability to trade variable expenses for fixed expenses. Cloud services allow organizations to pay for the resources they use on a variable and scalable basis, rather than incurring the fixed costs associated with maintaining physical data centers and infrastructure. This flexibility helps businesses better manage their costs, as they can scale up or down as needed, reducing the need for large upfront investments in infrastructure.\n\nIn summary, both options A and C are relevant to the benefits of cloud computing, but option A specifically addresses the idea of trading variable expenses for fixed expenses, which aligns with the concept of economies of scale.","timestamp":"1697635920.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1056950","content":"A is incorrect if you read the answer again.
