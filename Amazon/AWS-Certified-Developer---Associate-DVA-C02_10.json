Here's how it works:\n\nStop Pull from Main: By stopping the pull from the main branch to the feature branch, the developer can prevent the introduction of new conflicts while they are resolving the existing ones.\n\nRebase the Feature Branch: After stopping the pull, the developer can rebase the feature branch onto the main branch. This essentially replays the feature branch's changes on top of the main branch's latest changes.

Stop the pull from the main branch to the feature branch. Rebase the feature branch from the main branch: Rebasing the feature branch from the main branch is an effective way to resolve merge conflicts. This approach involves updating the feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch and then applying the feature branch's changes on top of it. Rebasing can simplify the process of resolving conflicts and is generally less effort-intensive compared to creating new branches and transferring changes.\n\nC. Use the Commit Visualizer view to compare the commits when a feature was added. Fix the merge conflicts: Using tools like Commit Visualizer to understand the changes and conflicts can be helpful. However, this step alone doesn’t resolve the conflicts. The developer still needs to manually resolve the conflicts in the code.","comment_id":"1125265","poster":"SerialiDr","timestamp":"1705520880.0"},{"timestamp":"1697274720.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Passexam4sure_com","content":"D\nD.
