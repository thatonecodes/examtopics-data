This is one of the key benefits of using Auto Scaling groups—they automatically maintain the desired number of instances across multiple Availability Zones, ensuring that your application is highly available and fault-tolerant. So even in the event of a failure in one Availability Zone, your application will continue to run on the required number of instances.
