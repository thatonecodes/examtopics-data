Reliability\n\n\"There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:\nAutomatically recover from failure: By monitoring a workload for key performance indicators (KPIs), you can trigger automation when a threshold is breached. These KPIs should be a measure of business value, not of the technical aspects of the operation of the service. This allows for automatic notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it’s possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.\"\n\nhttps://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.pillar.reliability.en.html#:~:text=There%20are%20five,before%20they%20occur."},{"comment_id":"950154","timestamp":"1689192720.0","content":"B mada****","poster":"jahmad0730","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption B girlss","poster":"QuanN7","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"940623","timestamp":"1688283360.0"},{"timestamp":"1687552320.0","comment_id":"931936","upvote_count":"1","poster":"zz77zz77zz","content":"b \nb isright"},{"poster":"fhernandez","timestamp":"1686258360.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Option B is correct","comment_id":"918676"}],"exam_id":18,"timestamp":"2023-06-06 16:15:00"},{"id":"P4P9cA118QnRSIGLzZQj","answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-07-12 22:13:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (86%)","14%"],"choices":{"D":"AWS Config","B":"AWS Organizations","C":"AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)","A":"AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)"},"question_images":[],"exam_id":18,"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/115000-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-873/","question_text":"A company wants to centrally manage security policies and billing services within a multi-account AWS environment.\n\nWhich AWS service should the company use to meet these requirements?","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1694587860.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"atom101","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer B: AWS Organizations\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html\n\n\"AWS Organizations is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.
