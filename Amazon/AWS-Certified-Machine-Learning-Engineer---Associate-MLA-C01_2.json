Transforming numerical data into categorical data is unnecessary unless the problem explicitly requires it (e.g., binning for some specific applications).\n\nWhy Use SageMaker Data Wrangler?\n Minimal Operational Overhead: Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler provides a user-friendly interface to clean, preprocess, and transform data without needing to write custom code.\n Comprehensive Data Handling: Supports data sources like S3 and on-premises databases, and can handle both categorical and numerical data transformations efficiently.\n\nWhy Not AWS Glue?\n AWS Glue is more suitable for large-scale ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, such as schema inference or combining large datasets.
