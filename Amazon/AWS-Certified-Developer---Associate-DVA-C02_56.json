Create an IAM Role in the Second Account: The administrator of the second account creates an IAM role and attaches policies that grant permissions to the resources that the developer needs to access. The trust policy of the role allows the first account (the developer's account) to assume this role.\n\n2.

S3 event notifications can directly invoke a Lambda function to insert records into DynamoDB.\n\nOption C is incorrect because polling the S3 bucket periodically to check for new files is inefficient and not necessary with S3 event notifications.\n\nOption D is incorrect because running a cron job at a scheduled time is not real-time and would not insert the record into DynamoDB as soon as a new file is added to the S3 bucket."},{"upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1695685680.0","poster":"Untamables","comment_id":"850586","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html"},{"poster":"pratik7006","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742208480.0","comment_id":"1399610","content":"Selected Answer: B\nðŸ”¹ For simple automation â†’ Use S3 Events.\nðŸ”¹ For advanced event-driven applications â†’ Use EventBridge."},{"poster":"sumanshu","timestamp":"1734886740.0","comment_id":"1330478","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA) Eliminated - This approach introduces unnecessary complexity when S3 already supports native event notifications to Lambda.\n\nB) Correct - S3 has native support for event notifications to trigger Lambda functions\n\nC) Eliminated - Polling is inefficient and unnecessary\n\nD) Eliminated - This is a time-based solution, not event-driven, meaning there could be a delay between the file being added and the record being inserted.","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\n==> Discard A: EventBridge is unnecessary because S3 already provides direct event notifications. \n==> Discard C: Polling violates the \"as soon as\" requirement due to delay and inefficiency. \n==> Discard D: Cron jobs do not respond immediately, violating the \"as soon as\" requirement.\n\nB is correct because S3 event notifications can trigger a Lambda function immediately when a new file is added, ensuring real-time insertion into DynamoDB.\nB is better than A because S3 event notifications directly trigger a Lambda function, eliminating the need for additional configuration or services like EventBridge, making it simpler and more efficient.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"trieudo","comment_id":"1326339","timestamp":"1734149640.0"},{"poster":"65703c1","timestamp":"1732209600.0","comment_id":"1215057","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721184720.0","poster":"JohnPl","comment_id":"1124683","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA is also a solution for this which is better if we want loose coupling but will introduce a slight latency.
