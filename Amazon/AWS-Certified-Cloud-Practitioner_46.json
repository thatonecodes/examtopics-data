In AWS, you change access keys by rotating them. This means that you create a new one, configure your applications to use the new key, and then delete the old one. You are allowed to have two access key pairs active at the same time for just this reason.

Creating a new user with new access keys is a common approach when an IAM secret access key is lost.

This can be done by the user themselves, provided they still have access to their AWS account and the permissions required to perform this action.\n\nC. Rotate the secret access key: IAM users can rotate their own access keys to help protect their AWS resources. When an access key is rotated, AWS invalidates the existing access key and generates a new one. The user can then use the new access key to access AWS resources, and the old access key is no longer valid.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"843418","poster":"Vinayhasija","timestamp":"1679198880.0"},{"content":"Rotating the secret access key means creating a new key and deactivating the old one.

Having an established process that is run regularly also ensures the operational steps around key rotation are verified, so changing a key is never a scary step.","poster":"SLEON01","comment_id":"721608","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1668810720.0"},{"comment_id":"720439","poster":"gabbani72","timestamp":"1668687120.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nright, B","upvote_count":"3"}],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/87769-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-301/","question_text":"What should a user do if the user loses an IAM secret access key?","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer":"C","exam_id":18,"question_id":226,"answers_community":["C (72%)","B (28%)"],"timestamp":"2022-11-17 13:12:00","choices":{"C":"Rotate the secret access key.","A":"Retrieve the secret access key by using the IAM console.","D":"Request a new secret access key from AWS Support.","B":"Create a new user with a new access key and a new secret access key."},"unix_timestamp":1668687120},{"id":"kCZfxd7pDXAj5xtXV9pB","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":18,"question_id":227,"answer_images":[],"answer":"CE","question_text":"A company wants to deploy a Docker application to the AWS Cloud.
