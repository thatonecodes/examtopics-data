Provisioned concurrency ensures that a specified number of concurrent executions of the Lambda function are always available. This can help in managing the third-party API rate limits by controlling the number of simultaneous requests made to the API. By setting the provisioned concurrency to a value that aligns with the third-party API's rate limits, you can avoid exceeding those limits and reduce the occurrence of HTTP 429 errors.","comment_id":"1059477","poster":"PrakashM14","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Jing2023","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA. increase the batch size does not change how many items being processed. \nC is from \nConfiguring error handling for asynchronous invocation — You can set it up when creating the lambda.\n\nMaximum age of event — The maximum amount of time Lambda retains an event in the asynchronous event queue, up to 6 hours.\nRetry attempts — The number of times Lambda retries when the function returns an error, between 0 and 2.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1056535","timestamp":"1698546720.0"},{"comment_id":"1056186","timestamp":"1698495960.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"B.
