It is referred to as \"ephemeral\" because the data stored in the instance store volumes is not persistent and is deleted when the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.\n\nInstance store volumes are physically attached to the host server where the EC2 instance is running. They provide high I/O performance and low-latency access, making them suitable for applications that require temporary storage, caching, or scratch space. However, it is important to note that the data stored in instance store volumes cannot be easily recovered once the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.","comment_id":"950374","poster":"man5484","timestamp":"1689227520.0"},{"timestamp":"1687994700.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ESAJRR","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

The data on an instance store volume persists only during the life of the associated Amazon EC2 instance. If the instance is stopped or terminated, any data on instance store volumes is lost. In contrast, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances.","poster":"Guru4Cloud","comment_id":"861157","timestamp":"1680617880.0"},{"timestamp":"1679666580.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"849347","poster":"Patzi","content":"Selected Answer: B\nShould be B"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.","comment_id":"780499","poster":"Saif93","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674082320.0"},{"timestamp":"1671540840.0","poster":"ACLOUD_PRACTITIONER","comment_id":"750887","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1669549320.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"728159","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer","poster":"N9"},{"content":"Answer is B","poster":"Istiaque","comment_id":"681834","timestamp":"1664377740.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"sumanshu","timestamp":"1663346460.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"670969","content":"Vote for B"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1662493020.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B.","poster":"bilel500","comment_id":"661613"}]},{"id":"655JHWbQk9TgccnP4MME","topic":"1","question_id":7,"question_text":"Which of the following is a characteristic of the AWS account root user?","choices":{"D":"The root user has a password that cannot be changed.","C":"The root user is the first sign-in identity that is available when an AWS account is created.","B":"The root user is the only user that can access the AWS Management Console.","A":"The root user is the only user that can be configured with multi-factor authentication (MFA)."},"unix_timestamp":1661891100,"timestamp":"2022-08-30 22:25:00","answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/78496-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-104/","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"654402","poster":"davinkeithlewis","upvote_count":"13","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer","timestamp":"1661891100.0"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1024340","timestamp":"1696383840.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Yes ,\nC should be answer"}],"comment_id":"960777","poster":"Th3Pr0fe33or","content":"Seriously who is marking these answers.

The root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account, making it a very powerful account. Therefore, it is best practice to create and use individual IAM (Identity and Access Management) users for day-to-day activities, and only use the root user when absolutely necessary.\n\nThe root user is the only user that can perform certain tasks, such as creating and managing IAM users, billing and payment information, and closing an AWS account. However, the root user is not the only user that can access the AWS Management Console. IAM users with the appropriate permissions can also access the console.\n\nIt is important to secure the root user account with a strong password and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access to the account.

The root user is the first sign-in identity that is available when an AWS account is created.\n\nExplanation: The AWS account root user is created automatically when the AWS account is created. This user has full access to all AWS services and resources in the account. The root user is the first identity that is available to sign in to the AWS account, and it cannot be deleted. However, it is recommended that the root user not be used for everyday tasks in order to improve security. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be configured for the root user, but it is also recommended to create additional IAM users with appropriate permissions for daily operations. The root user can access the AWS Management Console, but other IAM users can also be granted access. The root user's password can be changed for security purposes.","timestamp":"1680785760.0","comment_id":"862974","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Guru4Cloud"},{"poster":"akiraaws","comment_id":"861243","timestamp":"1680622500.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"The question is about a characteristic and not good practices.\nLetter C is correct."},{"poster":"Patzi","content":"Selected Answer: C\nShould be C","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1679666700.0","comment_id":"849351"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"A - I have one IAM user, I am able to use MFS\n\nB - My IAM user is able to access the Console\n\nC - This is true\n\nD - I can change my root user password.

The root user is the first sign-in identity that is available when an AWS account is created.\n\nThe AWS account root user is the initial user identity created when an AWS account is created. It has complete access and control over all resources in the AWS account, and it cannot be deleted. However, it is recommended to create IAM (Identity and Access Management) users and groups and use them instead of the root user to manage AWS resources.\n\nOption A is incorrect because MFA can be enabled for any IAM user, including the root user.\n\nOption B is incorrect because IAM users can also access the AWS Management Console if they have been granted the necessary permissions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the root user can change its password just like any other IAM user.","poster":"Vinayhasija","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"841613","timestamp":"1679030400.0"},{"timestamp":"1677814500.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer","comment_id":"827638","poster":"harisene"},{"timestamp":"1676749140.0","content":"Normally non-root accounts are lower privileged accounts and would not be able to create accounts with higher privilege.
