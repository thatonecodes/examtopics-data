Before you can delete an SSL certificate, you need to either rotate SSL certificates or revert from using a custom SSL certificate to using the default CloudFront certificate.\n\nExplanation:\nThe reason why you are getting the error message \"Certificate: <certificate-id> is being used by CloudFront\" is that the SSL certificate you are trying to delete is currently being used by a CloudFront distribution. In order to delete the certificate, you need to first either rotate the SSL certificates (replace the current certificate with a new one) or revert from using a custom SSL certificate to using the default CloudFront certificate.\n\nOption A (setting up HTTPS on your server) and Option B (setting up appropriate access level in IAM) are not directly related to the error message and would not be the reason for the error.\n\nOption D (requesting the deletion of SSL certificates from AWS) is not accurate, as AWS allows users to manage and delete their own SSL certificates.","comment_id":"928976","timestamp":"1687314660.0","poster":"SkyZeroZx","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1633837380.0","poster":"Aline_H","content":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-rotate-certificates.html","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"407781"}],"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/57998-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/","choices":{"A":"Before you can delete an SSL certificate you need to set up https on your server.","B":"Before you can delete an SSL certificate, you need to set up the appropriate access level in IAM","D":"You can't delete SSL certificates.
