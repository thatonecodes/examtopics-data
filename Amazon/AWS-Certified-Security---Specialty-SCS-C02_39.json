Designate a Delegated Administrator Account\n • In the AWS Organizations management account, set a Security Hub delegated administrator account (e.g., a security account).\n • This centralizes management of Security Hub across all accounts.\n 2. Create a Security Hub Configuration Policy in the Delegated Administrator Account\n • Security Hub provides configuration policies that automatically enable Security Hub for all existing and future accounts in the organization.\n 3.
