It allows you to control the amount of bandwidth used during data transfer.\n• DataSync uses agents at the source and destination to automatically copy files and file metadata over the network. This optimizes the data transfer and minimizes the impact on your network bandwidth.\n• DataSync allows you to schedule data transfers and configure transfer rates to suit your needs. You can transfer 30 TB within 5 days while controlling bandwidth usage.\n• DataSync can resume interrupted transfers and validate data to ensure integrity. It provides detailed monitoring and reporting on the progress and performance of data transfers.","comments":[{"poster":"kruasan","content":"Option A - AWS Snowcone is more suitable for physically transporting data when network bandwidth is limited.
