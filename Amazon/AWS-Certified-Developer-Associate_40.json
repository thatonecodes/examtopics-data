Amazon Cognito user pools provide a fully managed user directory that scales to hundreds of millions of users, and it can integrate with any IdP that supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standards.\n\n Configure an ALB listener to add a rule for authentication: The ALB can be configured to authenticate viewer requests using the Amazon Cognito user pool as the authentication provider. This can be done by creating an authentication rule on the ALB listener. The rule can specify the Amazon Cognito user pool as the authentication provider, and it can redirect unauthenticated requests to a login page hosted by Amazon Cognito.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of actions to meet these requirements is A and D","comments":[{"timestamp":"1692423420.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"cognito works with ALB","comment_id":"985000","poster":"jipark"}],"timestamp":"1676917800.0","upvote_count":"11"},{"comment_id":"809267","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nWhy would you use user pools when you are told to specifically \"use AWS native services in the solution\" and this link specifically says Identity Providers:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/external-identity-providers.html","poster":"robotgeek","timestamp":"1676448060.0"},{"poster":"fe2","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nyou can use cognito user pools together with ALB.","timestamp":"1672269000.0","comment_id":"760411","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA&D. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html This article explains in the section \"Configure user authentication\n\" how a rule needs to be created for the listener for both \"authenticate-cognito\" and \"authenticate-oidc\".
