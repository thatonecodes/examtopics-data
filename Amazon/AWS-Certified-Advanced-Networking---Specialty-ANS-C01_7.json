AWS Direct Connect has a limit on the number of routes that can be advertised to a virtual private gateway in a VPC (100 routes by default). In this case, the router for the first data center is advertising 110 routes, which exceeds the default limit, leading to the routes not being populated into the VPC route table.\nTo resolve this issue in the most operationally efficient manner, the network engineer should consider summarizing the advertised routes. Summarizing routes involves aggregating a set of routes into a single, more general route. In BGP, this is typically done using route summarization.\nBy changing the router configurations to summarize the advertised routes, the network engineer can reduce the number of routes being advertised to the Direct Connect gateway, ensuring that it stays within the route limit imposed by AWS.","poster":"vikasj1in","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"1149884","poster":"Marfee400704","content":"I think that it's correct answer is B according to SPOTO products.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707893040.0"},{"comment_id":"1144148","timestamp":"1707373680.0","poster":"marfee","content":"I think that it's correcty answer is B.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1703240940.0","comment_id":"1103303","poster":"nuzz","content":"Pick B because D is wrong.\n\nQ: Can I associate my AWS Transit Gateway to the AWS Direct Connect gateway attached to a private virtual interface?\n\nNo, an AWS Transit Gateway can only be associated with the AWS Direct Connect gateway attached to transit virtual interface.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/faqs"},{"poster":"yanhiro","comment_id":"1098180","timestamp":"1702731720.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption B)\nSee this link (https://repost.aws/questions/QURPt7zKeWSr6-JvM5YQSgvA/aws-direct-connect-route-limit)","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698494760.0","comment_id":"1056167","content":"Selected Answer: B\naggreation is the correct answer","poster":"FayeG"},{"comment_id":"1046311","poster":"Z_o_r_o","timestamp":"1697570280.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt seems D is the answer because of the following observation:\n\nA network engineer receives reports that resources in the VPC are not reachable from various locations in either data center.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1019958","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBoth B and D correct, but D more likely is right answer because we don't know what 110 routes are, and is it possible to summarize them.
