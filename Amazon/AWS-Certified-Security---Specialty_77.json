This involves creating a key-signing (KSK) key.\n\n Sign all resource records in the parent zone with the KSK using the DNSSEC signing configuration.\n\n Create a delegation signer (DS) record for the subdomain zone and register it with the parent zone. The DS record establishes trust between the parent and subdomain zones.\n\n If the subdomain zone is hosted in a separate Route 53 hosted zone, enable DNSSEC signing on that zone as well by creating a key-signing key.\n\n Sign all resource records in the subdomain zone with its key-signing key. This secures the records in the subdomain zone.\n\n Verify DNSSEC configurations by checking that the parent and subdomain zones are returning signed records with valid signatures when queried.","timestamp":"1703877180.0","comment_id":"1109027","upvote_count":"1","poster":"yorkicurke"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"735696","timestamp":"1670221320.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route-53-configure-dnssec-subdomain/","poster":"tainh"}],"topic":"1","question_text":"A company needs to implement DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) for a specific subdomain.
