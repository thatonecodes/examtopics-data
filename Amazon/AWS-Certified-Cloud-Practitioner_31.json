It simplifies the process of creating and managing AWS accounts within an organization. One of the features of AWS Organizations is the ability to set up a consolidated billing family, where one AWS account (the payer account) is responsible for paying the charges of all the other member accounts in the organization.\n\nWith AWS Organizations, you can set up a payment method in the payer account, and all the linked member accounts' charges will be consolidated into a single bill. This enables the sharing of benefits, such as pre-purchased Reserved Instances and Savings Plans, across all accounts in the organization. This is beneficial for cost optimization and resource management, as the payer account can optimize and purchase reserved capacity that is automatically shared with all linked accounts.","poster":"man5484","comment_id":"958098","timestamp":"1689918960.0"},{"comment_id":"952103","poster":"Pranava_GCP","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689404580.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/shareable.html\n\nYou can share Amazon EC2 resources by using AWS RAM."},{"poster":"et_learner","comment_id":"846712","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1679464680.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\ndo not consider removal function in AWS Organization."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
