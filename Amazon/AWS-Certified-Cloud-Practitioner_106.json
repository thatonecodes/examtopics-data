Edge locations\n\nAWS Edge locations are part of the AWS global infrastructure that provide low-latency access to content by storing copies of data close to end users. Edge locations are strategically placed in multiple geographic areas around the world and are optimized to deliver content quickly and efficiently to end users. They are used by services such as Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53 to cache and serve content, such as images, videos, and web pages, to users with minimal latency. Edge locations work in conjunction with AWS Regions and Availability Zones to provide a highly available and globally distributed infrastructure.","upvote_count":"7"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

It involves continually analyzing instance performance and usage needs and patterns—and then turning off idle instances and right sizing instances that are either overprovisioned or poorly matched to the workload. Because your resource needs are always changing, right sizing must become an ongoing process to continually achieve cost optimization. \"\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/right-sizing/","timestamp":"1690285740.0","poster":"Pranava_GCP","comment_id":"962657"},{"poster":"Saif93","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the answer.","timestamp":"1674592020.0","comment_id":"786926","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":988,"isImplemented":true,"name":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner","isMCOnly":true,"id":18,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","provider":"Amazon"},"currentPage":106},"__N_SSP":true}
