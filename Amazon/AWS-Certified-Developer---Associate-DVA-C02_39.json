Creating an EC2 instance profile and role with an appropriate policy and associating the role with the EC2 instances follows the principle of least privilege. The EC2 instances will have temporary security credentials provided by the role, and the permissions granted to the role can be tightly controlled using IAM policies. This approach eliminates the need to manage and store long-term access keys on the EC2 instances, which can be a security risk.\n\nC. Using the S3 GeneratePresignedUrl API call allows the application to generate time-limited URLs that provide temporary access to objects in the S3 bucket. These pre-signed URLs can be generated for authenticated users, ensuring that only authorized users can access the objects. This approach ensures that the objects in the S3 bucket remain private and are not publicly accessible."},{"comment_id":"1274639","upvote_count":"2","poster":"wh1t4k3r","content":"A is correct.
