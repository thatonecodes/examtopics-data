The EC2 instances are frequently started and stopped. As part of the process when an EC2 instance starts, an EBS volume is restored from a snapshot.\n\nEBS volumes that are restored from snapshots are experiencing initial performance that is lower than expected. The company's workload needs almost all the provisioned IOPS on the attached EBS volumes. The EC2 instances are unable to support the workload when the performance of the EBS volumes is too low. A SysOps administrator must implement a solution to ensure that the EBS volumes provide the expected performance when they are restored from snapshots.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?","answer_description":"","answer":"A","question_id":346,"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/130081-exam-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-topic-1/","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","content":"The issue described here is a common one with Amazon EBS volumes restored from snapshots. When an EBS volume is created from a snapshot, the data isn't fully loaded into the volume until it is accessed for the first time. This means that the initial I/O performance of the volume can be lower than expected, which can be problematic for high-performance workloads.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the most suitable solution would be:\n\nA. Configure fast snapshot restore (FSR) on the snapshots that are used: Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) immediately enables a snapshot's data to be fully realized on the volume, eliminating the need for the lazy loading of data.","comment_id":"1127044","timestamp":"1705722600.0","poster":"ahmedsamosam"},{"comment_id":"1172616","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFast Snapshot Restore (FSR) will solve this. \nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-fast-snapshot-restore.html","poster":"gamebase","timestamp":"1710337920.0"},{"timestamp":"1709151840.0","poster":"stoy123","comment_id":"1161972","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA for sure"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ogogundare","comments":[{"poster":"Aamee","timestamp":"1729647360.0","comment_id":"1301826","content":"Everytime the snapshot gets restored, we've to format the volume before using it??... how come it can improve the performance?!... and what about the data that it contains, won't it get lost completely with pre-format...","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1117983","timestamp":"1704847920.0","content":"C will be a good answer to pre format a volume before using it.
