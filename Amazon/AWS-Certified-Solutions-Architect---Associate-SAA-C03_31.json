It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze access patterns and determine the most appropriate tier for each object.\n\nIn the given scenario, where some media files are accessed frequently while others are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern, S3 Intelligent-Tiering can be a suitable choice. It automatically adjusts the storage tier based on the access patterns, ensuring that frequently accessed files remain in the frequent access tier for fast retrieval, while rarely accessed files are moved to the infrequent access tier for cost savings.\n\nCompared to S3 Standard-IA, S3 Intelligent-Tiering provides more granular cost optimization and may be more suitable if the access patterns of the media files fluctuate over time. However, it's worth noting that S3 Intelligent-Tiering may have slightly higher storage costs compared to S3 Standard-IA due to the added flexibility and automation it offers.","comment_id":"926572","poster":"cookieMr","timestamp":"1687078920.0"},{"poster":"Abrar2022","timestamp":"1684042380.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"B - for unpredictable patterns use intelligent tiering","comment_id":"897268"},{"timestamp":"1682965920.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Rahulbit34","comment_id":"886596","content":"B - \"UNPREDICTABLE pattern\" is the key"},{"poster":"PhucVuu","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1680853980.0","comment_id":"863636","content":"Selected Answer: B\nKeywords:\n- Must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone.\n- files are accessed FREQUENTLY while other files are RARELY accessed in an UNPREDICTABLE pattern.\n\nA - Incorrect: S3 Standard is not cost effective for rarely access files\nB - Correct: S3 Intelligent-Tiering is good for file which frequently or rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern.
