You can start with just a few hundred gigabytes of data and scale to a petabyte or more. This allows you to use your data to gain new insights for your business and customers.\n\nThe first step to create a data warehouse is to launch a set of nodes, called an Amazon Redshift cluster. After you provision your cluster, you can upload your data set and then perform data analysis queries. Regardless of the size of the data set, Amazon Redshift offers fast query performance using the same SQL-based tools and business intelligence applications that you use today.\n \nRef link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html\n \nWhile some might mistakenly talk about the “Athena database,” Athena is not a database but rather a query engine.
