Use a Route 53 failover routing policy with health checks to distribute the traffic across the regions.\n\nThis solution meets all the requirements mentioned in the question. The use of Auto Scaling groups and DynamoDB allows the application to scale up and down in response to changes in traffic, and DynamoDB's cross-region replication provides near-real-time replication of session data. The use of a Route 53 failover routing policy ensures that traffic is routed to the secondary region in case of a disruption in service in the main region.
