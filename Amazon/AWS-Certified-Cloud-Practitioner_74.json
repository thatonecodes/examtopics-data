Amazon S3\n\nAmazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It can be used to serve a static website. By creating a new bucket in Amazon S3, and then uploading the files for your website to the bucket, you can make your website available to the world. You can also configure the bucket to act as a static website host. Once your website is hosted on Amazon S3, you can use Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to your website.\n\nB. Amazon Route 53: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) service, it does not host websites.\n\nC. Amazon QuickSight: Amazon QuickSight is a business intelligence service, it does not host websites.\n\nD. AWS X-Ray: AWS X-Ray is a service that allows customers to analyze and debug their applications, it does not host websites.","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1674370380.0","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","comment_id":"783997"},{"poster":"tryingravioli","timestamp":"1707201120.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAmazon S3 is capable of hosting static websites","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1141843"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"thanglongsp","content":"A.

Amazon S3\n\n\"You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts, such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET. Amazon S3 does not support server-side scripting, but AWS has other resources for hosting dynamic websites.\"\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html","poster":"Pranava_GCP","comment_id":"973485"},{"comment_id":"842914","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Loose coupling\nC. Disposable resources\n\nLoose coupling: AWS allows for the creation of decoupled components within an architecture. This principle enables systems to be built with loosely coupled components, reducing dependencies between different parts of the system and allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience.\n\nDisposable resources: AWS Cloud facilitates the concept of disposable or ephemeral resources, enabling the creation and destruction of resources as needed. This supports the idea of creating resources on-demand, scaling up or down, and decommissioning resources when they are no longer required. This approach can save costs and improve efficiency.","comment_id":"1108258"},{"timestamp":"1691291100.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB. Loose coupling\nC.

Loose coupling: AWS allows you to design your applications in a loosely coupled manner, where components are decoupled and communicate with each other through APIs. This promotes flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance of your applications.\n\nC.
