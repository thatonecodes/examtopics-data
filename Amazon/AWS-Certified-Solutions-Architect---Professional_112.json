After extensive testing, the company determines that the m5.2xlarge instance size is optimal for the workload. Application data is stored in db.r4.4xlarge Amazon RDS instances that are confirmed to be optimal. The traffic to the web application spikes randomly during the day.\nWhat other cost-optimization methods should the company implement to further reduce costs without impacting the reliability of the application?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"155235","poster":"Nemer","content":"B - is the reasonable option, as there is no point in changing instances sizes that are already optimal, and a spot instance for the db is a bad idea.","timestamp":"1632363660.0","upvote_count":"22"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1634603760.0","poster":"bnh_fedi","comment_id":"290369","content":"and the minimum number of EC2 instance**","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1634370060.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Checked the pricing on the m5.2xlarge vs m5.xlarge and they are $0.384 and 0.192 per Hour.
