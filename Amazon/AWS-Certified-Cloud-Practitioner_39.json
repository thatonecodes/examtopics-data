Security group\n\"A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.

Security group\n\nA security group is an AWS service or tool that is associated with an Amazon EC2 instance and acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups enable you to specify which traffic is allowed to reach your instances, based on a set of rules that you define. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level, so each instance in a subnet in your VPC must be associated with a security group. You can add or remove rules from a security group at any time, and you can associate multiple security groups with a single instance.\n\nAWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, AWS Shield is a service that provides DDoS protection for web applications hosted on AWS, and Network access control list (ACL) is another service that controls traffic in and out of a VPC, but it acts at the subnet level, not the instance level like security groups.","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","comment_id":"781435","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1674150960.0"}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which AWS service or tool is associated with an Amazon EC2 instance and acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic?"},{"id":"k5DNXl4P0VX8daWnVBXs","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","choices":{"B":"Security patching of the guest operating system","A":"EC2 hypervisor","C":"Network connectivity of the host server","D":"Uptime service level agreement (SLA) for the EC2 instances"},"question_text":"A company wants to migrate its on-premises Microsoft SQL Server database server to the AWS Cloud.
