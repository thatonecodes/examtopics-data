There are times that you don't need, or can't get, example data with answers. This is true for problems whose answers identify groups. For example:\n\n\"I want to group current and prospective customers into 10 groups based on their attributes. How should I group them? \" You might choose to send the mailing to customers in the group that has the highest percentage of current customers. That is, prospective customers that most resemble current customers based on the same set of attributes.
