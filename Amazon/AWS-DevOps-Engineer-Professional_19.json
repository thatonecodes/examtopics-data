{"pageProps":{"questions":[{"id":"fVRxxCxkoKnfQZGSR9BB","question_text":"A company is using an Amazon API Gateway API and an AWS Lambda function to host a microservice. The microservice accesses pricing data in an Amazon DynamoDB table for the company’s online store.\n\nInterest in the online store has increased. As a result, latency issues and throttling on the DynamoDB table are occurring when a specific query runs. Some internal services access the DynamoDB table directly. No caching is enabled for the current solution.\n\nA DevOps engineer notices that repeat requests to the API are taking the same amount of time as unique requests. The DevOps engineer must reduce the latency for the repeat requests to the API and must reduce the throttling on the DynamoDB table.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"891331","timestamp":"1683458340.0","poster":"ParagSanyashiv","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is more suitable as combination of API Gateway Caching and DAX is reliable for throttling and repeat request on DB.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1677427740.0","comment_id":"822653","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDAX is recomended against memcached","poster":"kiiw"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"820852","poster":"CloudFloater","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAPI GATEWAY CACHE/DAX combo good for caching/repeat requests and db throttling issue","timestamp":"1677265740.0"},{"timestamp":"1677231360.0","comment_id":"820299","poster":"saeidp","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\ndynamodb DAX and api gateway caching"},{"comment_id":"819274","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A .
