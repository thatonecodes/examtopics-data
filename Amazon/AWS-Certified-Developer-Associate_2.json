Making an entirely new stage every time a dev pushes code makes no sense. Instead you would push the code into a new Lambda version and update the alias to point to it, with no changes on the API gateway."},{"comment_id":"407256","poster":"Huy","content":"Create 3 stages means you need 3 lambda functions.
