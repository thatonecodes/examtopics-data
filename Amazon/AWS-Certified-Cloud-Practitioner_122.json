These KPIs should be a measure of business value, not of the technical aspects of the operation of the service. This allows for automatic notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, itâ€™s possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.\n \nRef link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/design-principles.html","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"811154","poster":"wooyourdaddy"},{"poster":"Pranava_GCP","comment_id":"956254","timestamp":"1689744840.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

This storage class is designed for infrequently accessed data that can be recreated if lost and is stored in a single availability zone, which makes it less expensive than S3 Standard and S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
