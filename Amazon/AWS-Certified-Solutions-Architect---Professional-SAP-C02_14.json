In order to enable the business drivers, the established business case must then be aligned to a technical capability (increased security and elasticity). AWS Migration Evaluator (formerly known as TSO Logic) can help you meet these objectives.\n\nTo get started, you can choose to upload exports from third-party tools such as Configuration Management Database (CMDB) or install a collector agent to monitor. You will receive an assessment after data collection, which includes a projected cost estimate and savings of running your on-premises workloads in the AWS Cloud. This estimate will provide a summary of the projected costs to re-host on AWS based on usage patterns. It will show the breakdown of costs by infrastructure and software licenses. With this information, you can make the business case and plan next steps.","timestamp":"1691300760.0","poster":"ZZ5","upvote_count":"18","comment_id":"799502"},{"timestamp":"1694545860.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe AWS Migration Evaluator works by analyzing data about your current on-premises environment, including servers, storage, networking, and applications.

If I understood this question correctly, I do this almost every day, and I don't use those terms. Basically, the solution is inserting an NLB in front of the existing ALB, so traffic is Client->FW->NLB->ALB->EC2. Another point is that fixing the public IP address makes a lot of sense, but not the private one, like in this case. Every time you create an ALB 2 or more ENI are created and you have the IP addresses there.","timestamp":"1693853460.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"comment_id":"816902","content":"B.

The NLB would then be configured with an ALB-type target group and the existing ALB would be added to this target group. The IP address of the NLB would be added to the on-premises firewall appliance, and the clients would be updated to connect to the NLB.\n\nThis solution allows the on-premises firewall to whitelist the IP address of the NLB, which is a fixed, predictable address that can be easily identified and managed by the firewall appliance. Additionally, the NLB provides higher network throughput and lower latency than an ALB, which may be beneficial for the application's performance.","timestamp":"1692630600.0","poster":"dummy1777","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1691609280.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"803689","poster":"Musk","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSure about this one."},{"poster":"masssa","comments":[{"content":"miss type.\ncorrect answer is B.\nThere is no need to delete ALB.","comment_id":"820222","upvote_count":"1","poster":"masssa","timestamp":"1692855900.0"}],"timestamp":"1691152260.0","comment_id":"798032","upvote_count":"2","content":"https://aws.amazon.com/jp/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/alb-static-ip/\nALB cannnot use static ip, so it must be set NLB in front of ALB.\nCorrect answer is C."},{"comment_id":"796310","timestamp":"1690992540.0","poster":"bititan","content":"Selected Answer: C\nALB's cannot use static IP's.
