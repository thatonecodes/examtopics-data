Both systems use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. The inventory management system uses the Amazon Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) to publish data to a stream. The inventory reordering system uses the Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to consume data from the stream. The company configures the stream to scale up and down as needed.\n\nBefore the company deploys the systems to production, the company discovers that the inventory reordering system received duplicated data.\n\nWhich factors could have caused the reordering system to receive duplicated data?
