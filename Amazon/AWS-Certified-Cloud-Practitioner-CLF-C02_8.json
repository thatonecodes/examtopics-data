Consolidated Billing\n\nConsolidated billing is a feature of AWS Organizations that allows you to combine billing for multiple AWS accounts. With consolidated billing, each department can have its own AWS account for tracking and managing its resources separately, while the company enjoys the convenience of a single payment method for all these accounts. This setup makes it easier to track costs and implement chargeback mechanisms.\nE. Multiple AWS Accounts\n\nCreating multiple AWS accounts, one for each department, is an effective way to segregate resources, manage permissions, and track costs separately. This approach enhances security by limiting the scope of access and impact of changes, and it simplifies the process of attributing costs to the right department. Combined with consolidated billing, it provides both organizational flexibility and centralized financial control."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Amin_013","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB.
