By using the start_query_execution API from the Athena Boto3 client, you can programmatically start Athena queries. Lambda functions are cost-effective as they charge based on the compute time used, and there's no charge when the code is not running. However, Lambda has a maximum execution timeout of 15 minutes, which means it's not suitable for long-running operations but can be used to trigger or start queries.\nAWS Step Functions can orchestrate multiple AWS services in workflows. By using a Wait state, the workflow can periodically check the status of the Athena query, and proceed to the next step once the query is complete. This approach is more scalable and reliable compared to continuously running a Lambda function, as Step Functions can handle long-running processes better and can maintain the state of each step in the workflow.","timestamp":"1707102780.0","poster":"rralucard_"},{"comment_id":"1167986","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB - because\n https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/sample-athena-query.html\nE - because \nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/orchestrate-amazon-emr-serverless-spark-jobs-with-amazon-mwaa-and-data-validation-using-amazon-athena/","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1270620","timestamp":"1724321340.0","poster":"San_Juan","content":"I discarted E because Airflow is more expensive than Glue/Step-Functions.
