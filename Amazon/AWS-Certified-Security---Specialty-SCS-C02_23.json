Create an Amazon EventBridge rule with a pattern that matches Security Hub findings events with high severity. Configure the rule to send the findings to a target Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the desired email addresses to the SNS topic.\n\nExplanation:\nSince the company is already using AWS Security Hub with integrations for GuardDuty, IAM Access Analyzer, and Macie, Security Hub aggregates findings from these services.\nBy creating an Amazon EventBridge rule to match Security Hub findings with high severity, you can easily capture and trigger notifications when such findings occur.\nEventBridge can then send the findings to an SNS topic, and you can subscribe the desired email addresses to the SNS topic, which will send the email alerts.\nThis approach is automated and centralized, reducing operational overhead while meeting the requirement of getting email alerts based on high-severity findings.","comment_id":"1358989","poster":"AWSLoverLoverLoverLoverLover","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740003120.0"},{"timestamp":"1728780780.0","poster":"mercespsn","comment_id":"1296692","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIs the right answer"}],"exam_id":30,"unix_timestamp":1728780780,"question_id":111,"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/149201-exam-aws-certified-security-specialty-scs-c02-topic-1/","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_text":"A company’s security engineer wants to receive an email alert whenever Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer, or Amazon Macie generate a high-severity security finding.
