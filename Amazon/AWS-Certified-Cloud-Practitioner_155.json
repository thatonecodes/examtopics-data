The answer is B, Amazon EC2.\n\nAmazon EC2 is a compute service that allows you to launch virtual machines (VMs) on AWS. It offers a variety of features, including automatic scaling. Automatic scaling allows you to automatically increase or decrease the number of EC2 instances that are running based on demand. This can help you to optimize your costs and ensure that your application is always available.\n\nThe other services listed do not offer automatic scaling.\n\nAmazon SQS is a message queuing service that allows you to decouple applications and processes.\nAmazon Aurora is a relational database service that is based on MySQL and PostgreSQL.\nAWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.\nI hope this helps!
