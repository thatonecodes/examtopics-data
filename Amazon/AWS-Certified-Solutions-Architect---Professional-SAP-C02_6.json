The company uses a third-party security tool to monitor the inbound traffic to the application. The company has used the security tool for the last 15 years, and the tool has no cloud solutions available from its vendor. The company's security team is concerned about how to integrate the security tool with AWS technology.\n\nThe company plans to deploy the application migration to AWS on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances will run in an Auto Scaling group in a dedicated VPC. The company needs to use the security tool to inspect all packets that come in and out of the VPC. This inspection must occur in real time and must not affect the application's performance.

Aurora has a built-in, fault-tolerant storage system that can automatically detect and repair failures. Additionally, Aurora has a feature called \"Aurora Global Database\" which allows you to create read-only replicas across multiple AWS regions which can further help to reduce the failover time.\n\nCreating an Aurora replica can also help to reduce the failover time as it can take over as the primary DB instance in case of a failure.\n\nUsing RDS proxy can also help to reduce the failover time as it can route the queries to the healthy DB instance, it also helps to balance the load across multiple DB instances.","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"masetromain","content":"Selected Answer: BCF\nThe correct answer is B, C and F.\n\nUsing Amazon ElastiCache for Redis in front of the database (Option B) will help to reduce the failover time by caching the frequently-used data, so that it can be quickly served from the cache rather than having to be retrieved from the database during a failover.\n\nUsing RDS Proxy in front of the database (Option C) will help to reduce the failover time by managing the connections to the RDS DB instance, so that it can quickly route traffic to the new primary instance during a failover.\n\nCreating an RDS for MySQL read replica (Option F) will help to reduce the failover time by having a read-only copy of the database running in parallel with the primary instance, so that it can take over as the primary instance in the event of a failover.\n\nOption A and D are not relevant in this case as the question is asking specifically about reducing failover time for an RDS for MySQL database.","comment_id":"777809","timestamp":"1673880960.0","comments":[{"poster":"spd","timestamp":"1676329860.0","content":"C, D and E Correct","comment_id":"807902","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"poster":"zhangyu20000","comment_id":"777696","content":"CDE are correct","timestamp":"1673875560.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"answers_community":["CDE (91%)","9%"],"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"name":"AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional SAP-C02","isImplemented":true,"id":33,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Amazon","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":529,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":6},"__N_SSP":true}
