Enable API caching in API Gateway can help the company enhance the responsiveness of the APIs. By enabling caching, API Gateway stores the responses from the API and returns them for subsequent requests instead of forwarding the requests to Lambda. This reduces the number of requests to Lambda, improves API performance, and reduces latency for users.","timestamp":"1683376200.0","poster":"Bibay","upvote_count":"29"},{"timestamp":"1734773280.0","comment_id":"1329902","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA) Cached data reduces calls to the backend (in this case, Lambda) and serves responses directly from the cache.

Caching is the general solution to improve performance of non-frequently change data. (in this case, daily, not really frequent)\nB. interface endpoint is a VPC concept, in this architect we don't need to concern with VPC. For those who are interested, go check with interface endpoint and gateway endpoint.\nC. CORS is short for cross origin resource share. it is a distractor here. You may consider CORS when your client cannot access to your API Gateway resource, not when you want to improve the performance.\nD. usage plan is used when your API client's behaviour is predictable, and it can avoid anormal usage."},{"content":"A-> Caching frequently accessed api calls allows reducing process time every time api is called. \n\nB-> You shloud configure VPC if you want to change network security of your application.

Use Amazon CloudFront with signed URLs for Amazon S3.\n\nUsing Amazon CloudFront with signed URLs is a secure and cost-effective way to control access to downloads.

This provides both security and control over access.\n\nOption B (Create a dedicated Amazon CloudFront Distribution for each customer) may result in higher costs and increased complexity.
