You can add other information to the segment document as annotations and metadata. Annotations and metadata are aggregated at the trace level, and can be added to any segment or subsegment.\n\nAnnotations are simple key-value pairs that are indexed for use with filter expressions. Use annotations to record data that you want to use to group traces in the console, or when calling the GetTraceSummaries API.\n\nX-Ray indexes up to 50 annotations per trace.\n\nMetadata are key-value pairs with values of any type, including objects and lists, but that are not indexed. Use metadata to record data you want to store in the trace but don't need to use for searching traces.\n\nYou can view annotations and metadata in the segment or subsegment details in the X-Ray console."},{"comment_id":"998478","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Paul_101","timestamp":"1693825500.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI also believe its A based on this link.

I am doing the practice exam on the aws skill builder site. it has this same question, and the reasoning behind D is - A custom CodeBuild image is a Docker image that you create with everything you need to build and test a project. When a developer builds the application, CodeBuild will retrieve the Docker image from the container registry that the project configuration specifies. CodeBuild will use the environment to compile source code, run tests, and package an application. There is no need to download the packages from anywhere upon each build.
