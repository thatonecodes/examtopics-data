AWS KMS generates this event on a best-effort basis.\"\n\"When you schedule deletion of a KMS key, AWS KMS enforces a waiting period before deleting the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key and sends a KMS CMK Deletion event to EventBridge. AWS KMS guarantees this EventBridge event.\"\nBecause there is no guarantee for the CMK Rotation event in EventBridge, it is better to use CloudTrail instead of EventBridge.","timestamp":"1722700260.0","poster":"DAAJ"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720437300.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHere's how this approach works:\n\nEnable AWS CloudTrail in each production account and configure it to capture KMS events. This ensures that all KMS-related events, including CMK deletion or rotation, are logged.\n\nConfigure CloudTrail to send the KMS logs to an Amazon S3 bucket that is managed by the Security team. This allows centralized access and management of the logs.\n\nBy implementing this approach, the Security team can collect the KMS event logs from all production accounts and monitor them for any relevant activities related to CMK deletion or rotation.","poster":"albert_kuo","comment_id":"946425"},{"poster":"gulu73","comment_id":"798719","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer","timestamp":"1707126360.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Cyril_the_Squirl","timestamp":"1667683380.0","comments":[{"content":"event bus is feature of EventBridge, not CloudWatch Events","comment_id":"532039","poster":"juraj666","timestamp":"1674642660.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"433523","content":"B is correct.\nAll events are sent to cloudwatch using default event bus, with event bridge you can create a custom bus and a rule that selects the events youâ€™re interested in, use your event is as the destination."},{"poster":"ahaffar","timestamp":"1667176320.0","comment_id":"382312","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/understanding-kms-entries.html\ni believe it could be C\nCloudTrail supports the above KMS events"},{"poster":"saki0915","content":"I recommend B.\nC can also achieve its purpose, but it also includes unnecessary logs other than rotation and deletion. \nB can only get the events it needs.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/kms/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1666605480.0","comment_id":"279078","comments":[{"content":"To track data encryption events as well, C is a better answer.","comment_id":"292256","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kenkct","timestamp":"1666760220.0"}]},{"timestamp":"1666227600.0","poster":"abhishek_m_86","content":"C.
