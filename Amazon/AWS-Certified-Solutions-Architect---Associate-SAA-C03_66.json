The lifecycle hook can be used to delay instance termination until the script has completed, ensuring that all data is sent to the audit system before the instance is terminated. This solution is more efficient than using a scheduled AWS Lambda function, which would require running the function periodically and may not capture all instances launched and terminated within the interval.
