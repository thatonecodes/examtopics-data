High availability: By leveraging multiple regions and latency-based routing, the application can provide high availability and improved performance for users across different locations.\n\nb. Low latency: Serving user content through CloudFront and using local DynamoDB tables for user preferences ensures low-latency access, providing a responsive user experience.\n\nc. Scalability: The architecture can scale horizontally by adding more ELBs in each region and leveraging the scalability of DynamoDB and SQS to handle increasing traffic and user demand.\n\nd. Cost-effective: Storing user content in S3 and utilizing DynamoDB for user preferences can provide a cost-effective solution compared to managing infrastructure and databases in multiple regions.\n\nIn conclusion, option A is the recommended choice for providing a highly available design for the social media site, leveraging multiple regions, and addressing the latency-sensitive requirements while maintaining cost efficiency."},{"timestamp":"1672002300.0","comment_id":"756008","poster":"TigerInTheCloud","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSNS and SWF are not fit into this scenario, so B and D can be eliminated first.\nC With 'S3 copy API to multiple regions', which is not necessary with CloudFront, it is less preferred than A.
