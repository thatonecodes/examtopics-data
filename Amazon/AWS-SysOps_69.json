While it is a valid scaling option, it is not supported by Auto Scaling itself, as Auto Scaling's main purpose is to automate the scaling process based on predefined rules and metrics.","comment_id":"932057"},{"content":"Correct Answer: A","poster":"TroyMcLure","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1666021440.0","comment_id":"372043"},{"poster":"awscertified","timestamp":"1663950480.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"A.

This is achieved through the concept of health checks.\n\nAuto Scaling regularly monitors the health of the instances it manages by performing health checks. The health check mechanism determines if an instance is considered healthy or unhealthy based on predefined criteria, such as the response to a specific network request.\n\nIf an instance fails the health check and is deemed unhealthy, Auto Scaling takes action to replace it.
