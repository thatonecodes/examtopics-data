AWS Managed Services provide fully managed, highly available, and scalable infrastructure services. These services are designed to offload the operational responsibilities of provisioning, running, and scaling the infrastructure. This will allow the IT team to focus on higher-value tasks such as application development, while AWS takes care of the underlying infrastructure. Managed services can include Amazon RDS, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS and many others.","comment_id":"781420"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
