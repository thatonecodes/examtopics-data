For example, your API quota might be 5.000 calls per month. Remember that this could be combined with a rate limit or throttling setup e.g. 20 TPS (Transactions per Second).\n\nWhat is throttling in AWS API gateway?\nAWS throttling limits are applied across all accounts and clients in a region. These limit settings exist to prevent your API—and your account—from being overwhelmed by too many requests. These limits are set by AWS and can't be changed by a customer.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-usage-plans-with-console.html#api-gateway-usage-plan-create\nChoose Enable quota, and set specify a value (for example, 5000) for a selected time interval (for example, Month).","poster":"DrCloud","comments":[{"comment_id":"804967","poster":"pancman","timestamp":"1676087160.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"This is great info.
