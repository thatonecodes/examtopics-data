To improve the user experience, Global Accelerator directs user traffic to the application endpoint that is nearest to the client, which reduces internet latency and jitter. Global Accelerator routes traffic to the closest edge location by using Anycast, and then routes it to the closest regional endpoint over the AWS global network. Global Accelerator quickly reacts to changes in network performance to improve your usersâ€™ application performance.\n\"\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-benefits-of-migrating.html","timestamp":"1718130420.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"seetpt","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree with D","timestamp":"1709889300.0","comment_id":"1168684"}],"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-03-05 23:01:00","topic":"1","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Create additional NLBs and EC2 instances in other Regions where the company has large customer bases.","D":"Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator.
