WAF\n\nThe service that can meet those requirements is WAF.Yes it will be installed on the ALB,but that is not mentioned in the question.The ALB will do its load balancing and security for it is only set at the security group level,it does not not act as a firewall for yuur EC2 instances but rather a load balancer, which is its purpose.It is tricky the way they asked but the FAQS assured me this is the right answer\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/waf/faqs/","poster":"MFDOOM","timestamp":"1666314660.0"},{"content":"When a load balancer receives an HTTP request, it checks for malformed requests and for the length of the method. The total method length in an HTTP request to a load balancer must not exceed 127 characters. If the HTTP request passes both checks, the load balancer sends the request to the EC2 instance. If the method field in the request is malformed, the load balancer responds with an HTTP 400: BAD_REQUEST error. If the length of the method in the request exceeds 127 characters, the load balancer responds with an HTTP 405: METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED error.\n\nD","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"186056","poster":"firstabed","timestamp":"1666120920.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"JGD","timestamp":"1665673080.0","comment_id":"151835","comments":[{"poster":"JGD","content":"I'm taking my words.
