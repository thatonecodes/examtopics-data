Automatically scale to meet demand: This principle ensures that your system can handle fluctuations in workload by automatically adjusting resources to match demand. By scaling resources dynamically, you can maintain performance and availability during periods of increased traffic or demand, thus enhancing the reliability of your application.\n\nE. Automatically recover from failure: This principle emphasizes designing systems that can recover from failures automatically without manual intervention. Implementing automated recovery mechanisms such as auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and fault-tolerant architectures helps ensure that your application remains resilient in the face of failures, thereby improving reliability."},{"comment_id":"1098197","poster":"Gil_Rosenberg","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1702733160.0","content":"A.
