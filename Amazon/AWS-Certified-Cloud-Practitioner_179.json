Elasticity is automatically scaling up or down resources to meet user demands. \nThe key difference between scalability and elasticity is the level of automation. Scalability requires manual intervention, while elasticity is completely automated. This means scalability requires more effort to manage resources, while elasticity can scale with minimal effort.\"\n\nFrom context of this question itself, I tend to opt for A.
