They are associated with instances and operate at the instance level. You can configure security group rules to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, port ranges, and protocols.\n\n Network ACLs: Are an additional layer of security for your VPC. They operate at the subnet level and are stateless, meaning they evaluate rules for inbound and outbound traffic separately. Network ACLs can be used to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, port ranges, and protocols.\n\n Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs: Capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a VPC. While they provide visibility into network traffic, they don't block or control traffic.\n\n Amazon CloudWatch: A monitoring service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources. It is not used for blocking network traffic to an instance.\n\n AWS CloudTrail: Provides a record of actions taken by users, roles, or services within an AWS account.
