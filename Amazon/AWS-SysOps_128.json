Create a script by using the AWS CLI to automatically apply tags to existing resources to each department. Schedule the script to run weekly. Tagging resources can help you organize them according to your business needs. By tagging resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run scripts to tag resources after creation. You can also use cost allocation tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure.\n\nE. Create a Budget from the Billing and Cost Management console.
