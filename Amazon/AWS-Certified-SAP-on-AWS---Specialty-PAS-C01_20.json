Synchronous replication ensures that data is written to the primary and secondary database simultaneously, providing near-zero RPO.\n\nHaving the instances in separate Availability Zones within the same AWS region ensures high availability and fault tolerance without the latencies that would be incurred if the instances were in separate regions.","poster":"kaishin0527","comment_id":"969907","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1690963200.0"},{"timestamp":"1690044420.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC \n\nThink about HIGH latency when deploying multi-region","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"959701"},{"content":"I think its C.","timestamp":"1688473020.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"942736","poster":"tatarevick"}],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":96,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A company wants to deploy SAP BW/4HANA on AWS.
