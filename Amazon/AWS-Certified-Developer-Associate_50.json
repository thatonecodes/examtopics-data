Call sam package to create the deployment package. Call sam deploy to deploy the package afterward.\nE. Create a ZIP package and upload it to Amazon S3. Call aws cloudformation create-stack to create the application.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is a framework for building serverless applications. It uses AWS CloudFormation to define the infrastructure as code and provides shorthand syntax to simplify the definition of AWS resources. To deploy a serverless application with AWS SAM, you can use the following steps:\n\nPackage the AWS SAM application using the sam package command. This command will package the source code and its dependencies into a deployment package and upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nDeploy the AWS SAM application using the sam deploy command. This command will create or update the CloudFormation stack that represents your application and its resources.","poster":"dp8719823","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1676533140.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nCertainly A,B","comment_id":"810378","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MMaquis"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nAB is the one","poster":"hb0011","timestamp":"1674240240.0","comment_id":"782661"},{"timestamp":"1674219720.0","poster":"BobAWS23","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"782247","content":"AAABBB"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nnot sure about E but B is correct because, \n\nThe sam package command zips your code artifacts, uploads them to Amazon S3, and produces a packaged AWS SAM template file that's ready to be used.
