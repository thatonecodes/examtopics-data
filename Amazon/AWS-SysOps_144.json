You can then use StackSet operations to deploy and manage the stack instances across the desired AWS accounts.\n\nStackSets also provide features like drift detection, allowing you to detect any configuration changes or drift in the deployed stacks, and stack instance operations, enabling you to create, update, or delete stack instances in an account.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"albert_kuo"},{"timestamp":"1666387200.0","poster":"RicardoD","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"362295","content":"D is the answer"},{"content":"D.

As my understanding, for a CMK it can be created by AWS-generated key material / import your own key material / create the key material in the AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with an AWS KMS custom key store. No matter which one, it can be either customer managed or AWS managed. On the other hand, for \"automatic key rotation\", it can happen on both customer managed or AWS managed CMKs, the difference is that one is optional for each 1 year and the other is required for each 3 years. Therefore, based on the description on this question, I took it as the SysOps is using a customer managed CMK (that's why he/she \"wants\" to rotate the key), so he/she just need to enable automatic key rotation via console or KMS API without creating a new CMK (especially it mentioned to ensure that the EBS volume encrypted with the \"current key\" remains readable ).\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#rotate-keys-how-it-works","comment_id":"429375","poster":"ZL23"},{"content":"C is correct , \nThe question say AWS-generated key material .. and customer managed CMK can be generated by material provided by aws or by importing material .. \ndon't confuse it with AWS managed CMK which have rotation only each 3 years ..","comment_id":"339840","timestamp":"1666934940.0","poster":"Kimle","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"C.
