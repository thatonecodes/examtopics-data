Increase the size of the current instance type: By increasing the size of the current instance type, you provide more CPU resources to handle the increased workload. This will help alleviate the CPU credit exhaustion and improve the overall performance of the web application.\n\nD. Configure a CloudWatch alarm on the CPU credits metric: By configuring a CloudWatch alarm on the CPU credits metric, you can set up automated notifications or actions when the CPU credits drop to a certain threshold. This will help you proactively monitor and manage the CPU credits usage, allowing you to take necessary steps to prevent depletion and ensure optimal performance of the web application.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1043102","poster":"albert_kuo","content":"T2 instances (Option A): While T2 instances are burstable and come with CPU credits, they might not provide sustained performance if your application has a steady increase in traffic over time.
