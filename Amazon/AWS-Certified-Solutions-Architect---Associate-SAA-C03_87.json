By configuring DAX for the new messages table, read requests for the table will be served from the DAX cache, significantly reducing the latency.\n\nMinimal Application Changes: With DAX, the application code can be updated to use the DAX endpoint instead of the standard DynamoDB endpoint. This change is relatively minimal and does not require extensive modifications to the application's data access logic.\n\nLow Latency: DAX caches frequently accessed data in memory, allowing subsequent read requests for the same data to be served with minimal latency. This ensures that new messages can be read by users with minimal delay.","comments":[{"comment_id":"901390","content":"Option B (Add DynamoDB read replicas) involves creating read replicas to handle the increased read load, but it may not directly address the requirement of minimizing latency for new message reads.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"cloudenthusiast","timestamp":"1700333520.0"}]},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Efren","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1116919","timestamp":"1720458300.0","content":"Yes it's tricky but least code changes is the tie breaker.
