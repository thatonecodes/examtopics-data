In simple terms, imagine you rented a storage unit to store your stuff. Even if you don’t visit the unit, you still have to pay rent because your stuff is still there. It’s the same with EBS volumes. Even if your EC2 instance is stopped, your data is still stored in the EBS volume, so you’re charged for it.\n\nElastic IP addresses are like phone numbers for your computer on the internet. They don’t change, even if you turn off your computer. Since AWS has a limited number of these addresses, they want to encourage people to release them when they’re not in use. So, if your computer (or EC2 instance) is off, but the Elastic IP address is still linked to it, you’ll get charged.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1703502060.0","comment_id":"1105196","poster":"YSJ_VIT"}],"poster":"Ikki77","upvote_count":"17","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D.

However, there are certain components and services associated with EC2 instances that could still incur charges even when the instances are stopped. Two possible causes for continued charges are:\n\nA. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage charges: If you have EBS volumes attached to your stopped EC2 instances, you may still incur charges for the storage associated with those volumes. EBS volumes are billed separately from EC2 instances and are persistent, so they continue to accumulate charges even when the instances are stopped.\n\nD. Elastic IP charges: If you have associated Elastic IP addresses with your EC2 instances, these addresses may incur charges when they are not associated with a running instance. Elastic IP addresses are billed if they are not attached to a running EC2 instance, and this can result in charges even when the instance is stopped.","timestamp":"1693930560.0"},{"comment_id":"966162","poster":"Pranava_GCP","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1690612020.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA.

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage charges\nD. Elastic IP charges\n\nWhen a company stops an Amazon EC2 instances, the instance is no longer running and therefore no longer consuming CPU or memory resources. However, other resources that are associated with the instance continue to incur charges. One of the resources that may still incur charges even when the instances are stopped is Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage charges. EBS storage is charged hourly and continue to incur charges as long as the data is stored.\n\nAnother resource that may still incur charges is Elastic IP addresses. Elastic IP addresses are charged on an hourly basis even if you don't actively use them, and If you allocate an Elastic IP address but don't associate it with a running instance or a network interface, you'll incur charges for it.","poster":"NotMeAnyWay"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nAD ---------","comment_id":"733126","timestamp":"1669931280.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"dark_cherrymon"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"726583","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D.","poster":"Zonci","timestamp":"1669369260.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nfor me A & D","timestamp":"1669043340.0","comment_id":"723677","poster":"gabbani72","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D.","poster":"SLEON01","timestamp":"1668702660.0","comment_id":"720648","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"JA2018","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1668644940.0","comment_id":"720097","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nshould ve a and D.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-billing-terminated/\n\nYou terminated your instances, but you still have EC2 resources provisioned to your account\n\nThe Elastic Compute Cloud line item in your bill includes resources other than instances.
