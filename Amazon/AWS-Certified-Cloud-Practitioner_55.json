Spot Instances\n\nSpot Instances is an AWS pricing model that enables customers to bid on spare Amazon EC2 capacity and potentially save up to 90% on the cost of running their workloads. Spot Instances are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted, such as big data, containers, CI/CD, and batch processing. These workloads can take advantage of the low cost and high availability of Spot Instances.\n\nCapacity Reservations is a feature that allows you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances, which may reduce the costs associated with running those instances, but it's not as cost-effective as Spot Instances.\nAmazon Lightsail is a service that simplifies web hosting and management of web applications, but it may not be a good fit for the company's workloads.\nDedicated Hosts is a service that allows you to run Amazon EC2 instances on dedicated physical servers, which can be useful in certain compliance scenarios but it will not provide the greatest cost savings.","timestamp":"1674325500.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","comment_id":"783644"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: C\nVote for C","timestamp":"1671744300.0","poster":"Ivy0o0","comment_id":"753646"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\n#7 Use Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to reduce EC2 costs\n\nIf your workload is fault-tolerant, use Spot instances to reduce costs by up to 90%.
