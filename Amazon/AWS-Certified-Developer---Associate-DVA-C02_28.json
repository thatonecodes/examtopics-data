Retry the call with exponential backoff is the recommended best practice in this scenario. Exponential backoff is a standard error-handling strategy for network applications in which the client progressively increases the wait time between retries, up to a maximum number of retries, when a request fails due to server-side throttling. This approach helps to smooth out the rate of API calls, reducing the likelihood of hitting the rate limit."},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1714464780.0","content":"D.

This is critical for maintaining the order of ticket requests.\n\nSQS FIFO Queues: By having two separate FIFO queues for inventory management and payment processing, the application can process these aspects in parallel while still maintaining the order integrity. The FIFO nature of the queues ensures that if a seat is sold more than once, the first order received is processed first.\n\nOrder Processing Logic: With this setup, if the first order is rejected during payment processing, the second order can be processed next.

This option isn't available.\n\nThe next best option would be Option B. Better than A, since you won't be charged for an order where seating isn't available.\n\nIf I am wrong, please explain it.
