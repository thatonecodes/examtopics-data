Amazon API Gateway can efficiently manage the REST endpoint and offers built-in caching capabilities to reduce the number of requests to the backend Lambda function, further optimizing costs. This setup also leverages the serverless model, reducing the operational overhead and cost associated with provisioning and managing servers.","timestamp":"1724780460.0","poster":"SerialiDr"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nyes B is correct","poster":"a5fc516","timestamp":"1722927420.0","comment_id":"1141977","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1708704420.0","comment_id":"988387","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the cost-effective one.","poster":"hmdev"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/109210-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c02-topic-1/","isMC":true},{"id":"L6adHb7ufctOOBE3WzZh","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1683547320,"timestamp":"2023-05-08 14:02:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1332016","content":"Selected Answer: A\nB) Eliminated - Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) designed for distributing static and dynamic content globally.\n\nC) Eliminated - it is not designed for low-latency use cases like session management.\n\nD) Eliminated - it is not highly scalable, as it ties user sessions to specific servers, which can lead to uneven load distribution and scaling issues.","timestamp":"1735233000.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"sumanshu"},{"poster":"Saudis","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is Correct, the store the session state is a key word","timestamp":"1726202040.0","comment_id":"1283003","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1716406740.0","comment_id":"1215971","upvote_count":"2","poster":"65703c1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer."},{"comment_id":"1160940","poster":"SerialiDr","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAmazon ElastiCache is a high-performance, in-memory data store that provides sub-millisecond latency to applications. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets, making it suitable for storing session state data. ElastiCache offers both Redis and Memcached engines, with Redis providing more advanced data structures and features such as persistence, replication, and transaction support. This solution is fault-tolerant and highly scalable, ensuring that any service interruption does not affect the user experience.","timestamp":"1709063460.0"},{"poster":"Phongsanth","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1687686000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI vote A\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/elasticache-as-an-asp-net-session-store/","comment_id":"933427"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1684044120.0","poster":"loctong","comment_id":"897297","content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe answer came from the discussion at https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/8789-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-1-question-176/"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/8789-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-1-question-176/","comment_id":"892125","timestamp":"1683547320.0","poster":"zodraz"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","question_text":"An e-commerce web application that shares session state on-premises is being migrated to AWS.
