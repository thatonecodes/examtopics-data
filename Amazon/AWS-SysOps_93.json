Each statement is structured as follows:\nEffect: The effect can be Allow or Deny. By default, IAM users don't have permission to use re-sources and API actions, so all requests are denied. An explicit allow overrides the default. An ex-plicit deny overrides any allows.\nAction: The action is the specific API action for which you are granting or denying permission.\nResource: The resource that's affected by the action. With many Elastic Load Balancing API ac-tions, you can restrict the permissions granted or denied to a specific load balancer by specifying its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in this statement. Otherwise, you can use the * wildcard to specify all of your load balancers.\nCondition: You can optionally use conditions to control when your policies in effect.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingIAM.html","exam_id":36,"timestamp":"2020-07-19 10:41:00","unix_timestamp":1595148060,"answers_community":[],"question_id":462,"question_text":"You have set up an IAM policy for your users to access Elastic Load Balancers and you know that an IAM policy is a JSON document that consists of one or more statements.
