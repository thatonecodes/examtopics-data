A transit gateway enables you to attach VPCs and VPN connections in the same Region and route traffic between them. A transit gateway works across AWS accounts, and you can use AWS RAM to share your transit gateway with other accounts 1.\n\nTo meet the network security policy that requires all traffic between any two VPCs to be transparently inspected by a third-party appliance, you can deploy two clusters that consist of multiple appliances across multiple Availability Zones in a designated inspection VPC. You can connect the inspection VPC to the transit gateway by using a VPC attachment. Then create a target group and register the appliances with the target group. After that, you can create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and set it up to forward to the newly created target group.
