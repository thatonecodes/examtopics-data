A rule specifies which events to send to which targets for processing. A single rule can send an event to multiple targets, which then run in parallel. There are two types of rules: rules that match on event data as events are delivered, and rules that run on a defined schedule. In addition, certain AWS services may create and manage rules in your account as well.\n\nAmazon EventBridge rule that match on event data - match against incoming events based on event data criteria,an event pattern.
