However, throttling can occur if you exceed double your previous peak within 30 minutes. For example, if your application’s traffic pattern varies between 25,000 and 50,000 strongly consistent reads per second where 50,000 reads per second is the previously reached traffic peak, DynamoDB recommends spacing your traffic growth over at least 30 minutes before driving more than 100,000 reads per second.","poster":"Amitst","timestamp":"1678822260.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1668014280.0","comment_id":"714762","content":"On-demand mode is a good option if any of the following are true:\n\nYou create new tables with unknown workloads.\n\nYou have unpredictable application traffic.\n\nYou prefer the ease of paying for only what you use.","poster":"mrgreatness"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIts 100% C as per AWS documentation. \nRead <Peak traffic and scaling properties> section in below link\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html#HowItWorks.OnDemand","poster":"nsvijay04b1","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"706249","timestamp":"1666943640.0"},{"timestamp":"1666275240.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ni_yot","content":"yeah i'd go for C as well.
