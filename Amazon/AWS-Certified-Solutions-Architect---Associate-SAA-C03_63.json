Use an interface endpoint.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n Interface Endpoint (Option B): An interface endpoint (also known as VPC endpoint) allows communication between resources in your VPC and services without traversing the public internet. In this case, you can create an interface endpoint for API Gateway in your VPC. This enables the communication between the BuyStock and CheckFunds RESTful web services within the VPC, and it doesn't require significant changes to the code.\n\n X-API-Key header (Option A): Adding an X-API-Key header for authorization doesn't address the issue of ensuring that the APIs communicate through the VPC.
