Right size services based on capacity requirements\n\n\"Right sizing is the most effective way to control cloud costs. It involves continually analyzing instance performance and usage needs and patterns—and then turning off idle instances and right sizing instances that are either overprovisioned or poorly matched to the workload. Because your resource needs are always changing, right sizing must become an ongoing process to continually achieve cost optimization.\"\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/right-sizing/","timestamp":"1691667120.0","poster":"Pranava_GCP","comment_id":"977574","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1674517440.0","poster":"Saif93","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the answer.","comment_id":"785978"},{"comment_id":"784065","timestamp":"1674374580.0","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Right size services based on capacity requirements\n\nOne of the cost efficiency principles related to the AWS Cloud is to right-size services based on capacity requirements. This means that you should choose the appropriate instance type and size for your workload, and adjust it as needed, to ensure that you are not over- or under-provisioning resources. This can help you to minimize costs and optimize performance.","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"775672","timestamp":"1673712180.0","poster":"Meeso","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html\n\nUnder Tagging AWS resources: \n>> Tags for cost allocation : \nAWS Cost Explorer and detailed billing reports let you break down AWS costs by tag. Typically, you use business tags such as cost center/business unit, customer, or project to associate AWS costs with traditional cost-allocation dimensions.
