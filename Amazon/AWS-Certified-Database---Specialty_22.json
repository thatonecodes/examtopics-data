Configure the application and reports to connect to the cluster endpoint.\n\nBy creating a read replica of the DB instance and directing the reporting dashboard to connect to the replica, the application can continue to read and write data to the primary DB instance without impacting the performance of the reporting dashboard. The read replica can handle the additional read-only load from the reporting dashboard, improving overall performance. By configuring the application and reports to connect to the cluster endpoint, the load can be distributed across the primary DB instance and the read replica.
