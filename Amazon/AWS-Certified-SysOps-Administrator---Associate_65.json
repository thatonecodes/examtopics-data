In the event of a failure in one AZ, the remaining two AZs can continue to serve the application without performance degradation.\n\nLoad Distribution: With 6 instances in each of the 3 AZs, the application maintains a total of 18 instances. This setup exceeds the minimum requirement of 12 instances, ensuring that even if one AZ fails, there are still 12 instances available (6 in each of the remaining two AZs) to handle the load without performance issues.\n\nFewest Running Instances: This solution provides a balance between high availability and cost-efficiency.
