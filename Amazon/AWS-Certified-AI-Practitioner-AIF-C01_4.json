In this case, the labeled images of animals (input) and their corresponding categories (output) make supervised learning the ideal approach. The model learns from these examples to classify new, unseen images into the correct categories.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nB: Unsupervised learning:\nUnsupervised learning does not use labeled data and is typically used for clustering or pattern discovery.
