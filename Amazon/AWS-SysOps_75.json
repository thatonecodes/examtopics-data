The agent supports both Windows Server and Linux, and enables you to select the metrics to be collected, including sub-resource metrics such as per-CPU core. We recommend that you use the agent to collect metrics and logs instead of using the deprecated monitoring scripts.\"","comment_id":"372134","poster":"TroyMcLure"}],"topic":"1","exam_id":36,"question_text":"Can you use CloudWatch to monitor memory and disk utilization usage for your Amazon EC2 Linux instances?","question_id":371,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"C":"It is possible only on Linux EC2 instances using the CloudWatch Monitoring scripts for Linux.","A":"CloudWatch can only measure memory usage.","B":"CloudWatch can only collect memory and disk usage metrics when an instance is running.","D":"CloudWatch can only measure disk usage."},"answer":"C","answer_description":"Using the Cloudwatch Monitoring scripts for Linux, you can measure memory and disk usage of your Linux EC2 instances.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/mon-scripts.html","timestamp":"2020-07-02 09:26:00","answers_community":[]},{"id":"wP4EpetMqmmA5N18qj8H","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/113148-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-434-discussion/","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"5","B":"6","C":"4","A":"7"},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nCooldown prevents from launching or terminating before effects of previous activities are visible","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733448000.0","poster":"dexdinh91","comment_id":"1088924"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"988960","timestamp":"1724485080.0","poster":"Tapkar","content":"Correct answer is B.\nThe cool down period is the time difference between the end of one scaling activity (can be start or terminate) and the start of another one (can be start or terminate). \nThus, after auto-scaling was triggered for the first time, it added one instance, giving us six instances in total.
