Now, with a simple API call, you have an out-of-band method to trigger a kernel panic (blue screen error in case of Windows operating system) for an EC2 instance. You can use this capability to direct the operating system to perform tasks like creating a crash dump, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace.
