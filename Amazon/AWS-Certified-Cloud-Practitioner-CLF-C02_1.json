The correct answer revolves around the 10-day free use period (A) and other key processes that don’t incur charges, like transferring data from the appliance into S3 (C). I remember this being clearly explained in the examforusre.com guide, which detailed how AWS billing works for Snowball devices. The pro version broke down these activities step by step, making it much easier to grasp.
