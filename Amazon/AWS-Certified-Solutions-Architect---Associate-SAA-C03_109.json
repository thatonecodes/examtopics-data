If you want to use a third-party certificate with Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon API Gateway, you may import it into ACM using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or ACM APIs. ACM does not manage the renewal process for imported certificates. You can use the AWS Management Console to monitor the expiration dates of an imported certificates and import a new third-party certificate to replace an expiring one.","comment_id":"1081916","poster":"numark","timestamp":"1701114360.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"TariqKipkemei","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt's 22/Nov/2023 and from the console you cant create a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) that is signed by the third-party CA.
