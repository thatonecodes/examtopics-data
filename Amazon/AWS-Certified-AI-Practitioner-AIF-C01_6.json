Human-in-the-loop\n\nExplanation:\n\nHuman-in-the-loop (HITL) is a technique used in the post-processing stage of the machine learning lifecycle to improve model performance, including reducing bias and toxicity. In HITL, human evaluators intervene to assess and refine model outputs. This feedback loop helps to identify and correct biases, toxic language, or other undesirable outputs before they are presented to end-users.

Include more diverse training data. Fine-tune the model again by using the new data.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe issue of bias in the loan approval model likely arises from the model being trained on data that does not sufficiently represent all demographics. To address this, the bank should augment the training dataset with more diverse data to ensure that the model can learn to make fair and equitable decisions across different demographics. After incorporating the more diverse training data, the bank can fine-tune the model again to adjust its behavior and reduce any biases identified during the audit.","poster":"aws_Tamilan"}],"topic":"1","answer_images":[]},{"id":"9mrRuZp4QObcrPSBLpiF","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nA company has developed a large language model (LLM) and wants to make the LLM available to multiple internal teams.
