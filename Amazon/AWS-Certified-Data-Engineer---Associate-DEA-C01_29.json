The schema is already defined in the SQL Server database, as the created view contains the required structure (columns and data types). AWS Glue can directly connect to the database via JDBC, extract the data, transform it into Parquet format, and store it in S3 without additional steps.\n\nA crawler is useful if you're working with data that doesn't have a predefined schema (e.g., files in S3) or if you need the data to be cataloged for services like Amazon Athena.
