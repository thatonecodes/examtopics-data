With elasticity, your infrastructure can scale in (reduce resources) or scale out (increase resources) as needed to handle fluctuations in traffic, workload, or demand. This helps ensure optimal performance, cost efficiency, and responsiveness to varying levels of usage.","comment_id":"932053","timestamp":"1719190380.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"67988","upvote_count":"2","poster":"awscertified","content":"B.
