Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning and S3 Object Lock enabled.\n\nS3 Versioning allows multiple versions of an object to be stored in the same bucket. This means that when an object is modified or deleted, the previous version is preserved. S3 Object Lock adds additional protection by allowing objects to be placed under a legal hold or retention period, during which they cannot be deleted or modified.
