It is a straightforward way for users to launch instances with pre-configured templates for common use cases, making it easy to get started without the need for extensive AWS expertise.\n\nTherefore, for the specific requirements of using pre-configured instances and application stacks, Amazon Lightsail (Option A) is the most suitable choice.","timestamp":"1720445220.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nLightsail is the most suitable choice:\n\n-Pre-configured Instances and Application Stacks: Lightsail offers a wide range of pre-configured instances with popular software stacks already installed and ready to use","comment_id":"1110676","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1719754200.0","poster":"Jay_K"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAmazon Lightsail can deploy application stacks. For instance, you can deploy a LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack application onto a single Lightsail instance 1.

Spot Instances\nFor stateless, fault-tolerant workloads that can handle interruptions and have short durations, using Spot Instances is a cost-effective option. Spot Instances allow you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at a potentially lower price than On-Demand Instances. However, Spot Instances can be terminated if the capacity is needed by On-Demand or Reserved Instances customers.\n\nGiven the nature of the company's workload, where thousands of simulations are run simultaneously and each simulation is stateless, fault-tolerant, and runs for up to 3 hours, Spot Instances would be a suitable choice.
