Cost of data center operations: Running and maintaining an on-premises data center can be expensive due to various factors like power, cooling, space, and personnel required to manage the data center facility. With AWS Cloud, the company can use the shared infrastructure and pay-as-you-go pricing model, which eliminates the need to operate and maintain a data center.\n\nD. Cost of physical server hardware: On-premises IT infrastructure requires purchasing and maintaining physical server hardware. With AWS Cloud, the company can use virtualized instances provided by AWS, and the underlying hardware is managed by AWS. This reduces the need for upfront hardware purchases and maintenance costs.","timestamp":"1689919860.0"},{"content":"A &D correct","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1681668840.0","poster":"RS16","comment_id":"872023"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\na & d are the best answers","timestamp":"1680810180.0","poster":"studynoplay","comment_id":"863277","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"et_learner","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1679468520.0","comment_id":"846758","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nCorrect"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nThe two costs that the company will eliminate with this migration are:\n\nA. Cost of data center operations: The company will no longer need to manage and maintain its own data centers, which will eliminate the costs associated with power, cooling, physical security, and other data center operations.\n\nD. Cost of physical server hardware: The company will no longer need to purchase and maintain its own physical server hardware. Instead, it can use the compute resources provided by AWS, such as Amazon EC2 instances, which can be scaled up or down as needed. E. Cost of network management: While migrating to the AWS Cloud may reduce the cost of network management, it is not a guaranteed elimination of this cost. Network management costs can vary depending on the complexity of the network architecture, security requirements, and other factors.","timestamp":"1679109960.0","poster":"Vinayhasija","comment_id":"842443"},{"poster":"enc_0343","comment_id":"795110","timestamp":"1675255620.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nUsing AWS eliminates a need for data centers and physical servers."},{"poster":"Saif93","comment_id":"782588","timestamp":"1674236280.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nAD is the answer.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"content":"You still have a virtual network to manage so you don't fully get rid of that portion in the cloud","poster":"RobertMcD","upvote_count":"6","comments":[{"timestamp":"1676354940.0","poster":"656823","comment_id":"808132","upvote_count":"1","content":"Got it.
