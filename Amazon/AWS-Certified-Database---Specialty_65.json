Fault injection queries are issued as SQL commands to an Amazon Aurora instance and they enable you to schedule a simulated occurrence of one of the following events:\nA crash of a writer or reader DB instance\nA failure of an Aurora Replica\nA disk failure\nDisk congestion\nWhen a fault injection query specifies a crash, it forces a crash of the Aurora DB instance. The other fault injection queries result in simulations of failure events, but don't cause the event to occur. When you submit a fault injection query, you also specify an amount of time for the failure event simulation to occur for.\"","comment_id":"157643","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1633853700.0"},{"timestamp":"1633105860.0","poster":"firbhat","comment_id":"153964","upvote_count":"3","content":"Ans B:\n Two ways to test/simulate fault tolerance • Manual failover\n• Fault injection queries"},{"content":"will go with B","timestamp":"1632428520.0","comment_id":"153915","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Billhardy"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1632259320.0","comment_id":"145883","poster":"BillyC","content":"B is correct"}],"answer":"B"}],"exam":{"name":"AWS Certified Database - Specialty","isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":359,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","provider":"Amazon","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":22},"currentPage":65},"__N_SSP":true}
