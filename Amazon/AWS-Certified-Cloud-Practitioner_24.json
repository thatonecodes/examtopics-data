When components are decoupled, they are not tightly coupled or dependent on each other, allowing for independent upgrades or changes to specific components without affecting the entire system. This provides flexibility and agility in managing and evolving the architecture over time.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"956224","timestamp":"1689743340.0"},{"content":"Answer: B. Ability to upgrade components independently.\n\nDecoupling an AWS Cloud architecture involves breaking up a monolithic system into smaller, independent components that can be upgraded or replaced without affecting the entire system. This results in greater flexibility, scalability, and agility, as well as the ability to use different technologies or services for different components. Decoupling does not necessarily result in reduced latency, decreased costs, or fewer components to manage.","comment_id":"880251","poster":"Madbo","timestamp":"1682420400.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1674186720.0","poster":"Saif93","comment_id":"781843","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer."}],"answer":"B","topic":"1","question_id":118,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/86516-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-204/"},{"id":"xVzzZ7OVQRXkVjJIgBZN","unix_timestamp":1668577200,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Protect the security of the AWS global infrastructure.","D":"Patch Amazon RDS software.","A":"Maintain the security of the hardware that runs Amazon EC2 instances.","B":"Patch the guest operating system of Amazon EC2 instances."},"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/87592-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-205/","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1689743400.0","poster":"man5484","comment_id":"956226","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAccording to the AWS shared responsibility model, the responsibility for patching the guest operating system of Amazon EC2 instances lies with the customer.
