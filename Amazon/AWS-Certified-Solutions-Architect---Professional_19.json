Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.\nBy using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments.\nReference:\nhttp://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/#details","answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"9","poster":"Krish812003","timestamp":"1633460400.0","content":"Answer is A.
