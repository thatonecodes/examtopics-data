CloudFormation provides a way to write the complete infrastructure for an application in a text file, called a template. This describes the resources that need to be created and their configuration. CloudFormation then automates the process of creating, configuring, and managing the resources. Elastic Beanstalk, on the other hand, is an application deployment service and provides an all in one solution for deploying and managing applications. Rather than providing users with control as to how their application will be deployed, Elastic Beanstalk offers a simple solution that requires minimal user input or interference.
