The user measures the weight of some goods every 5 minutes and sends data to AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and tracking.\nWhich of the below mentioned parameters is mandatory for the user to include in the request list?","answer":"B","answer_description":"AWS CloudWatch supports the custom metrics. The user can always capture the custom data and upload the data to CloudWatch using CLI or APIs. The user can publish the data to CloudWatch as single data points or as an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set. The user has always to include the namespace as part of the request. The user can supply a file instead of the metric name. If the user does not supply the time zone, it accepts the current time. If the user is sending the data as a single data point it will have parameters, such as value. However, if the user is sending as an aggregate it will have parameters, such as statistic-values.","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"919635","timestamp":"1733785140.0","poster":"albert_kuo","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-data.html"}],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Namespace","D":"Time zone","C":"Metric Name","A":"Value"},"question_images":[],"exam_id":36,"question_id":176},{"id":"sHdKMD5XtwUjWyJybmQx","answer_description":"Auto Scaling keeps checking the health of the instances at regular intervals and marks the instance for replacement when it is unhealthy.

Once the new instance is up and running and passes the health checks, Auto Scaling then terminates the unhealthy instance. This ensures that there is a healthy instance available before terminating the problematic one, helping to maintain the desired capacity and availability of the application.","poster":"albert_kuo","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"979066"},{"content":"I do not agree with the answer \"D\".
