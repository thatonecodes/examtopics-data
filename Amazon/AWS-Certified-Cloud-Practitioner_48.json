AWS Developer Support\n\nAWS Developer Support is the most cost-effective support plan that provides programmatic case management through the AWS Support API. This plan includes access to the AWS Support API, which allows you to automate case management tasks such as opening and managing cases, and checking the status of your cases. It also includes access to the AWS Trusted Advisor service, which provides best practice recommendations to help optimize your AWS environment.\nAdditionally, you'll get access to online and email support, and a response time of 12 hours during business hours.
