Create an IAM role and attach a policy with the necessary permissions.\n\nThis approach allows the external company to use its own identity provider to authenticate users and access resources in the company's AWS account. By delegating the management of user identities and access to the external company's identity provider, the security officer minimizes the overhead of managing user access directly. The IAM role and policy can be used to grant the necessary permissions to the external company's users, allowing them to perform the required operational tasks while still maintaining control over access to the company's resources.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"760378"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"732073","timestamp":"1669849440.0","poster":"hubekpeter","content":"Selected Answer: B\nD is more suitable if you're configuring federation on organizational level and have many limitations."},{"timestamp":"1661709960.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is an improvement of B.\nAnd yes, of course an AWS policy can be attached to a group.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_attach-policy.html","poster":"sapien45","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"653074"},{"comment_id":"535974","content":"It should be B \n\nTo create a role for identity federation (AWS CLI)\n\nCreate a role: aws iam create-role\n\nAttach a permissions policy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy\n\nor\n\nCreate an inline permissions policy for the role: aws iam put-role-policy\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html","poster":"AliS2020","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1643524020.0"},{"timestamp":"1643215860.0","comment_id":"533073","content":"Using 3rd party identity provider which makes me to go with Cognito, so answer A.","poster":"NSF2","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"I like the option D but I've a problem with the words \"Create an IAM group to map to the identity provider user group\". we map IAM roles to IdP groups not the groups. \nSo the correct option should be A.","poster":"sam_live","timestamp":"1642919580.0","comment_id":"530301","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"You're getting group membership as a claim, so that's exactly what you need to do.
