An AWS Lambda function supports the API and retrieves the data from an Amazon DynamoDB table. The API's latency increases during times of peak usage each day. However, the latency of the DynamoDB table reads is constant throughout the day.\n\nA DevOps engineer configures DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for the DynamoDB table, and the API latency decreases throughout the day. The DevOps engineer then configures Lambda provisioned concurrency with a limit of two concurrent invocations. This change reduces the latency during normal usage. However, the company is still experiencing higher latency during times of peak usage than during times of normal usage.\n\nWhich set of additional steps should the DevOps engineer take to produce the LARGEST decrease in API latency?","answer_images":[],"question_id":81,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1673784360,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/95409-exam-aws-devops-engineer-professional-topic-1-question-171/","timestamp":"2023-01-15 13:06:00"},{"id":"6XaMsqtomBUwgK3T9k6G","choices":{"A":"Use the cfn-signal helper script to signal success or failure to CloudFormation.

The web application consists of an Application Load Balancer (ALB), a target group, a launch template that uses an Amazon Linux 2 AMI, an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances, a security group, and an Amazon RDS for MySOL database. The launch template includes user data that specifies a script to install and start the application.\n\nThe initial deployment of the application was successful. The DevOps engineer made changes to update the version of the application with the user data. The CI/CD pipeline has deployed a new version of the template. However, the health checks on the ALB are now failing. The health checks have marked all targets as unhealthy.\n\nDuring investigation, the DevOps engineer notices that the CloudFormation stack has a status of UPDATE_COMPLETE. However, when the DevOps engineer connects to one of the EC2 instances and checks /var/log/messages, the DevOps engineer notices that the Apache web server failed to start successfully because of a configuration error.\n\nHow can the DevOps engineer ensure that the CloudFormation deployment will fail if the user data fails to successfully finish running?","exam_id":35,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"A is correct.","timestamp":"1674939180.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"791082","poster":"Bulti"},{"timestamp":"1674514560.0","comment_id":"785935","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA for me","upvote_count":"1","poster":"saeidp"},{"timestamp":"1674504360.0","comment_id":"785791","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-signal.html","poster":"DerekKey","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"776496","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Oleg_gol","timestamp":"1673783760.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI agree A https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html"}],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"YiPePtOwCzVO8PNSAYiy","topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","question_id":83,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"776487","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI agree","timestamp":"1673783280.0","poster":"Oleg_gol"},{"timestamp":"1698830700.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nD is incorrect.
