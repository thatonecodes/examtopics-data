Enable S3 server-side encryption on the S3 bucket.\n\"Server-side encryption – When you use server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your objects before saving them on disks in its data centers and then decrypts the objects when you download them. Server-side encryption can help reduce risk to your data by encrypting the data with a key that is stored in a different mechanism than the mechanism that stores the data itself.\"\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html#:~:text=Server%2Dside%20encryption%20%E2%80%93%20When,stores%20the%20data%20itself.","comment_id":"961487","poster":"Pranava_GCP"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Guru4Cloud","comment_id":"872913","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe best practice for securing sensitive data stored in Amazon S3 is to enable S3 server-side encryption on the S3 bucket.

Enable S3 server-side encryption on the S3 bucket.\n\nEnabling server-side encryption ensures that sensitive data stored in Amazon S3 is protected at rest, even if an unauthorized party gains access to the data. It also helps meet compliance requirements for data protection. Cross-Region replication, AWS WAF, and Amazon GuardDuty are all useful for enhancing the security of an S3 bucket, but enabling server-side encryption is a fundamental security best practice.","poster":"RajithaR","comment_id":"842694","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Saif93","timestamp":"1674443460.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"784919","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer."},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nGuradduty is threat detection service that will monitor and provide detailed findings on malicious activities for remediation.\n\nfor sensitive data handling, s3 server side encryption seems to be more accurate option.","comment_id":"757520","timestamp":"1672063560.0","poster":"Vrush44"},{"content":"Correct Answer B.
