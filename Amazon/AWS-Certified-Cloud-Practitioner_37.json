Spot Instances\n\nSpot Instances are a cost-effective option for running applications on Amazon EC2 for short periods of time. These instances are available at a significant discount compared to On-Demand instances, with hourly rates that can be up to 90% lower. Spot Instances can be interrupted by Amazon EC2 with a two-minute notification when EC2 needs the capacity back, this makes them suitable for applications that can be interrupted.\n\nOn-Demand Instances are instances that you can launch at any time and pay for by the hour, they are the most flexible and they don't have the same cost-effectiveness as Spot instances.\nReserved Instances are a cost-effective option for customers who can commit to using a specific instance type for a period of time, they are not as cost-effective as Spot instances for short-term runs.\nDedicated Instances are a type of EC2 instance that runs on a dedicated, single-tenant host, This type of instances are more expensive than the others and not suitable for short-term runs.","timestamp":"1674148980.0","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","comment_id":"781387"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

They allow you to bid on unused EC2 capacity, and you pay the Spot price for the instance type you choose. Spot Instances can be interrupted with a two-minute notification when EC2 needs the capacity back, but they can significantly reduce costs compared to On-Demand or Reserved Instances, making them suitable for applications that can handle interruptions or are fault-tolerant.","poster":"man5484","comment_id":"959250"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Global reach\n\nAWS Global Reach enables users to deploy cloud infrastructure that consists of multiple geographic regions connected by a network with low latency, high throughput, and redundancy. This allows users to store data and run applications closer to their customers and end-users, providing better performance, lower latencies, and compliance with data sovereignty and other regulatory requirements. This feature enables customers to select the region where their data will be stored, and also allows customers to distribute their applications across multiple regions for high availability and disaster recovery.\n\nEconomies of scale, Security and Elasticity are other benefits of using AWS, but they are not related to Global reach.\nEconomies of scale allow customers to take advantage of the massive scale of AWS to reduce costs. Security provides customers with a secure environment to run their workloads and protect their data.
