With a CloudWatch Logs metric filter, you can extract and count occurrences of specific patterns within your log data and create a custom metric based on those occurrences. In this case, you can create a metric filter that looks for the HTTP 404 response code in the log events and increments a counter for each occurrence. This way, you get a dedicated CloudWatch metric that represents the count of 404 responses, making it easy to set up alarms, dashboards, and other monitoring configurations based on this metric."},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704525120.0","comment_id":"767366","poster":"dangji","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Counting404Responses.html","timestamp":"1704506760.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"yeacuz","comment_id":"767190"},{"timestamp":"1704290460.0","poster":"zolthar_z","comment_id":"764712","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAns is A","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Metric Filter","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ashu27","timestamp":"1704290220.0","comment_id":"764708"}],"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":34,"question_text":"A company hosts a web application on an Amazon EC2 instance.
