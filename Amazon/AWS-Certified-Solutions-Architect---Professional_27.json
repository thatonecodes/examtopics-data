The cluster is managed using an open-source framework called Hadoop. You have set up an application to run Hadoop jobs. The application reads data from DynamoDB and generates a temporary file of 100 TBs.\nThe whole process runs for 30 minutes and the output of the job is stored to S3.\nWhich of the below mentioned options is the most cost effective solution in this case?","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"AWS EC2 Spot Instances allow the user to quote his own price for the EC2 computing capacity. The user can simply bid on the spare Amazon EC2 instances and run them whenever his bid exceeds the current Spot Price. The Spot Instance pricing model complements the On-Demand and Reserved Instance pricing models, providing potentially the most cost-effective option for obtaining compute capacity, depending on the application. The only challenge with a Spot Instance is data persistence as the instance can be terminated whenever the spot price exceeds the bid price. In the current scenario a Hadoop job is a temporary job and does not run for a longer period. It fetches data from a persistent DynamoDB. Thus, even if the instance gets terminated there will be no data loss and the job can be re- run. As the output files are large temporary files, it will be useful to store data on ethereal storage for cost savings.\nReference:\nhttp://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/spot-instances/","discussion":[{"content":"Answer is B\n\"the output of the job is stored on S3\".

True, from the application's point of view, connecting to the cluster configuration endpoint is no different than connecting directly to an individual cache node.\n\nIn the context of Amazon ElastiCache, the cluster configuration endpoint provides a single endpoint that represents the entire cache cluster. When an application connects to the cluster configuration endpoint, ElastiCache's automatic client-side routing feature directs the application's requests to the appropriate cache node within the cluster. From the application's perspective, it does not need to be aware of the individual cache nodes. The cluster configuration endpoint abstracts the underlying cache nodes, making it transparent to the application.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.
