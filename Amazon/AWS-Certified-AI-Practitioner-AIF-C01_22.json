Generative adversarial network (GAN): GANs are specifically designed for generating synthetic data. They consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator.

Reinforcement learning with rewards for positive customer feedback is the strategy that provides self-improvement capability. In reinforcement learning (RL), an agent (in this case, the chatbot) learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties).
