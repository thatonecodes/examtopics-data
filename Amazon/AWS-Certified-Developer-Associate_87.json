This approach may work, but it is not the best practice for handling failed CloudFormation stack deletions. Manually deleting the resource after deployment can be time-consuming and prone to human error, and it may not address the root cause of the issue.\n\nBy adding a DependsOn attribute, option B, to the resource that depends on the ASGInstanceRolel2345678 resource, the CloudFormation stack deletion process will ensure that the ASGInstanceRolel2345678 resource is deleted first. Once this resource is deleted, the other resource can then be deleted successfully.","timestamp":"1681315500.0","comment_id":"868528"},{"timestamp":"1676597100.0","content":"The question is what should the developer do to resolve the error.
