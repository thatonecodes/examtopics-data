This header is typically used when you want to invoke a Lambda function asynchronously, but it doesn't ensure that you get an immediate response. It essentially sends the request to a queue for asynchronous execution and doesn't wait for the processing to complete before providing a response.\n\nIn contrast, option D suggests using the X-Amz-Target header with a static value of 'Async,' which is a more appropriate choice when you need to provide an immediate response to the client while offloading the processing for background execution.
