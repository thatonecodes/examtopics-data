The use of AWS Lambda allows the company to run their Python code to process the documents as they arrive in the S3 bucket without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This also allows for horizontal scalability, as AWS Lambda will automatically scale the number of instances of the function based on the incoming rate of requests. The results can be stored in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, which is a fully-managed, high-performance database service that is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.

This solution leverages serverless architecture, allowing for automatic scaling and high availability without the need for managing infrastructure, making it the most suitable choice.\n\nA. This option requires manual management and scaling of EC2 instances, resulting in higher operational overhead and complexity.\n\nC. This approach still involves manual management and scaling of EC2 instances, increasing operational complexity and overhead.\n\nD.
