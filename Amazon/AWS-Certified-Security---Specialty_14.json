A host-based solution can inspect data in system memory at the points it is unencrypted. It also may have other insights that network solutions cannot see or may miss in tricky attacks when the host reassembles all the packets. Host-based solutions are also highly beneficial in preventing hosts from talking to each other that should not be if network security fails for some reason.","comment_id":"328774","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1634202360.0"},{"comment_id":"254896","poster":"Ghostbusters","comments":[{"comment_id":"336924","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Cushion","content":"No it's a HIDS.
