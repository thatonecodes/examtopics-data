By doing this, the ALB rules can be updated to check for the OAI and return an HTTP 403 error if the OAI header is not present, which ensures that all requests are routed through CloudFront.","timestamp":"1678050540.0","poster":"joseribas89","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"D is not correct, because OAI only can be used with aws S3. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#private-content-restricting-access-to-s3-oai\nSo I'm with A and E, because both says about WAF and Security policy.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#private-content-restricting-access-to-s3-oai","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mgonblan","timestamp":"1682688720.0","comment_id":"883518"}],"comment_id":"830330"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1677771960.0","comment_id":"827057","poster":"CloudFloater","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nagree, revising my pick to AB.
