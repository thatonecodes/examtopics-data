Economies of scale\n\nEconomies of scale is an advantage of AWS Cloud computing that minimizes variable costs. AWS Cloud computing allows customers to pay only for the resources they use, and as they scale their usage up or down, their costs also scale. This allows customers to take advantage of the economies of scale that come with using a large, shared infrastructure. AWS can spread the fixed costs of running a large, global infrastructure across many customers, which allows them to offer lower variable costs for compute, storage, and other services.\n\nA. High availability: High availability refers to a system or service that is always operational and accessible to users. It does not minimize variable costs.\n\nC.

Economies of scale\n\nEconomies of scale in AWS refer to the ability to achieve cost efficiencies by scaling infrastructure and services. With a large-scale infrastructure and a pay-as-you-go pricing model, AWS can offer resources at a lower cost due to spreading fixed costs across a larger number of users and instances.

Economies of scale\n\nEconomies of scale in cloud computing refer to the cost benefits that come from the ability to efficiently allocate and share computing resources across a large number of customers. This results in lower variable costs for individual customers because they can leverage the scale and efficiency of cloud providers like AWS.

Economies of scale\n\n\"Benefit from massive economies of scale – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.\"\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html","comment_id":"973467","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nEconomies of scale is an advantage of AWS cloud computing that minimizes variable costs. With AWS, you can leverage the massive scale of the cloud provider's infrastructure, which allows them to spread their fixed costs over a large number of customers. As a result, the cost per unit of computing resources decreases, and customers can benefit from cost savings. This means that as your usage increases, the cost per unit of computing power, storage, and other resources decreases, making it a cost-effective solution compared to maintaining your own on-premises infrastructure.","timestamp":"1690149240.0","poster":"Gulsah","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"960865"},{"content":"B. Economies of scale\n\nAmazon Web Services, like other cloud providers, operates on a massive scale. Because of this, they can achieve economies of scale that reduce costs, savings they then pass onto their customers. This allows customers to convert what would normally be large variable costs into much smaller, predictable periodic costs. With AWS, customers pay only for what they use, and they can scale their usage up or down based on demand. This eliminates the need for large upfront investments in hardware and lengthy procurement processes.","poster":"Bradggg123","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1685639280.0","comment_id":"912294"},{"comment_id":"842912","timestamp":"1679154840.0","poster":"RajithaR","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
