This approach helps minimize administrative overhead while providing secure access to the credentials.\n\nBy passing an environment tag as a parameter to the CloudFormation template, you can specify the target environment during deployment. The user data script can then retrieve the environment tag and insert it into the EC2 instances.\n\nThe application can access the credentials from the Systems Manager Parameter Store using the appropriate API calls or SDKs provided by AWS.
