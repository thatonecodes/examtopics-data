Break up the function into multiple smaller functions.\n\nIf the size of the Lambda function is too large, breaking it into smaller, more modular functions can help. Each function can be responsible for a specific part of the application's logic. This approach not only helps with deployment but also aligns with microservices best practices, potentially improving the maintainability and scalability of the application.\nE. Move common libraries, function dependencies, and custom runtimes into Lambda layers.\n\nLambda layers are a way to manage and share common components across multiple Lambda functions. By moving libraries, dependencies, and runtimes into layers, you reduce the size of the Lambda function's deployment package. Layers can be shared across multiple functions, leading to more efficient use of storage and easier management of common code.","comment_id":"1132417","timestamp":"1706261940.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"1116427","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Snape","timestamp":"1704692160.0","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nC and E"},{"content":"A E no discussion","poster":"nickqq","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704600300.0","comment_id":"1115590"},{"comment_id":"1107963","poster":"kipr","upvote_count":"2","content":"C and E\nhttps://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/5330-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-topic-1-question-17/","timestamp":"1703780820.0"},{"timestamp":"1702751880.0","poster":"Certified101","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA & E is correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1098410"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nFollowing anasbakla document, we can see the default storage of Quota is 75 GB for uploaded functions (.zip file archives) and layers.","comments":[{"poster":"preachr","comment_id":"1287623","content":"you are reading the wrong place\ncheck the line \"Deployment package (.zip file archive) size\"","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726993620.0"}],"timestamp":"1702646640.0","poster":"TanTran04","comment_id":"1097346"},{"content":"A and E\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html","timestamp":"1700018820.0","comment_id":"1071038","upvote_count":"2","poster":"anasbakla"}]}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":551,"name":"AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02","isBeta":false,"id":24,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Amazon","lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":30},"__N_SSP":true}
