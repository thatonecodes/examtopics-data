Since the workload occurs once a week for 4 hours, you can provision the read and write capacity units accordingly to handle the expected load during that time. This can be a more cost-effective option than on-demand pricing for predictable workloads.","timestamp":"1719669540.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/129711-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (73%)","A (27%)"],"question_text":"A company performs tests on an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table.
