Add Amazon CloudFront caching for static content:\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that caches and distributes content globally to provide low-latency and high-performance access to static and dynamic content. By caching static content (such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript) in CloudFront, you can serve those resources from edge locations closer to the site visitors, reducing the loading times significantly.\n\nD. Implement Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for the web servers:\nAmazon EC2 Auto Scaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. By implementing EC2 Auto Scaling for the web servers behind the ALB, you can automatically add more instances during periods of high traffic and remove instances during periods of low traffic. This ensures that the website can handle varying levels of traffic and provide consistent performance.","poster":"albert_kuo","timestamp":"1721626800.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"959205"},{"timestamp":"1707327720.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"801199","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D answer","poster":"gulu73"},{"content":"A, D.
