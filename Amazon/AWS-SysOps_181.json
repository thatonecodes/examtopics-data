Lifecycle hooks allow you to perform custom actions as instances launch or terminate in an Auto Scaling group. By adding a \"Terminating\" lifecycle hook, the EC2 instance will be put into a wait state before termination, giving you the opportunity to perform any necessary actions, such as delivering the latest logs, before the instance is finally terminated.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1707409380.0","poster":"gulu73","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"802247"},{"timestamp":"1672850940.0","poster":"szl0144","comment_id":"516834","content":"answer is A","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"A: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html","timestamp":"1666191900.0","poster":"BearNear","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"403575"},{"timestamp":"1663626240.0","comment_id":"395335","content":"Answer is A","poster":"qurren","upvote_count":"4"}],"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","question_id":902,"question_images":[],"exam_id":36},{"id":"mUdGOAhQAdw6qn9PR0oV","exam_id":36,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1666425360.0","content":"Answer is C. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-register-targets.html","comment_id":"395339","poster":"qurren"},{"timestamp":"1722250260.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"966340","poster":"albert_kuo","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhen registering targets for a Network Load Balancer (NLB) using IP addresses, the targets must be within any of the specified private CIDR blocks: 10.0.0.0/8, 100.64.0.0/10, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16.
