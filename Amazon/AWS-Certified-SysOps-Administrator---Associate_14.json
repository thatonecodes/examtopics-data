Use AWS Storage Gateway, and configure it to use gateway-cached volumes.\n\nAWS Storage Gateway is a service that connects an on-premises data center to the cloud. It provides block-based storage that is compatible with the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) and can be used as a target for data backups. Gateway-cached volumes allow you to store your data locally, while asynchronously backing up that data to Amazon S3. This allows you to retain local access to your data, while still providing the benefits of cloud-based data storage and backup.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1702442940.0","comment_id":"743591","upvote_count":"1","poster":"michaldavid","content":"Selected Answer: D\ndddddd"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1700297580.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/storagegateway/latest/vgw/StorageGatewayConcepts.html\nBy using stored volumes, you can store your primary data locally, while asynchronously backing up that data to Amazon.
