Storage performance is the combination of I/O operations per second (IOPS) and how fast the storage volume can perform reads and writes (storage throughput). On gp3 storage volumes, Amazon RDS provides a baseline storage performance of 3000 IOPS and 125 MiBps.\n\nFor every RDS DB engine except RDS for SQL Server, when the storage size for gp3 volumes reaches a certain threshold, the baseline storage performance increases to 12,000 IOPS and 500 MiBps.

With canary, you would use nodes on a smaller scale. So D over A. Info: https://circleci.com/blog/canary-vs-blue-green-downtime/\n\nYou're gonna need something to pull the data from SQS - Lambda required. And there is no such thing as an SQS agent anyway. So the answer is C.\n\nAs for GP3 vs io2 ...let's think about this. GP3 offers 99.98% durability vs IO2's 99.9999%. But this question wants us to take cost into consideration. So let's calculate the difference in operating costs.\n\nFor a 100GB volume with 16,000 IOPS and 256 MiB/s, gp3 would cost $78 per month (i.e. 0.08*100 + 0.005 * (16000-3000) + 0.04 * (256-125)), and io2 would cost $1052 per month (i.e. 0.125*100 + 0.065*16000.\n\nFor me it's CDF based on the answers given.

Automatic scaling with a custom policy in Amazon EMR release versions 4.0 and later allows you to programmatically scale out and scale in core nodes and task nodes based on a CloudWatch metric and other parameters that you specify in a scaling policy. Automatic scaling with a custom policy is available with the instance groups configuration and is not available when you use instance fleets. For more information about instance groups and instance fleets, see Create a cluster with instance fleets or uniform instance groups.","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB for me","timestamp":"1661103060.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"649846","poster":"asfsdfsdf"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBetween B and D, You cannot use spot for master hence B","comment_id":"646791","timestamp":"1660490220.0","poster":"Harithareddynn"},{"timestamp":"1659159180.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"cen007","content":"Selected Answer: B\nReserved Or Dedicated for master node, spot for task nodes","comment_id":"639483"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1658062620.0","poster":"Enigmaaaaaa","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWill go with D due to the below:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/strategies-for-reducing-your-amazon-emr-costs/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/optimizing-amazon-emr-for-resilience-and-cost-with-capacity-optimized-spot-instances/\nThe correct is answer is a combining both A and D since the question asks for \"minimizing the time required to perform numerous workloads\" it has to be D.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/best-practices-for-resizing-and-automatic-scaling-in-amazon-emr/","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1658135160.0","content":"Changing to A.\nYou cant define mix of on-demand and spot to master node type","comment_id":"632946","poster":"Enigmaaaaaa"}],"comment_id":"632557"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"wannaaws","timestamp":"1655516340.0","comment_id":"618037","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-fleet.html"},{"comment_id":"591173","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Bigbearcn","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is ok. \nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/optimizing-amazon-emr-for-resilience-and-cost-with-capacity-optimized-spot-instances/","comments":[{"poster":"Bigbearcn","comment_id":"591179","upvote_count":"3","content":"A auto scaling is also workable. but auto scaling need instance group that each node type (master, core, or task) consists of the same instance type and the same purchasing option for instances:On-Demand or Spot.
