IAM provides fine-grained control over permissions and allows administrators to define policies that specify what actions a user can perform on specific resources.\n\nBucket ACLs, on the other hand, are a legacy way of managing access control in S3 and are not designed to grant access to IAM users directly. Bucket ACLs are used to grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or predefined groups, but they do not work with IAM users."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC : https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/iam-policies-and-bucket-policies-and-acls-oh-my-controlling-access-to-s3-resources/","poster":"Finger41","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1701844680.0","comment_id":"612163"},{"timestamp":"1682913660.0","comment_id":"367414","upvote_count":"1","poster":"TroyMcLure","content":"Correct Answer: C"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"C.
