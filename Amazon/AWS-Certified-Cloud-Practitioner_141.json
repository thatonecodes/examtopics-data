Elasticity","timestamp":"1690433040.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"948726","timestamp":"1689056520.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nElasticity refers to the ability to dynamically scale computing resources up or down based on demand. In the case of CPU capacity, elasticity allows users to easily adjust the amount of CPU resources allocated to their applications in response to changing workloads.\n\nWith elasticity in the AWS Cloud, users can scale up their CPU capacity during periods of high demand to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness. Conversely, during periods of low demand, they can scale down the CPU capacity to eliminate underutilized resources and reduce costs.\n\nBy leveraging the elastic nature of the AWS Cloud, users can effectively eliminate underutilized CPU capacity and only pay for the resources they actually need, optimizing cost-efficiency while maintaining performance.","poster":"man5484"},{"timestamp":"1687990860.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ESAJRR","comment_id":"937178","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Elasticity","poster":"Warsame21"},{"timestamp":"1680542460.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe characteristic of the AWS Cloud that helps users eliminate underutilized CPU capacity is B. Elasticity. AWS provides an elastic infrastructure that allows users to easily scale their computing resources up or down as needed, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. With AWS, users can provision resources to match their current needs and scale automatically to meet their future demands. This allows users to eliminate underutilized CPU capacity and optimize their resources for cost and performance.","comment_id":"860185","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Guru4Cloud"},{"timestamp":"1674078060.0","poster":"Saif93","comment_id":"780447","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer."},{"timestamp":"1663509900.0","comment_id":"672433","poster":"AJ79","upvote_count":"2","content":"B, Elasticity helps reduce the instance if underutilised."},{"poster":"sumanshu","comment_id":"670586","timestamp":"1663314720.0","content":"Vote for B","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"bilel500","timestamp":"1661982180.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"655514","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B."},{"poster":"fahim_neo","comment_id":"637205","timestamp":"1658815500.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":701,"exam_id":18,"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/77748-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-73/","isMC":true},{"id":"fjl3pAvtngMSNYabJN2d","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/106617-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-730/","answer":"B","question_text":"A company wants to use the latest technologies and wants to minimize its capital investment.

The trade of infrastructure expenses for operating expenses: Moving to the AWS Cloud allows companies to avoid the upfront capital investment required to purchase and maintain on-premises infrastructure. Instead, they can leverage AWS's pay-as-you-go pricing model, where they pay for the resources and services they consume on an operational basis. This shift from a capital expenditure (CapEx) model to an operating expenditure (OpEx) model allows companies to minimize upfront costs and pay only for the resources they actually use.","comment_id":"915301","timestamp":"1685959560.0","poster":"Zonci","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1683064440.0","content":"\"The trade of infrastructure expenses for operating expenses,\" which is option B.\n\nMoving to the AWS Cloud allows the company to minimize capital investment in infrastructure and instead pay for only what they use on a pay-as-you-go basis.

The scenario describes the AWS Cloud benefit of trading infrastructure expenses for operating expenses. By using the AWS Cloud, the company can avoid the capital expense of upgrading on-premises infrastructure and instead pay only for the resources it uses in the AWS Cloud, turning a capital expense into an operating expense. This can be more cost-effective and allows the company to scale resources up and down as needed.","poster":"Guru4Cloud","comment_id":"873771","timestamp":"1681829820.0"}],"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":702,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1681829820,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-04-18 16:57:00"},{"id":"t5zc6UXRxgP4QHv4dOSo","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/106616-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-731/","question_text":"Which AWS service can defend against DDoS attacks?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"970080","poster":"Pranava_GCP","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
