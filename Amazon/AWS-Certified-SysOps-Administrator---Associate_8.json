This volume type helps to provide the right balance of price and performance for most applications. It also helps you to scale volume performance independently of volume size. This means that you can provision the required performance without needing to provision additional block storage capacity. Additionally, gp3 volumes offer a 20 percent lower price per GiB than General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes.\n\ngp3 volumes provide single-digit millisecond latency and 99.8 percent to 99.9 percent volume durability with an annual failure rate (AFR) no higher than 0.2 percent, which translates to a maximum of two volume failures per 1,000 running volumes over a one-year period.
