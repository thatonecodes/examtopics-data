The SaaS solution is hosted in the AWS Cloud and is powered by AWS PrivateLink. The company uses a PrivateLink endpoint to access the SaaS solution behind the SaaS provider's Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n\nThe company recently added a new Availability Zone and new subnets to its VPC. A network engineer is unable to deploy a new interface VPC endpoint for the SaaS solution in the new Availability Zone.\n\nWhat is the cause of this problem?","choices":{"B":"The enableDnsHostnames attribute and enableDnsSupport attribute were not configured on the new subnets in the new Availability Zone.","A":"The CIDR block of the new subnets conflicts with the SaaS provider's CIDR block.","D":"The new subnets are missing a route to the VPC internet gateway.","C":"The SaaS provider does not offer the solution in the new Availability Zone and has not configured cross-zone load balancing for the NLB."},"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1324060","poster":"woorkim","content":"C is right!\nA: CIDR block conflicts are not relevant here, as PrivateLink operates at the network interface level and is independent of the CIDR block configuration of the VPC.\nB: The enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport attributes are required for DNS resolution of private endpoints, but their absence would not block the creation of an endpoint in a specific Availability Zone.\nD: The new subnets do not need a route to an internet gateway to use AWS PrivateLink, as it operates within the AWS network and does not rely on public internet routing.","timestamp":"1733750580.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"cas_tori","comment_id":"1273455","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724765520.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nthis is C"},{"poster":"Akshay0403","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721719080.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAWS PrivateLink endpoints require the service to be available in the Availability Zone where the endpoint is being created. If the SaaS provider does not offer the service in the new Availability Zone and cross-zone load balancing is not configured for the NLB, the endpoint cannot be deployed in that Availability Zone.
