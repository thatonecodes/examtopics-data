You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued. This might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file writes to the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you can't pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You can remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending. \nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html","timestamp":"1726926480.0","poster":"dahp"},{"timestamp":"1730808720.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct Answer: C","poster":"TroyMcLure","comment_id":"364978"},{"timestamp":"1729803660.0","poster":"RicardoD","comment_id":"336805","content":"C is the answer\n\nEBS volume can be used while the snapshot is being executed.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"waterzhong","timestamp":"1728556020.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"198154","content":"Ans C.
