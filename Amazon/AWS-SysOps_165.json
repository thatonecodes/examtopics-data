Enable detailed monitoring on the instance within Amazon CloudWatch: By enabling detailed monitoring for the EC2 instances, you can collect more granular data at a 1-minute frequency, as opposed to the standard 5-minute frequency.

Install Amazon CloudWatch agent to track memory metrics: The Amazon CloudWatch agent is a software application that can be installed on an EC2 instance to collect and send metrics, logs, and events to CloudWatch.
