However is it important to note that granting trust to the identity account alone will not prevent unauthorized access to services. You will need to create a trust policy on IAM roles in prod and test accounts that grant assumeRole permission to specific groups or users in the 'identity account."},{"timestamp":"1634933460.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1635194820.0","poster":"Kian1","content":"so what is your best answer?","comment_id":"281893"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"petebear55","content":"A B CAN NOT BE RIGHT BECAUSE THE QUESTION ASKS MOST SECURE !!!

I agree that creating users in a centralized account would be the best . However option A does not offer cross account roles. It states \"Add the identity account to the trust policies for the roles\", which is a resource/identity based policy, which would work the roles. However, we need a cross account roles in production and testing which will allow the users in centralized account to assume the roles with right permissions. \nD is the only option which lists cross account role.
