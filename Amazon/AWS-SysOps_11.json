The user is managing an AWS account for an organization that already has an identity system, such as the login system for the corporate network (SSO). In this case, instead of creating individual IAM users or groups for each user who need AWS access, it may be more practical to use a proxy server to translate the user identities from the organization network into the temporary AWS security credentials. This proxy server will attach an IAM role to the user after authentication.","question_text":"You are managing the AWS account of a big organization.
