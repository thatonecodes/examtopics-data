By default, when you create a Lambda function, it is not connected to any VPC, which is why you would select B. AWS PrivateLink allows you to privately access services across VPCs and accounts. However, it is typically used to access AWS services or to create private connections to your own services. In this scenario, creating an interface endpoint (PrivateLink) would not be relevant if we're referring to a traditional database hosted on an EC2 instance or an RDS instance without its own PrivateLink-enabled endpoint.","comment_id":"1322546"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is a classic solution of Lambda <-> Private RDS within the same VPC\nA works but is not necessary","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Aamee","comment_id":"1301802","timestamp":"1729645740.0","content":"Completely wrong!... how would you connect the lambda directly to the DB publically from the internet w/o having any interface endpoint created?!....

When AWS Lambda tries to connect to RDS instance, it will use the RDS endpoint, but since DNS is in private subnet, Lambda cannot reach from Internet to this Private subnet. Hence, keeping the traffic inside VPC becomes viable using PrivateLink. Creating a Lambda Endpoint will allow the traffic of Lambda to stay inside of AWS within the VPC where it would be created and will allow seamless connectivity to other services inside the VPC.","timestamp":"1716821160.0","comment_id":"1219620","poster":"nyalpellymkar07"},{"timestamp":"1712478300.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think A","comment_id":"1190852","poster":"seetpt","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1711146000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAWS PrivateLink interface endpoints are two-way connections.
