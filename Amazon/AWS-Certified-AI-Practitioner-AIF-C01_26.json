BERT-based models: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model that has been fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks, including text completion. BERT-based models are particularly effective at predicting missing words or filling in gaps in text because they can understand context in both directions (left and right of the missing word).

Pairs of user messages and correct user intents\n\nExplanation:\nFew-shot learning involves training a model with a small number of examples (or samples). In this case, the goal is to improve intent detection, which requires a clear understanding of the user's intent based on their message. To fine-tune the large language model (LLM) using few-shot learning, the model needs examples of user messages along with their corresponding correct user intents.
