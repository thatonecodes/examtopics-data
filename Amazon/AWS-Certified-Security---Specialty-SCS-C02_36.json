Configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs as the target of the EventBridge rule. Set up a metric filter on the IncomingBytes metric and enable anomaly detection.

Configure a CloudWatch alarm that uses the SNS topic to send the notification.\n\n\nEventBridge Rule and CloudWatch Logs: By configuring CloudWatch Logs as the target of the EventBridge rule, you can capture and store all relevant logs for further analysis.\n\nMetric Filter and Anomaly Detection: Setting up a metric filter on the IncomingBytes metric enables detailed monitoring and anomaly detection for specific API call patterns, such as the GetSecretValue API.\n\nSNS Topic for Notifications: Creating an SNS topic ensures that alerts are sent out immediately when an anomaly is detected. CloudWatch alarms can be configured to trigger notifications via SNS, providing timely alerts to the security team.","poster":"IPLogic","comments":[{"content":"Option A and B: Configuring CloudTrail as the target and using attribute filters is less direct and involves an additional step of setting up CloudTrail alarms, which might not offer the same level of granularity and immediate anomaly detection as CloudWatch Logs.\n\nOption D: Using CloudWatch Logs Insights is another valid approach, but it involves more complex querying and might not be as straightforward for continuous anomaly detection compared to using metric filters.\n\nBy following Option C, you can ensure a robust, automated solution for detecting and alerting on anomalous API calls in AWS Secrets Manager.","comment_id":"1322536","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733434560.0","poster":"IPLogic"}],"comment_id":"1322535"},{"poster":"723993f","comment_id":"1317854","timestamp":"1732583940.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC - using built-in anomaly detection in cloudwatch based on the volume of \"what is being logged itself\" \nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Monitoring-CloudWatch-Metrics.html#cwl-metrics\nhttps://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/unlocking-the-power-of-amazon-cloudwatch-anomaly-detection-for-secrets-manager-27a7ffd66498","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"0lzIV4O1GtIkdDoUEU6S","question_text":"A company is using AWS Organizations with the default SCP.
