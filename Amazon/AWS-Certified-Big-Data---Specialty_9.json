The key of this question is to figure out the cause of throttling under capacity.

However, we have 200G in total and the total wcu requested is 10k. This means, dynamoDB has to give us 20 partitions, with 500 wcu for each partition. therefore, a throttling will occur if for a single partiton the wcu goes over 500. option c gives us information of the most frequently updated attributes and the size, thus can help us calculate whether a wcu for a single partition is over 500.

Use AWS Direct Connect to connect your data center with AWS resources. Once connected, you can use Amazon EMR to process your data stored in your own data center and store the results on AWS or back in your data center. This approach gives you 1 or 10 gigabit-per-second link connectivity to AWS at all time. And directconnect outbound bandwidth costs less than public Internet outbound cost. So in cases where you expect great amount of traffic exported to your own data center, having direct connect in place can reduce your bandwidth charges.\nhttps://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-amazon-emr-best-practices.pdf"},{"content":"Selected A","poster":"san2020","timestamp":"1634837220.0","comment_id":"52144","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"kalpanareddy","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"41803","timestamp":"1634676840.0","content":"answer B.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/connect-data-center-to-aws/"},{"content":"i will go with B.\nhe most common way is to upload the data to Amazon S3 and use the built-in features of Amazon EMR to load the data onto your cluster.
