You must specify an Elastic IP address for your NAT gateway; if you don't have one, you must first allocate one to your account. If you want to use an existing Elastic IP address, ensure that it's not currently associated with another instance or network interface. The NAT gateway is automatically created in the public subnet of your VPC. \"","poster":"TroyMcLure","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1698087900.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"64318","poster":"AWS_Noob","content":"A.
