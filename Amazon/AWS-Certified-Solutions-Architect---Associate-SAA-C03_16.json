By creating an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue to hold messages and setting up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue, the company can ensure that the order of the event data is maintained throughout processing. SQS FIFO queues guarantee the order of messages and are suitable for scenarios where strict message ordering is required.\n\nB is incorrect because Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics are not designed to preserve message order. SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging service and does not guarantee the order of message delivery.\n\nC is incorrect because using an SQS standard queue does not guarantee the order of message processing. SQS standard queues provide high throughput and scale, but they do not guarantee strict message ordering.\n\nD is incorrect because configuring an SQS queue as a subscriber to an SNS topic does not ensure message ordering.

However, the databases are billed for the compute and storage costs during this idle time. To reduce the overall cost, Amazon RDS allows instances to be stopped temporarily. While the instance is stopped, you’re charged for storage and backups, but not for the DB instance hours. Please note that a stopped instance will automatically be started after 7 days.\n\nThis post presents a solution using AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge that allows you to schedule a Lambda function to stop and start the idle databases with specific tags to save on compute costs.
