This means that even if the metric name is the same, the different dimensions provided will create distinct metrics within CloudWatch.\n\nDimensions are used to further categorize and filter metrics in CloudWatch. By including different dimensions, you can create multiple instances of the same metric with varying characteristics or attributes.\n\nCloudWatch considers the combination of the metric name and dimensions to uniquely identify a metric. Therefore, if you send multiple requests with the same metric name but different dimensions, CloudWatch will treat them as separate metrics.","comment_id":"932065","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"67998","upvote_count":"2","content":"A.
