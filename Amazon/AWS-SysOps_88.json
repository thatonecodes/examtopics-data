We are creating a list of IAM users with the AWS Console. Not CLI or API. Therefore IAM Passwords is the only credential that is enabled by default (via console). If we were creating the list of passwords thru API or CLI, the answer would be B. Last note: when creating IAM users via AWS Console you have option for either password or IAM access key, not secret access key. If you don't set the IAM password policy (e.g. length of pw), your IAM users will have default AWS length of pw. \n\"You can choose the credentials that are right for your IAM user.
