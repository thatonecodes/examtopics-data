It emphasizes designing systems that can automatically handle failures and continue operating without manual intervention.\n\nIn this scenario, the company's requirement for automatic recovery from failure reflects the focus on building a reliable system that can withstand disruptions and maintain availability. By designing the workload to be resilient and implementing fault-tolerant architectures, the system can automatically recover and continue functioning even in the event of failures or disruptions.","comment_id":"947826"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

NAT gateway\n\nA NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway allows instances in a private subnet to access the Internet, but prevent the Internet from initiating a connection with those instances. A NAT gateway forwards traffic from instances in the private subnet to the Internet, and then routes the response back to the instances. This way, instances in the private subnet can access the Internet to download software updates, retrieve application data and perform other tasks, while remaining isolated from incoming Internet traffic, providing a more secure network environment.\nIt's important to note that a NAT gateway is a horizontally scalable, redundant, and highly available VPC component that automatically replaces failed NAT gateways.","comment_id":"783359"}],"question_text":"A company is running Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet in a VPC.\n\nWhich AWS service or feature can provide the EC2 instances with network connections to the internet?","answer":"B"},{"id":"d2WCX5NrcpbRvWvEkCPP","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/96315-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-551/","choices":{"C":"Amazon GuardDuty","B":"AWS Trusted Advisor","A":"AWS Artifact","D":"AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)"},"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1674309660,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"844766","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAWS Artifact is an AWS service that provides on-demand access to AWS compliance documentation and reports, including compliance with specific compliance frameworks such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC.

This means that the root user credentials should be used sparingly and only when no other user or permission can perform the necessary action. Using the root user credentials for normal activities or limiting their use to specific tasks like creating private VPC subnets or using them only for Amazon EC2 instances from the AWS Free Tier is not recommended. These practices increase the risk of credential misuse or compromise, which can lead to security breaches and other issues.
