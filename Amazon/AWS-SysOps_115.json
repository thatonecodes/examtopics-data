Adding more details how SG also allows ephemeral port without specifying.\n\n\nGood Discussion. I have a question.\n\n\nif you want to allow your EC2 instance to serve HTTP traffic, you will need to allow port 80 inbound and ports 1024 – 65535 in NACL.\nephemeral ports ports are randomly selected to allow return traffic for a request. So, if a request comes to the server on port 80, the request also specifies a random port between 1024 – 65535 for the return traffic. \n\nThe stateful nature of the security group handles the ephemeral port requirement automatically. When the request comes in, it accesses the server on port 80, but also specifies a port for the return traffic. This port is one of the ports in the ephemeral range. The stateful Security Group automatically allows the return traffic on this port.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"31860","timestamp":"1664099520.0"},{"poster":"saumenP","timestamp":"1663982340.0","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"19167","content":"D seems to be correct; Thanks Chris82"},{"comment_id":"16922","upvote_count":"2","content":"B is correct","poster":"saumenP","timestamp":"1663628280.0"}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/7061-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-619-discussion/","answer":"B"},{"id":"AanTa4QwPp1OMMoGUM9L","answer_ET":"C","question_id":575,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"138201","content":"C\nIf we don't set the minimum and desired capacity to 0, Auto Scaling will not allow for the deletion of the group from CLI.\nHowever from Console, Auto Scaling will automatically set the desired capacity to 0","poster":"onlinebaba","timestamp":"1666524000.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct steps are:\n1.
