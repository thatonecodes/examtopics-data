AWS Lambda can process the incoming log stream to apply more complex logic, such as checking for and ignoring duplicate entries within a set time frame (daily, weekly, monthly) before incrementing the metrics. This allows for the implementation of logic to ensure that users are only counted once per period, effectively tracking unique logins.\n\nConclusion:\nAmong the given options, Option D using an AWS Lambda function is best equipped to handle the requirement of counting unique user logins accurately over specified periods.
