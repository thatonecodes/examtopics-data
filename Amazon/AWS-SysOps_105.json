It provides a direct measure of the application's load and is well-suited for scaling policies when the application is memory-heavy, as mentioned in the scenario.\n\nBy using the RequestCountPerTarget metric, the Auto Scaling group can dynamically scale the number of instances or containers based on the incoming request rate.

For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an ELB load balancer in the Frankfurt region.\n\nWhen you use geolocation routing, you can localize your content and present some or all of your website in the language of your users. You can also use geolocation routing to restrict distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights.

It allows you to create a hierarchy of organizational units (OUs) to group and organize accounts based on projects, teams, or other criteria. By using OUs, you can apply consistent policies and controls across multiple accounts, making it easier to manage and enforce security and compliance requirements.\n\nWith AWS Organizations, you can create a separate OU for each project team's account. Within each OU, you can define service control policies (SCPs) at the account level. SCPs are used to restrict the services that can be accessed and the actions that can be performed within an account.
