AWS Secrets Manager\n\n\"Secrets Manager helps you improve your security posture, because you no longer need hard-coded credentials in application source code. Storing the credentials in Secrets Manager helps avoid possible compromise by anyone who can inspect your application or the components. You replace hard-coded credentials with a runtime call to the Secrets Manager service to retrieve credentials dynamically when you need them.\nWith Secrets Manager, you can configure an automatic rotation schedule for your secrets. This enables you to replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, significantly reducing the risk of compromise. Since the credentials are no longer stored with the application, rotating credentials no longer requires updating your applications and deploying changes to application clients.\"\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html","poster":"Pranava_GCP","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1679501640.0","poster":"RajithaR","comment_id":"847241","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAWS Secrets Manager is a fully managed service that helps you protect access to applications, services, and IT resources.
