One of the company’s cloud-based applications has hundreds of AWS Lambda functions that pull data from these endpoints. A developer updated the trust store of the Lambda execution environment to use the Root CA Cert when the Lambda execution environment is initialized. The developer bundled the Root CA Cert as a text file in the Lambda deployment bundle.\n\nAfter 3 months of development, the Root CA Cert is no longer valid and must be updated. The developer needs a more efficient solution to update the Root CA Cert for all deployed Lambda functions. The solution must not include rebuilding or updating all Lambda functions that use the Root CA Cert. The solution must also work for all development, testing, and production environments.

Use an AWS Step Functions state machine to monitor API failures. Use the Wait state to delay calling the Lambda function: This is a viable and efficient solution. AWS Step Functions can orchestrate the Lambda function invocations and manage the workflow, including handling API call rate limits. The Wait state can be used to introduce delays between API calls to ensure compliance with the rate limits. This approach also allows for handling errors and retries effectively.\n\nB. Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to hold the API calls. Configure the Lambda function to poll the queue within the API threshold limits: While using SQS to queue API call requests is a good way to manage workload, it adds complexity to the solution. The Lambda function would need to be modified to manage the queue and ensure API calls are made within the threshold limits.
