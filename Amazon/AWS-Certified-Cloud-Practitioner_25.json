Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and AWS Lambda. Here's why this combination is a strong fit for the scenario:\n\nWhy SQS and Lambda work well together:\n\nDecoupling: SQS acts as a buffer, storing incoming requests and decoupling the request generation from the actual processing. This prevents the backend from being overwhelmed.\nScalability: Lambda functions can automatically scale up or down based on the volume of messages in the SQS queue. This ensures efficient resource utilization to match demand.\nAsynchronous Processing: This architecture allows for asynchronous handling of requests. Users don't have to wait for immediate responses, improving responsiveness.\nFault Tolerance: If a Lambda function fails, SQS retains the message for retry, adding resilience."},{"timestamp":"1707717180.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
