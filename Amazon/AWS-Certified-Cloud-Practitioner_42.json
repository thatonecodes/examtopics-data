Maintenance most often involves updates to the DB instance's underlying hardware, underlying operating system (OS), or database engine version. Updates to the operating system most often occur for security issues and should be done as soon as possible.\nSome maintenance items require that Amazon RDS take your DB instance offline for a short time. Maintenance items that require a resource to be offline include required operating system or database patching. Required patching is automatically scheduled only for patches that are related to security and instance reliability. Such patching occurs infrequently (typically once every few months) and seldom requires more than a fraction of your maintenance window.\"\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html","timestamp":"1690199160.0","comment_id":"961553","poster":"Pranava_GCP","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"ESAJRR","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1687941720.0","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB.
