By creating a custom AWS Config rule, you can track EC2 instances that do not have the required cost-related tags. When an EC2 instance is launched or modified and lacks the required tags, AWS Config can automatically detect this non-compliance and generate an evaluation result.\n\nThis solution requires minimal operational overhead once the AWS Config rule is set up and enabled. AWS Config takes care of continuously monitoring the resources for compliance and automatically evaluates whether the required tags are present on EC2 instances, without the need for manual intervention.","comment_id":"966750","poster":"albert_kuo","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722297840.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"802264","poster":"gulu73","timestamp":"1707410160.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"juraj666","comment_id":"533673","timestamp":"1674817200.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"SCP would enforce the policy, not detect differences in tags, i go with C"}],"timestamp":"1667798940.0","comment_id":"413149","content":"I will go for A. see the requirement of multiple accounts.","poster":"raychen"},{"poster":"random_007","timestamp":"1667789520.0","comment_id":"412654","upvote_count":"2","content":"question ask for detection and with least possible overhead.\nconfig has capability to check from compliance point view (custom) and which does not require any additional configuration at resource level.\nAnswer : C"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"C.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/aws-config-checking-for-compliance-with-new-managed-rule-options/","poster":"haim96","timestamp":"1666166520.0","comment_id":"406128"},{"timestamp":"1665231060.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"I strong believed that answer is C","comment_id":"405506","poster":"sankhar"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Answer : C","timestamp":"1664561400.0","poster":"USR","comment_id":"395877"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"I'll go for C","poster":"qurren","timestamp":"1664445780.0","comment_id":"395367"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/56593-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-932-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","choices":{"C":"Use an AWS Config rule to track EC2 instances that do not have the required tags.","D":"Use AWS Well-Architected Tool (AWS WA Tool) to run a report to identify EC2 instances that do not have the required tags.","A":"Use service control policies (SCPs) to track EC2 instances that do not have the required tags.","B":"Use Amazon Inspector to run a report to identify EC2 instances that do not have the required tags."},"question_id":922,"isMC":true},{"id":"vcHaBJMi2GYboxwSd0v9","question_text":"An organization, which has the AWS account ID as 999988887777, has created 50 IAM users.
