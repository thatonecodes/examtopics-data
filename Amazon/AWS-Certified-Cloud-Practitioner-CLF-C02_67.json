AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. You simply upload your code, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring. It is ideal for non-containerized Java-based web applications, as it abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing environments","timestamp":"1728143160.0","comment_id":"1189989"}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":331,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/137983-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-topic-1/","answer":"D","exam_id":19,"unix_timestamp":1712331960,"question_text":"A company wants to deploy a non-containerized Java-based web application on AWS.

AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits)\n\nAWS SDKs provide a set of tools for developers to integrate with and manage AWS services programmatically. These SDKs support multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, and Go, among others, enabling developers to use the language they are most comfortable with to interact with AWS services.
