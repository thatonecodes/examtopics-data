Associate the web ACL with the ALB.\n\nThis solution will enhance the origin security by adding an additional layer of security with a random string that is stored in Secrets Manager and rotates automatically. CloudFront is configured to inject the random string as a custom HTTP header for the origin request. An AWS WAF web ACL rule is created to match this custom header and is associated with the ALB.
