Create an S3 Lifecycle rule on the S3 bucket to delete expired markers or incomplete multipart uploads.\n\nExplanation:\nS3 Lifecycle rules allow you to define actions that Amazon S3 should take on objects in the bucket over time. This includes transitioning objects between storage classes and deleting objects when they meet certain criteria.\n\nTo reduce the number of incomplete multipart upload objects in the S3 bucket, you can create an S3 Lifecycle rule that targets incomplete multipart uploads and specifies a deletion action for them.

One thing we must understand is that AWS Organizations attaches an AWS managed SCP named FullAWSAccess to every root, OU and account when it's created. This policy allows all services and actions. Therefore, attaching a new SCP that denies all DynamoDB actions to the root of the organizations makes a lot more sense. This is because we don't care what access other SCPs have granted the Management accounts and OUs, this new SCP explicitly denies DynamoDB related actions.
