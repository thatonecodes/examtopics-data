The question says, what will be the most cost effective way. ALB is much cheaper than the NLB. Thus, the best way to use NLB is when your application requires TCP and UDP connection. In this scenario, the users only communicate using TCP, which the ALB supports including variety of protocols such as, HTTP, HTTPS & SSL. \n\nAdditionally, ALB's service uptime is up to 99.995%, which falls to the requirement of this question that application must be highly available... and that nullifies your logic!\n\nCorrect answer is C"}],"timestamp":"1727812320.0","poster":"blehbleh","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nThis is A and B.

They have to do more processing per connection than an NLB, which operates at Layer 4. This translates to higher resource consumption on the ALB side, even for simple TCP forwarding. \n\nAlso, both ALBs and NLBs have similar pricing structures based on\n1. Hourly usage: You pay for the time the load balancer is running. This is generally comparable between the two.\n2. Load Balancer Capacity Units (LCUs)\n\nFor TCP traffic, NLBs are significantly more efficient in terms of LCU consumption, especially regarding new connections and bytes processed. Even with low connection rates, the overhead of the ALB's Layer 7 processing will usually result in higher LCU consumption and therefore higher costs.","comments":[{"content":"NLBs are designed to handle millions of connections per second with very low latency. Even if the application in the question doesn't require \"extreme connection scaling\" right now, using an NLB provides headroom for future growth without incurring significant cost increases. The cost difference between a lightly used NLB and an ALB handling the same basic TCP traffic is usually not substantial enough to justify the potential performance bottleneck and lack of scalability of the ALB for TCP. Lastly, NLB configuration for TCP is generally simpler than configuring an ALB for TCP.","comment_id":"1337928","timestamp":"1736337840.0","poster":"LeonSauveterre","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1736337780.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1337927"},{"timestamp":"1734322920.0","poster":"Ghoneam","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nALB for TCP","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1327158"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1303596","poster":"siheom","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nVOTE BC","timestamp":"1730035860.0"},{"poster":"classic_manda","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729756800.0","content":"Answer is B and C","comment_id":"1302360"},{"comment_id":"1292085","poster":"1a0d459","timestamp":"1727810400.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nTCP - NLB"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/148519-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/","question_id":1006,"unix_timestamp":1727810400,"topic":"1","answers_community":["AB (76%)","12%","12%"],"answer":"AB","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-10-01 21:20:00","question_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"mSj5t8zl1D9CJUSAk6sO","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Create a tag policy to deny running instances when a tag key is not specified.
