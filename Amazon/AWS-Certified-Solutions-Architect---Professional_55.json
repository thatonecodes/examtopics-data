To check the operational validity, you need to attempt to create the stack.\n\nBy creating a stack from your CloudFormation template, AWS will attempt to provision the specified resources and configurations. During this process, AWS CloudFormation will perform various checks and validations to ensure the template's operational validity.\n\nIf there are any issues or errors in the template, AWS CloudFormation will provide feedback and fail to create the stack. This feedback can help identify and address any problems before attempting to deploy the template in a production environment.\n\nUsing the \"aws cloudformation validate-template\" command (option D) can help catch syntax and structure errors in your template but may not cover all aspects of operational validity.
