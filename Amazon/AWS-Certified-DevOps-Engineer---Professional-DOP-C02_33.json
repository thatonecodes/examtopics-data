DynamoDB is better suited for high-speed key-value access and doesn’t provide the same level of querying capabilities for large datasets compared to Amazon S3 with Athena.\n\nDynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours.
