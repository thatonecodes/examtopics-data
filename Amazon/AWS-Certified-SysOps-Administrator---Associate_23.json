Use the ALB's RequestCount metric. Configure a time range of 2 weeks and a period of 1 minute. Examine the chart to determine peak traffic times and volumes.\n\nExplanation: The ALB's RequestCount metric provides the total number of requests processed by the ALB. By configuring a time range of 2 weeks with a 1-minute period, you can collect detailed data on request counts for each minute over the 2-week period. This will allow the SysOps administrator to visualize the traffic patterns and identify peak times when the requests exceeded the threshold of 100 requests per second."},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"zolthar_z","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A","comment_id":"752474","timestamp":"1703171400.0"}],"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Use the ALB’s RequestCount metric.
