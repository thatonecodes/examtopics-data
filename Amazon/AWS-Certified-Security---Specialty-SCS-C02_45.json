Give the customer managed policy the same name and same permissions in each account.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen using IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to administer access to AWS accounts across multiple accounts, and attaching a customer managed policy to a permission set, it's essential to create the corresponding IAM policy with the same name and permissions in each AWS account where the permission set is assigned. This ensures consistency and avoids issues during the assignment process.\n\nOption A aligns with this requirement by recommending the creation of the customer managed policy in every account where the permission set is assigned, with the same name and permissions. This approach helps in maintaining uniformity across accounts and resolving the assignment failure.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not directly address the need to create the customer managed policy in each account or ensure consistency across accounts, making option A the appropriate solution in this scenario.\n\n- ChatGPT"}]},{"poster":"kejam","comment_id":"1066955","timestamp":"1699593000.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer C\n\nNot A: AWS IAM Identity Center enables you to centrally manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts without configuring each account manually.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-accounts.html\n\nNot B: You can assign more than one permission set to a user.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsets.html\n\nNot D: A custom permission set can use up to 10 AWS managed or customer managed policies.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.html"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1053654","comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"when you're using permissionset you don't need to create the customer managed policy in every org manually. so its C","poster":"mynickc","timestamp":"1705361400.0","comment_id":"1123766","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"ahrentom","content":"have to correct me, the right one here is A","comment_id":"1069306","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1699879260.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nI would go with C here, seems to be the most logical anwser","poster":"ahrentom","timestamp":"1698232200.0"}],"answer":"A","question_id":225}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":288,"name":"AWS Certified Security - Specialty SCS-C02","provider":"Amazon","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","id":30,"isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":45},"__N_SSP":true}
