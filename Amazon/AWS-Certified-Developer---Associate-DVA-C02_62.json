Create an Amazon Cognito user pool, configure the Cognito Authorizer in API Gateway, and use the identity or access token.\n\nHere's why:\n\nCognito User Pools are designed for managing user identities and authentication. They handle user registration, login, and token generation securely. The tokens (ID and access tokens) generated by Cognito have built-in expiration mechanisms, automatically handling the refresh requirement.\n\nCognito Authorizer in API Gateway seamlessly integrates with Cognito User Pools. It verifies the tokens presented by the client, ensuring only authorized users can access protected resources.","comment_id":"1334742","upvote_count":"1","poster":"examuserss","timestamp":"1735642200.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-07-12 05:44:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/143757-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c02-topic-1/","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1720755840,"choices":{"B":"Create and maintain a database record for each user with a corresponding token and use an AWS Lambda authorizer in API Gateway.","D":"Create an IAM user for each API user, attach an invoke permissions policy to the API, and use an IAM authorizer in API Gateway.","A":"Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool, configure the Amazon Cognito Authorizer in API Gateway, and use the temporary credentials generated by the identity pool.","C":"Create an Amazon Cognito user pool, configure the Cognito Authorizer in API Gateway, and use the identity or access token."},"answer":"C","question_id":307,"exam_id":24,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"A company is developing an application that will be accessed through the Amazon API Gateway REST API.
