It is commonly used to implement caching layers in applications because it can provide fast, low-latency access to frequently accessed data. In this case, caching the most viewed products would allow the application to quickly retrieve this data without querying the RDS for MySQL database every time, which would reduce the load on the database and improve performance.\n\nHow it works: The application would update to use the ElastiCache for Redis cluster endpoint to store and retrieve the most viewed products. Redis supports various data structures, such as hashes, lists, and sets, which can be efficiently used to store the product data.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"examuserss"}],"question_text":"A developer is working on an ecommerce application that stores data in an Amazon RDS for MySQL cluster.
