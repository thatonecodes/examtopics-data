For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Ama-zon EC2) instances and then use this data to determine whether you should launch additional in-stances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money. In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics.
