Here's why:\n\nAWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) with a rate-based rule allows you to monitor and block traffic based on the rate of requests from different IP addresses.\nThe rate-based rule can help identify and block the excessive login attempts originating from a large number of IP addresses that change weekly.\nBy blocking traffic at the ALB level using AWS WAF, the traffic doesn't reach the application, reducing the load on your authentication service.\nThe rate-based rule can automatically adjust to changing patterns of attack without manual updates, providing an efficient solution.\nAWS WAF is designed for web application protection and allows you to create flexible rules to mitigate various types of attacks, making it a suitable choice for handling this scenario.","upvote_count":"7"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"career360guru","timestamp":"1732326480.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nUsing WAF with ALB is most operationally efficient.

The system is highly available in a fully redundant configuration across 12 servers in the companyâ€™s data center.\nThe system runs scheduled jobs, both hourly and daily, in addition to one-time requests from users. Scheduled jobs can take between 20 minutes and 2 hours to finish running and have tight SLAs. The scheduled jobs account for 65% of the system usage. User jobs typically finish running in less than 5 minutes and have no SLA. The user jobs account for 35% of system usage. During system failures, scheduled jobs must continue to meet SLAs. However, user jobs can be delayed.\nA solutions architect needs to move the system to Amazon EC2 instances and adopt a consumption-based model to reduce costs with no long-term commitments.

By creating an AWS WAF web ACL and configuring it to allow access only to the IP addresses of the trusted partners, the company can effectively block requests originating from unauthorized sources. Associating the web ACL with the API ensures that the filtering rules are applied to the API traffic.\n\nAdditionally, creating a resource policy with a request limit allows the company to set a maximum limit on the number of requests that can be made to the API within a given time frame. This helps mitigate the impact of potential botnet traffic, ensuring that the API is not overwhelmed with excessive requests.\n\nRequiring an API key on the POST method adds an extra layer of security by enforcing authentication for accessing the API.
