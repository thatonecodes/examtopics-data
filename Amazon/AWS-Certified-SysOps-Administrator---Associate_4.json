Scheduled scaling makes sense.\nScheduled scaling helps you to set up your own scaling schedule according to predictable load changes. For example, let's say that every week the traffic to your web application starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday. You can configure a schedule for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to increase capacity on Wednesday and decrease capacity on Friday.\n\nTo use scheduled scaling, you create scheduled actions. Scheduled actions are performed automatically as a function of date and time. When you create a scheduled action, you specify when the scaling activity should occur and the new desired, minimum, and maximum sizes for the scaling action. You can create scheduled actions that scale one time only or that scale on a recurring schedule.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html","poster":"princajen","timestamp":"1677734160.0","upvote_count":"13","comment_id":"656911"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nVote C.
