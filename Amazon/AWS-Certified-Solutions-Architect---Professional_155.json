It handles failover it by default based on dials and weights you set for endpoint groups and endpoints respectively. \n\"Failover\nWith a multi-Region active/active strategy, if your workload cannot operate in a Region, failover will route traffic away from the impacted Region to healthy Region(s). You can accomplish this with Route 53 by updating the DNS records. Make sure you set TTL (time to live) on these records low enough so that DNS resolvers will reflect your changes quickly enough to meet your RTO targets. Alternatively, you can use AWS Global Accelerator for routing and failover. It does not rely on DNS. Global Accelerator gives you two static IP addresses.

The application is showing an increase in the number of errors during PUT requests. Most of the PUT calls come from a small number of clients that are authenticated with specific API keys.\nA solutions architect has identified that a large number of the PUT requests originate from one client. The API is noncritical, and clients can tolerate retries of unsuccessful calls. However, the errors are displayed to customers and are causing damage to the API's reputation.\nWhat should the solutions architect recommend to improve the customer experience?","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"513779","content":"Put can’t be cached, better throttling","timestamp":"1640907120.0","poster":"Firelord","upvote_count":"11"},{"timestamp":"1644627720.0","content":"Answer A.
