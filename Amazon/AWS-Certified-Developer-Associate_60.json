The use of Amazon SQS provides a scalable and reliable queueing system, allowing you to handle varying API call rates and accommodate the restrictions imposed by the third-party service.\n\nTherefore, the most operationally efficient approach is to refactor the application using an Amazon SQS queue to control the rate of API calls made by the Lambda function.","poster":"pranay_2406"}],"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1684846860.0","poster":"pranay_2406","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt's B\nBy using an Amazon SQS queue, you can decouple the API calls from the Lambda function's execution and ensure that you stay within the API limits. Here's how the solution would work:\n\n1. Set up an Amazon SQS queue to hold the API calls. This queue will act as a buffer, allowing you to control the rate at which the API calls are made.\n\n2. Configure the Lambda function to periodically poll the Amazon SQS queue for messages. You can use the AWS SDK or AWS Lambda triggers to trigger the function when there are messages in the queue.\n\n3.
