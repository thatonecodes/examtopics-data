Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers.\n\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static and dynamic web content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos. By using CloudFront, the company can distribute the content of their website from edge locations that are closer to the users in Europe, reducing the loading times for these users.\n\nTo use CloudFront, the company can set up a custom origin pointing to their on-premises servers in the United States. CloudFront will then cache the content of the website at edge locations around the world and serve the content to users from the location that is closest to them.

Moving the website to S3 and implementing Cross-Region Replication would distribute the website's content across multiple regions, including Europe. S3 is primarily used for static content hosting, and it does not provide server-side processing capabilities necessary for dynamic website functionality.\n\nD.
