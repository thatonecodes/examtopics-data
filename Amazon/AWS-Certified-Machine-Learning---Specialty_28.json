Batch Transform can also scale down the instances when there are no files to process, so you only pay for the duration that the instances are actively processing files.\nBatch Transform is more cost-effective than Asynchronous Inference because Asynchronous Inference is designed for workloads with large payload sizes (up to 1GB) and long processing times (up to 15 minutes) that need near real-time responses. Asynchronous Inference queues incoming requests and processes them asynchronously, returning an output location as a response. Asynchronous Inference also autoscales the instance count to zero when there are no requests to process. However, Asynchronous Inference charges you for both request processing and request queuing time, which may be higher than Batch Transform for your use case.","comment_id":"985429"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"loict","timestamp":"1726065720.0","comment_id":"1004909","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

The Async inference seems promising but the size of telemetry file is not known.\n\nAs per https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-cost-optimization.html\n\n\"Use batch inference for workloads for which you need inference for a large set of data for processes that happen offline (that is, you donâ€™t need a persistent endpoint). You pay for the instance for the duration of the batch inference job\". As you pay for the batch job duration, cost should not be an issue with Batch transform.\n\n\"Use asynchronous inference for asynchronous workloads that process up to 1 GB of data (such as text corpus, image, video, and audio) that are latency insensitive and cost sensitive. With asynchronous inference, you can control costs by specifying a fixed number of instances for the optimal processing rate instead of provisioning for the peak.

In this case, the telemetry data for each device is collected hourly and can be processed in batches using SageMaker Batch Transform.

Sampling reduces the size of the initial dataset so that it fits into memory. For dimension reduction, the algorithm decreases the feature dimension of the data to reduce the footprint of the k-NN model in memory and inference latency.\"\n\" The main objective of k-NN's training is to construct the index. The index enables efficient lookups of distances between points whose values or class labels have not yet been determined and the k nearest points to use for inference.\"\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/k-nearest-neighbors.html"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nshould be C","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Aninina","comment_id":"800917","timestamp":"1675775820.0"}],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-02-07 14:17:00"}],"exam":{"provider":"Amazon","id":26,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":369,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","name":"AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty"},"currentPage":28},"__N_SSP":true}
