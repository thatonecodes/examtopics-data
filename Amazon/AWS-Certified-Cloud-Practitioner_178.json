The middle tier consists of the analytics engine that is used to access and analyze the data. The bottom tier of the architecture is the database server, where data is loaded and stored. Data is stored in two different types of ways: 1) data that is accessed frequently is stored in very fast storage (like SSD drives) and 2) data that is infrequently accessed is stored in a cheap object store, like Amazon S3. The data warehouse will automatically make sure that frequently accessed data is moved into the “fast” storage so query speed is optimized.","timestamp":"1673401560.0","comment_id":"771950","poster":"mwsd","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1663727040.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB and E as redshift is warehouse","poster":"kasiv"},{"comment_id":"674459","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nRedshift is a data warehouse service.","timestamp":"1663700580.0","poster":"BruTTus"},{"content":"Vote for B & E","poster":"sumanshu","timestamp":"1663335000.0","comment_id":"670875","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"667132","poster":"pancman","timestamp":"1662995160.0","comments":[{"poster":"Craig92866","comments":[{"upvote_count":"5","content":"Data warehouse is write once (batch) - reads frequently.
