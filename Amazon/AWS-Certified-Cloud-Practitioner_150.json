AWS provides several services and features to help create and define these policies, and two of the primary tools are Service Control Policies (SCPs) and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.\n\nService Control Policies (SCPs) are used to define permission guardrails across accounts in a Control Tower landing zone. With SCPs, you can limit permissions for IAM entities (users, groups, and roles) and the resources they can access. SCPs work as a whitelist, explicitly allowing access to only the specified resources and services, and denying access to all other resources and services. This helps to enforce compliance policies across all accounts and resources within the AWS Control Tower environment.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"873545","poster":"Guru4Cloud","timestamp":"1681818480.0"}],"answer_ET":"AB","unix_timestamp":1681818480,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/106571-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-773/","answer":"AB","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Service control policies (SCPs)","C":"Amazon Guard Duly","A":"AWS Config","E":"Security groups","D":"AWS Identity and Access Management (1AM)"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":18},{"id":"u40CmSXXCgKRU2vMVZnp","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/106570-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-774/","answer":"C","question_id":750,"exam_id":18,"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1681818180,"choices":{"D":"Place the resources in AWS edge locations that are closest to the company's headquarters.","A":"Place the resources in the AWS Region that is closest to the company's headquarters.
