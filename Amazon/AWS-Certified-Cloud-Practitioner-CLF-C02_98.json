It highlights one of the key benefits of cloud services: the ability to scale resources up or down based on actual demand, rather than having to predict and invest in infrastructure capacity ahead of time. This approach helps avoid the costs associated with over-provisioning (buying more capacity than needed) or under-provisioning (not having enough capacity to meet demand).","timestamp":"1734124500.0","poster":"Yak_Yeti"},{"comment_id":"1311930","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
