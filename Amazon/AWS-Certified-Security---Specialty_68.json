The question only states the VPC endpoint has been configured, not that the route tables have been configured. This still needs to be done, see:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/gateway-endpoints.html\n\n\"Traffic from your VPC to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB is routed to the gateway endpoint.

A VPC Endpoint for Amazon S3 enables instances in your VPC to use their private IP addresses to access S3 with no exposure to the public internet. AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to create a privately routed connection between the VPC and S3.\n\nThe issue described in the question arises because when the Lambda function requires access to S3, it is using the NAT Gateway instead of the VPC Endpoint. This is likely due to the route table of the private subnet pointing to the NAT Gateway for 0.0.0.0/0 (all IP address space), causing all traffic to be routed to the internet via the NAT Gateway, including traffic intended for S3.\n\nTo ensure the Lambda function uses the S3 VPC Endpoint and not the NAT Gateway, you should remove the route to the NAT Gateway from the route table of the private subnet that the Lambda function uses.
