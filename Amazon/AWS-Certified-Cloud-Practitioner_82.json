Amazon AppStream 2.0\n\nAmazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed service that allows you to stream interactive applications from the AWS cloud to low-end client devices without requiring the use of backend infrastructure or high-end client hardware. The service enables the company to deploy the application and make it accessible to students using lightweight, low-cost laptops. AppStream 2.0 allows you to stream desktop applications from AWS to any device, including web browsers, iOS and Android devices, and thin clients, which can help the company to meet the hardware requirements of its application and users."},{"timestamp":"1690607820.0","poster":"Pranava_GCP","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"966111","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Amazon AppStream 2.0\n\n\"AppStream 2.0 lets you move your desktop applications to AWS without rewriting them. It’s easy to install your applications on AppStream 2.0, set launch configurations, and make your applications available to users. AppStream 2.0 offers a wide selection of configuration options so you can select the instance type and auto-scale parameters that best match your application and end-user requirements. AppStream 2.0 allows you to launch applications in your own network, which means your applications can interact with your existing AWS resources.\"\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/faqs/?nc=sn&loc=7"},{"timestamp":"1674488220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"785558","poster":"Saif93","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the answer."},{"timestamp":"1670671680.0","poster":"Zonci","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"740920","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAppStream 2.0 runs on AWS with access to compute capabilities not available on local devices, which means that your applications run with consistently high performance. You can instantly scale locally and globally, and ensure that your users always get a low-latency experience.

Resource elasticity\n\n\"Most people, when thinking of cloud computing, think of the ease with which they can procure resources when needed. This is only one aspect to elasticity. The other aspect is to contract when they no longer need resources. Scale out and scale in. Scale up and scale down. Some services do this as part of their service: Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, Amazon SES, Amazon Aurora, etc. Some require vertical scaling, like Amazon RDS. Others integrate with AWS Auto Scaling, like Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, AWS Fargate, Amazon EKS, and Amazon DynamoDB. Amazon Aurora Serverless and Amazon Athena also qualify as elastic.\"\n\nhttps://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.elasticity.en.html"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Resource elasticity is an AWS value proposition that describes a user's ability to scale infrastructure based on demand.\n\nResource elasticity refers to the ability of a system or application to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand. This means that users can quickly add or remove computing resources to match their workload, and pay only for what they use. Resource elasticity is a key advantage of using cloud infrastructure, and is a fundamental aspect of the AWS platform.","timestamp":"1681761240.0","comment_id":"873052","poster":"Guru4Cloud"},{"poster":"Saif93","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674488280.0","comment_id":"785560","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer."},{"poster":"Zonci","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"740921","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrectt","timestamp":"1670671680.0"}],"choices":{"B":"Resource elasticity","C":"Decoupled architecture","D":"Global deployment","A":"Speed of innovation"},"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1670671680,"exam_id":18,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"sNqu5COwwZIrGv6FCVZ7","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/90991-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-466/","question_id":408,"unix_timestamp":1670748720,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"Madbo","upvote_count":"6","content":"B is the correct answer:\n- AWS allows you to apply tags to your resources to help organize them and identify their purpose.

Pay-as-you-go pricing\n\nAWS offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model for its technology services, which enables companies to replace upfront fixed expenses with variable expenses. This means that companies only pay for the resources they use and can scale up or down as needed, rather than having to invest in and maintain expensive infrastructure. This pay-as-you-go model can help companies to minimize costs and increase their flexibility.","poster":"NotMeAnyWay"},{"timestamp":"1672069380.0","poster":"dean192837","comment_id":"757609","content":"Selected Answer: C\npayg - c","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"longbob","comment_id":"743376","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFixed to variable = pay as you go","timestamp":"1670883300.0"},{"comment_id":"740926","content":"Selected Answer: C\npay as you go","poster":"Zonci","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1670671860.0"},{"comment_id":"740626","poster":"Josantru","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1670637840.0","content":"Correct: C"},{"poster":"RichC","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\npayg is correct?","comment_id":"740541","timestamp":"1670629200.0"}],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","exam_id":18,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/90860-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-topic-1-question-468/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1670629200,"question_text":"Which AWS benefit is demonstrated by on-demand technology services that enable companies to replace upfront fixed expenses with variable expenses?","choices":{"A":"High availability","D":"Global reach","C":"Pay-as-you-go pricing","B":"Economies of scale"},"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Amazon","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":988,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","id":18,"name":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner"},"currentPage":82},"__N_SSP":true}
