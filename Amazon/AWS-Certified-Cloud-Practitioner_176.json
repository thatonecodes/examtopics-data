Outbound data transfers without acceleration\nE. Compute resources that are currently in use\n\n\"There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. \"\n\"In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services within the same Region. There are some exceptions, so be sure to verify data transfer rates before beginning. Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the outbound data transfer rate. This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out.\"\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/how-aws-pricing-works/key-principles.html"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"952252","timestamp":"1689415680.0","poster":"meeju","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nD AND E for sure"},{"content":"Selected Answer: DE\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/how-aws-pricing-works/key-principles.html","comment_id":"940255","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1688235060.0"},{"content":"Answer: BE\nB.
