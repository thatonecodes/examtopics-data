Here's how it works:\n\nCreate a CloudWatch alarm: Set up a CloudWatch alarm with the desired configuration, specifying the metric to monitor (CPU utilization) and the threshold to trigger the alarm (average CPU utilization lower than 5% for a 30-minute period).\n\nDefine the action: Configure the alarm to stop the EC2 instances when the threshold is breached. This can be done by specifying an Amazon EC2 action to stop the instances associated with the alarm.\n\nBy implementing this solution, the EC2 instances will be automatically stopped when their average CPU utilization falls below 5% for a continuous 30-minute period. This indicates that the instances are not being actively utilized and can be safely stopped to save costs and resources.","comment_id":"939147","timestamp":"1719757740.0"}],"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1688135340,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/113766-exam-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-topic-1/"},{"id":"NxFkjLdY3DLpSYQyRMac","timestamp":"2022-09-03 01:32:00","question_images":[],"question_id":257,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Use Provisioned IOPS on the storage volumes that support the DB cluster to improve performance sufficiently to support the peak load on the application.","A":"Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster in front of the DB cluster.

This means if one AZ has issues, RDS will automatically fail over to the standby in another AZ with minimal disruption and without manual intervention. Additionally, RDS handles backups automatically and stores them for a user-defined period, which can be restored as needed. Updating the application's connection string to the new RDS instance completes the migration process from EC2 to RDS. While snapshotting the EBS volume frequently does help to minimize data loss, this option does NOT provide a QUICK failover solution in case of a database failure. Recovery time would include the process of provisioning a new EC2 instance and attaching the restored EBS volume, which can be time-consuming and also may result in data loss since the last snapshot.","poster":"numark","comment_id":"1321821","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"B by chatGpto4\nConclusion:\nOption B (RDS Multi-AZ): Using Amazon RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance offers the most operationally efficient and robust solution to minimize data loss and downtime.
