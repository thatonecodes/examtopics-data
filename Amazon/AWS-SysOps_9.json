As per link below, alludes to B : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/con-bill-blended-rates.html\n\n\"The preceding example shows how using consolidated billing in AWS Organizations helps lower the overall monthly cost of storage. If you calculate the cost for each member account separately, the total cost is $7,660 rather than $6,720. By aggregating the usage of the three accounts, you reach the lower-priced tiers sooner. The most expensive storage, the first TB, is charged at the highest price just once, rather than three times. For example, three TB of storage at the most expensive rate of $100/TB would result in a charge of $300. Charging this storage as 1 TB ($100) and two additional TB at $80 ($160) results in a total charge of $260.\"\"","poster":"Finger41","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1733718900.0","comment_id":"613594"},{"timestamp":"1728203280.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt is (B) definitely.

By setting up a consolidated billing structure, the finance department can have a single paying account that is linked to all the other accounts.\n\nUsing IAM cross account access with roles, the finance department can grant appropriate permissions to each department's AWS account. This allows the departments to access and manage their own resources while maintaining centralized control over billing. The finance department can assign the appropriate cost center information to each account and easily track the costs associated with each department.\n\nThis approach provides better isolation, management, and cost separation between the different departments within the organization.","timestamp":"1717364640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"albert_kuo","comment_id":"913049","comments":[{"comment_id":"1003699","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725944220.0","content":"Change to A","poster":"albert_kuo"}]},{"content":"I'm going with A.","timestamp":"1667383440.0","comment_id":"398638","upvote_count":"1","poster":"xxxdolorxxx"},{"content":"A.
