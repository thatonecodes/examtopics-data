BeginResponse Function: Publishes to a single SNS topic when it completes its processing.\n 2. SNS Fan-Out: The SNS topic sends the message to multiple SQS queues, one for each dependent Lambda function.\n 3. SQS Queues and Lambda: Each Lambda function is subscribed to its respective SQS queue and processes messages independently.\n 4. Retry and Concurrency: SQS queues ensure messages are retried if processing fails, and Lambda concurrency can be tuned for each queue.","comment_id":"1326804","timestamp":"1734261540.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Ky_24"}],"unix_timestamp":1734261540,"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Create an AWS Step Functions Standard Workflow.
