It uses CloudFormation under the hood, so it is a way to simplify the process of creating, updating, and deploying CloudFormation templates. CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to any instance, including on-premises instances and Lambda functions.\nWith AWS SAM you can use the built-in CodeDeploy to deploy new versions of the Lambda function, gradually shift traffic to the new version, and use pre-traffic and post-traffic test functions to verify code.\nYou can also define CloudWatch Alarms to trigger a rollback in case of any issues.\nThis allows for a faster and more efficient deployment process, as well as a more reliable rollback process when errors are identified. This way you can increase the speed of deployment and reduce the time to detect and revert when errors are identified."},{"comment_id":"1308233","poster":"TariqKipkemei","timestamp":"1730954460.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nkeywords:\n'Code deployment, reduce deployment time, rollback, serverless' = AWS Serverless Application Model, AWS CodeDeploy"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"844771","timestamp":"1727062260.0","poster":"5up3rm4n","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/automating-updates-to-serverless-apps.html\n\nAWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) comes built-in with CodeDeploy to provide gradual AWS Lambda deployments.
