It never automatically recovers its health. You can intervene manually by calling the SetInstanceHealth action (or the set-instance-health command) to set the instance's health status back to healthy. If the instance is already terminating, you get an error. Because the interval between marking an instance unhealthy and its actual termination is so small, attempting to set an instance's health status back to healthy with the SetInstanceHealth action (or, set-instance-health command) is probably useful only for a suspended group.
