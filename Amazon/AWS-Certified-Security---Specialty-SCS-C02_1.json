IAM role for Lambda with policy: This is the most common and recommended approach. You create an IAM role specifically for the Lambda function, then attach an IAM policy to the role that grants the necessary read and write permissions to the S3 bucket. Lambda functions assume this role when they are executed and can then interact with the S3 bucket.\n\nD. IAM role for Lambda with a bucket policy: Another valid approach is to create an IAM role for the Lambda function and attach a bucket policy to the S3 bucket that allows access from the Lambda function's role. The bucket policy explicitly grants access to the function's role, so no IAM role-specific permissions are needed for the Lambda function itself, although this option is less common than the previous one.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1380805","timestamp":"1741608900.0","poster":"PrabhuKK"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nfor sure this will be the use of AWS ROLES it is simple, you attach a role to the lambda to be able to access certain S3 bucket.","timestamp":"1726759980.0","comment_id":"1079460","poster":"awssecuritynewbie","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1724261400.0","comment_id":"1270302","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC and D","poster":"FunkyFresco","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1220022","content":"Selected Answer: CD\n100% it is C and D","timestamp":"1716876840.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"shailvardhan"},{"comment_id":"1187165","poster":"leaddev","content":"C & D are the correct answers","timestamp":"1711942920.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1707494940.0","poster":"Raphaello","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1145622","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nCD\nAlways create execution role for your lambda function, as a best practice."},{"content":"Respuesta seleccionada: CD","poster":"aescudero51","timestamp":"1707430980.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1145071"},{"comment_id":"1068992","timestamp":"1699845000.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nAnswer is CD","poster":"Daniel76"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"lalee2","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nsame account. for ABAC IAM role w/ policy will do.
