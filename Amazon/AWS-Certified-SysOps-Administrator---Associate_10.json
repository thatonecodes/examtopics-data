The new Lambda function can be created with minimal configuration, and the Amazon CloudWatch Events rule can be set up to trigger the function hourly. If the timestamp of the newest file in the S3 bucket is more than an hour ago, the function will publish a message to an Amazon SNS topic to notify the application team. This approach avoids complex configurations and dependencies on other AWS services, making it easier to manage and maintain over time.","poster":"thetnyeinmoe","comments":[{"comment_id":"1018728","upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1695812580.0","poster":"ad45","content":"You chose the D answer, we're talking about \"most operationally\" solution and the answer D uses 3 services instead of 2 like the answer C.
