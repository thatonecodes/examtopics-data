Spot Instances allow users to bid on unused EC2 capacity, often resulting in significantly lower prices compared to On-Demand or Reserved Instances. Since the workload in this scenario is experimental and can be stopped after 12 hours, leveraging Spot Instances enables the company to take advantage of cost savings without compromising performance or reliability. Additionally, Spot Instances can be terminated with a two-minute notification, which aligns well with the requirement to stop the instance after a specific duration. Overall, Spot Instances provide a cost-effective solution for running flexible and transient workloads like experimental tasks.","poster":"moadabdou"},{"poster":"bd009999","timestamp":"1708019400.0","comment_id":"1151185","upvote_count":"4","content":"continuously run and stop, so here you still need underlying data / EBS volume intact.
