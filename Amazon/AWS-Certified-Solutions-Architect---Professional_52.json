It provides additional dedicated capacity for EBS IO.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a user launches an EBS optimized instance with EC2, it means that the instance has been configured to provide additional dedicated capacity for Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) I/O (Input/Output) operations. This enables the instance to deliver more consistent and higher EBS performance compared to non-EBS optimized instances.\n\nBy using an EBS optimized instance, the user can maximize the I/O throughput for their EBS volumes. This is particularly beneficial for applications that require intensive and predictable I/O performance, such as database workloads.\n\nThe other options mentioned (B, C, and D) are not correct statements regarding EBS optimization. EBS optimization does not directly impact the storage capacity of attached EBS volumes, the type of EBS volume (PIOPS or not), or the placement of the instance on dedicated hardware in a VPC.","poster":"SkyZeroZx","comment_id":"924799","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1686882360.0"},{"poster":"cldy","upvote_count":"1","content":"A.

In other words, you can create, update, or delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, or deleting stacks. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template. A stack, for instance, can include all the resources required to run a web application, such as a web server, a database, and networking rules. If you no longer require that web application, you can simply delete the stack, and all of its related resources are deleted.
