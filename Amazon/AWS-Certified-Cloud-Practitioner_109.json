Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)\n\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS allows you to send, store, and receive messages between application components, which aligns with the company's requirement to send, store, and receive messages between application components. Additionally, SQS provides a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue that guarantees that messages are processed in the order they are sent, which aligns with the company's requirement to process messages in FIFO order. SQS is a highly available and scalable service that can handle millions of messages per second, making it a suitable option for the company's application.","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","upvote_count":"9","comment_id":"783465","timestamp":"1674314280.0"},{"comment_id":"1152369","timestamp":"1708146000.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"chini786","content":"hangN Highly Voted 2 years, 3 months ago\nYou can now use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) FIFO topics, in combination with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues, to build applications that require messages to be sent and processed in a strict sequence and without duplicates.

Use EC2 instances in the same edge location and the same AWS Region.\n\nTo minimize network latency between Amazon EC2 instances, it is recommended to use EC2 instances in the same edge location and the same AWS Region. An edge location is a specific point of presence where AWS has a presence in a given geographic area. Placing the EC2 instances in the same edge location ensures that network traffic between them stays within the same geographical area, reducing latency.
