These execution environments are ready to respond immediately to incoming function requests. Provisioned concurrency is useful for reducing cold start latencies for functions. Configuring provisioned concurrency incurs additional charges to your AWS account.","poster":"xdeveloper","comment_id":"1332459","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1735312560.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-12-27 16:16:00","isMC":true},{"id":"GgzZwgDkk0pVNUcS9eIm","timestamp":"2025-02-06 09:38:00","unix_timestamp":1738831080,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","question_id":467,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/156020-exam-aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c02-topic-1/","exam_id":24,"answer_description":"","question_text":"A developer is building a three-tier application with an Application Load Balancer (ALB), Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon RDS.
