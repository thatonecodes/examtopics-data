IAM supports identity federation through SAML 2.0, which allows users to access AWS resources and third-party applications using a single sign-on (SSO) experience ¹. With IAM, you can create a SAML identity provider (IdP) that represents your organization's identity management system, and configure it to establish trust between your organization and AWS ¹. You can then use IAM roles to grant permissions to your users to access AWS resources and third-party applications, and use SAML assertions to authenticate users and provide them with temporary security credentials ¹. \n\nI hope this helps!","poster":"Tampokomiks","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nWeb-based single sign-on (SSO) to the AWS Management Console from your organization. Users can sign in to a portal in your organization hosted by a SAML 2.0–compatible IdP, select an option to go to AWS, and be redirected to the console without having to provide additional sign-in information. You can use a third-party SAML IdP to establish SSO access to the console or you can create a custom IdP to enable console access for your external users.","comment_id":"1071223","poster":"abbey0922","timestamp":"1700036520.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","timestamp":"1700024340.0","comment_id":"1071098","poster":"asdfcdsxdfc","upvote_count":"2"}],"choices":{"C":"AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On)","B":"Amazon Cognito","A":"AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)","D":"AWS CLI"},"question_id":80,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":19,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/126204-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-topic-1/","question_text":"A company needs a central user portal so that users can log in to third-party business applications that support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0.\n\nWhich AWS service will meet this requirement?","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1700024340,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-11-15 05:59:00","answers_community":["C (51%)","B (49%)"]}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":718,"provider":"Amazon","name":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"id":19},"currentPage":16},"__N_SSP":true}
