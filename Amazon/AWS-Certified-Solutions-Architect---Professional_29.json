Mongo DB.\n\nPIOPS (Provisioned IOPS) EBS volumes are designed for applications that require low-latency and consistent I/O performance. They are a good fit for database workloads that require high I/O operations, such as MongoDB, which often have demanding read and write patterns.\n\nOption A, Analytics, typically involves processing large volumes of data and may benefit more from high throughput rather than consistent low-latency I/O provided by PIOPS volumes.\n\nOption B, System boot volume, doesn't necessarily require the high I/O performance offered by PIOPS volumes. Standard EBS volumes are typically sufficient for boot volumes.\n\nOption D, Log processing, can vary depending on the specific requirements of the log processing application.
