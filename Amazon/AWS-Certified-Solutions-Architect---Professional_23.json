It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the user has defined. An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that the user can attach to an instance in a VPC. An ENI can include attributes such as: a primary private IP address, one or more secondary private IP addresses, one elastic IP address per private IP address, one public IP address, one or more security groups, a MAC address, a source/destination check flag, and a description. The user can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another instance. The attributes of a network interface follow the network interface as it is attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance. Thus, the user can maintain a fixed MAC using the network interface.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html","topic":"1","question_text":"An organization is purchasing licensed software.
