Test systems at production scale.\nD. Drive architecture design based on data collected about the workload behavior and requirements.\n\n\"Test systems at production scale: In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only pay for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises.\"\n\n\"Drive architectures using data: In the cloud, you can collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and improvements over time.\"\n\nhttps://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.design_principles.wa-dp.en.html"},{"timestamp":"1689767760.0","comment_id":"956581","poster":"Dar87","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB and d","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1688064360.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nhttps://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.design_principles.wa-dp.en.html\n\nZONCI, STOP USING CHATGPT, USE YOUR BRAIN!","comment_id":"938464","poster":"[Removed]"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nDrive architecture design based on data collected about the workload behavior and requirements: This principle emphasizes the importance of gathering data and understanding the behavior and requirements of your workload before making architectural decisions. By analyzing data, you can make informed design choices that align with the specific needs of your workload, leading to more effective and efficient solutions.\n\nMake AWS Cloud architectural decisions static, one-time events: This principle highlights the significance of making well-thought-out architectural decisions upfront. Architectural decisions should not be treated as one-time events but rather as ongoing considerations throughout the lifecycle of your application. It emphasizes the need for careful planning and taking a proactive approach to ensure long-term success in the AWS Cloud.","poster":"Zonci","timestamp":"1686116820.0","comment_id":"916916"}],"unix_timestamp":1686067500,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"BD","answers_community":["BD (92%)","8%"],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"xtarY8Q9zjEohcLd2jU1","topic":"1","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1690803660.0","poster":"Pranava_GCP","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
