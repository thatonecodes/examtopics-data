AWS CloudTrail logs\n\nAWS CloudTrail logs provide a record of all the AWS Management Console sign-in events and API calls made in the AWS account. CloudTrail logs can be used to report on events that involve specific AWS services that a company uses. The company can use CloudTrail logs with Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and alert on specific activities that occur within their AWS environment.\n\nCloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS.
