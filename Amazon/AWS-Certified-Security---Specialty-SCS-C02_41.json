While this will disconnect the instance from the network, preventing further communication, deleting ENIs could have unintended consequences, such as disrupting the instance's availability or interrupting legitimate processes. \nC: Detaching the EBS volumes could prevent the malware from accessing persistent storage, and terminating the instance would stop the malware from running. This is a more thorough isolation and remediation approach. Adding a tag to the EBS volumes can also help with tracking and auditing. However, simply detaching EBS volumes might not prevent the malware from spreading if the instance is not immediately terminated.
