By default, these health checks use the results of EC2 instance status checks to determine the health of an instance. If you use a load balancer with your Auto Scaling group, you can optionally choose to include the results of Elastic Load Balancing health checks.\nAuto Scaling marks an instance unhealthy if the calls to the Amazon EC2 action DescribeInstanceStatus returns any other state other than running, the system status shows impaired, or the calls to Elastic Load Balancing action DescribeInstanceHealth returns OutOfService in the instance state field.\nAfter an instance is marked unhealthy because of an Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing health check, it is scheduled for replacement.\nYou can customize the health check conducted by your Auto Scaling group by specifying additional checks or by having your own health check system and then sending the instance's health information directly from your system to Auto Scaling.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/healthcheck.html","question_text":"After moving an E-Commerce website for a client from a dedicated server to AWS you have also set up auto scaling to perform health checks on the instances in your group and replace instances that fail these checks.
