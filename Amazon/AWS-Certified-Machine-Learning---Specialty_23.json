They can adjust the model hyperparameters and look for lower inference times. They can also use SageMaker Model Monitor for visibility into the ModelLatency metric and OverheadLatency metric of the model after the model is deployed. However, option C, which suggests computing the filter ranks based on the training outputs and applying pruning to remove the low-ranking filters, is not applicable for transfer learning models since the layers in the pre-trained model are already trained and cannot be changed. Therefore, the correct solution is B.","timestamp":"1714108740.0","poster":"Gaby999","comments":[{"comment_id":"972158","timestamp":"1722775560.0","content":"better not use chatgpt without knowing something of AWS, it will trick you","upvote_count":"3","poster":"ccpmad"}],"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"881137"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Valcilio","comment_id":"833919","timestamp":"1709985180.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nEven if a better machine could help, the problem is about the model, not about the general or the machine in specific."},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"AjoseO","content":"Selected Answer: C\nUsing SageMaker Debugger, the company can monitor the training process and evaluate the performance of the model by computing filter ranks based on information like weights, gradients, biases, and activation outputs. \n\nAfter identifying the low-ranking filters, the company can apply pruning to remove them and set new weights. \n\nBy doing so, the company can reduce the model size and improve the inference time.
