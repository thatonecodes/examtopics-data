The company has separate units for software development. The company uses AWS Organizations and federation with SAML to give permissions to developers to manage resources in their AWS accounts. The development units each deploy their production workloads into a common production account.\nRecently, an incident occurred in the production account in which members of a development unit terminated an EC2 instance that belonged to a different development unit. A solutions architect must create a solution that prevents a similar incident from happening in the future. The solution also must allow developers the possibility to manage the instances used for their workloads.\nWhich strategy will meet these requirements?","answer_description":"","question_id":760,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1629422400,"answer_ET":"B"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"name":"AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional","provider":"Amazon","isImplemented":true,"id":32,"numberOfQuestions":1019},"currentPage":152},"__N_SSP":true}
