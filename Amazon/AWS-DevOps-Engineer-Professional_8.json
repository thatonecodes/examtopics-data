The company has historically created AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower through the AWS Management Console. The company wants to implement an automated solution that will create new AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower Account Factory.\n\nA DevOps engineer is testing a new approach in which employees will upload a csv file into an Amazon S3 bucket. The .csv file will contain the information that is necessary to create a new AWS account. An AWS Lambda function will process event notifications from Amazon S3 when new files are created in the S3 bucket. The Lambda function will create the AWS account by using the AWS Service Catalog APIs.\n\nThe DevOps engineer needs to implement a solution to publish a notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the account creation process ends successfully.\n\nWhat should the DevOps engineer do to automate the SNS notification?","answer_description":"","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_id":36,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1676646840.0","comment_id":"812045","content":"I thought B but it is clearly D\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/mt/using-lifecycle-events-to-track-aws-control-tower-actions-and-trigger-automated-workflows/","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mark1000"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD - CreateManagedAccount: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to create and provision a new account using account factory.","timestamp":"1675684920.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"799685","poster":"DerekKey"},{"poster":"Bulti","timestamp":"1674611760.0","comment_id":"787182","upvote_count":"2","content":"D is correct."},{"comment_id":"760472","upvote_count":"3","poster":"strike3test","timestamp":"1672275540.0","content":"D is correct\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/lifecycle-events.html#create-managed-account"},{"poster":"Imstack","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1671806880.0","content":"D - correct","comment_id":"754305"}],"unix_timestamp":1671806880,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/92584-exam-aws-devops-engineer-professional-topic-1-question-130/","timestamp":"2022-12-23 15:48:00"},{"id":"KvhpZ6JWlmDrd4yMf5Bw","exam_id":35,"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A company has microservices running in AWS Lambda that read data from Amazon DynamoDB.
