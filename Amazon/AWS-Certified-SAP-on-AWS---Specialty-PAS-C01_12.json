However, AWS Config does not have built-in functionality to monitor SAP system parameters, so you would need to create custom rules for this purpose. AWS Config can then use Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) to trigger notifications via Amazon SNS when a resource is found to be noncompliant.
