Encrypt the environment variables by using AWS Secrets Manager. Set up automatic rotation in Secrets Manager.\n\nExplanation:\nAWS Secrets Manager is designed specifically for securely managing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets. It provides:\n\nBuilt-in encryption using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).\nAutomatic rotation of secrets with minimal effort. Secrets Manager has a native feature for automatic rotation that can be enabled for supported use cases.\nIntegration with AWS services (e.g., Lambda, RDS, etc.).\nKey Features Satisfying the Requirements:\n\nThe sensitive API keys can be stored securely as secrets.\nAutomatic rotation can be set up without requiring custom development. Secrets Manager handles rotation using Lambda functions configured for this purpose.","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAWS KMS supports key rotation","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1322359","poster":"YUICH","timestamp":"1733402280.0","content":"While KMS enables automatic key rotation, it does not manage secrets.
