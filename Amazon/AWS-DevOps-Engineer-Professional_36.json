There is nothing that suggests that the code needs to be deployed simultaneously in both environments. It just says automatically to both environments. That doesn't mean the pull request from a feature branch needs to be created against both test and prod at the same time. What A will enable us to do is have the feature engineer submit a pull request into the test branch and have the admin user of the tear branch review and approve the pull request. This should automatically start the deployment into the test environment. Once the code is full tested by the QA resource in the test environment, they will initiate a pull request into the Prod environment. The prod environment admin user will review and approve the pull request at which point the code will be automatically deployment to the Prod environment.

OpsWorks provides a framework for defining and managing applications using Chef or Puppet, allowing for automated configuration and deployment.\n\nOn the other hand, option D involves using AWS Elastic Beanstalk with a custom AMI. While Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the deployment and management of applications, it may still require some initial configuration and setup time for the custom AMI. This could potentially result in longer configuration times compared to using OpsWorks for automated configuration.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"906191","timestamp":"1684969740.0","poster":"easytoo"},{"timestamp":"1675952880.0","comment_id":"803314","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is corretct","poster":"bihani"},{"content":"Pre-baked EC2 instances along with node.js points to Elastic BeanStalk.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674318480.0","content":"Answer is D","comment_id":"783533","poster":"Bulti"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674318420.0","poster":"Bulti","comment_id":"783532"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1635998040.0","poster":"oopsy","comment_id":"447427","content":"Go D -1"},{"poster":"Dantehilary","content":"I think the answer is A, D is wrong because THERE IS NOTHING LIKE Elastic Beanstalk load balance","comment_id":"374347","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"4","content":"They refer to a LB created by Beanstalk","comment_id":"403972","poster":"siejas","timestamp":"1635887940.0"}],"timestamp":"1635886080.0"},{"timestamp":"1635844380.0","comment_id":"322347","poster":"poylan","upvote_count":"1","content":"i'll go with D"},{"upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"320264","timestamp":"1635830520.0","content":"I'll go with D)\nCreating AMI is always a good practice when instances took up to 20 minutes to become fully configured...","poster":"WhyIronMan"},{"comment_id":"318240","poster":"glam","timestamp":"1635730320.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"D.

May be like fetching some application artifacts from internet, and installing them. This is good but not the best way to configure your instance during booting with user data. The best way is to create a custom IMAGE with preconfigured applications. Then when you lunch the custom image, it automatically come with existing applications, thus reducing time to boot. For instance, AMI from AWS are preconfigured with cloud watch log agent. You don’t need to install it once you lunch AWS ima.
