Grant access to the custom model in Amazon Bedrock.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSince the company has trained a custom model to enhance summarization and wants to use it through Amazon Bedrock, they must grant access to the custom model within Bedrock so it can be used for inference.\n • Amazon Bedrock allows fine-tuning of base models → After fine-tuning, the custom model must be registered and access must be granted.\n • Ensures secure and controlled model usage → This step enables API access for the custom summarization model.\n • Bedrock manages model deployment internally → The model does not need an Amazon SageMaker endpoint for use within Bedrock.","timestamp":"1741317360.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Jessiii","comment_id":"1355384","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
