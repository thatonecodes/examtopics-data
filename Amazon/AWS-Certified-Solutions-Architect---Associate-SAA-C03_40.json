Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function on a schedule. Configure the Lambda function to send the EC2 Auto Scaling status data directly to Amazon S3.\n\nThis approach will use a serverless solution (AWS Lambda) which will not affect the speed of EC2 instance launches. It will use the EventBridge rule to invoke the Lambda function on schedule to send the data to S3. This will meet the requirement of near-real-time updates in a dashboard as well. The Lambda function can be triggered by CloudWatch events that are emitted when Auto Scaling events occur. The function can then collect the necessary data and store it in S3.
