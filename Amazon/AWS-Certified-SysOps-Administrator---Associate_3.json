Credentials Management\nWhy AWS Secrets Manager?\nAWS Secrets Manager is designed specifically to manage, store, and automatically rotate database credentials securely. It is the most suitable solution for the requirement to rotate credentials monthly for an Amazon RDS instance.\nAWS Key Management Service (KMS) is used for encrypting data, not managing database credentials. Thus, KMS does not meet the credentials rotation requirement.\n2. Handling Write-Intensive Traffic and Connection Spikes\nWhy RDS Proxy?\nRDS Proxy manages database connections efficiently by pooling and reusing connections, which is critical for applications with variable and spiking client connections.\nIt helps in reducing the database's memory and CPU overhead, especially during sudden connection surges.\nRead replicas are useful for scaling read-only workloads, but they do not assist with write-intensive traffic or connection pooling.","poster":"muznorton"},{"poster":"RM999","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct option","timestamp":"1721729460.0","comment_id":"1129491","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"tamng","timestamp":"1719790020.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1110922","content":"C is correct"},{"timestamp":"1707780480.0","comment_id":"979591","poster":"jipark","content":"Selected Answer: C\nwhy not A : \nAWS KMS is used for encryption key management rather than credential rotation.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1690486080.0","content":"C is right","poster":"Ajit1207","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"790018"},{"poster":"michaldavid","timestamp":"1686456660.0","comment_id":"741458","content":"Selected Answer: C\ncccccccc","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Liongeek","comment_id":"720252","content":"Ans: C","timestamp":"1684296420.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Surferbolt","comment_id":"697259","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_turn-on-for-db.html","timestamp":"1681725480.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSecret Manager can rotate secret in database.","poster":"bakjeeone","timestamp":"1680482160.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"685131"},{"timestamp":"1679944320.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"718317","content":"KMS does not handle database credentials.
