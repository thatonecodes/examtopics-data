Customers send the ticket requests to an Amazon API Gateway API with an AWS Lambda function that acknowledges the order and generates an order ID. The application includes two additional Lambda functions: one for inventory management and one for payment processing. These two Lambda functions run in parallel and write the order to an Amazon Dynamo DB table.\n\nThe application must provide seats to customers according to the following requirements. If a seat is accidently sold more than once, the first order that the application received must get the seat. In these cases, the application must process the payment for only the first order. However, if the first order is rejected during payment processing, the second order must get the seat. In these cases, the application must process the payment for the second order.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1669294020,"exam_id":25,"timestamp":"2022-11-24 13:47:00","topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nSNS + SQS = Fan Out pattern.
