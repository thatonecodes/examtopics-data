You can create a root stack that references and manages multiple nested stacks. This approach simplifies the management and deployment of multiple interdependent templates in the correct order.\nStackSets: CloudFormation StackSets allow you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple AWS accounts and regions with a single operation.
