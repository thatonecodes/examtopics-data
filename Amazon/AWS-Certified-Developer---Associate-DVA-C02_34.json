Immutable: In an immutable deployment, AWS Elastic Beanstalk deploys the application version to a fresh group of instances in a new Auto Scaling group. Once the new instances pass health checks, they are moved to the existing Auto Scaling group, and the old instances are terminated. This approach ensures that new instances are used for the deployment, minimizing the impact on the existing environment.\n\nD. Blue/Green: Blue/green deployment involves deploying the new version of the application to a separate environment (the \"green\" environment). Once the new environment is ready and tested, the traffic is switched from the old environment (the \"blue\" environment) to the new one. This type of deployment is effective for ensuring that the new version is deployed on new instances and provides a straightforward way to rollback if needed.","poster":"SerialiDr","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1132751"},{"comment_id":"1402345","poster":"otabek94_30","timestamp":"1742744580.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nWhy BD?
