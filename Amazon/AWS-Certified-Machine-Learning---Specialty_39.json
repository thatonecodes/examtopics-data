Introducing a small L2 regularization parameter (Option D) is a more appropriate solution based on AWS documentation and industry best practices","comment_id":"1179229","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711025160.0","poster":"F1Fan"},{"poster":"endeesa","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1082942","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSeems like a problem of too much regularization, so I would start by decreasing L1","timestamp":"1701204240.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1076626","poster":"wimalik","timestamp":"1700597400.0","content":"Ans: B\nDecreasing the L1 regularization parameter would reduce the penalization on the coefficients, allowing some features to contribute to the model without being driven to zero.
