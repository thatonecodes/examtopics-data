Design for failure.\n\nUsing Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups to manage a fleet of web servers running on Amazon EC2 is an example of designing for failure. This is because the Auto Scaling group automatically increases or decreases the number of instances in response to changes in demand for the application. This ensures that the application has the required capacity to handle traffic, and also automatically replaces instances that fail, without manual intervention. This practice helps to build a more resilient and fault-tolerant architecture that can withstand unexpected failures, and automatically recover from them. This aligns with the Design for Failure best practice of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.","comment_id":"783343"},{"poster":"MiniYang","content":"The answer is A. \nBased on the meaning of the question, the most direct and correct answer should be A.

Secure the workload\n\n\"Stop guessing capacity: A common cause of failure in on-premises workloads is resource saturation, when the demands placed on a workload exceed the capacity of that workload (this is often the objective of denial of service attacks).
