However, if you want to exceed throughput rates of 10,000 write capacity units or 10,000 read capacity units for an individual table, you must first contact Amazon. If you want to provision more than 20,000 write capacity units or 20,000 read capacity units from a single subscriber account, you must first contact us to request a limit increase.","comment_id":"40780"},{"poster":"amministrazione","timestamp":"1723810320.0","comment_id":"1267031","content":"C.

To run a DB instance under the BYOL model, you must have the appropriate Oracle Database license (with Software Update License & Support) for the DB instance class and Oracle Database edition you wish to run. You must also follow Oracle's policies for licensing Oracle Database software in the cloud computing environment. DB instances reside in the Amazon EC2 environment, and Oracle's licensing policy for Amazon EC2 is located here.\nLicense Included: In the \"License Included\" service model, you do not need separately purchased Oracle licenses; the Oracle Database software has been licensed by AWS. \"License Included\" pricing is inclusive of software, underlying hardware resources, and Amazon RDS management capabilities.","timestamp":"1635072840.0","comment_id":"40781","poster":"CloudFloater"},{"comment_id":"1267033","content":"A.
