AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that enables the company to control and manage access to AWS resources. IAM allows the company to create and manage users, groups and roles, and to grant permissions to those groups and roles. This enables the company to grant permissions to a group of users, rather than having to grant permissions individually to each user. With IAM, the company can create IAM users and groups and then grant permissions to those groups using policies. This allows the company to grant permissions to a set of users as a group, which helps to simplify the process of managing access to resources.","comment_id":"782449","poster":"NotMeAnyWay"},{"timestamp":"1672253460.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions_overview.html\n\n\"An account administrator can control access to AWS resources by attaching permissions policies to IAM identities (users, groups, and roles).\"","comment_id":"760215","poster":"ChiragVisavadiya"},{"timestamp":"1670201520.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSecurity groups are for instances.","poster":"Aasvogel","comment_id":"735556","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"dark_cherrymon","timestamp":"1669861320.0","comment_id":"732175","content":"Selected Answer: A\naaaaaaaaaaa","comments":[{"timestamp":"1679554260.0","comment_id":"847887","poster":"et_learner","content":"A is infra layer, not organization layer. so you are totally WRONG!!!","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"SalesforceMaster","comment_id":"731243","comments":[{"comment_id":"906066","upvote_count":"1","content":"A applies to EC2 instances, not to the wider scope given in this question.","timestamp":"1684949040.0","poster":"lwf2"}],"timestamp":"1669798500.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA, is correct, IAM users are individual access credentials to the account."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nagreed","poster":"JA2018","timestamp":"1668581460.0","comment_id":"719394"}],"answers_community":["B (94%)","6%"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Security groups","D":"AWS Security Hub","B":"AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)","C":"Resource groups"},"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-11-16 07:51:00","question_text":"A company wants to organize its users so that the company can grant permissions to the users as a group.\nWhich AWS service or tool can the company use to meet this requirement?","question_id":218},{"id":"f875fVg5YaBgsv9IqqdA","question_images":[],"exam_id":18,"choices":{"E":"AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)","A":"AWS Artifact","C":"AWS Config","D":"AWS CloudTrail","B":"AWS Trusted Advisor"},"answer_description":"","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1668581520,"answer_ET":"CD","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1668581520.0","poster":"JA2018","upvote_count":"9","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nagreed\n\nAWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to enable security and governance.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=+AWS+Elastic+Beanstalk+vs+aws+config&rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG1031SG1031&ei=RJR0Y6eiM8uSseMPhfOckAo&ved=0ahUKEwin1J3bmbL7AhVLSWwGHYU5B6IQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=+AWS+Elastic+Beanstalk+vs+aws+config&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIECCEQFToECAAQQzoFCAAQgAQ6BggAEBYQHjoFCAAQhgM6BQghEKABOggIIRAWEB4QHToKCCEQFhAeEA8QHToHCAAQHhCiBDoFCAAQogQ6BgghEA0QFUoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWIxCYJZEaABwAXgAgAHpAYgBtAqSAQYxMC40LjGYAQCgAQKgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#:~:text=AWS%20Config%20FAQs,%E2%80%BA%20config%20%E2%80%BA%20faq","comment_id":"719396"},{"content":"https://aws.amazon.com/config/faqs/\nHow can AWS Config help with audits?\nAWS Config gives you access to resource configuration history.
