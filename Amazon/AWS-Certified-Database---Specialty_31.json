The survey uses an Amazon EC2 instance that is hosted in a public subnet to host a customer survey website. The company uses an Amazon RDS DB instance that is hosted in a private subnet in the same VPC to store the survey results.\nThe company takes a snapshot of the DB instance after a survey is complete, deletes the DB instance, and then restores the DB instance from the snapshot when the survey needs to be conducted again.

Launch an ElastiCache for Redis cluster and select read replicas in different Availability Zones.\n\nBy launching an ElastiCache for Redis cluster with read replicas in different Availability Zones, the database specialist can ensure high availability of the ecommerce website within the company's AWS Region. ElastiCache automatically provisions and maintains the read replicas in different Availability Zones to enable faster read access and to provide high availability of the cache. This architecture helps to reduce latency and improve website response times, while also ensuring that the ecommerce website is highly available in case of a failure in one Availability Zone.","poster":"jpj","comment_id":"836757","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1678603500.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB look great","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1670003100.0","comment_id":"733951","poster":"examineme"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nYou can enable Multi-AZ only on Redis (cluster mode disabled) clusters that have at least one available read replica.
