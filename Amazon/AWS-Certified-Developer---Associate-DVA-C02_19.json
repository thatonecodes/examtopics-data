Store the credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as a secure string parameter: This is a strong option. Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data and secrets. It can store data such as passwords and database connection strings securely, and it integrates with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encryption. Lambda functions can then retrieve the connection string securely at runtime.\n\nD. Use Lambda environment variables with a shared AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key for encryption: While Lambda environment variables can be encrypted with AWS KMS and used to store sensitive information like database connection strings, they are not as centrally manageable as Parameter Store. Each Lambda function's environment variables would need to be updated individually if the connection string changes, which is less efficient and more prone to error."},{"timestamp":"1697569320.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/iam-role-based-authentication-to-amazon-aurora-from-serverless-applications/","comment_id":"1046293","upvote_count":"4","poster":"TallManDan"},{"timestamp":"1696594500.0","comment_id":"1026586","poster":"Digo30sp","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is (D).\n\nSolution (D) is the best option because it uses Lambda environment variables with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) shared key for encryption."}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-10-06 02:37:00","question_text":"A company has an application that runs as a series of AWS Lambda functions.

Enable gradual deployments through AWS SAM templates: Gradual deployments allow you to safely deploy your application while exposing new versions to only a portion of your traffic. This approach is ideal for testing new updates in a production environment without impacting all users. AWS SAM supports the configuration of deployment preferences directly within the SAM template.\n\nD. Set the deployment preference type to Canary10Percent30Minutes. Use hooks to test the deployment: The Canary deployment type is suitable for gradually introducing a new version of the Lambda function. In this case, \"Canary10Percent30Minutes\" means that 10% of the traffic will be directed to the new version for 30 minutes. If no issues are detected, the rest of the traffic is shifted to the new version.
