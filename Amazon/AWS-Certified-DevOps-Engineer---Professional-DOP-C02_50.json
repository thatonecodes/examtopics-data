Option BDF, on the other hand, captures both application and access logs, and uses the CloudWatch Logs driver to stream logs directly to CloudWatch Logs. This solution is more scalable as it does not require the CloudWatch Logs agent to be installed on each instance, and it can capture logs from multiple ECS tasks running on the same instance.
