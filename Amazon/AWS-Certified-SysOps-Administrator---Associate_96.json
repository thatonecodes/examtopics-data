But D seems the best option from those presented.\n\nThere can be a delay between when you incur a charge and when you receive a notification from AWS Budgets for the charge. This is due to a delay between when an AWS resource is used and when that resource usage is billed. You might incur additional costs or usage that exceed your budget notification threshold before AWS Budgets can notify you.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html","comment_id":"1070169","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731574740.0"},{"comment_id":"868269","comments":[{"poster":"jipark","content":"I agree","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723469820.0","comment_id":"979383"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nC is services in use vs D which is services each team own","timestamp":"1712921460.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"englishborn"},{"poster":"michaldavid","comment_id":"740738","timestamp":"1702191000.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\ndddddd"},{"content":"Ans: D\nYou will need one budget per deparment","comment_id":"720915","poster":"Liongeek","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1700258820.0"},{"poster":"Surferbolt","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Reducing the duration allows you to serve dynamic content. Increasing the duration means that your users get better performance because your files are more likely to be served directly from the edge cache. A longer duration also reduces the load on your origin.\n\nTo change the cache duration for an individual file, you can configure your origin to add a Cache-Control header with the max-age or s-maxage directive, or an Expires header to the file.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html"},{"poster":"be9z","comment_id":"1241396","upvote_count":"2","content":"By adding a Cache-Control header with max-age=0 to the S3 object, you instruct CloudFront to revalidate the content on every request.\nWhen a user refreshes the page, CloudFront checks with S3 to ensure it has the latest version of the file.\nThis approach ensures that users receive the most up-to-date content.","timestamp":"1720008360.0"},{"poster":"bruppp31","content":"I think this question is wrong.
