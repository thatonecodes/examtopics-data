However, they are priced higher than other options.\n\n Dedicated Instances: Dedicated Instances run on hardware dedicated to a single customer account but are priced higher than On-Demand Instances. They may not be the most cost-effective for interruptible workloads.\n\n Spot Instances: Spot Instances allow you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at potentially lower costs. They are suitable for interruptible workloads where you can tolerate potential interruptions. However, they can be terminated with short notice if the capacity is needed by On-Demand or Reserved Instances.\n\n Reserved Instances: Reserved Instances provide a capacity reservation and offer cost savings over On-Demand pricing for a commitment of 1 or 3 years. They are more suitable for steady-state workloads with predictable usage."},{"poster":"Sir_Kay","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSpot Instances are the most cost-effective option for workloads that can be interrupted, as they allow you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at a significantly lower price than On-Demand Instances.
