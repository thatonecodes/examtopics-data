They provide support and guidance, but the customer or AWS KMS is responsible for enabling encryption.\n\nB. AWS customers - AWS customers are responsible for enabling encryption for their EBS volumes, but they do so using AWS KMS.\n\nC. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) - AWS KMS is the service that provides the encryption keys and enables encryption of data at rest for Amazon EBS. Customers can use AWS KMS to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys to protect their data.\n\nD. AWS Trusted Advisor - AWS Trusted Advisor is a service that provides recommendations to optimize your AWS environment, but it does not directly enable encryption for EBS volumes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option C.

So answer is B."},{"poster":"VikJo1978","timestamp":"1702237620.0","comment_id":"1092800","content":"According to the official documentation, when you create an encrypted EBS volume and attach it to a supported instance type, data stored at rest on the volume, disk I/O, and snapshots created from the volume are all encrypted. The encryption occurs on the servers that host EC2 instances, providing encryption of data-in-transit from EC2 instances to EBS storage 1.\n\nThe encryption is performed using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots. The data key is generated by AWS KMS and then encrypted by AWS KMS with your AWS KMS key prior to being stored with your volume information. All snapshots, and any subsequent volumes created from those snapshots using the same AWS KMS key share the same data key 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1701622260.0","comment_id":"1086951","poster":"fguglia","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFor me c si correct answer"},{"poster":"Rinkans","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1701170220.0","comment_id":"1082479","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe data key is generated by AWS KMS and then encrypted by AWS KMS with your AWS KMS key prior to being stored with your volume information"},{"poster":"Ram_moharil","comment_id":"1078999","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1700795400.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nEncryption at EBS is enabled by Aws KMS"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-ebs.html","upvote_count":"1","poster":"petercorn","comment_id":"1078912","timestamp":"1700784240.0"},{"timestamp":"1700053620.0","poster":"asdfcdsxdfc","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1071458"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/126262-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-topic-1/"},{"id":"eEhIxcuBuHiuq4nEO0Ce","isMC":true,"answer":"B","exam_id":19,"question_text":"What can a user accomplish using AWS CloudTrail?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1704417660,"topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Record API calls made to AWS services.","C":"Assess the compliance of AWS resource configurations with policies and guidelines.","D":"Ensure that Amazon EC2 instances are patched with the latest security updates.","A":"Generate an IAM user credentials report."},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
