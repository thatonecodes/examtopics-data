A drawback for using storing sessions on an individual node is that in the event of a failure, you are likely to lose the sessions that were resident on the failed node. In addition, in the event the number of your web servers change, for example a scale-up scenario, it’s possible that the traffic may be unequally spread across the web servers as active sessions may exist on particular servers. If not mitigated properly, this can hinder the scalability of your application\""}],"comment_id":"573698","content":"Should we not use ELB as an origin for Cloudfront? \nCache management can be done nicely, also Cloudfront can serve dynamic content, not sure why we are not considering it.\n\nAs for me B, E is the answer.
