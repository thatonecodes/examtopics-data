This approach eliminates the need to manually update security groups in each account when adding a new partner. By updating the prefix list, the changes are automatically propagated to all accounts sharing the prefix list, streamlining the management process.\n\nOptions A, B, and D involve using AWS Lambda functions to read and update IP address ranges and security groups, which introduces additional complexity compared to leveraging AWS RAM for centralized management. Therefore, Option C is the most operationally efficient solution.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1160980","poster":"mrt261","timestamp":"1709067300.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\n- Create a new prefix list and add all allowed partner network IP address ranges to this prefix list.This prefix list acts as a centralized repository for managing the allowed IP address ranges.\n- Use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share the prefix list across different AWS accounts.\n- Update the security groups associated with the ALB in each account to reference the shared prefix list instead of specifying individual partner IP address ranges.\n- When adding a new partner, simply update the shared prefix list with the new IP address range. All associated security groups automatically reflect this change.\n\nThis solution ensures central management, reduces manual updates, and enhances scalability when adding new partners, making it operationally efficient for the given requirements.","comment_id":"1152499","poster":"vikasj1in","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708168140.0"},{"poster":"Marfee400704","upvote_count":"1","content":"I think that it' correct answer is C according to SPOTO products.","comment_id":"1150678","timestamp":"1707960120.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Arad","comment_id":"1061604","timestamp":"1699029540.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC, no brainer!"},{"poster":"tcp22","content":"C \nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/managed-prefix-lists.html","timestamp":"1683179760.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"889180"}],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":15,"answer":"C","isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/107571-exam-aws-certified-advanced-networking-specialty-ans-c01/"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Amazon","numberOfQuestions":272,"id":15,"name":"AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Specialty ANS-C01","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":52},"__N_SSP":true}
