AWS provides two features that the user can use to increase security in\nVPC: security groups and network ACLs. Security groups work at the instance level.

For a new security group, the user has to specify the rule, add it to define the source as the security group itself, and select all the protocols and ports for that source.","answer":"C","choices":{"D":"The user has to use VPC peering to configure this","C":"Configure the security group itself as the source and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports","A":"There is no need for a security group modification as all the instances can communicate with each other inside the same subnet","B":"Configure the subnet as the source in the security group and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports"},"question_id":56,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A user has configured a VPC with a new subnet.
