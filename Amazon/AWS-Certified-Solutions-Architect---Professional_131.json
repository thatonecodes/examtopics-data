You build an application that users can run on their computers. On the back end, the application reads and writes objects in an S3 bucket. Users don't have direct access to AWS. Instead, the application communicates with an identity provider (IdP) to authenticate the user. The IdP gets the user information from your organization's identity store (such as an LDAP directory) and then generates a SAML assertion that includes authentication and authorization information about that user. The application then uses that assertion to make a call to the AssumeRoleWithSAML API to get temporary security credentials. The app can then use those credentials to access a folder in the S3 bucket that's specific to the user.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/11798-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/","unix_timestamp":1578812940,"exam_id":32,"answer":"BC","question_id":654,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"BC","discussion":[{"poster":"CloudFloater","content":"BC\n\nA.
