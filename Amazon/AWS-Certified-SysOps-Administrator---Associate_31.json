Require users to use temporary credentials from the get-session token command to sign API calls.\n\nIn order to enforce MFA for API calls using the CLI, the company needs to require users to use temporary credentials obtained from the get-session-token command. This command will prompt the user to enter their MFA token, and will return temporary security credentials that include an MFA token. The user can then use these temporary credentials to sign API calls, which will ensure that the calls are authenticated using MFA.
