Nested stacks allow you to break down complex templates into smaller, more manageable units, where each nested stack can have its own set of parameters, conditions, and resources. This approach promotes code reusability, simplifies template management, and reduces duplication of common components across templates.\n\nBy creating dedicated templates as nested stacks, you can define and maintain the common components in a single location and then reference them from other templates.
