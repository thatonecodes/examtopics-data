You can configure the \"days to expiration\" value when these events are first published for your certificates. ACM automatically attempts to renew an ACM generated certificate 60 days prior to certificate expiration. Hence, these events only show up for certificates that have not yet been, or could not be, renewed. Events are published for both issued and imported certificates.\n\nFor example, when set to 45, the first event will be published when a certificate is 45 days away from its expiration date, followed by one event per day until expiration.","poster":"0bdf3af","comment_id":"1364335"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1352239","poster":"e886835","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAmazon EventBridge can be used to track specific events, such as the approaching expiration of SSL certificates in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

Option A leverages ACM's built-in event for certificates approaching expiration, while Option D uses AWS Config's managed rule acm-certificate-expiration-check to assess certificate compliance and trigger notifications via EventBridge and SNS.\n\nBy default, ACM's \"Certificate Approaching Expiration\" event starts 45 days before expiration. If you require notifications earlier than 45 days, AWS Config's managed rule allows you to specify a custom number of days for the check.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/APIReference/API_ExpiryEventsConfiguration.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\nQuestion is asking for 90 days earlier than expiration, so D is the right answer."},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1736809620.0","poster":"bp07","comment_id":"1340082","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAmazon EventBridge provides a set of predefined events, and one of these events is related to ACM certificates.
