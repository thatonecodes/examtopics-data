It allows users to securely store and centrally manage secrets such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. You can use fine-grained AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to these secrets, and Secrets Manager also supports automatic rotation of secrets to meet security and compliance requirements1. If you need to retrieve a credential from Secrets Manager, you can log into the AWS account, choose Secrets Manager from the Services menu, search for the desired credential, and retrieve its secret value2.","timestamp":"1718941380.0","poster":"e59311f"}],"question_id":361,"answer":"C","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-05-27 08:19:00"},{"id":"wIeB0SGlVt9HsxXJiK2R","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"C":"Operational excellence","D":"Performance efficiency","A":"Security","B":"Cost optimization"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1726253160,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"ShaiTay","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
