It ensures that transactions are not lost even if one tier becomes overloaded.\n\nBy using EC2 in ASG, the application can automatically scale based on the demand and the length of the SQS. This allows for efficient utilization of resources and ensures that the application can handle increased workload and communication failures.\n\nCloudWatch is used to monitor the length of SQS. When queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential communication failures, the ASG can be configured to scale up by adding more instances to handle the load.\n\nD.
