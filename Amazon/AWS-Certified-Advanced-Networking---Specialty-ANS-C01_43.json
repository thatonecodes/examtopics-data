However, this is unlikely to be the cause of the problem described in the scenario, because Appliance Mode is used to forward all traffic to the next hop, without performing routing table lookups or IP address translations. In this case, the issue is related to inter-VPC traffic between different Availability Zones, and the fact that the stateful security appliances in the shared services VPC are dropping the traffic.\n\nTherefore, the root cause of the problem is related to the deployment of the stateful security appliances and the transit gateway attachments in the shared services VPC, as well as the fact that they are not able to handle the inter-Availability Zone traffic from the application VPCs.
