This option also allows for quick promotion of the secondary region in case of a disaster, aligning with the 15-minute RTO2.\nOption C is chosen because having an ALB and an Auto Scaling group pre-configured in the DR region ensures that the application can be quickly redirected and scaled in case of a disaster, meeting the 15-minute RTO2.

Because essentially keeping the same configuration of an application in another region implies huse costs (multi-site approach). \nPlease have a look over these DR strategies and see for yourselves the difference between the Warm Standby and the Active/Active approach. \nGiven the requirement of 15 minutes, I'd say a Warm Standby in this case would be enough.","timestamp":"1729162980.0"},{"timestamp":"1708406520.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"specifically for C vs D yall it ask for the most cost effective way. if they have the same configuration it will 2x their cost vs just having the min, max, and desired instanced to 1.

Configure the Aurora cluster to replicate data to the DR Region by using the Aurora global database option.\n\nAurora global database allows you to replicate your Aurora database across AWS Regions with minimal replication lag. By setting up the Aurora global database option, you ensure that data is continuously being replicated to the DR Region, which helps meet the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 15 minutes.\n\nD. Configure the DR Region with an ALB and an Auto Scaling group. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity, maximum capacity, and desired capacity to 1.\n\nBy configuring the DR Region with an ALB and an Auto Scaling group with minimum, maximum, and desired capacity set to 1, you ensure that the infrastructure is in place and ready to receive traffic in case of a failover event.
