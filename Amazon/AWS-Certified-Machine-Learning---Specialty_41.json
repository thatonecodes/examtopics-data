Apply smoothing to correct for seasonal variation.\n\nSmoothing techniques, such as using moving averages or other time series smoothing methods, can help in reducing noise and capturing the underlying patterns in the sales data.

On the other hand, the Advanced job type (option B) involves a custom load test where you have more control over the traffic pattern and requirements for latency and throughput. However, this option may take longer to complete (an average of 2 hours).\n\nGiven the requirement for the least development effort, option A seems more suitable. It utilizes the Default job type, which is more automated and requires less manual configuration compared to the Advanced job type.

Register the model artifact and container to the SageMaker Model Registry. Use the SageMaker Inference Recommender Default job type. Provide the known traffic pattern for load testing to select the best instance type and configuration based on the workloads.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSageMaker Model Registry allows you to register and organize your trained models.\nThe SageMaker Inference Recommender Default job type simplifies the process of selecting the best instance type and configuration based on the known traffic pattern. It automatically selects the best instance type for the model.\nLoad testing with the known traffic pattern helps in understanding the actual workloads and selecting the most appropriate instance type and configuration.\nThis approach leverages the capabilities provided by SageMaker without the need for additional infrastructure or open-source tools","poster":"aquanaveen","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1098858","timestamp":"1702813980.0"}],"exam_id":26,"answer_images":[]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"name":"AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty","provider":"Amazon","numberOfQuestions":369,"isBeta":false,"id":26,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":41},"__N_SSP":true}
