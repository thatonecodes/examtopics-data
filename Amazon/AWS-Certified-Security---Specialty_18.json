Review the rejected packet reason codes in the VPC Flow Logs.\n\nVPC Flow Logs are a great way to troubleshoot network connectivity issues. They can be used to see which packets were sent and received, as well as the reason for any rejections. In this case, the troubleshooting steps should be:\n\nCheck the inbound and outbound security groups, looking for DENY rules. If there are no DENY rules, then the security groups are not the issue.\nCheck the inbound and outbound Network ACL rules, looking for DENY rules. If there are no DENY rules, then the Network ACLs are not the issue.\nReview the rejected packet reason codes in the VPC Flow Logs.
