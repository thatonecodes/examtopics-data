The company can securely store the API key in the Lambda function's environment variables and pass the key in the headers of the requests made from the Lambda function. This way the key is not exposed to the users of the web application. This solution is cost effective as the cost of Amazon API Gateway is calculated by the number of requests and data transfer.
