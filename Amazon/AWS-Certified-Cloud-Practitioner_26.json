In this scenario, you can set a CloudWatch alarm to monitor CPU utilization of the EC2 instances. When the CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold, the alarm triggers an auto scaling action to add more instances to handle the increased load. Similarly, when the CPU utilization decreases, the auto scaling action can remove instances to optimize costs.","upvote_count":"11"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I think it's C:\nAWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS.

When a message is sent to the SNS topic, it triggers the Auto Scaling group to add or remove EC2 instances based on the configured scaling rules.\n\nHowever, in the case of triggering EC2 Auto Scaling based on CPU utilization, Amazon CloudWatch is the more suitable service to use. CloudWatch is specifically designed for monitoring and alerting on cloud resources, including EC2 instances, and provides more fine-grained control over scaling rules and alarm thresholds. SNS, on the other hand, is a more general-purpose messaging service that can be used for a wide range of use cases, including triggering EC2 Auto Scaling but may not provide the same level of control and granularity as CloudWatch for this specific use case.","comment_id":"813574","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1675367880.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAmazon CloudWatch","poster":"Onyejicash","comment_id":"796391"},{"timestamp":"1674230520.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the answer.","comment_id":"782451","poster":"Saif93"},{"comment_id":"766119","timestamp":"1672871340.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"ozbeyucel","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D \nA metric alarm watches a single CloudWatch metric or the result of a math expression based on CloudWatch metrics.
