In this case, the CodePipeline is located in the us-east-1 region, but the artifact is stored in an S3 bucket in the us-west-1 region. This mismatch in regions is causing the deployment to fail with an InternalError and JobFailed.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should ensure that the artifact is stored in an S3 bucket in the same region as the CodePipeline. You can either copy the artifact to an S3 bucket in the us-east-1 region or create a new CodePipeline in the us-west-1 region to work with the artifact in its current location.","timestamp":"1721025300.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html","comment_id":"612072","timestamp":"1686010440.0","poster":"Finger41","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"RicardoD","content":"B is the Answer","comment_id":"360674","timestamp":"1666929960.0"},{"poster":"abhishek_m_86","content":"B.

By specifying an AutoScalingUpdate policy in the CloudFormation template, you can define the update behavior for your Auto Scaling group, including how many instances should be replaced at a time.\n\nTo update the AMI while maintaining service continuity, you can configure the AutoScalingUpdate policy to replace a subset of instances at a time. This ensures that the service remains available by keeping a minimum number of active instances running while new instances with the updated AMI are launched.

This is a very tricky question. I don't know why you guys disconsidered letter (A). My observations in real webservers says that when we have high DISK latency, processing individual tasks could take much much longer. In high concurrency systems, a task taking longer means that you will end up having more parallel tasks being executed at the same time. With such a scenario, with parallel tasks being accumulated because of disk latency, the CPU usage will increase. So, disk latency could be a real CPU killer. \n\nLetter (B) is a good solution, but it is vertical scalling. The question states that it can not be vertical scalled.
