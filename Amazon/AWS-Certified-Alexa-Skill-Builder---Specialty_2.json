You could also use session attributes to create a context sensitive “Help” for your customers. Rather than delivering the same help message, you could create an intent history by assigning the last intent to an attribute called “lastIntent\" and then using that to deliver context sensitive help messages. You could even use this “lastIntent” attribute to suggest a valid slot in case the slot is missing or not a match.\"","poster":"Babyfacer","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/implement-the-built-in-intents.html","question_text":"An Alexa Skill Builder would like to improve a skill's help experience.
