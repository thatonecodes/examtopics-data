The application has a sporadic traffic pattern and should be able to scale during marketing campaigns to process the orders with minimal delays.\n\nWhich of the following is the MOST reliable approach to meet the requirements?","answer_ET":"B","exam_id":33,"question_images":[],"answer":"B","isMC":true},{"id":"cbUOksG9ZxruDRDAKkkD","exam_id":33,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1084297","poster":"shaaam80","upvote_count":"11","timestamp":"1701344100.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer B.

Enable a Lambda function to rotate the secrets regularly. Create a KMS key for each secret and use them to encrypt the credentials. Assign permissions to allow the business Lambda function to retrieve the credential from Secret manager and decrypt the credential with the KMS key.\n\nB is not ideal but is the only acceptable answer: \n“Turn on rotation.”: In Secret Manager, you must enable a Lambda function to rotate the credential\n“Provide a reference to the Secrets Manager key as an environment variable for the Lambda functions. “ permission must be set to allow the Lambda function to use the Key to decrypt the credential.","poster":"bjexamprep","comment_id":"1120982","timestamp":"1705082400.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption B","comment_id":"1120150","poster":"career360guru","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705004040.0"},{"comment_id":"1082475","content":"Selected Answer: B\n\"rotate passwords automatically\" -> AWS Secrets Manager","upvote_count":"3","poster":"GabrielDeBiasi","timestamp":"1701170100.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAWS Secrets Manager with Rotation Enabled:","poster":"thala","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1077948","timestamp":"1700700000.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"devalenzuela86","comment_id":"1077877","timestamp":"1700689140.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB for sure"},{"comment_id":"1077772","poster":"321swa","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct Answer is B","timestamp":"1700683980.0"},{"comment_id":"1077079","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer: B","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1700638320.0","poster":"cypkir"}],"timestamp":"2023-11-22 08:32:00","topic":"1","question_id":345,"unix_timestamp":1700638320,"answer_description":"","question_text":"A company is deploying AWS Lambda functions that access an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database.
