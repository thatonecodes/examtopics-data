Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) queues can be subscribed to the SNS topic, and SNS message filtering can be used to direct messages to the appropriate SQS queue based on the quote type. This setup ensures that quotes are separated by quote type and that they are not lost. Each backend application server can then poll its own SQS queue to retrieve and process messages.
