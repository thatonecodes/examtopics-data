Create an AWS Config conformance pack that contains the AWS Config rules and remediation actions. Deploy the pack from the delegated administrator account by using AWS Config.\n\nConformance packs are a collection of AWS Config rules and remediation actions that can be easily deployed as a single entity in an account and a region, and across an organization in AWS Organizations. These packs are created and managed from a central account, and help to establish a secure and compliant posture for your accounts. Non-administrator users can view the AWS Config rules within a conformance pack but they cannot modify them. AWS Config conformance packs are therefore a good fit for achieving the desired control and security policy.\n\nThe other options, while potentially viable for deploying Config rules, do not inherently protect the baseline AWS Config rules from being modified by non-administrator users in the member accounts.","timestamp":"1704965880.0","upvote_count":"10"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct: <a common baseline of AWS Config rule> means conformance pack. <a member account as a delegated administrator account for AWS Config> means delegated admin\nA and C: no mentionf of conformance pack\nB: should deploy this using AWS config and in the delegated account, not the management account","timestamp":"1722695880.0","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1139465","poster":"thanhnv142"},{"timestamp":"1743289080.0","poster":"Srikantha","comment_id":"1411884","content":"Selected Answer: B\nption B is the most appropriate solution because it leverages AWS Config conformance packs, which are purpose-built for applying and managing AWS Config rules across multiple accounts.
