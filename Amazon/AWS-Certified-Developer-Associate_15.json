Create a Lambda@Edge function to encrypt data when CloudFront processes a client request. Configure the distribution to invoke the Lambda@Edge function when the origin request event occurs. \nThis will ensure that data is encrypted at rest, in transit, and during processing. The Lambda@Edge function should use a customer managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the sensitive data.\n\nE. Store the data in the S3 bucket by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Transfer the encrypted data from the S3 bucket to the DynamoDB table. \nThis will ensure that data is encrypted at rest in the S3 bucket, and during transfer to the DynamoDB table. Using SSE-S3 simplifies key management since AWS manages the encryption keys for the S3 bucket.","comments":[{"comment_id":"838031","upvote_count":"3","poster":"fomenkogregory","content":"I thinks, if you encrypt the data with Lambda@Edge it will be remain encrypted all the way to storage as shown on \"Figure 2: Field-level encryption process\"\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-protect-sensitive-data-for-its-entire-lifecycle-in-aws/","timestamp":"1678721340.0"}],"poster":"mistral","comment_id":"816539","upvote_count":"5"},{"comment_id":"937088","timestamp":"1687981500.0","poster":"rcaliandro","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nFor me is both A and B.
