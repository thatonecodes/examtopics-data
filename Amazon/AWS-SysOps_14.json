But subnet is one thing, and availability zone is another. You can have multiple subnets on one AZ. Moreover, ELB requires at least two subnets, so letter A and B are not possible.

Your load balancer uses these IP addresses to establish connections with the instances.\n\nCreate a subnet in each Availability Zone where you want to launch instances. Depending on your application, you can launch your instances in public subnets, private subnets, or a combination of public and private subnets. A public subnet has a route to an internet gateway. Note that default VPCs have one public subnet per Availability Zone by default.\n\nWhen you create a load balancer, you must add one or more public subnets to the load balancer. If your instances are in private subnets, create public subnets in the same Availability Zones as the subnets with your instances; you will add these public subnets to the load balancer.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-backend-instances.html","comment_id":"237600","timestamp":"1729708920.0","poster":"eyadman"},{"poster":"walthor","content":"I think the correct answer is B.
