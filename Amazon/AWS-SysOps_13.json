Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system. However, it is recommended that the user use the Amazon EC2 to reboot the instance instead of running the operating system reboot command from the instance. The instance remains on the same host computer and maintains its public DNS name, private IP address, and any data on its instance store volumes.
