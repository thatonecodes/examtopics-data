User data: The user data section in CloudFormation is typically used for one-time configuration scripts and not intended for passing sensitive information like log group names or ARNs, raising security concerns.\nC.

The Mappings section in a CloudFormation template is used to define sets of key-value pairs that can be used to specify conditional parameter values based on region or other criteria.
