Create a Route 53 private hosted zone.

Associating the private hosted zone with the VPC ensures that only the resources within the VPC can resolve the DNS queries, maintaining a secure environment for application and on-premises service communication.\n\nThe outbound resolver endpoint and rule would be more relevant if the requirement was for resources within the VPC to resolve DNS queries for domain names that are located in the on-premises network. In that case, the outbound resolver would forward queries from the VPC to the on-premises DNS server for resolution.
