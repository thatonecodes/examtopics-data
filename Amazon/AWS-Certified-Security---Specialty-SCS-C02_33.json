Determine whether the unscanned Lambda functions have been invoked in the last 90 days.\n\nAmazon Inspector's eligibility for scanning Lambda functions is typically based on activity. If a Lambda function has not been invoked in the last 90 days, it may no longer be eligible for scanning. This helps ensure that only active and potentially vulnerable functions are scanned, optimizing resource usage and focusing on functions that are in use.","poster":"IPLogic","timestamp":"1733419740.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true,"question_text":"A company has used AWS Lambda functions to build an application on AWS.
