This allows you to centrally manage your accounts and apply policies across your organization. You can also use Service Catalog as a service principal for AWS Organizations, which lets you share your portfolios with organizational units (OUs) or accounts in your organization.\n\nTo create a Service Catalog portfolio, you need to use an administrator account, such as the organization's management account. You can upload your CloudFormation template as a product in your portfolio, and define constraints and tags for it. You can then share your portfolio with the OU that contains the accounts for the web applications. This will allow the developers in those accounts to launch products from the shared portfolio using the Service Catalog end user console.","poster":"Christina666","upvote_count":"8","comments":[{"upvote_count":"6","poster":"Christina666","timestamp":"1716141240.0","content":"Option C is incorrect because creating an IAM role that has a trust policy that allows cross-account access to the portfolio is not secure.
