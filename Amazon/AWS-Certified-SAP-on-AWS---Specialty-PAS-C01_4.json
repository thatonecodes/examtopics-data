Snapshots allow the SAP install to be captured and new systems created from them quickly. The AWS Service Catalog product grants access to deploy new systems without elevating permissions.\n\nOption A uses Launch Wizard which has more overhead to setup each additional system.\n\nOptions C and D use custom AMIs which add extra steps compared to snapshots in Option B.\n\nOverall Option B delivers a self-service portal to deploy systems from a golden SAP install with the least overhead."},{"poster":"odre90","timestamp":"1702064580.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nNot 100% sure.
