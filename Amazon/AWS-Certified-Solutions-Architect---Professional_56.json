The user does not have the ability to define a different expiration date.\n\nOption D states that the cross connect is not completed within the specified duration from the appropriate provider. This is also incorrect. The LOA-CFA is issued by AWS, not by the colocation provider.

If the cross connect is not completed within 90 days, the authority granted by the LOA-CFA expires.\n\nThe LOA-CFA is a document that is issued by AWS to authorize you to create a cross connect at a colocation facility. The LOA-CFA is valid for 90 days, and if the cross connect is not completed within that time, the authority granted by the LOA-CFA expires.\n\nThe other options are incorrect. Option B states that the LOA-CFA becomes outdated if the virtual interface is not created within 72 days. This is not correct. The virtual interface is created after the cross connect is completed, so it is not possible for the LOA-CFA to become outdated before the cross connect is even created.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SkyZeroZx","comment_id":"925282","timestamp":"1686926460.0"},{"comment_id":"462889","upvote_count":"2","content":"90 days......","poster":"Bhagirathi","timestamp":"1635308460.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1634363460,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/64177-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/","answer":"A","timestamp":"2021-10-16 07:51:00","question_id":276},{"id":"9oo1xprYRR63XHC7iSEs","choices":{"A":"Stateless instances for the web and application tier synchronized using ElastiCache Memcached in an autoscaimg group monitored with CloudWatch and RDS with read replicas.","C":"Stateful instances for the web and application tier in an autoscaling group monitored with CloudWatch and multi-AZ RDS.","D":"Stateless instances for the web and application tier synchronized using ElastiCache Memcached in an autoscaling group monitored with CloudWatch and multi-AZ RDS.","B":"Stateful instances for the web and application tier in an autoscaling group monitored with CloudWatch and RDS with read replicas."},"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1615626660,"question_text":"A read only news reporting site with a combined web and application tier and a database tier that receives large and unpredictable traffic demands must be able to respond to these traffic fluctuations automatically.\nWhat AWS services should be used meet these requirements?","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/46855-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"amministrazione","timestamp":"1723729380.0","content":"A.

Let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Stateless instances for the web and application tier synchronized using ElastiCache Memcached in an autoscaling group monitored with CloudWatch and RDS with read replicas.\n\nStateless instances are ideal for scalability since they don't maintain any session information. If one instance fails, users can be directed to another instance without any disruption.\nElastiCache Memcached can be used to cache frequent database queries or session data, reducing the load on the database.\nAutoscaling ensures that the application can scale out or in based on demand.\nCloudWatch monitors the performance and can trigger scaling actions.\nRDS with read replicas can handle a large number of read requests by distributing the load across multiple replicas.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1695569760.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1671405060.0","comment_id":"749285","poster":"EricZhang","content":"Why we would need ElastiCache to sync web/app tier up if they are stateless?"},{"comment_id":"743483","poster":"TigerInTheCloud","timestamp":"1670895720.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\n\"read-only\" -> read replicas\n\"unpredictable traffic \" -> autoscaling -> stateless"},{"content":"A. read only. read replica.","comment_id":"636796","poster":"hilft","timestamp":"1658763720.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"aandc","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhigh availability is not the requirement","timestamp":"1656826380.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"626427"},{"comment_id":"586291","upvote_count":"4","poster":"tartarus23","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
