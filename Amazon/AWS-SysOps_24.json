This means that if the conditions specified in the CloudWatch alarms are met, Auto Scaling will not automatically trigger scaling actions like launching or terminating instances until the process is resumed. This can be useful if the user wants to temporarily prevent Auto Scaling actions from being taken in response to alarm conditions.","comment_id":"978999","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723413240.0"},{"comment_id":"367385","timestamp":"1667051640.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct Answer: B","poster":"TroyMcLure"},{"comment_id":"60817","content":"B.
