The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. The organization wants to extend their network into the cloud and also directly access the internet from their AWS VPC. Thus, the organization should setup a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a public subnet and a private subnet, and a virtual private gateway to enable communication with their data center network over an IPsec VPN tunnel. To setup this configuration the organization needs to use the Amazon VPC with a VPN connection.
