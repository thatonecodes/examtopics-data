This means that the rule would trigger the Lambda function every 600 seconds (10 minutes) regardless of whether a new account registration has occurred or not.\n\nIn contrast, Option C allows you to trigger the Lambda function specifically 10 minutes after a new account registration by sending a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) delay queue and setting the queue to 600 seconds. This way, the Lambda function is only invoked when a new account registration occurs, and not on an ongoing basis.

It is not C because the purpose of delay queues in SQS is totally different. Their use case is when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages.
