Users can shorten the term of their Convertible RIs by merging them with other Convertible RIs\nExplanation: Convertible Reserved Instances (RIs) are a type of AWS pricing option that allows users to change the attributes of the RI during its term. This means that users can exchange Convertible RIs for other Convertible RIs with different attributes, such as instance type or operating system, but they cannot exchange them for other Convertible RIs from a different instance family or AWS Region. Additionally, Convertible RIs cannot be sold or bought on the AWS Marketplace. One of the key benefits of Convertible RIs is the ability to shorten the term of the RI by merging it with other Convertible RIs. This can be useful if a user needs to reduce their RI commitment or switch to a different pricing option.","timestamp":"1679244240.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[]},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the answer.","comment_id":"785920","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Saif93","timestamp":"1674513240.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"question_text":"What is a characteristic of Convertible Reserved Instances (RIs)?","answer":"A","exam_id":18,"unix_timestamp":1673122920,"question_id":440,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (92%)","8%"],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"Users can shorten the term of their Convertible RIs by merging them with other Convertible RIs","B":"Users can exchange Convertible RIs for other Convertible RIs in different AWS Regions","C":"Users can sell and buy Convertible RIs on the AWS Marketplace","A":"Users can exchange Convertible RIs for other Convertible RIs from a different instance family"},"answer_images":[]}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":988,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","id":18,"provider":"Amazon","name":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":88},"__N_SSP":true}
