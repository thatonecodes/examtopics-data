The AWS account has reached EC2 limits for the Region.\n\nExplanation: AWS sets various limits on resources in each AWS Region, including the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched. If the AWS account has reached the EC2 limits for the specific Region, it won't be able to launch additional instances until the limits are increased.\n\nE. The subnet being used has no more usable private IP addresses.\n\nExplanation: Each subnet in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) has a finite number of available private IP addresses based on the CIDR block associated with the subnet. If all the private IP addresses in the subnet have been allocated to existing instances, the new EC2 instance won't be able to obtain an available IP address and, thus, will fail to launch."},{"content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA and E are the answers","timestamp":"1707329880.0","comment_id":"801256","poster":"gulu73","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"410026","timestamp":"1667393580.0","content":"A,D\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting-launch.html","poster":"idoshaul"},{"comment_id":"369500","poster":"RicardoD","timestamp":"1667383680.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"A | E are the answers"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1667317920.0","content":"I think that A, E is correct.","comment_id":"324174","poster":"hdbs"},{"timestamp":"1666908120.0","poster":"abhishek_m_86","comment_id":"271639","content":"A.

In EC2-Classic, the load balancer provides a special source security group that you can use to ensure that instances receive traffic only from your load balancer. You can't modify this source security group. In a VPC, you provide the security group for your load balancer, which enables you to choose the ports and protocols to allow.
