It offers very high performance and low latency since it is physically attached to the instance's hardware. The performance of instance store volumes is often better than any other storage option.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that EC2 instance store is temporary storage and is not persistent. The data stored on instance store volumes is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated. If data retention is not required across instance restarts, using instance store as a cache can provide the highest performance.","comment_id":"944438"},{"poster":"Gomer","comment_id":"921677","timestamp":"1718219580.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"I'm sure the \"Instance Store\" volume is actually stored in local memory, which is why it is non-persistent but will also always have higher performance than any attached EBS volume."},{"comment_id":"916589","upvote_count":"2","poster":"tts1234","timestamp":"1717701900.0","content":"Should be D, since the workload doesn't need to retain the cache\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1717679100.0","comment_id":"916266","poster":"pepecastr0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. instance store provides highest performance"}],"unix_timestamp":1686056700,"question_id":231,"question_text":"A company runs a workload on an Amazon EC2 instance.
