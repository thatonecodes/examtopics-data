Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.\n\nYou can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access to your AWS resources. We want these users to normally have access to the resources that fit their current job description, hence why IAM Groups are better. \n\nIAM Groups:\nAn IAM user group is a collection of IAM users.
