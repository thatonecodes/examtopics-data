You can also reference parameters in a number of other AWS services, including the following:\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)\nAmazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)\nAWS Secrets Manager\nAWS Lambda\nAWS CloudFormation\nAWS CodeBuild\nAWS CodePipeline\nAWS CodeDeploy","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"561613","timestamp":"1646510580.0"},{"timestamp":"1645996920.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"557633","poster":"user0001","content":"I vote for C since the requirement is to auto implement and validation.\nB is good but it work at instance level and admin will need to manage them seperatly"},{"timestamp":"1643820420.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html\nWho should use Parameter Store? - Any AWS customer who wants to have a centralized way to manage configuration data.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"538959","poster":"thelad"},{"content":"\"... changes to are automatically implemented to all instances as necessary\"..
