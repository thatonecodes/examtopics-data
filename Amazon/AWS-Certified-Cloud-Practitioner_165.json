According to the documentation, AWS recommends that you deploy EC2 hosts across multiple Availability Zones to make your application more fault tolerant. Therefore, option C is the best choice as it allows the deployment of the application on EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones within a single AWS Region. This ensures that the application can provide low latency between components while also having fault tolerance capabilities.","comment_id":"915356","timestamp":"1685962080.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"A is correct","comment_id":"886742","upvote_count":"1","poster":"nalaikpanda","timestamp":"1682974980.0"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Multiple AWS Regions","D":"Regional edge caches","C":"Multiple Availability Zones","B":"Multiple edge locations"},"question_text":"A company wants to migrate its high performance computing (HPC) application to Amazon EC2 instances.
