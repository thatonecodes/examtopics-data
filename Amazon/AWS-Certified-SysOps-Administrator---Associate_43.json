This allows the on-premises servers to resolve DNS queries for the private hosted zone using Route 53's DNS resolution. The outbound endpoint provides a secure and efficient way for on-premises DNS resolution.\n\nA is incorrect because the inbound endpoint is used for receiving DNS queries from your on-premises network to resolve public DNS names. It is not suitable for resolving private hosted zone names.\n\nC and D are incorrect because editing the private hosted zone with TXT or PTR records does not enable the on-premises servers to use Route 53 for DNS resolution.

To achieve this, you need to create alias records for each server with evaluate target health set to yes, which means Route 53 will perform health checks on the targets associated with these records.\n\nChoosing an alias record is appropriate because alias records can be used to map the domain name to an Elastic Load Balancer, an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon CloudFront distribution, or another Route 53 resource record set.
