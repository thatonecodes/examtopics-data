When you perform the DeleteImportedKeyMaterial action, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the CMK key state changes to pending import. When the key material is deleted, the CMK is immediately unusable. There is no waiting period. To enable use of the CMK again, you must reimport the same key material. Deleting key material affects the CMK right away, but data encryption keys that are actively in use by AWS services are not immediately affected.\nSource: https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-kms-best-practices.pdf"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nYou can only schedule the deletion of a customer managed key.
