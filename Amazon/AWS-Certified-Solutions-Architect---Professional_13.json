The user can achieve additional dedicated capacity for the EBS I/O with an enhanced RDS option.\n\nPIOPS stands for Provisioned IOPS. It is a feature of Amazon EBS that allows you to provision a specific amount of IOPS for your EBS volume. This can be useful for applications that require high I/O performance, such as databases.\n\nWhen you create a MySQL RDS instance with PIOPS, you are essentially creating an RDS instance that uses an EBS volume with a provisioned IOPS capacity. This will give you the ability to achieve higher I/O performance for your database than you would get with a standard EBS volume.","comment_id":"921864"},{"poster":"TigerInTheCloud","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1672063140.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html","comment_id":"757509"},{"poster":"MarkChoi","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"with an enhanced RDS option\" ???\nIt's weird.\nC is correct.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"637782","timestamp":"1658893800.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1650079020.0","comment_id":"586587","content":"Selected Answer: C\nProvisioned IOPS uses optimized EBS volumes and an optimized configuration stack.
