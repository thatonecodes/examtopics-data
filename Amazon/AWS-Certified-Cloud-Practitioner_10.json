The selection of S3 storage tiers"},{"poster":"Guru4Cloud","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe storage class used in Amazon S3 can certainly have an impact on the cost of a data lake, as different storage classes have different pricing tiers. For example, using the Glacier storage class for infrequently accessed data can be much cheaper than using the Standard storage class for frequently accessed data. However, in most cases, the amount of data stored will have a larger impact on the overall cost than the storage class used. This is because storage usage is generally the primary driver of cost in an S3-based data lake, regardless of the storage class. Therefore, it is important to carefully monitor and manage the amount of data being stored in the S3 bucket to keep costs under control.","comment_id":"856040","timestamp":"1680199320.0"},{"comment_id":"856018","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA\nRefer to: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#:~:text=The%20S3%20storage%20classes%20include,frequently%20accessed%20data%2C%20S3%20Glacier","poster":"Guru4Cloud","timestamp":"1680198480.0"},{"comment_id":"834082","timestamp":"1678374240.0","poster":"elidiojose","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

This is done through the AWS Systems Manager service, which allows users to automate operational tasks on their EC2 instances, including patching, without requiring any manual intervention.\n\nWhile AWS provides options for encrypting data at rest and in transit (such as encrypting data stored in Amazon DynamoDB and encrypting user network traffic), these tasks typically require configuration and setup by the user.
