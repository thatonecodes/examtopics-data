The per-second billing applies to instances launched from certain AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) based on specific operating systems. This means that the payment can vary depending on the instance AMI's operating system.\n\nAdditionally, the payment for instances can be either per hour or per second, depending on the instance type. Certain instance types may offer the option to be billed per second, allowing customers to pay for the exact duration of usage."},{"comment_id":"567538","timestamp":"1678785180.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"aidenpearce01","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nWhen see \"billing for EC2\" go a head with the answer has \"per second, per hour\", i go with B and D"},{"poster":"awscertified","timestamp":"1667214180.0","comment_id":"67936","content":"B.

If you launched an instance for 45 minutes, you would also pay for 1 hour. This means that partial hours cost as much as one full hour. Pricing is per instance-hour consumed for each instance, from the time an instance is launched until it is terminated or stopped. Each partial instance-hour consumed will be billed as a full hour.\nWith EC2 services now billed per-second in some cases, as well as per-hour in others as of October 2, 2017, there is more to consider. Amazon AWS is still based on the concept of pay-as-you-go. You pay Amazon EC2 instances by the second for all instance types except Dedicated Host, which is still billed per instance-hour. You are billed per second when using Linux operating systems with no separate hourly charge, and billed per hour when using Windows operating systems.\nReference:\nhttp://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/","answer":"BD","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1585092540},{"id":"rnJF4LvwDxSyCQ58tZOF","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/17399-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-352-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"371290","content":"Correct Answer: B","upvote_count":"1","poster":"TroyMcLure","timestamp":"1730130900.0"},{"content":"B is correct.","comment_id":"299200","poster":"AshisMondal","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729872060.0"},{"content":"B.
