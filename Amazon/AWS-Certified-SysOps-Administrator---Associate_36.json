Promote the read replica in case of failure) provides additional data redundancy, but it introduces cross-region replication and may not be the most efficient way to reduce the failover time. Cross-region replication involves data transfer between regions, which can add latency and may not be as fast as using an RDS proxy within the same region.","comments":[{"comment_id":"962347","content":"Option D (Create an RDS proxy. Point the application to the proxy endpoint) is the correct solution for decreasing failover time. An RDS proxy acts as an intermediate layer between the application and the RDS database. It allows for fast and automated failover during Multi-AZ database failover scenarios. When a failover occurs, the RDS proxy automatically connects the application to the new primary instance, reducing the time it takes for the application to be back online.\n\nBy using an RDS proxy, the failover time is reduced because the proxy maintains connections to both the primary and standby database instances. It also automatically routes the connections to the healthy instance, making the failover process seamless for the application.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Christina666","timestamp":"1721883240.0"}],"comment_id":"962346","poster":"Christina666","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1709919420.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nItâ€™s D - RDS proxy can improve db failover by 32% for MySQL, PostgreSQL and 79% for Aurora service.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/improving-application-availability-with-amazon-rds-proxy/","poster":"csG13","comment_id":"833224"},{"poster":"anderri","comment_id":"810072","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1708041480.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWith RDS Proxy, failover times for Aurora and RDS databases are reduced by up to 66% |\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/"}],"question_id":176,"question_text":"A company's SysOps administrator maintains a highly available environment.
