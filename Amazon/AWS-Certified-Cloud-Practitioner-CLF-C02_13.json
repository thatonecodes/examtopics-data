Avoid monolithic architecture by segmenting workloads.\n\nIn AWS Cloud architecture, one of the key design principles is to avoid monolithic architectures and instead use a microservices or segmented approach for workloads. This promotes flexibility, scalability, and maintainability by breaking down applications into smaller, independent components. This makes it easier to deploy, scale, and manage applications, and it improves fault isolation.","comment_id":"1334643","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1735621800.0"},{"poster":"Bomber","comment_id":"1147159","content":"Why not A?","timestamp":"1707648780.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"This is not a recommended design principle because it goes against the principles of building scalable, resilient, and maintainable cloud-based systems.","comment_id":"1242583","timestamp":"1720165560.0","poster":"f964633"}],"upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1707362160.0","content":"D. Avoid monolithic architecture by segmenting workloads.\n\nMonolithic architectures can become unwieldy, difficult to maintain, and prone to failures. Segmenting workloads into smaller, more manageable components allows for greater scalability, resilience, and flexibility in the cloud. This approach aligns with best practices for modern cloud-native architectures, where services are decoupled, independently deployable, and can scale independently","comment_id":"1144017","poster":"BoBOMr","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1072128","poster":"jimoon","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1700107680.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD 가 정답입니다."}],"question_text":"Which of the following is a recommended design principle for AWS Cloud architecture?","timestamp":"2023-11-16 05:08:00","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","question_id":62,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1700107680,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/126343-exam-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-topic-1/"},{"id":"Vh2ytp7FBpyIhB6GaCl9","unix_timestamp":1701099060,"isMC":true,"answer":"A","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1559354","timestamp":"1744225560.0","poster":"tastatura","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
