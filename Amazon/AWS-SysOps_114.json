Ans: B\n\nFinally, you need a way to instruct AWS CloudFormation to complete stack creation only after all the services (such as Apache and MySQL) are running and not after all the stack resources are created. In other words, if you use the template from the previous section to launch a stack, AWS CloudFormation sets the status of the stack as CREATE_COMPLETE after it successfully creates all the resources. However, if one or more services failed to start, AWS CloudFormation still sets the stack status as CREATE_COMPLETE. To prevent the status from changing to CREATE_COMPLETE until all the services have successfully started, you can add a CreationPolicy attribute to the instance. This attribute puts the instance's status in CREATE_IN_PROGRESS until AWS CloudFormation receives the required number of success signals or the timeout period is exceeded, so you can control when the instance has been successfully created.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/deploying.applications.html","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Ans: B","upvote_count":"3","poster":"saumenP","timestamp":"1663720560.0","comment_id":"16917"}],"question_text":"A company creates custom AMI images by launching new Amazon EC2 instances from an AWS CloudFormation template.
