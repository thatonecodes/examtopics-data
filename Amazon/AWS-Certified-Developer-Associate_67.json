Visibility timeout is the number of seconds a message in the queue stays invisible after a processor takes it. If this message is processed within this time limit, it will be deleted from the queue. If it is not processed within this time, the object will be returned to the queue and it will be visible again, waiting to be processed by the recipient EC2. In our case it is not being processed within the time limit so it is being returned to the queue.

The visibility timeout is the amount of time that the message is invisible in the queue after a consumer retrieves it. During this time, the message is not available to other consumers. If the Lambda function finishes processing the message before the visibility timeout expires, it will delete the message from the queue. If the Lambda function does not finish processing the message before the visibility timeout expires, the message becomes visible again and can be processed by another consumer.","poster":"JagpreetLM10"},{"poster":"Phinx","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's D.
