In this case, the Administrator can configure a String match condition to look for the specific header that includes the name of the division in each application request. When the WAF encounters a request with the specified header value, it will trigger the associated rule, and you can use the WAF logs to count the number of requests coming from each division.","comment_id":"959177","poster":"albert_kuo","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1709505180.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the answer","poster":"Gzuis","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"828450"},{"comment_id":"801188","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1707327000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the answer","poster":"gulu73"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"366213","timestamp":"1667701620.0","content":"D is the answer","poster":"RicardoD"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1666567920.0","content":"D.
