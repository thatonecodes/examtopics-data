By using a write-through caching strategy, the application writes data to the cache and the database simultaneously. This ensures that the data in the cache is always up-to-date and the database is used only to retrieve data that is not in the cache. This approach can improve the application's read performance and decrease latency.\n\nWrite-behind caching strategy - is appropriate for an application that performs more writes than reads. It is a technique that defers database updates until after new data is written to the cache.

In this case, the language string should be included in the whitelist. By including the language string in the query string, CloudFront will consider it as part of the cache key, allowing it to serve the appropriate language-specific content.\n\nOnce the new cache policy is created, the developer needs to update the CloudFront distribution to use the new cache policy.
