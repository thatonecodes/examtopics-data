AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) provides a managed service for provisioning and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.\n\nHere's how the process works:\n\nCreate a new Amazon-issued certificate in ACM.\nAssociate the certificate with the ALB. This ensures that the ALB can terminate SSL/TLS connections on behalf of the EC2 instances.\nExport the certificate from ACM.\nInstall the exported certificate on the EC2 instances. This ensures that the communication between the ALB and EC2 instances is also encrypted.\nBy using ACM, you benefit from the managed certificate service, automated certificate renewal, and easy integration with other AWS services like ALB.

What certificate is being applied? ALB does not pass encrypted traffic to a target. NLB will do that.\n\nyou must deploy at least one SSL server certificate on your load balancer. The load balancer uses a server certificate to terminate the front-end connection and then decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the targets. You must also specify a security policy, which is used to negotiate secure connections between clients and the load balancer.\n\nIf you need to pass encrypted traffic to targets without the load balancer decrypting it, you can create a Network Load Balancer or Classic Load Balancer with a TCP listener on port 443. With a TCP listener, the load balancer passes encrypted traffic through to the targets without decrypting it.\n\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1716626400.0","comment_id":"1079927"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect","poster":"oioi","timestamp":"1716490680.0","comment_id":"1078803","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"cDOQiidmGIPRuZDV3kjA","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732303980.0","comment_id":"1215876","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.

They are evaluated before resource policies.\n\nIf an SCP denies access to a particular service, even a resource policy allowing access on the specific resource won't take effect. The SCP at the root level will override any resource policy attached to individual resources.\n\nSo, while a resource policy can be useful for granting permissions on a specific resource, it cannot be used to override the restrictions imposed by an SCP at a higher level in the organization's hierarchy.
