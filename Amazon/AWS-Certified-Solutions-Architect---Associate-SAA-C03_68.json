This aligns with the principle of least privilege by providing the minimum required permissions for their job activities.\n\nOption E, creating an IAM role with specific permissions for AWS CloudFormation stack operations and allowing the deployment engineer to assume that role, is another valid approach. By using an IAM role, the deployment engineer can assume the role when necessary, granting them temporary permissions to perform CloudFormation actions. This provides a level of separation and limits the permissions granted to the engineer to only the required CloudFormation operations.","timestamp":"1701543480.0","poster":"alexandercamachop","comment_id":"912957"},{"timestamp":"1701402060.0","comment_id":"911658","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nDddd,Eeee","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Babaaaaa"},{"comment_id":"855898","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1696086240.0","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nD & E are a good choices","poster":"elearningtakai"},{"comment_id":"836697","poster":"fruto123","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nI agree DE","timestamp":"1694481660.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/102155-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/","answers_community":["DE (100%)"],"question_id":340,"timestamp":"2023-03-10 15:46:00","choices":{"B":"Create a new IAM user for the deployment engineer and add the IAM user to a group that has the PowerUsers IAM policy attached.","C":"Create a new IAM user for the deployment engineer and add the IAM user to a group that has the AdministratorAccess IAM policy attached.","D":"Create a new IAM user for the deployment engineer and add the IAM user to a group that has an IAM policy that allows AWS CloudFormation actions only.","E":"Create an IAM role for the deployment engineer to explicitly define the permissions specific to the AWS CloudFormation stack and launch stacks using that IAM role.","A":"Have the deployment engineer use AWS account root user credentials for performing AWS CloudFormation stack operations."},"exam_id":31,"answer_ET":"DE","topic":"1"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","provider":"Amazon","isMCOnly":true,"name":"AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":1019,"id":31,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":68},"__N_SSP":true}
