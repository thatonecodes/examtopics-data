It can detect security-related issues, including security groups with overly permissive rules. In this case, it can help you identify security groups that are open to the internet on port 3389, which is the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port.\n\nBy using AWS Trusted Advisor, the SysOps administrator can quickly access a list of security groups that have this unrestricted access configuration. This allows them to review and take necessary actions to tighten the security settings and restrict access as needed.","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"963269","timestamp":"1706243700.0","poster":"Christina666"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722385080.0","content":"D is the correct option","poster":"yagaisiva","comment_id":"1136329"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/security-checks.html#security-groups-specific-ports-unrestricted","timestamp":"1702893300.0","comment_id":"926524","poster":"rdiaz","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":34},{"id":"TB4QkQsdklJDe333yibB","exam_id":34,"unix_timestamp":1682999640,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1714622040.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nThe simplified logic I came up with is if the same existing/working public NACL is applied to the new pub subnet, then no change should need to be made to the rules. On the other hand, the custom DB subnet NACL needs to have new incoming/outgoing rules to also operate with the new public subnet. Incoming is always going to be 3306 to the DB listener (MySQL). Outgoing is always going to be ephemeral from the DB server to public subnet. I must be slow or tired, but It took some effort for this to become clear in my mind tonight. Your only allowing an existing subnet, and you don't want to touch any existing configurations or your going to create a new problem and maybe be looking for a new job. I'd always document a checklist before doing something this, and run it through peer review and change control before touching prod. I'd turn those notes into a SOP and include any references I could fine documenting AWS best practices, etc. Enough said.","poster":"Gomer","comments":[{"comment_id":"886995","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Gomer","timestamp":"1714622160.0","content":"I meant to say \"your only allowing a NEW subnet and you don't want to touch any existing configurations...\""}],"comment_id":"886994","upvote_count":"9"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC. allow inbound to DB,\nD. allow outbound for return port","poster":"jipark","timestamp":"1724046240.0","comment_id":"985002","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1721988540.0","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nTo ensure that the web servers can communicate with the DB instance after adding the third subnet to the Auto Scaling group configuration, you need to make changes to the network ACLs. The network ACLs control the traffic flow in and out of the subnets. Here are the two actions you should take:\n\nA. On the default ACL, create inbound Allow rules of type TCP with the ephemeral port range and the source as the database subnets.\nExplanation: By allowing inbound TCP traffic with the ephemeral port range (usually ports 1024-65535) from the database subnets to the web subnets, you enable communication between the web tier and the database tier. The web servers use these ephemeral ports as source ports when connecting to the database on port 3306.","poster":"Christina666","comments":[{"poster":"Christina666","comment_id":"963581","upvote_count":"1","content":"C. On the network ACLs for the database subnets, create an inbound Allow rule of type MySQL/Aurora (3306). Specify the source as the third web subnet.\nExplanation: This allows inbound MySQL/Aurora (3306) traffic from the third web subnet to the database subnet. Since the error message states that the server cannot connect to the database intermittently, it suggests that the third subnet is being used during scaling events, and this rule will enable the web servers in the new subnet to connect to the database.","timestamp":"1721988540.0"},{"timestamp":"1721989020.0","content":"Sorry, I vote for CD as well, please correct @examptopics \nlink: https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/resolve-connection-sg-acl-inbound","comments":[{"content":"To turn on the connection to a service running on an instance, the associated network ACL must allow the following:\n\nInbound traffic on the port that the service is listening on\nOutbound traffic to ephemeral ports\nWhen a client connects to a server, a random port from the ephemeral port range (1024-65535) becomes the client's source port.\n\nThe designated ephemeral port becomes the destination port for return traffic from the service.
