This is often known as “Zero Frequency”. To solve this, we can use the smoothing technique. One of the simplest smoothing techniques is called Laplace estimation.\nOn the other side naive Bayes is also known as a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from predict_proba are not to be taken too seriously.\nAnother limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. In real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are completely independent.","comment_id":"282666","poster":"cnethers"},{"poster":"cnethers","timestamp":"1632446340.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"282665","content":"If SVM was set to use non linear kernel then I would have to argue that would be the best option for a binary classification issue \nhttps://uk.mathworks.com/discovery/support-vector-machine.html","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1634909280.0","poster":"garud","comment_id":"357580","content":"So what is your final verdict as far as the answer goes?"}]}]},{"id":"PH4NW09jX9BAj3mL2t0I","exam_id":26,"timestamp":"2023-06-09 15:08:00","unix_timestamp":1686316080,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/111690-exam-aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty-topic-1/","answer":"D","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730751900.0","comment_id":"1206617","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JonSno","content":"d - Cloudwatch - no brainer for diagnostics logs"},{"timestamp":"1727737260.0","comment_id":"1187070","upvote_count":"1","poster":"vkbajoria","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCloudWatch"},{"poster":"loict","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA.
