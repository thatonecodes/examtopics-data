However, asynchronous replication can cause delays in synchronizing data between regions, and if the RPO is set too aggressively, it can cause write operations to block when replication is behind.\n\nBy configuring synchronous replication, writes to the primary region will only be acknowledged once the changes are successfully replicated to the secondary regions, reducing the likelihood of replication lag. This means that write operations will be blocked if the replication is lagging and the RPO setting is not met, but the frequency of blocked writes may be reduced because synchronous replication guarantees data consistency across regions.","poster":"youonebe","comment_id":"1332497"},{"timestamp":"1734480900.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTo reduce the frequency of blocked write operations in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL global database, particularly when you're using a 60-second Recovery Point Objective (RPO), the goal is to improve replication performance so that the lag between the primary cluster and its secondary regions does not exceed the 60-second threshold.","poster":"spring21","comment_id":"1328214"}],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/153142-exam-aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-dop-c02/","answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-12-18 01:15:00","exam_id":23,"question_text":"A company uses an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL global database that has two secondary AWS Regions.
