The user has complete control over the virtual networking environment. If the organization wants the Amazon EC2 instances to have a private IP address, he should create a public and private subnet for VPC in each Availability Zone (this is an AWS Elastic Beanstalk requirement). The organization should add their public resources, such as ELB and NAT to the public subnet, and AWC Elastic Beanstalk will assign them unique elastic IP addresses (a static, public IP address). The organization should launch Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet so that AWS Elastic Beanstalk assigns them non-routable private IP addresses. Now the organization should configure route tables with the following rules:\n✑ route all inbound traffic from ELB to EC2 instances\n✑ route all outbound traffic from EC2 instances through NAT\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo-vpc.html","question_images":[],"question_id":136,"timestamp":"2019-12-29 05:03:00","question_text":"An organization is setting up a highly scalable application using Elastic Beanstalk.\nThey are using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) as well as a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets.

With VPC the user can specify multiple private IP addresses for his instances.\nThe number of network interfaces and private IP addresses that a user can specify for an instance depends on the instance type. With each network interface the organization can assign an EIP. This scenario helps when the user wants to host multiple websites on a single EC2 instance by using multiple SSL certificates on a single server and associating each certificate with a specific EIP address.
