Task nodes are optional and can be added to a cluster to perform tasks, but do not contain the HDFS DataNode daemon.\n\nBecause the master and core nodes are critical for the functioning of the EMR cluster, they should be run on On-Demand Instances to ensure they do not get terminated due to Spot Instance price fluctuations.","comment_id":"932602","poster":"gd1","timestamp":"1687614240.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nUsing On-Demand Instances for the primary and core nodes provides a level of stability for the cluster.

As such, task nodes are stateless and can be safely terminated and re-spawned without any data loss.
