They allow users to categorize and track costs based on specific attributes or dimensions, such as application, environment, department, or any other custom criteria. By assigning cost allocation tags to resources, the company can gain visibility into the costs associated with each application.\n\nTo implement this, the company can create and apply appropriate cost allocation tags to the resources used by each application. Once the tags are in place, they can use AWS Cost Explorer or the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to view cost breakdowns based on the assigned tags.

There are some limitation if you use tag to monitor the cost of the application.

It's important to review the documentation of each service to understand which resources can be tagged and how.\n\nLimitations on the granularity of the tags: The granularity of the tags can be limited by the service that the resource belongs to. For example, you may not be able to tag an EC2 instance by its individual usage time, and instead, the tag will apply to the entire instance.
