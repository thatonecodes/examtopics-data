Detect imbalances or disparities in the data: Bias often originates from imbalanced or biased data. By detecting and addressing any imbalances or disparities in the data (such as certain groups being overrepresented or underrepresented), the company can ensure that the model treats all applicants fairly, regardless of their background. This helps to minimize potential bias that could negatively affect certain customers.\n\nC. Evaluate the model's behavior so that the company can provide transparency to stakeholders: Evaluating the model’s behavior is crucial for responsible AI usage.
