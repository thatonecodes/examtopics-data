Amazon S3\nE. Amazon DynamoDB\n\nAmazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB both offer gateway VPC endpoints that allow you to access the services over a private network connection within your VPC, without the need to go over the internet. This can help improve security, reduce latency, and lower data transfer costs.\n\nAmazon SNS, Amazon SQS, and AWS CodeBuild do not offer gateway VPC endpoints. However, you can still use these services securely within your VPC by using VPC endpoints for AWS services or by setting up a VPC peering connection.","timestamp":"1679042280.0","comment_id":"841797"},{"timestamp":"1677816420.0","comment_id":"827649","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nD and E","poster":"harisene","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1677320340.0","poster":"wabosi","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"821367","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nI vote for DE"},{"timestamp":"1674089040.0","comment_id":"780599","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nDE is the answer.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Saif93"},{"comment_id":"745541","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nB is just impossible","poster":"LibertyX","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1671062700.0"},{"comment_id":"696261","upvote_count":"6","content":"Answer is D E.\n\nGateway type endpoints are available only for AWS services including S3 and DynamoDB.
