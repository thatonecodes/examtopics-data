Set part number as the partition key. Do not set a sort key.\nC. Create a global secondary index (GSI) with category as the partition key and brand+model as the sort key. Select ALL for attribute projections.\n\nOption A: Setting part number as the partition key allows customers to search by part number and all the required attributes will be returned.\n\nOption C: Creating a GSI with category as the partition key and brand+model as the sort key allows customers to look for instruments by browsing category, then brand, and finally model.
