For example, if you delete an object, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker instead of removing the object permanently. The delete marker becomes the current object version. If you overwrite an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. You can always restore the previous version.","timestamp":"1675398180.0","poster":"shogan","comment_id":"796713"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.","poster":"Saif93","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"779580","timestamp":"1674012840.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"719221","poster":"JA2018","content":"Selected Answer: B\nagreed","timestamp":"1668560040.0"},{"content":"B is correct","comment_id":"690981","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ksuccex","timestamp":"1665396120.0"},{"timestamp":"1664251140.0","comment_id":"680361","content":"answer is B","poster":"Istiaque","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1663573020.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB seems the logic anwser","comment_id":"673031","poster":"certiflux"},{"timestamp":"1663255260.0","poster":"sumanshu","content":"Vote for B","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"670062"}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-09-15 17:21:00","choices":{"A":"Server access logging","B":"S3 Versioning","D":"Encryption in transit and at rest","C":"S3 Lifecycle rules"},"answer":"B"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"name":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner","numberOfQuestions":988,"provider":"Amazon","id":18,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":118},"__N_SSP":true}
