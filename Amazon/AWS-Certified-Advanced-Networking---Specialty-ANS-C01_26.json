This is crucial for understanding which parts of your architecture are causing the excessive NAT gateway usage. By analyzing these logs, you can pinpoint whether traffic to services like Amazon S3, DynamoDB, or other external services is responsible for the high costs.\n\nVPC endpoints (specifically gateway endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB) allow traffic between your VPC and these AWS services to bypass the NAT gateway, thus reducing the data transfer costs associated with the NAT gateway.
