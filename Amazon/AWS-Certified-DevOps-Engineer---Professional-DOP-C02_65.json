The AWS Lambda function serves as an intermediary between the SNS topic and the Systems Manager Automation runbook. The SNS topic sends a notification to the Lambda function, which then invokes the runbook. This indirect invocation introduces an extra step and potential latency in the application restart process. But as per Answer D, we can create an EventBridge rule that reacts to the CloudWatch alarm entering the ALARM state directly.","comment_id":"898640","poster":"2pk","comments":[],"timestamp":"1684176900.0"},{"poster":"PhuocT","comment_id":"891281","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1683453240.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Configure an AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook that runs a script to restart the application on the instances. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts when the CloudWatch alarm enters ALARM state. Specify the runbook as a target of the rule.\n\nThis solution meets the requirements in the most operationally efficient manner by automating the application restart process on the instances without restarting them. When the CloudWatch alarm enters the ALARM state, the EventBridge rule is triggered, which in turn invokes the Systems Manager Automation runbook that contains the script to restart the application on the instances."},{"comment_id":"888605","poster":"Jeanphi72","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC for me","timestamp":"1683123900.0"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"0dLFS4T7wMf3moo3vZNO","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["ACE (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731480120.0","content":"The IAM user that was created cannot have an access key from the beginning.
