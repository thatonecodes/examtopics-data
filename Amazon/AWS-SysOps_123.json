This rejection indicates that the security group associated with the EC2 instance is blocking outbound communication on TCP port 25.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you should update the security group associated with the EC2 instance to allow outbound communication on TCP port 25. This can be done by adding a rule to the security group that permits outbound traffic on port 25 to the IP range or specific IP address of the SMTP server.","timestamp":"1720437180.0","comment_id":"946424"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"gulu73","timestamp":"1707126240.0","comment_id":"798717","content":"Selected Answer: A\nId choose A"},{"content":"I would go with A since the log is for the SMTP server and other instances can communicate correctly.\nhowever the protocol is wrong its not TCP its UDP (17)","poster":"asfsdfsdf","timestamp":"1676832360.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"551239"},{"comment_id":"433499","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1667797500.0","content":"A is correct.\nThe logs on smtp server side show rejected traffic from instance, therefore traffic does reach smtp server subnet but gets rejected, answer is A.","poster":"Cyril_the_Squirl"},{"content":"A is the answer\n\nTraffic is being rejected so SG inbound should allow traffic to pass through","upvote_count":"1","poster":"RicardoD","timestamp":"1667764260.0","comment_id":"350838"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"339102","poster":"Kimle","timestamp":"1667745840.0","content":"The fact that traffic is detected \"but refused\" in VPC flow logs mean that ec2 instance have SMTP client installed and that client SG allow outbound traffic over port 25. so C,D excluded ..\n- adding ec2 \"smtp client\" to same SG as server doesn't enable it to communicate with the server , a rule must be defined in SG to accept traffic from same SG over port 25 .. \n choice A taxonomy is very weird as it say \" and ensure that is permitted to communicate over TCP port 25.\" does this mean adding inbound rule or outbound rule or what !!"},{"timestamp":"1667731680.0","comment_id":"273959","content":"A.
