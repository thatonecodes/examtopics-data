There is a clear ask for an immutable deployment in the question. CodeDeploy in that answer C mentiones does not have an immutable deployment option.\n\nImmutable deployments perform an immutable update to launch a full set of new instances running the new version of the application in a separate Auto Scaling group, alongside the instances running the old version. Immutable deployments can prevent issues caused by partially completed rolling deployments.
