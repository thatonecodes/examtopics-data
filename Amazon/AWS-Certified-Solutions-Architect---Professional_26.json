For example, you might not want users to have direct access to your stack's app servers or databases and instead require that all public traffic be channeled through an Elastic Load Balancer. A VPC consists of one or more subnets, each of which contains one or more instances. Each subnet has an associated routing table that directs outbound traffic based on its destination IP address. Instances within a VPC can generally communicate with each other, regardless of their subnet. Subnets whose instances can communicate with the Internet are referred to as public subnets. Subnets whose instances can communicate only with other instances in the VPC and cannot communicate directly with the Internet are referred to as private subnets. AWS OpsWorks requires the VPC to be configured so that every instance in the stack, including instances in private subnets, has access to the following endpoints:\nThe AWS OpsWorks service,\nhttps://opsworks-instance-service.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\n.\n\nAmazon S3 -\nThe package repositories for Amazon Linux or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, depending on which operating system you specify.\nYour app and custom cookbook repositories.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingstacks-vpc.html#workingstacks-vpc-basics","choices":{"B":"Subnets whose instances can communicate only with other instances in the VPC and cannot communicate directly with the Internet are referred to as private subnets.","A":"Subnets whose instances cannot communicate with the Internet are referred to as public subnets.","C":"All instances in the stack should have access to any package repositories that your operating system depends on, such as the Amazon Linux or Ubuntu Linux repositories.","D":"Your app and custom cookbook repositories should be accessible for all instances in the stack."},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1616346600,"timestamp":"2021-03-21 18:10:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/47889-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/","question_id":126,"isMC":true,"topic":"1"},{"id":"OtB8yOYNxfSOe49yQ1ge","question_text":"An organization has hosted an application on the EC2 instances.

If the user wants to have secure access to AWS while hosting applications on EC2, the first security rule to follow is to enable MFA for all users. This will add an added security layer. In the second step, the user should never give his access or secret access keys to anyone as well as store inside programs. The better solution is to use IAM roles. For critical data of the organization, the user should keep an offsite/ in premise backup which will help to recover critical data in case of security breach. It is recommended to have AWS AMIs and snapshots as well as keep them at other regions so that they will help in the DR scenario.
