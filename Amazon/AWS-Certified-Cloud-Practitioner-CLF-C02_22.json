Maintain the physical hardware of the infrastructure\" is not the best answer because, according to the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS is responsible for managing the physical infrastructure of the cloud, including data centers and hardware maintenance.

Therefore, option B is the best choice as it aligns with AWS's responsibility for managing encryption options for data stored on their platform."},{"poster":"ODRAMIREZ","comment_id":"1154141","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1708363020.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1700047080.0","poster":"asdfcdsxdfc","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1071359"}],"answers_community":["D (90%)","10%"],"timestamp":"2023-11-15 12:18:00"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":718,"provider":"Amazon","isImplemented":true,"name":"AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02","isBeta":false,"id":19},"currentPage":22},"__N_SSP":true}
