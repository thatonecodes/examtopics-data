Every month, the security team sends an email message with the latest approved AMIs to all the development teams.\n\nThe development teams use AWS CloudFormation to deploy their applications. When developers launch a new service, they have to search their email for the latest AMIs that the security department sent. A DevOps engineer wants to automate the process that the security team uses to provide the AMI IDs to the development teams.\n\nWhat is the MOST scalable solution that meets these requirements?","choices":{"D":"Direct the security team to use Amazon EC2 Image Builder to create new AMIs and to create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic so that every development team can receive notifications. When the development teams receive a notification, instruct them to write an AWS Lambda function that will update their CloudFormation stack with the most recent AMI ARNs.","A":"Direct the security team to use CloudFormation to create new versions of the AMIs and to list the AMI ARNs in an encrypted Amazon S3 object as part of the stack's Outputs section. Instruct the developers to use a cross-stack reference to load the encrypted S3 object and obtain the most recent AMI ARNs.","C":"Direct the security team to use Amazon EC2 Image Builder to create new AMIs and to place the AMI ARNs as parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Instruct the developers to specify a parameter of type SSM in their CloudFormation stack to obtain the most recent AMI ARNs from Parameter Store.","B":"Direct the security team to use a CloudFormation stack to create an AWS CodePipeline pipeline that builds new AMIs and places the latest AMI ARNs in an encrypted Amazon S3 object as part of the pipeline output.

This registration process can be achieved through an AWS Lambda function that is triggered by a CloudFormation Custom Resource.\n\nTherefore, by using a Custom Resource that triggers a Lambda function to register the EC2 instances with the appropriate ECS cluster, the DevOps engineer can ensure that the EC2 instances associate with the intended ECS cluster.
