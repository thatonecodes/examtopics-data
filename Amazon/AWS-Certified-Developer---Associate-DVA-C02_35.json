This caching is designed to improve performance by reducing the number of calls to the Lambda function. However, it can also lead to outdated authorization information being used if the user's attributes change in the identity provider (IdP) but the cached policy in the Lambda authorizer is still based on the old attributes.\n\nIn this case, when the developer initially logged in with the department set to Engineering, the custom Lambda authorizer created and cached a policy based on this information. Subsequently, even after the developer updated their department to Sales in the IdP, the cached policy (which still reflects the Engineering department) was used, leading to the access denial.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1706361780.0","comment_id":"1133367"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"SerialiDr","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis approach leverages the real-time capabilities of WebSocket connections managed by Amazon API Gateway.
