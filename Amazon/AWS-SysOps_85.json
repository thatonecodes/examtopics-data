With asymmetric key cryptography, you can use key pairs consisting of a public key and a private key for encryption and decryption. Symmetric key cryptography, on the other hand, uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption.\n\nAWS KMS allows you to create and manage both types of keys, enabling you to encrypt and decrypt data using asymmetric key pairs or symmetric keys depending on your requirements.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"albert_kuo"},{"content":"Correct Answer: C\nOutdated answer.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"372952","timestamp":"1666831140.0","poster":"TroyMcLure"},{"comment_id":"221787","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Afolabi","timestamp":"1666562520.0","content":"Yes, C is the Answer"},{"content":"C - \nKMS at this time only allows asymmetric cryptography","timestamp":"1665982200.0","comment_id":"77513","upvote_count":"3","poster":"AWS_Noob"},{"comment_id":"64197","timestamp":"1664869740.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer should be C","poster":"sen12"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1663909980.0","content":"Agree it has changed since end of 2019","poster":"Asds","comment_id":"49683"}],"question_id":421,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2019-12-29 10:26:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Private ephemeral key agreement cryptography","B":"Symmetric and asymmetric random number generation key cryptography","C":"Asymmetric key cryptography and symmetric key cryptography","D":"Only symmetric key cryptography"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":36,"answer":"C","answer_description":"The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.

The organization wants a particular group of IAM users to access only the test instances and not the production ones. They want to deploy the instances in various locations based on the factors that will change from time to time, especially in the test group. They expect instances will often need to be churned, i.e. deleted and replaced, especially in the testing group. This means the five instances they have created now will soon be replaced by a different set of five instances. The members of each group, produc-tion and testing, will not change in the foreseeable future.

The user can add conditions as a part of the IAM policies. The condition can be set on AWS Tags, Time, and Client IP as well as on various parame-ters.

This allows you to define a fine-grained IAM policy that grants access to specific resources based on the tags assigned to the IAM users. You can then add a condition to the IAM policy that allows access to instances with specific tags, such as \"TestGroup\" or \"ProductionGroup\".","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719278700.0","comment_id":"933099"}],"question_id":425,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/113218-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-484-discussion/"}],"exam":{"id":36,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"11 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"name":"AWS-SysOps","numberOfQuestions":928,"provider":"Amazon"},"currentPage":85},"__N_SSP":true}
