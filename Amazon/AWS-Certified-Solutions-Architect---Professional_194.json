You don't need an SNS notification and lambda function to update route 53. Router 53 can do the health checks on its own and failover.

Finally, the application's Route 53 record should be updated with a failover policy that routes traffic to the ALB in the backup region when a health check failure occurs.\n\nThis approach provides automatic failover to the backup region when a health check failure occurs, reducing the RTO to less than 15 minutes.
