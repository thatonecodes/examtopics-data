Use AWS CloudFormation and AWS CodeCommit to deploy and manage the infrastructure.\n\nAWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define your infrastructure as code using templates.

This makes it easy to deploy multiple identical copies of your infrastructure, stage changes, and revert to previous versions.\n\nAWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that allows you to store and version-control your CloudFormation templates.
