When you launch an instance, you associate one or more security groups with the instance. You add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group. When we decide whether to allow traffic to reach an instance, we evaluate all the rules from all the security groups that are associated with the instance.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/17406-exam-aws-sysops-topic-1-question-360-discussion/","question_images":[],"exam_id":36,"unix_timestamp":1585092960,"topic":"1","question_text":"What is a security group in Amazon AWS?"},{"id":"SA6DDwrqJYp2JvTn5eqQ","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"Amazon EBS stands for Elastic Block Store.
