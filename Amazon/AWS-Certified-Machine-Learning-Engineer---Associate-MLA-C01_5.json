A high learning rate causes the model to overshoot the optimal point in the loss landscape, leading to oscillations instead of convergence. Reducing the learning rate allows the model to make smaller, more precise updates to the weights, improving convergence.\n\nA. Early stopping prevents overfitting by halting training when validation performance stops improving. However, it does not address the root cause of oscillating loss.\nB. The size of the test set does not affect the training dynamics or loss patterns.\nC. Increasing the learning rate would worsen the oscillations and prevent the model from converging.","comment_id":"1324401"},{"comment_id":"1338355","upvote_count":"4","poster":"ninomfr64","timestamp":"1736428680.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA.
