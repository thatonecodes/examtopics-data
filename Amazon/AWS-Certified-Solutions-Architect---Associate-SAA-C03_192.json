Though server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) would allow AWS to manage keys and enable logging via AWS CloudTrail, this option uses AWS-managed keys instead of customer-managed keys, limiting control over key rotations. Additionally, there can be more costs involved in using AWS-managed KMS keys compared to the customer managing their own.\n\nOption D: Correct. Using server-side encryption with customer-managed AWS KMS keys allows the company to have full control over the encryption keys, including managing and ensuring automatic rotation every year. Moreover, AWS CloudTrail can be employed to log events associated with AWS KMS, enabling the tracking of when keys are rotated.
