This is because internal ELBs are not exposed to the internet, so they can only be accessed by instances that are in the same VPC.\n\nAmazon ELB service allows subnet selection. You can choose which subnets you want to associate with your ELB. This is important for high availability, as you can distribute your ELB across multiple subnets in different availability zones.\n\nInternal ELBs can support only one subnet in each availability zone. This is because each subnet is in a different availability zone, and the ELB needs to be able to reach all of the instances in the subnets.\n\nThe other two statements are incorrect.

There are two ELBs available with VPC: internet facing and internal (private) ELB.

The internal load balancer will route requests to the back-end application instances, which are also using private IP addresses and only accept requests from the internal load balancer.
