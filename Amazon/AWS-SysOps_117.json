To improve security, the Information Security team has deployed an\nApplication Load Balancer (ALB) in separate subnets and pointed the DNS at the ALB instead of the EC2 instances.\nAfter the change, traffic is not reaching the instances, and an error is being returned from the ALB.\nWhat steps must a SysOps Administrator take to resolve this issue and improve the security of the application? (Choose two.)","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1720418700.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nBy adding the EC2 instances to the ALB target group, you allow the ALB to route traffic to the instances. It is essential to configure the health check settings to ensure that the instances are healthy and capable of serving traffic. The ALB periodically checks the health of the instances based on the configured health check settings and directs traffic only to healthy instances.\n\nTo improve the security of the application, it is recommended to restrict access to the EC2 instances from only the ALB. This can be achieved by modifying the security group rules for the instances and allowing inbound traffic only from the security group associated with the ALB. This ensures that traffic is allowed only from the ALB and not directly from the public internet. Additionally, removing the public IPs from the instances enhances security by preventing direct access to the instances.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"albert_kuo","comment_id":"946207"},{"comment_id":"549571","upvote_count":"1","content":"The default answer is correct B and D","timestamp":"1676655180.0","poster":"Adeshina"},{"poster":"TroyMcLure","timestamp":"1666549320.0","comment_id":"375925","upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct Answer: A & D\nlike @XRiddlerX said:\n\"The Security Team deployed the ALB (Application Load Balancer) with no registered targets.
