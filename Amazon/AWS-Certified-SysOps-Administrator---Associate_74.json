For example, you can create environments for development, testing, and production so that you can test changes before implementing them into production. To make templates reusable, use the parameters, mappings, and conditions sections so that you can customize your stacks when you create them. For example, for your development environments, you can specify a lower-cost instance type compared to your production environment, but all other configurations and settings remain the same. \nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#reuse"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"847699","content":"Selected Answer: C\nans: C","timestamp":"1727051040.0","poster":"Amonchaiz"},{"timestamp":"1717820220.0","comment_id":"738680","poster":"michaldavid","content":"Selected Answer: C\nccccccccc","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Liongeek","comment_id":"721525","content":"Ans: C","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716053280.0"},{"timestamp":"1715467560.0","comment_id":"716404","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI believe C","poster":"Atown"},{"comment_id":"699851","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1713612900.0","content":"It looks like B is correct","poster":"Milus"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
