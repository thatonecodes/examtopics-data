It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. You can configure your VPC: you can select its IP ad-dress range, create subnets, and configure route tables, network gateways, and security settings. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a subnet that you select. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the\nInternet. If a subnet's traffic is routed to an in-ternet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet. If a subnet doesn't have a route to the Inter-net gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet. If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet.\nReference:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html","exam_id":36,"answer":"B","question_id":358,"question_text":"You are setting up a VPC and you need to set up a public subnet within that VPC.
