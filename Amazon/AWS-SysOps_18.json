For example, you use a user name and password to sign in to the AWS Management Console. You use access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS API actions.\n\nKey pairs consist of a public key and a private key. You use the private key to create a digital signature, and then AWS uses the corresponding public key to validate the signature. You can create Amazon EC2 key pairs from the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API.\n\nAccess keys consist of an access key ID and a secret access key. You use access keys to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS if you use the AWS SDKs, REST, or Query APIs.\n\nOne can use the IAM API to upload a certificate, via the UploadServerCertificate request.\n\nOption B and E are wrong because this is done via the Console and not via API’s.\n\nFor more information on Security, please visit the below URL:\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"th3wolf","comment_id":"972699","content":"CDE are correct. \nWhile options A (Key pairs) and B (Console passwords) are also related to AWS access, they are not as directly relevant to API access credentials.
