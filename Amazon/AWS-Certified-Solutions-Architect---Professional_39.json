When the user has configured this setup with Wizard, it will create a virtual private gateway to route all the traffic of the VPN subnet.

The correct answer is:\n\nD. The ratio between IOPS and the EBS volume is lower than 50.\n\nThe maximum IOPS to volume size ratio for Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes is 50:1. This means that the number of provisioned IOPS should be lower than 50 times the volume size. For example, if the volume size is 100 GB, the maximum number of provisioned IOPS allowed would be 5,000 (100 GB * 50 IOPS/GB = 5,000 IOPS).\n\nSo, in the given scenario, if the user is trying to create a PIOPS EBS volume with 4000 IOPS and 100 GB size, it falls within the allowed ratio of 50:1.
