ENA provides superior performance characteristics relative to the currently available network interfaces, including higher IOPS, lower latency, and higher bandwidth. x2gd.16xlarge instances require ENA support.

However, the x2gd.16xlarge instance type is based on a newer generation that requires ENA drivers to be installed before changing the instance type.
