The Elastic Load Balancer provides a feature called sticky session which binds the user's session with a specific EC2 instance. If the sticky session is enabled the first request from the user will be redirected to any of the EC2 instances. But, henceforth, all requests from the same user will be redirected to the same EC2 instance. This ensures that all requests coming from the user during the session will be sent to the same application instance.","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730044800.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"C\nWhen sticky session are enabled, if a request comes the first time from a (NEW) user to AWS ELB then the ELB routes each request to an EC2 instance in a zone with the minimum load, subsequent requests from the same user will be served by the same EC2 instance.","poster":"onlinebaba","comment_id":"138398"},{"comment_id":"58924","timestamp":"1728804540.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"awscertified","content":"C.
