By renaming the fields with the “rename” command after the transforming command. For example, “stats count by ComputerName | rename count AS total_count”. This allows you to rename fields after performing transforming commands like table, chart, or stats, enabling you to customize the field names as needed for clarity or consistency in your analysis.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1705215120.0","comment_id":"1122310","poster":"kangaru","content":"Selected Answer: A\nD may be correct, but the example 'stats count (as) totalcount by ComputerName' works only on 'stats' and 'chart'. 'Table' however, does not support using 'as' to rename field on the fly. However, with '| rename input as output' works for all table, chart and stats, which sufficiently satisfy the success criteria of the question.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"A, You rename after the transform command.
