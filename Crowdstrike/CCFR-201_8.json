It excludes sensor monitoring and event collection for the trusted file path\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Excludes host information: This wouldn't be the primary function of a sensor visibility exclusion.\nB. Prevents file uploads: Sensor visibility exclusions focus on monitoring, not file transfer.\nD. Disables detection but allows prevention: While this might be intuitive, sensor visibility exclusions typically disable both detection and prevention for the excluded path.\nCreating a sensor visibility exclusion essentially tells the security software to trust a specific file path and not monitor activity there.
