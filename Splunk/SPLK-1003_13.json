This is because some configuration files, like indexes.conf, must be identical across peer nodes.\n\nTo keep configuration settings consistent across peer nodes, configuration files are managed from the cluster manager node, which pushes the files to the peer-app directories on the peer nodes. Files in the peer-app directories have the highest precedence in a cluster peer's configuration.
