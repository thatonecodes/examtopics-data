There is one crucial difference: when you have indexer acknowledgment turned on, you must specify a channel when you send events.\n\nThe concept of a channel was introduced in HEC primarily to prevent a fast client from impeding the performance of a slow client. When you assign one channel per client, because channels are treated equally on Splunk Enterprise, one client can't affect another.\n\nYou must include a matching channel identifier both when sending data to HEC in an HTTP request and when requesting acknowledgment that events contained in the request have been indexed.
