Export a dashboard panel.\nC. Modify the chart type displayed in a dashboard panel.\nD. Drag a dashboard panel to a different location on the dashboard.\n\nB. Export a dashboard panel.\nThis is correct. Many Splunk dashboards allow you to export the data or chart from a panel (e.g., as a CSV file or other formats) depending on permissions and configuration.\n\nC. Modify the chart type displayed in a dashboard panel.\nThis is correct. When editing a dashboard, you can modify a panel's visualization type (e.g., changing a bar chart to a line chart or pie chart) by accessing the panel's settings.\n\nD. Drag a dashboard panel to a different location on the dashboard.\nThis is correct. Dashboards in Splunk have a drag-and-drop interface, allowing you to rearrange panels for better organization.\n\n\nIncorrect answer A. \nThis option is incorrect in the context of editing dashboards. The term \"output\" is more relevant to creating searches, lookups, or reports, but it is not an option when editing dashboards directly."},{"poster":"JokerRWild","timestamp":"1727508300.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"887795","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC and D is the correct answer.\nA.

Modify the chart type displayed in a dashboard panel - This is possible when editing a dashboard in Splunk. You can change the chart type from the Visualization tab in a panel's Edit menu.\nD.
