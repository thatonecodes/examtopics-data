Use stats when the events need to be viewed as a single correlated event.\n\nThe transaction command is used to group events together based on common field values. It can also use more complex constraints such as the total period of the transaction, delays between events within the transaction, and required beginning and ending events. The stats command is used to calculate statistics on events grouped by one or more fields. It does not retain the raw event and other field values from the original event.\n\nThe transaction command is slower than the stats command, but it is more flexible. It can be used to group events together based on more complex criteria. The stats command is faster, but it is less flexible. It can only group events together based on field values.\n\nThe transaction command is limited to 1000 events. The stats command has no limit on the number of events that it can group together.\n\nIf you need to view the events as a single correlated event, you should use the transaction command.
