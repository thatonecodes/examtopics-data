It must contain the transaction command if it is a root transaction dataset.: This is not true. A root dataset does not have to use the transaction command; it can be a simple base search.\n\nB. It will automatically contain knowledge objects associated with the base search.: This is misleading. While the root dataset can be associated with configurations, it does not automatically contain all knowledge objects.\n\nC. It can contain transforming commands as long as it is a root search dataset.: This is false. The root dataset itself is meant to include only the base search and cannot contain transforming commands like stats, chart, etc.\n\nD. It can only contain a base search with no transforming commands.: This is correct. The root dataset is fundamentally defined as a base search with no additional transformation commands applied.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. It can only contain a base search with no transforming commands.","poster":"ismailwale","timestamp":"1735482180.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732565220.0","poster":"Datta2608","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe root dataset of a data model in Splunk is essentially a base search that sets the foundation for the entire data model.
