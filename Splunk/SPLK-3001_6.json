Increasing the throttling window allows for a broader time range of events to be considered, which can help in better identifying true correlations and reducing false positives.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1702531680.0","content":"Sorry, correcting here option A is correct :\n\nA. Reducing the severity.\n\nReducing the severity would not directly impact the number of false positives in a correlation search. Severity is typically used to assign a level of importance or priority to events or alerts, but it doesn't affect the accuracy or false positive rate of the correlation search itself.","poster":"RIchardMatos","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"922719"}],"comment_id":"922053","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702460700.0"},{"timestamp":"1697571180.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Increasing the throttling window: This option may help reduce false positives. The throttling window determines how long related events are grouped together. If the window is too short, unrelated events may be grouped together, generating false positives. If the window is too long, legitimate events may be excluded from the group. Increasing the window may allow more legitimate events to be grouped together, reducing the number of false positives.","comment_id":"873037","poster":"qtygbapjpesdayazko","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"A is correct","comment_id":"805697","poster":"Ntani","timestamp":"1691782920.0"},{"timestamp":"1656426540.0","content":"Can someone please explain this?","comment_id":"511327","upvote_count":"1","poster":"noysherer"},{"timestamp":"1654058700.0","poster":"andy73","upvote_count":"2","content":"A is correct","comment_id":"491327"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"457135","content":"A is correct","poster":"_adem","timestamp":"1649076540.0"},{"poster":"oksey","timestamp":"1616353860.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"183843","content":"I am not sure but I think B will do the job","comments":[{"timestamp":"1648217400.0","poster":"1qaz2wsx","comment_id":"451423","upvote_count":"1","content":"\"not reduce\""}]}]},{"id":"6OendPZd7TATeWKvZXkY","choices":{"D":"The ES installation package","B":"SplunkBase","C":"www.splunk.com","A":"GitHub"},"question_text":"Where is the Add-On Builder available from?","question_id":27,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":204,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1638324180,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddonBuilder/3.0.1/UserGuide/Installation","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/67005-exam-splk-3001-topic-1-question-31-discussion/","answer":"B","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"805698","poster":"Ntani","timestamp":"1723405320.0","content":"B is correct"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"B.
