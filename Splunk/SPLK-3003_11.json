As a result, the lookup cannot be used by search peers during distributed searches.\n\nHowever, when the \"local=true\" parameter is specified in the lookup command, it tells Splunk to perform the lookup locally on the search head, rather than using a distributed search to perform the lookup on the indexers. This means that the lookup file does not need to be present on the search peers, and the search can be successfully executed even if the lookup has been blacklisted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: the customer needs to modify the search to ensure that the lookup command specifies parameter \"local=true\".
