B is a replicated copy and is not searchable.\n\nFrom the bootcamp slidedeck notes:\nIndividual hosts manage their own retention, but notify master. May trigger fixup activity. One host may have frozen a bucket (perhaps because of uneven disk usage) but others may still have a live copy. If this other copy is live, then the bucket will remain searchable. If only replica copies are available, the data will no longer be searchable.\n\nAny bucket frozen in a cluster is only frozen *on that instance*, however, the peer will notify the CM. This is so that no fixup activity is done for that bucket any longer. That is, if a bucket is “missing” because it was frozen, it won’t be replaced. The assumption is that the other indexers will freeze it themselves relatively soon. The only caveat to this is if one of the remaining copies is a searchable copy (and we froze the primary); in this instance, an already-existing searchable copy can be flagged primary (searchable)."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.0/Indexer/Bucketsandclusters\n\nNote: In 6.3, a change was made in how the cluster responds to frozen primary bucket copies, in order to prolong the time that a bucket remains available for searching:\n\nIn a pre-6.3 cluster, when a primary copy freezes, the cluster does not attempt to reassign the primary to any other remaining searchable copy. Searching on a bucket ceases once the primary is frozen.\nIn 6.3 and later, when a primary copy freezes, the cluster reassigns the primary to another searchable copy, if one exists.
