The correct answer is C. See the link in hwangho's post. Search heads, and all Splunk instances, already have inputs built to read internal logs by default. They just need an outputs.conf to create a tcpout stanza to your indexers to get them to send their internal logs, which is what this question is asking about. In our Splunk environment we have NEVER set up an inputs for internal logs, we only deploy an outputs.conf with our indexers listed in a tcpout stanza, and we get all of our internal logs just fine.\n\nIf you had other logs on a search head (like from a script or something), then yes, you would need an inputs.conf to get those to be read.
