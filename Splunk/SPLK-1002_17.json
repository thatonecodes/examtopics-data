This matches the events tagged for the SpecialProjectX project, specifically those related to the Support Team (team=support).\nWhy not the other options?\nA. tag!=Fuji,Austin: This would exclude tags with the values Fuji and Austin, but it doesn't narrow down to SpecialProjectX or Support Team. Itâ€™s not specific enough for your need.\nB. tag=SpecialProjectX: While this would filter for all events tagged with SpecialProjectX, it doesn't filter for the Support Team specifically.

A Run workflow action: This term is not specific to common Splunk workflow action types and does not align with the search context described.\n\nB. A GET workflow action: Although this could imply retrieving data, a GET action is typically used for retrieving resources and would not specifically handle running a search in a new window with field values.\n\nC. A Search workflow action: This is the correct choice. A Search workflow action is designed to allow users to initiate a new search based on field values extracted from events. It can be configured to open the search results in a new window.\n\nD. A POST workflow action: This is incorrect. A POST action generally submits data to a server and is not typically used for initiating searches based on field values in the context presented.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is C.
