Annotations\nAnnotations in Splunk Enterprise Security allow correlation searches to be tagged with relevant frameworks, like NIST 800-171, CIS, or MITRE ATT&CK. This tagging provides context to the analyst, showing how specific searches align with these frameworks. It effectively maps correlation searches to compliance guidelines or security frameworks.\n\nFramework mapping isn't an official Splunk Enterprise Security feature or term. The closest feature that performs this mapping function in Splunk is indeed Annotations.\n\nSo, C. Annotations is correct because it is the feature in Splunk Enterprise Security designed for mapping correlation searches to frameworks like NIST.","timestamp":"1730582160.0","poster":"CeeCapi","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"I'm not sure about that","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1736419260.0","poster":"supremesplunker","content":"where you sure about any of the questions?","comment_id":"1338294","upvote_count":"2"}],"comment_id":"1289678","poster":"nosavotor","timestamp":"1727377980.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/147258-exam-splk-5001-topic-1-question-34-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-09-10 14:23:00","unix_timestamp":1725970980,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","question_text":"The United States Department of Defense (DoD) requires all government contractors to provide adequate security safeguards referenced in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-171.
