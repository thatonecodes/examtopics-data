If an outer macro contains a nested macro that requires an argument, you can provide the argument using nested parentheses.\n\nFor example, if you have:\n • An inner macro called inner_macro(1) that takes one argument.\n • An outer macro called outer_macro that includes the inner macro.\n\nYou can pass an argument like this:\n`outer_macro(`inner_macro(argument_value)`)`\n\nThis structure allows the argument to be passed correctly to the inner macro.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1360337","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn Splunk, when you have a nested macro (a macro that calls another macro), you can pass arguments to the inner macro through the outer macro.
