Hash values\n\nAccording to David Bianco's Pyramid of Pain, hash values are considered the least effective indicator for continuous monitoring because they are easy for attackers to change. This means that using hash values as indicators creates minimal pain for attackers, as they can simply modify the file slightly to generate a new hash and evade detection.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CeeCapi","timestamp":"1730510040.0","comment_id":"1306034"},{"poster":"nosavotor","timestamp":"1727377980.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Friends could you please confirm this answer","comment_id":"1289659"}],"answer":"D"},{"id":"uutj7EVubwEKzCiOgu6n","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/148161-exam-splk-5001-topic-1-question-15-discussion/","answer":"D","timestamp":"2024-09-26 21:13:00","question_id":7,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1727377980,"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Security Analyst","C":"Security Engineer","B":"SOC Manager","A":"Security Architect"},"isMC":true,"question_text":"An analysis of an organization’s security posture determined that a particular asset is at risk and a new process or solution should be implemented to protect it.

Security Architect\nHere’s a clarification:\n\nSecurity Architect: Primarily responsible for designing and planning the overall security architecture and framework. They make high-level decisions about what data sources, tools, and rules are necessary to protect the organization. If the analyst identifies a need for more context or new data sources, the Security Architect will review and design how these fit into the broader security strategy.\n\nSecurity Engineer: Focused on the hands-on implementation and configuration of security tools and systems. If the Security Architect approves the need for new data sources or changes in correlation rules, the Security Engineer would typically take action to integrate these into the existing systems and ensure they’re functioning as expected.\n\nSo, when an analyst identifies a need for more data sources or rules, the request typically goes to the Security Architect for review. If approved, it is often then passed to the Security Engineer for implementation."},{"poster":"nosavotor","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1289663","timestamp":"1727377980.0","content":"Could someone help me confirm the correctness of this answer"}],"choices":{"D":"Security Architect","A":"SOC Manager","B":"Security Analyst","C":"Security Engineer"},"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/148164-exam-splk-5001-topic-1-question-18-discussion/"}],"exam":{"name":"SPLK-5001","isBeta":false,"id":207,"numberOfQuestions":66,"provider":"Splunk","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":2},"__N_SSP":true}
