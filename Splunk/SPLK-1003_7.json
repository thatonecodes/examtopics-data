By default, the Splunk platform performs line merging, and the value for SHOULD_LINEMERGE is true. You don't normally need to adjust this setting, but in cases where it is necessary, you must configure this setting in the props.conf configuration file on the forwarder that sends the data to Splunk Cloud Platform. If you configure the Splunk platform to not perform line merging by setting the SHOULD_LINEMERGE attribute to false, then the platform splits the incoming data into lines according to what the LINE_BREAKER setting determines.","poster":"shergar","timestamp":"1717230060.0","upvote_count":"9","comments":[{"timestamp":"1722491640.0","comment_id":"794907","comments":[{"content":"Nope, if you look at the question it should merge two lines so option A is correct","timestamp":"1723949220.0","poster":"toney_mu","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"812649"}],"poster":"KiyaK","upvote_count":"2","content":"shouldn't the answer be D (SHOULD_LINEMERGE=false) then?"}],"comment_id":"732489"},{"comment_id":"795425","upvote_count":"1","content":"D - Question states over multiple lines.
