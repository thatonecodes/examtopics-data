They are both knowledge objects.: This statement is true because both data models and pivot tables are considered knowledge objects in Splunk. They enable better data management and analysis.\n\nB. Data models are created out of datasets called pivots.: This statement is false. Data models are structured representations of data that may include datasets, but pivots themselves are not the building blocks of data models.\n\nC. Pivot requires users to input SPL searches on data models.: This statement is false. Pivot does not require users to input SPL searches; instead, it allows users to create visualizations and reports based on drag-and-drop interactions with data models without needing to know SPL.\n\nD. Pivot allows the creation of data visualizations that present different aspects of a data model. This statement is true. The pivot feature enables users to create various visual representations of data based on the underlying data model.","timestamp":"1735421880.0","poster":"ismailwale","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1333179"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"A.
