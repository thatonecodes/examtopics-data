Asset and Identity Framework\n\nExplanation:\nThe Asset and Identity Framework is specifically designed to raise the threat profile of individuals (identities) or devices (assets) by correlating events with contextual information. It achieves this by:\n\nEnriching raw events with metadata about assets (devices, servers) and identities (users, service accounts).\n\nAggregating suspicious activities tied to specific entities (e.g., repeated failed logins from a user or unusual data transfers from a server).\n\nProviding contextual prioritization (e.g., flagging a high-risk activity if it involves a privileged account or a mission-critical server).","poster":"12la12","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740732300.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727377980.0","comment_id":"1289664","poster":"nosavotor","content":"Wildcards are not efficient"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/148165-exam-splk-5001-topic-1-question-19-discussion/","question_id":11,"exam_id":207,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D"},{"id":"VhfYARGxOFJj9SiP9IhM","topic":"1","answer":"A","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following Splunk Enterprise Security features allows industry frameworks such as CIS Critical Security Controls, MITRE ATT&CK, and the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain® to be mapped to Correlation Search results?","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-08-30 23:54:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1725054840,"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Playbooks","A":"Annotations","D":"Enrichments","C":"Comments"},"exam_id":207,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":12,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1395769","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
