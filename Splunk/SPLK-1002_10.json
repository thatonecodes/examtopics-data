Distributable streaming: While eval can be used in distributed environments, it is not specifically categorized as distributable streaming.\n\nB. Report generating: This term usually refers to commands that produce output in a specific format or save reports, which isn't the primary function of eval.\n\nC. Streaming in some modes: This is correct. The eval command is considered a streaming command because it processes and evaluates expressions on each event as it passes through in the search pipeline. However, it can also be used in non-streaming modes in certain contexts when used with commands like stats or timechart.\n\nD. Centralized streaming: This is not a standard classification for eval and doesn't accurately describe its functionality.","comment_id":"1333254","poster":"ismailwale","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735437060.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct\nPG 301 F2","timestamp":"1725921000.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"voiddraco","comment_id":"1281284"},{"comment_id":"1165124","poster":"dupaaaaaa1232","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709502960.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1707796140.0","poster":"Alexi2415","comment_id":"1148883","content":"A is correct https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/9.1.2308/SearchReference/Commandsbytype"}],"exam_id":199,"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":"Report generating","D":"Centralized streaming","A":"Distributable streaming","C":"Streaming in some modes"},"unix_timestamp":1707796140,"question_id":50,"answer":"A","answer_images":[]}],"exam":{"provider":"Splunk","numberOfQuestions":180,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":199,"name":"SPLK-1002","isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":10},"__N_SSP":true}
