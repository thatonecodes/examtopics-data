After you access the Add Data page, choose one of three options for getting data into your Splunk platform deployment with Splunk Web: (1) Upload, (2) Monitor, (3) Forward\n\nThe Upload option lets you upload a file or archive of files for indexing. When you choose Upload option, Splunk Web opens the upload process page.\nMonitor.
