It allows you to use wildcard characters to match parts of a string.\nWildcard Usage: The % symbol is used as a wildcard in Splunk's like() function. It matches any number of characters (including zero characters).\nCorrect Syntax: The where command combined with the like() function is the correct way to filter results based on a pattern match.\nPattern Matching: The pattern \"108.%\" will match any clientip that starts with \"108.\" followed by any number of characters.","upvote_count":"9","comment_id":"1265383","poster":"freeolive_guru","timestamp":"1723585620.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/145690-exam-splk-1002-topic-1-question-137-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1723585620,"answer":"B","choices":{"D":"... | search clientip=108","C":"... | where (clientip=108.%)","A":"... | where (clientip, \"108.%\"","B":"... | where like(clientip, \"108.%\")"}},{"id":"hvGy7HzMNCh3cIIPo6Fo","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"exam_id":199,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","question_text":"Which of the following knowledge objects can reference field aliases?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733240760.0","poster":"NastyNutsu","comment_id":"1321434","content":"Selected Answer: C\nField Extractions > Field Aliases > Calculated Fields > Lookups > Event Types > Tags"},{"content":"C.
