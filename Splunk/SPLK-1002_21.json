The macro's argument count setting is 3 or more.\n\nFor a macro to accept three arguments, the macro's argument count setting needs to be configured to allow three or more arguments. The argument count setting determines the number of arguments that a macro can accept. By setting it to 3 or more, the macro becomes capable of receiving three specific arguments.\n\nOption A, stating that the macro's name ends with (3), is not a requirement for a macro to accept three arguments. The name of the macro does not determine the number of arguments it can accept.\n\nOption B, suggesting that the macro's name starts with (3), is also not a requirement. Again, the name of the macro does not dictate the number of arguments it can receive.\n\nOption D, claiming that nothing is required and all macros can accept any number of arguments, is incorrect.

Arguments are defined at execution time: Macros allow you to define placeholders for arguments that can be filled in with specific values when the macro is executed. The values of these arguments are provided at runtime or execution time, allowing for flexibility and dynamic customization of the macro's behavior.\n\nC. Argument values are used to resolve the search string at execution time: Macros often include a search string as part of their definition.
