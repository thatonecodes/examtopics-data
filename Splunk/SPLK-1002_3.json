A field added by an automatic lookup can be used as a source for a calculated field. When a lookup is configured to automatically add fields to events based on a lookup table, the added fields can be used in calculations just like any other field.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a lookup table that maps user IDs to department names. When you perform a search and the lookup table is applied, a new field called \"department\" is automatically added to each event, based on the user ID in the event. You can then use this \"department\" field as a source for a calculated field, such as counting the number of events by department.
