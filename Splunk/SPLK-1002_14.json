Field2 will still retain whatever values it has from previous events or selections if it is present. \n\nHere’s a breakdown of the other options for clarification:\n\nA. field1 and field2 values are merged.: This is incorrect. There is no merging of values; each field retains its own values independently.\n\nB. field2 values are removed from the events.: This is incorrect. Values for field2 are not removed; they simply are not present in this specific event.\n\nD. field2 values are replaced with the value of field1.: This is incorrect. Values in field2 are not replaced by any value from field1 unless specifically programmed to do so with a command.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1734011700.0","comment_id":"1325642","upvote_count":"2","poster":"FrozenYeti","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSelect Overwrite field values if you want your field alias to remove the field alias name when the original field does not exist or has no value, or replace the field alias name with the original field name when the field alias name already exists.\nREF: https://kinneygroup.com/blog/splunk-fields-of-dreams-how-to-create-calculated-fields-and-aliases/#:~:text=(Optional)%20Select%20Overwrite%20field%20values,Click%20Save."}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/152892-exam-splk-1002-topic-1-question-159-discussion/","choices":{"A":"field1 and field2 values are merged.","D":"field2 values are replaced with the value of the field1.","B":"field2 values are removed from the events.","C":"field2 values are unchanged."}},{"id":"0XXnbCmUBmQpW1TuvV7G","question_id":67,"timestamp":"2020-12-10 23:18:00","question_text":"A data model consists of which three types of datasets?","choices":{"B":"Events, searches, transactions.","A":"Constraint, field, value.","C":"Field extraction, regex, delimited.","D":"Transaction, session ID, metadata."},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/39574-exam-splk-1002-topic-1-question-16-discussion/","topic":"1","exam_id":199,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1607638680,"discussion":[{"content":"B:\n\nPg. 231 of the PDF","comment_id":"240480","upvote_count":"14","timestamp":"1639174680.0","poster":"Brandflakes"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nData model can consist of 3 types of datasets - Events, Searches and Transactions so B is correct answer.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1000746","timestamp":"1725635820.0","poster":"kruasan"},{"comment_id":"621570","content":"Per F2 pdf, Data model can consist of 3 types of datasets - Events, Searches and Transactions so B is correct answer.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1687602360.0","poster":"MxQ3"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1646795280.0","poster":"Nanila","comment_id":"306110","content":"Events, searches, and transaction pg. 231"},{"comment_id":"267091","timestamp":"1642173360.0","poster":"t4ufiq","upvote_count":"2","content":"B;\nyou can check on this web page:\nhttps://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Datamodeldataset"}],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Datamodeldataset","answer_images":[]},{"id":"cA8B0eN85fZIbrojF6Vh","topic":"1","question_id":68,"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.1/Knowledge/Acceleratedatamodels\nWhen you run a tstats search on an accelerated data model where the search has a time range that extends past the summarization time range of the data model, the search will generate results from the summarized data within that time range and from the unsummarized data that falls outside of that time range.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741153020.0","poster":"silverm4n","comment_id":"1365285"},{"poster":"jiiieee","comment_id":"1363686","timestamp":"1740863100.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhen a data model is accelerated, Splunk precomputes a summary of the data model to improve search performance.
