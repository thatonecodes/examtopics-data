Examples of command modifiers include:\n\n- The stats command modifier, which calculates statistics based on the search results\n- The sort command modifier, which orders the search results based on specific fields\n- The top command modifier, which returns the most frequent values for a specific field","poster":"JokerRWild","upvote_count":"6"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
