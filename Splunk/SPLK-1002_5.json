There is a limit to the number of fields that can be extracted.: This statement is misleading. While there may be practical limits related to performance, there isnâ€™t a strict predefined limit specifically imposed by the editing of a regex.\n\nB. The user is unable to return to the automatic field extraction workflow.: This is true. Once a user edits a regex for manual field extraction, they typically cannot revert back to the automatic extraction configuration that was generated prior to editing.\n\nC. The user is unable to preview the extractions.: This statement is false. Users can still preview the field extractions even after editing the regex.\n\nD. The extraction is added at index time.: This is false.

The user is unable to return to the automatic field extraction workflow.\n\nManual Editing Impact: According to the Splunk documentation, when a user manually edits the regular expression in the Field Extractor, it takes them out of the automatic field extraction workflow. This is supported by result which states, \"You can manually edit the regular expression. However, doing this takes you out of the field extractor workflow. When you save your changes to the field extraction, the field extractor takes you to the final Save step.\"\nPreview Limitation: The documentation also mentions that you can only return to the field extractor workflow if you have not yet tried to preview a regular expression change. Once you preview the change, the option to go back is no longer available.","poster":"freeolive_guru","timestamp":"1723596300.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1265452"},{"poster":"SnakeTech","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1246318","timestamp":"1720732020.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is answer, tested"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer A","comment_id":"1239467","poster":"MShubo","timestamp":"1719709860.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nNO , I suppose it would be B , A is not .. its a typo mistake","upvote_count":"2","poster":"MartinCaplan","timestamp":"1710765780.0","comment_id":"1176479"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A guys , I verified it at exam .","timestamp":"1710675060.0","poster":"MartinCaplan","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1175758"}],"choices":{"B":"The user is unable to return to the automatic field extraction workflow.","D":"The extraction is added at index time.","C":"The user is unable to preview the extractions.","A":"There is a limit to the number of fields that can be extracted."},"exam_id":199,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (73%)","A (27%)"],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/136395-exam-splk-1002-topic-1-question-117-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":21,"timestamp":"2024-03-17 12:31:00","question_text":"What happens when a user edits the regular expression (regex) field extraction generated in the Field Extractor (FX)?","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B"},{"id":"LkuQI3xPxP4gUfvuMd2s","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":199,"topic":"1","question_id":22,"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"NaN","D":"N/A","A":"NULL","B":"0"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/118294-exam-splk-1002-topic-1-question-118-discussion/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-08-17 00:19:00","unix_timestamp":1692224340,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"ismailwale","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct:\nif the fillnull command is used without specifying a value argument, it replaces null values with 0 by default.","timestamp":"1735433820.0","comment_id":"1333238","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725918180.0","comment_id":"1281265","poster":"voiddraco","content":"got this question earlier, its B"},{"poster":"Pandasbutt","content":"Answer is B","timestamp":"1692224340.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"983073"}],"question_text":"What does the fillnull command replace null values with, if the value argument is not specified?"},{"id":"uJjnwPNhDJcfA9TfPepN","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"| transaction(clientip,5m,1m)","D":"| transaction(clientip, 5, 1)","B":"| transaction clientip maxspan=5 pause=1","C":"| transaction clientip maxspan=5m maxpause=1m"},"question_id":23,"timestamp":"2023-08-18 03:46:00","unix_timestamp":1692323160,"exam_id":199,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","question_text":"What is the correct syntax for the transaction command?","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/118371-exam-splk-1002-topic-1-question-119-discussion/","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725918240.0","content":"C\n pg129 F2","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1281266","poster":"voiddraco"},{"comment_id":"984118","timestamp":"1692323160.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"C\n\nRef: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.1.0/SearchReference/Transaction#:~:text=1.%20Transactions%20of%20Web%20access%20events%20based%20on%20IP%20address","poster":"aarvee"}],"answers_community":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"ywzCiKQA06uo9jhDWTyu","question_id":24,"answer_ET":"ABC","isMC":true,"answer":"ABC","question_text":"Which of the following statements describe the Common Information Model (CIM)?
