A token in a search can be replaced by a form input value.\nAccording to Splunk documentation, form inputs can dynamically impact dashboard panels by capturing user selections or inputs as tokens. These tokens can then be used to replace parts of the inline search query within the dashboard panel, allowing the panel's data and visualizations to update based on the user's interaction with the form input. This functionality enables dynamic and interactive dashboards.\nFor example:\nA dropdown or text input can populate a token, which is then substituted into an inline search to filter or modify the search results displayed in the panel","timestamp":"1732150500.0","comment_id":"1315577","upvote_count":"1","poster":"cagdaskarabag"}],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":201,"choices":{"A":"A token in a search can be replaced by a form input value.","D":"Adding a form input to a dashboard converts all panels to prebuilt panels.","B":"Panels powered by an inline search require a minimum of one form input.","C":"Form inputs can not impact panels using inline searches."},"topic":"1","question_id":62,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2024-11-21 01:55:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/151736-exam-splk-1004-topic-1-question-8-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1732150500,"question_text":"How can form inputs impact dashboard panels using inline searches?"},{"id":"YgbveRRk0ZQPjhcuzvox","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2024-05-10 00:44:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Upload a lookup file directly to the alert.","A":"Use the lookup dropdown in the alert configuration window.","B":"Follow a lookup with an alert command in the search bar.","C":"Run a search that uses a lookup and save as an alert."},"exam_id":201,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/splunk/view/140244-exam-splk-1004-topic-1-question-9-discussion/","answer":"C","discussion":[{"poster":"cagdaskarabag","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Run a search that uses a lookup and save as an alert.\n\nIn Splunk, lookups are used within searches to enrich or filter data. To reference a lookup in an alert, you must first create a search that incorporates the lookup (e.g., using the inputlookup or lookup command). Once the search is defined and tested, it can be saved as an alert to trigger based on specific conditions.","comment_id":"1315578","timestamp":"1732150680.0"},{"poster":"emlch","timestamp":"1715294640.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nYou can either use the | outputlookup command in the alert search or select the \"Output results to lookup\".
