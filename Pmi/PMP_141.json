Create a work breakdown structure (WBS) of the new scope with the internal projects, create a change request with the scope of the new internal projects, and manage the quality of the delivery.\n\nThe reason is that the project manager should follow the change management process to document and approve the new scope of creating internal projects for the internships. The project manager should also create a WBS to define and decompose the work required for the internal projects, and manage the quality of the delivery to ensure that the internships meet the customerâs expectations and objectives. Using the projectâs contingency budget Â© may not be necessary or appropriate, as it is meant for addressing known risks or uncertainties, not for adding new scope.
