This ensures that stakeholder needs are addressed, potential conflicts are mitigated, and alignment is achieved. Stakeholders may have differing priorities, and addressing these differences early improves buy-in and minimizes resistance.","comment_id":"1317075"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\n\"When engaging the stakeholders\" the PM should consider their positions regarding the project's output.\n\nIf you apply a response for a risk that is affecting the investment stakeholders, I doubt that a household wants to hear it.\n\nThis way PM can better align with their objectives, preferences and tailor the communication.
