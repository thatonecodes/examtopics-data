This approach fosters a continuous learning culture and helps the team become self-sufficient in solving problems.\nB. This option does not promote team collaboration or self-sufficiency. It relies on external intervention rather than empowering the team to solve their own problems. C. While discussing development plans is important, this approach bypasses the immediate need to address the knowledge gap within the team and does not involve the team in finding a solution. D. Directly providing training might be necessary in some cases, but it does not involve the team in identifying and addressing the knowledge gaps collectively. It also does not promote the team's self-sufficiency in continuous improvement.","timestamp":"1725789300.0","poster":"thewalker","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1280290"},{"timestamp":"1692793560.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA = correct","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"988306","poster":"Petrevski"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":181,"timestamp":"2023-08-23 14:26:00","topic":"1","exam_id":127,"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Meet with the team member's line manager to discuss their development plan.","D":"Provide the team member with training in any lacking areas.","B":"Ask the line manager to assign the team member with the required technical knowledge.","A":"Facilitate a team discussion to identify knowledge gaps and determine the best way to address them."},"question_text":"An agile coach is working with a team that serves clients making product requests by phone.
