Discussing a significant issue like team fatigue and productivity drop would likely require more time and depth than a standup allows.\nOption B: Discuss the issue with the team at a special meeting for this purpose.\n\nWhile this could work, it might disrupt the team’s schedule and add to their fatigue. The retrospective is already a dedicated time for reflection and improvement, making it a more natural fit for this discussion.\nOption C: Discuss the issue with the project stakeholders at a special meeting for this purpose.\n\nInvolving stakeholders directly in team dynamics and internal issues might not be appropriate.
