Only thing we can assume for sure is that the stakeholders influence would increase with promotion so based on that stakeholder registry needs to be updated.","timestamp":"1717878360.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer.\nThe stakeholder has been promoted to lead another project. With this promotion, his priorities will change, his needs will change. The PM needs to do a brand new stakeholder analysis to see where he stands now on the power/influence grid and then update the engagement strategy according to his new role. He may no longer be interested or supportive towards this project, as his priority would now be to make his own project a success.","upvote_count":"8"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nTo ensure proper communication with the stakeholder who has been promoted to lead another functional area, the project manager should have the project team update the stakeholder register.\n\nThe stakeholder register is a key document that lists all stakeholders involved in the project and their roles, responsibilities, and communication requirements. The register should be updated whenever there are changes in stakeholder roles or responsibilities.\n\nIn this situation, the stakeholder who has been promoted to lead another functional area is still a stakeholder in the project. Therefore, the stakeholder register should be updated to reflect their new role and any changes in their communication requirements.\n\nUpdating the project management plan or the stakeholder engagement plan may also be necessary, but the stakeholder register is the most appropriate document to update in this situation.

Recording the new role and any updated contact details ensures the project team has accurate data. However, this alone doesn’t guarantee that communication remains effective—it’s a record, not a strategy.\n\nThe Communications management plan, on the other hand, builds on stakeholder information to define how communication occurs. If the promoted stakeholder’s new position alters their communication needs—such as frequency, format, or content—adjusting this plan ensures those needs are met. Since the question focuses on \"proper communications\" and implies action to maintain effectiveness across all stakeholders, the Communications management plan is the most directly relevant document. It uses updated stakeholder data (from the register) to adapt communication strategies as needed.","timestamp":"1740758700.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe Communications Management Plan defines how project information is shared with stakeholders, including methods, frequency, and responsibilities.
