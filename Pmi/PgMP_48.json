Cross-train the project managers to share expertise.\n\nCross-training project managers in a program environment is a strategic approach to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and skill enhancement across the program. By ensuring that project managers are trained in various aspects of the program, not just their specific projects, the program manager is enhancing the overall capability and flexibility of the team. This approach helps in managing interdependencies more effectively and ensures that the team can adapt to changes or challenges within the program. It also promotes a unified understanding of the program's objectives and enhances the team's ability to work cohesively towards common goals.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"happykaur"},{"timestamp":"1718979900.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"A or C.

Prioritize which change requests are critical to the project based on an impact analysis, resource only critical change requests until overdue milestones are achieved, and update the risk register.\n\nThis option allows the program manager to manage resources effectively by focusing on the most impactful change requests while also addressing the overdue milestones. By updating the risk register, the program manager acknowledges and documents the issue, which is crucial for transparency and future reference. This approach helps in balancing the need to accommodate necessary changes with the imperative to meet key milestones, thereby maintaining control over the program's progress and resource allocation.","comment_id":"1102745","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718980440.0","poster":"[Removed]"}],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A program manager is concerned because several change requests in a component project are causing delays to the program's work package milestones.
