Throughout the project lifecycle\n\nProject Risk Management should be conducted throughout the project lifecycle. It is an ongoing and iterative process that involves identifying, assessing, analyzing, and managing risks from the initiation of the project to its closure. Risk management activities are not limited to a single phase or stage of the project but should be continuously applied to address new risks that may arise, reassess existing risks, and adapt risk response strategies as the project progresses. Effective risk management is a dynamic and ongoing effort to ensure that potential risks are identified, addressed, and mitigated throughout the project's duration.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702769280.0","poster":"041ba31","comment_id":"1098559"},{"comment_id":"186392","content":"D-Throughout the project lifecycle","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1600968660.0","poster":"MoonManBlue"}],"answer":"D","question_id":156,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-09-24 19:31:00","choices":{"A":"Project Planning","B":"Monitoring and Controlling","C":"Quality Planning","D":"Throughout the project lifecycle"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32587-exam-capm-topic-1-question-241-discussion/"},{"id":"FrJI48VqLWVjMwXQcehY","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32747-exam-capm-topic-1-question-242-discussion/","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1601049900,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-09-25 18:05:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":126,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Reduces project cost by use of modern technologies allowing seamless team collaboration\n\nOne of the key benefits of using virtual project teams is the potential for reducing project costs. Virtual teams leverage modern technologies and tools to collaborate and communicate, which can lead to cost savings associated with reduced travel, office space, and other overhead expenses. By enabling team members to work from different locations, organizations can tap into a global talent pool and access specialized skills without incurring the same costs as traditional collocated teams. While virtual teams may introduce certain challenges, such as managing virtual communication and team dynamics, they offer cost-effective ways to assemble and manage project teams.","comment_id":"1098553","poster":"041ba31"}]}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":374,"isBeta":false,"id":126,"isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Pmi","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"CAPM"},"currentPage":32},"__N_SSP":true}
