Since the team already formed new agreements to address the issues, the next logical step is to reflect on why the same problems resurfaced. Did the team fail to follow the agreements, or were the agreements not effective? This aligns with PMBOK’s emphasis on team performance and adaptation.\n\nBy challenging the team constructively, the project lead encourages honest reflection and problem-solving — a key principle of servant leadership and agile retrospectives.
