Management wants to avoid risks, so fast tracking would not be helpful. Fast tracking is a technique for compressing project schedule. In fast tracking, phases are overlapped that would normally be done in sequence. It is shortening the project schedule without reducing the project scope.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: Crashing adds people and costs but is relatively safe in regard to risks.\nC: Critical chain is not a schedule compression technique and would not necessarily help the project get back on schedule.\nD: Lead time, similar to fast tracking, can increase project risks; however, fast tracking is more risky than lead time. Lead time allows individual activities to overlap, while fast tracking allows entire project phases to overlap.","unix_timestamp":1647475800,"question_id":16,"question_text":"Ben is the project manager of the NHF Project for his organization.
