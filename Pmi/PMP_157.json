Analyze the requirements that will need to be addressed under the requested method.\n\nWhen the development team requests a change in approach from predictive to agile due to changing regulatory requirements, the project manager should start by analyzing the requirements and implications of this change. This involves assessing whether the agile approach is better suited to handle the changing regulatory landscape and whether it aligns with the project's goals.\n\nAfter analyzing the requirements and potential benefits of adopting an agile approach, the project manager can then work with the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders to determine if the change is feasible and whether it requires adjustments to the project plan, budget, or scope. This analysis will help ensure that the project can adapt effectively to the changing regulatory requirements while maintaining alignment with its objectives.","poster":"Only12go","comment_id":"1049536"},{"poster":"victory108","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1693191480.0","comment_id":"991766","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
