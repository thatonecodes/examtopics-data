Add this risk to the risk register and monitor it according to the risk management plan.\n\nIn a hybrid project where different teams or components are using different methodologies (in this case, agile for software development), it's essential to acknowledge and manage the potential risks associated with these differences. By adding this risk to the risk register and monitoring it according to the risk management plan, the project manager can proactively track and address the software team's potential challenges in meeting delivery dates.
