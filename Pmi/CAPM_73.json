Get it? Together, Strategic & Business Management + Leadership = Leadership & Business Intelligence. It's also explicitly, yet vaguely worded in a few sentences on PMBOK page pg. 57. \n\nTo me, this question is asking for ONE answer that answers the TWO missing sides of the PMI Talent Triangle.

Page 57 of PMBOK 6 references the PMI talent triangle. “ While TECHNICAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT skills are core to the program and project management, PMI research indicates that they are not enough in todays increasingly complicated and competitive global marketplace. I take that to mean they are specifically referring to technical project management skills not being enough. It wouldn’t make sense for PMI to produce and trademark this thing and then say “ it’s not enough”. The book goes on to say that organizations are looking for added skills in leadership and business intelligence and that various organizations state their belief that these competencies can support longer range strategic objectives that contribute to the bottom line. Again, my interpretation is that PMBOK is saying the other two skills ( leadership and strategic business management) are the skills needed.","comment_id":"805484","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Zmfoutch","timestamp":"1707673860.0"},{"timestamp":"1702737240.0","comment_id":"747287","poster":"anfacer","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTricky question, altough D is the core of talent triange in page 57 states they are not enoguh for long term but ends by saying is good to have balanced. \nI dont think this questions is well formulated.","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"D - p. 56","timestamp":"1702316580.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"741939","poster":"ManagerBodia"}],"unix_timestamp":1600893480,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32451-exam-capm-topic-1-question-89-discussion/","question_text":"Due to today's competitive global market, organizations require more than technical project management skills.
