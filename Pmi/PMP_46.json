This updated plan should outline expectations for communication frequency, methods, and protocols for sharing information. Encouraging all teams to review and adhere to this plan ensures that everyone is on the same page regarding communication practices, which can help address the issue of team A feeling left out due to delayed or missed information. Also, implementing a standardized status reporting template ensures consistent and timely updates from all teams. This template should include key progress updates, challenges, and any other relevant information that needs to be shared regularly among the teams.
