Fallback Plan.\n\nA fallback plan is a contingency plan that is put into action when the primary risk response strategy does not work as expected or fails to fully mitigate the risk. This plan is essentially a backup approach to address the risk, providing an alternative means of risk response if the initial plan proves to be insufficient. Having a fallback plan in place is a part of thorough risk management, ensuring that the project is prepared for scenarios where the first line of defense against a risk doesn't work as intended.","timestamp":"1718623680.0","poster":"[Removed]"}],"unix_timestamp":1702819680,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"exam_id":132,"answers_community":[],"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/128818-exam-pgmp-topic-1-question-249-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following plans should a project manager implement if a selected risk strategy fails to be fully effective?","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Mitigation management plan","A":"Fallback plan","D":"Mitigation plan","B":"Risk response plan"},"topic":"1"},{"id":"DnCvSjn86FMohZxm4kqx","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1317618","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732551120.0","poster":"AmrKHALIL","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Often, these changes seem minor on their own but can accumulate over time, leading to significant shifts in the project's direction, workload, and resource requirements.

Cost overrun for work completed.\n\nThe CPI is a measure used in project management to assess the cost efficiency and financial effectiveness of a project. It is calculated by dividing the Earned Value (EV) of the work performed by the Actual Cost (AC) of the work. A CPI value of less than 1.0 means that the project is costing more than planned for the work that has been completed, indicating a cost overrun. Essentially, for every unit of currency spent, less value is being earned than was anticipated in the project plan.","comment_id":"1098972","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1657343580.0","comment_id":"519995","poster":"SyedCert","upvote_count":"1","content":"CPI = EV/AC ( > 1 : Under planned cost, < 1 : Over planned cost)\nCV = 1 on budget/schedule (hence D)","comments":[{"content":"CPI is \"LESS\" than 1.0 => Cost overrun hence A","comment_id":"609510","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1669778940.0","poster":"Salim_7"}]},{"poster":"tsangckl","content":"yes, less then.
