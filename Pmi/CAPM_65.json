Communications management plan.\n\nWhen facing a critical issue that requires immediate action from upper management of a specific stakeholder group, the project manager should refer to the Communications Management plan.

Stakeholder and Communications work like brothers together, where communications is about how to get relevant information to stakeholders in a timely manner and how to do so most effectively and efficiently. In this question, there is a critical issue that needs to be communicated quickly BECAUSE a specific stakeholder group needs to take immediate action.

You need to communicate this information quickly and through the proper channel to get to this specific stakeholder group.
