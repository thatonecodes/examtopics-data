{"pageProps":{"questions":[{"id":"bRSeUtWvh89JHJjuFNkH","answer_description":"A salience model uses three values to classify stakeholders: power, urgency, and legitimacy in the project. The salience model is a technique for categorizing stakeholders according to their importance. The various difficulties faced by the project managers are as follows: How to choose the right stakeholders? How to prioritize competing claims of the stakeholders communication needs? Stakeholder salience is determined by the evaluation of their power, legitimacy and urgency in the organization. Power is defined as the ability of the stakeholder to impose their will. Urgency is the need for immediate action. Legitimacy shows the stakeholders participation is appropriate or not. . The model allows the project manager to decide the relative salience of a particular stakeholder.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: This is a description of an influence/impact grid over the project.\nC: This is a description of a power/impact over the project.\nD: This is a description of a power/interest grid.","choices":{"B":"Classifies stakeholders based on their influence and impact.","A":"Describes classes of stakeholders based on their power, urgency, and legitimacy.","D":"Groups stakeholders based on their power and interest.","C":"Describes classes of stakeholders based on their power and influence."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/31708-exam-pmi-sp-topic-2-question-87-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mopar","timestamp":"1726742640.0","content":"Per PMBOK:\nuSalience model.

The critical path will be determined by the duration of the project activities and the sequencing of the project events. A critical path is the sequence of project activities, which add up to the longest overall duration. This determines the shortest time possible to complete the project. Any delay of an activity on the critical path directly impacts the planned project completion date (i.e. there is no float on the critical path). A project can have several, parallel, near critical paths. An additional parallel path through the network with the total durations shorter than the critical path is called a sub-critical or non-critical path. These results allow managers to prioritize activities for the effective management of project completion, and to shorten the planned critical path of a project by pruning critical path activities, by \"fast tracking\" (i.e., performing more activities in parallel), and/ or by \"crashing the critical path\" (i.e., shortening the durations of critical path activities by adding resources).\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: The project calendar must be considered to determine when the project work is allowed to take place in the different sites.\nC: The resource calendar must be considered for the availability of the project resource.\nD: Time zone differences must be considered for communication demands and coordination of events between the geographical sites.","choices":{"C":"Resource calendar","B":"Critical path","A":"Project calendar","D":"Time zone differences"},"unix_timestamp":1589227980,"answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-05-11 22:13:00","topic":"2","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/20333-exam-pmi-sp-topic-2-question-98-discussion/","question_text":"You are the project manager for your organization.
