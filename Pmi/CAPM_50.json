It represents the list of tasks that the team plans to complete during the sprint. It helps in defining what work will be done during the sprint and is crucial for planning and tracking progress.\n\nSprint retrospective (D): This is a meeting that occurs at the end of each sprint where the team reflects on the past sprint and identifies what went well and what could be improved. It is an important part of the agile process to continuously improve the team's performance.","comments":[{"content":"The other options:\n\nIncrements (B): While important, increments refer to the sum of all the completed product backlog items at the end of a sprint. It's a result rather than a planning artifact.\n\nDaily scrum (C): This is a daily meeting during the sprint where the team synchronizes activities and plans for the next 24 hours. It is not part of the initial planning phase but occurs daily during the sprint.\n\nSprint review (E): This is a meeting held at the end of the sprint to review the increment and get feedback. It is not part of the initial planning phase but occurs at the end of each sprint.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1236367","poster":"flee","timestamp":"1719235380.0"}],"comment_id":"1236366"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["AD (50%)","AE (25%)","AB (25%)"],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/142868-exam-capm-topic-1-question-353-discussion/"},{"id":"QiMvI5qGm7sqjBJaCpoY","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32711-exam-capm-topic-1-question-36-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Which project documents can determine the budget?","choices":{"C":"Business case, project charter, statement of work, and cost estimates","D":"Scope baseline, resource management plan, activity list, and assumption log","A":"Procurement documents, contracts, requirements documentation, and basis of estimates","B":"Basis of estimates, cost estimates, project schedule, and risk register"},"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2020-09-25 13:24:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1648214640.0","poster":"MoonManBlue","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"186938","content":"B-Basis of Estimates, Cost Estimates, Project Schedule, Risk Register-7.3"},{"timestamp":"1732354800.0","comment_id":"904694","poster":"ChymKuBoy","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB for sure"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Ibrahim_M","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct option is B.

Change the delivery date and deliver the initially agreed-upon scope after mitigation of the identified risk.\n\nHere’s why this option is appropriate:\n\nDelivery Date Adjustment: By changing the delivery date, the team acknowledges the impact of the risk and adjusts their timeline accordingly. This allows them to manage expectations and plan for the extended duration.\nRisk Mitigation: The team should actively work on mitigating the identified risk. This could involve additional efforts, alternative approaches, or contingency plans. The goal is to minimize the risk’s impact on project delivery.\nScope Management: Delivering the initially agreed-upon scope ensures that the project remains aligned with its original objectives. The team can focus on quality and meeting stakeholder expectations within the revised timeline.\nOption D provides a balanced approach, considering both the risk and the project’s overall goals.","timestamp":"1722268920.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1257575"}],"timestamp":"2024-07-29 18:02:00","answers_community":["A (80%)","D (20%)"]},{"id":"DelKNOXpW9ClFdK7vVUv","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":250,"exam_id":126,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Feature-driven development (FDD)","D":"Kanban","A":"Scrum","B":"SAFe"},"unix_timestamp":1726930800,"question_text":"A project manager was assigned to a project to implement a manufacturing system in a food factory.
