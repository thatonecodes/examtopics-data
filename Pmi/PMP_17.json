Change the work in progress (WIP) limit to reflect the team's capacity.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWork in Progress (WIP) Limits: One of the core principles of Kanban is to limit the amount of work in progress. If cards are not moving on the Kanban board and progress is slow, it might indicate that the team is overloaded or not effectively managing their work. Adjusting the WIP limits can help ensure that the team is focusing on completing tasks before starting new ones, thereby improving flow and efficiency.\n\nReflect Team Capacity: Changing the WIP limits to reflect the actual capacity of the team can help balance the workload, reduce bottlenecks, and improve overall performance. It encourages the team to complete work items and move them to done before taking on new tasks, which can lead to better progress and more consistent delivery."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nWIP will make sure that the team moves items to done","upvote_count":"2","poster":"dinodragon","comment_id":"1233250","timestamp":"1718834280.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1168366","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWill go with B.\nWIP limits encourages \"done.\" items. \nWIP also will make blockers and bottlenecks visible to all for team to come together to resolve","poster":"rshankhwa","timestamp":"1709846280.0"},{"comment_id":"1139105","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706949780.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD --> then B","poster":"Trytrio"},{"comment_id":"1122514","poster":"Abdelmonm","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1705234440.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhen a team is facing challenges in delivering committed work, it's essential for the agile project manager to engage with the team members directly. Meeting with the team allows the project manager to understand any obstacles or issues they may be facing and work collaboratively to address them. This aligns with the agile principle of individuals and interactions over processes and tools.\n\nWhile alternative performance metrics, adjusting WIP limits, and discussions with senior leadership may be relevant in certain situations, directly engaging with the team members provides a more immediate and targeted approach to resolving issues impacting the team's performance.
