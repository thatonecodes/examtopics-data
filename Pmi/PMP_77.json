Assign a qualified team member to be the risk manager for the project.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor a risk with a high probability of occurrence, the project manager must actively manage it by assigning responsibility to someone who can monitor and mitigate the risk. This person, often called a risk owner, ensures that specific actions are taken to address the risk. They also continuously monitor the risk and adjust strategies as needed to minimize its impact.","comment_id":"1327579"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Submit a change request to transfer the risk to a third party in case it becomes an issue.\n transferring the risk to a third party, such as an insurance provider or a contractor, can reduce the impact on the project. This approach can be especially relevant for risks that are likely to happen and could severely affect the project.\n\nD. Ask the team to monitor the risk and provide an alert if it becomes an issue- Monitoring is important, but with a high-probability risk, it’s better to take proactive steps to manage it rather than just wait for it to occur.","poster":"Okstm","timestamp":"1732621500.0","comment_id":"1318040"},{"timestamp":"1728701640.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Determined a budget reserve for this project.\n\nHere’s why this option is the most appropriate:\n\nBudget Reserve: A budget reserve, also known as contingency reserve, is set aside to cover unforeseen costs and risks that may arise during the project execution. By determining a budget reserve upfront, the project manager can account for potential cost overruns or unexpected expenses that may not have been anticipated when baselining the project.\n\nManaging Uncertainty: Projects inherently involve uncertainty, and even if the new project is a replication of a previous project, various factors could lead to cost variations over time (e.g., inflation, changes in resource costs, availability of materials). A budget reserve helps in managing this uncertainty by providing a cushion against cost increases.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"That's a long explanation to justify a wrong answer!
