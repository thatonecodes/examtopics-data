Change control process would be the most effective way for the business analyst to manage scope creep in this situation. A change control process helps to manage changes to the project scope and ensures that all changes are properly reviewed, approved, and implemented. This process would enable the business analyst to ensure that any new requirements or changes to the scope are evaluated for their impact on the project and then approved or rejected in a controlled manner. This would help to prevent scope creep and keep the project on track. A configuration management system and a communication plan may also be useful in managing scope creep, but they would not be as effective as a change control process in this particular situation. Sponsor signoff may also be useful, but it is not a comprehensive solution to managing scope creep."}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","exam_id":128,"question_id":6,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-04-11 07:00:00","unix_timestamp":1681189200,"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"Company A is working on implementing a new platform with multiple stakeholders.
