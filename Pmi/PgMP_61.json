Financial audit\n\nWhen a project within a program is terminated, especially due to affordability issues and trade-offs with other projects, a financial audit is an appropriate activity to perform. This audit will review and assess the financial transactions, commitments, and allocations made for the GHW Project up to its termination point. The goal is to ensure that all financial aspects of the project are properly closed out, that any remaining funds are accounted for and reallocated as necessary, and to evaluate the financial management of the project for any lessons learned that can be applied to ongoing or future projects within the program.","poster":"fido_dido","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706890860.0"},{"comment_id":"1097976","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
