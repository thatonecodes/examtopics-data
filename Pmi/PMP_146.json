Work with the team to decompose the scope into a WBS and work packages in order to create required deliverables and timelines.\nAfter the scope statement and iterative delivery approach have been agreed by all stakeholders, the next step for the project manager is to work with the team to break down the scope into smaller, manageable work packages. This will help to create a clear understanding of what needs to be done, by whom, and when. The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a key tool for achieving this, and the project manager should work with the team to develop a WBS that is appropriate for the project. Once the WBS is in place, the project manager can create a detailed schedule and work assignments for team members, as well as assign requirements to team members as part of the requirements management plan. However, the WBS and work packages are the first steps in creating a project plan and defining the work to be done.","comment_id":"887956"},{"poster":"snagile","comment_id":"886987","timestamp":"1682997420.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI am going with B due to use of \"Work with the team \" , whereas with the rest it says assign"},{"timestamp":"1682142780.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhy A?
