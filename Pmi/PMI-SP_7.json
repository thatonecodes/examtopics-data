Expert judgment is a technique based on a set of criteria that has been acquired in a specific knowledge area or product area. It is obtained when the project manager or project team requires specialized knowledge that they do not possess. Expert judgment involves people most familiar with the work of creating estimates. Preferably, the project team member who will be doing the task should complete the estimates. Expert judgment is applied when performing administrative closure activities, and experts should ensure the project or phase closure is performed to the appropriate standards.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: The consultant may be considered a direct expense because the fees can only be assigned to your project work, but this is not the best choice for the question.\nB: An external requirement is not a valid choice for this question.\nC: A temporary resource is not a valid project management term.","answer":"D","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_id":31},{"id":"jz4Ujs0AeR0fdXX43q4R","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/15326-exam-pmi-sp-topic-1-question-83-discussion/","question_id":32,"choices":{"C":"Execution variance analysis","B":"Assumption","A":"Constraint","D":"Resource leveling heuristic"},"isMC":true,"question_text":"Holly is the project manager for her organization.

If management restricts the project work to 45 per week, as in this example, Holly's schedule will likely increase because the project team can't complete as much work in one given time period. While this may be seen as a constraint, because it limits Holly's options, it's technically called a resource leveling heuristic.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: It is an assumption that's believed to be true, but it hasn't been proven to be true.\nC: Execution variance analysis describes the difference between what was planned and what was executed.
