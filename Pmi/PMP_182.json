Review the adequacy of the project's governance and ensure that an appropriate structure is in place.\n\nWhen a project is being delayed due to contradicting views and decision-making issues involving senior management and external stakeholders, it's essential to review the project's governance structure. The project manager should ensure that the governance structure is appropriate and effectively addresses decision-making processes and conflicts. This may involve revising the governance framework, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and establishing mechanisms for resolving disputes and aligning senior management and external stakeholder interests. A well-defined governance structure can help streamline decision-making and mitigate delays caused by conflicting views."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
