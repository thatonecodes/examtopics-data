C. Speak with the project management office (PMO) and request a 2-week extension of the schedule so the team can have rotational time off.\n\nIn this situation, where the team morale is low due to the schedule, it is important to address their concerns and find ways to boost motivation.

This can help them recharge, reduce stress, and regain motivation for the project. By prioritizing the well-being and work-life balance of the team, the project manager shows empathy and understanding, which can have a positive impact on team morale.","poster":"mdkhassan","timestamp":"1711490520.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1171683","timestamp":"1710247260.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNeed action immediately and not towards completion of project","poster":"rshankhwa"},{"timestamp":"1701440220.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1085273","poster":"Mamoonpk","content":"IT IS SUBJECTIVE"},{"comment_id":"1071269","timestamp":"1700041620.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhy not B?"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1052492","timestamp":"1698121680.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
