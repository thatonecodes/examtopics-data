The project manager should analyze the tasks, provide estimates, include a prototype demo, and send the information to the client directly. This approach aligns with the Agile methodology, which emphasizes direct communication between the customer and the development team.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Agile approach does not typically use a traditional backlog or require the use of reserves. Instead, Agile teams prioritize work based on customer value and focus on delivering high-quality, working software.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it adds standard risk reserves to the estimates, which is not a best practice in Agile. Agile teams typically address risks through ongoing risk management and adaptive planning.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because it implies that the project manager would be working in isolation from the development team.
