Standard has it that you don't delete any risk from the register .\nAlso the best answer is to escalate the risk to the appropriate project it may affect.\nThe risk was identified, assessed, and evaluated at the initial instance\nThere may be reasons why the risk does not apply: maybe the scope has been completed or removed but no matter the reason, the risk is closed and still maintained in the register. You can audit a risk register to determine appropriateness.\n\n D is used when referring to issues and problems. Like when a risk occurs that was not identified or the actual impact of a risk is greater than the assessed impact or the response did not accurately mitigate or avoid the risk\n\nusually where the frequency is very high on the project\n\nIf a single risk that was not identified occurs, we use work around but where many of them are occurring, we carry out investigations","timestamp":"1707001740.0","poster":"yandasatria","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699951620.0","poster":"FAAFMT","comment_id":"897324","content":"You should never remove risk from the register.. but you could ignore it if it does not occur"},{"content":"C is the RIGHT answer","comment_id":"897321","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1699951500.0","poster":"FAAFMT"},{"content":"A is correct.\nRisks that have been managed, avoided, or are no longer relevant can be removed from the risk register.

Quantitative risk analysis is a technique that is used to quantify the likelihood and impact of identified risks, as well as to determine the overall level of exposure for each risk. It involves using statistical and mathematical methods to estimate the likelihood and impact of each risk, as well as to calculate the expected value of each risk. This can be helpful in determining the maximum level of exposure for each risk, as well as in identifying the minimum acceptable level of exposure and impact. By performing a quantitative risk analysis, the project team can better understand the potential risks and uncertainties that are facing the project, and can identify the most effective strategies for managing those risks. This can help to ensure that the project is able to effectively mitigate or reduce the impact of identified risks, while also maximizing value and minimizing risk.","timestamp":"1719089880.0","poster":"IBANGA007","comment_id":"753726","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"id":"YJLEvjxozJb2GdtI6eg8","choices":{"C":"Issue log","D":"Change log","B":"Risk-adjusted back log","A":"Assumption log"},"answer_images":[],"question_id":108,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/140971-exam-pmi-rmp-topic-1-question-284-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"MikeMarlo","timestamp":"1732206180.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nRefer to question 244.\nRisk adjusted backlog, not Change Log","comment_id":"1215021","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"D","exam_id":129,"answer":"B","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1716301380,"timestamp":"2024-05-21 16:23:00","question_text":"While planning for project execution phase stakeholders are making decisions on how to respond to known and new risks.
