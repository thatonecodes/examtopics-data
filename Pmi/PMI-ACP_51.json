This aligns with the Agile principle of \"Working software over comprehensive documentation\" and the Agile practice of \"Continuous feedback and adaptation.\" By demonstrating only the completed stories, the product owner can show tangible progress and gain stakeholder feedback on the work completed. This approach enables the team to prioritize feedback and make any necessary adjustments early in the development process, rather than waiting until the end of the project to assess stakeholder satisfaction. Additionally, demonstrating only completed stories helps the team to focus on delivering high-quality, working software, which is the primary goal of Agile development.","poster":"Smokeyofficiial","comment_id":"844727"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nGoing with A.","comment_id":"789228","timestamp":"1690413180.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"InvisibleBeing"},{"poster":"7029","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1689577560.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is most","comment_id":"778724"},{"timestamp":"1674808020.0","comment_id":"637858","upvote_count":"1","content":"i vote A","poster":"richck102"},{"content":"For me, the answer is B. \nIt mentioned in scrumguide 2017 :Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next\nanticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product.\nhttps://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf","comment_id":"447575","upvote_count":"1","poster":"tpkhoa","timestamp":"1647698040.0"},{"poster":"pandat","timestamp":"1639781160.0","content":"Product Owner can explains what has been done and what have not been done. \nHowever, the Demo should only cover the \"Done\". \nso A.","comment_id":"384444","upvote_count":"4"},{"comments":[{"poster":"srv3","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"253204","content":"Each completed story is demoed as part of a working, tested system—preferably in a staging environment that closely resembles the production environment.\n\nhttps://www.scaledagileframework.com/iteration-review/","timestamp":"1624778580.0"}],"comment_id":"246032","poster":"Sky_Chaser","content":"https://mozaicworks.com/blog/incomplete-stories-in-sprint-reviews/","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1623877560.0"},{"poster":"Orikto","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1618349220.0","comment_id":"199424","content":"in the questions it already mentioned \"a demo of all the stories to the business.? how come again dothe same thing ?
