Suggest the product owner start by focusing on the next 2 sprints instead of 10\n\nExplanation:\nIncremental Planning: Agile methodologies emphasize incremental and iterative planning. Focusing on the next 2 sprints allows the team to adapt to changes and feedback more effectively.\nFlexibility: Detailed schedules and cost estimates for 10 sprints can be rigid and may not accommodate the dynamic nature of agile projects. Shorter planning horizons provide the flexibility to adjust as needed.\nLearning and Improvement: By focusing on shorter time frames, the team can learn from each sprint and improve their estimates and planning processes over time.\nStakeholder Engagement: This approach helps in managing the product owner's expectations and gradually transitioning them from a predictive to an agile mindset.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1725194220.0","comment_id":"1276062","poster":"thewalker"},{"timestamp":"1690067940.0","poster":"Nhuho","comment_id":"959899","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI choose D","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"892097","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD = correct.
