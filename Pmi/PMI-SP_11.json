The staffing management plan is part of human resources plan. It is a subsidiary plan of the overall project management plan and defines when project team members will be brought onto and released from the project. It describes when and how human resource requirements will be met. Depending upon the needs of the project, it can be formal or informal, highly detailed or broadly framed. The staffing management plan may include the following items: Staff acquisition, resource calendars, staff release plan, training needs, recognition and rewards, compliance, and safety.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: The project schedule management will define when resources are needed and scheduled. But it will not define how resources are allowed to be released from the project.\nC: This is not a valid project management plan.\nD: The communications management plan defines project communication requirements and expectations.","timestamp":"2020-09-09 00:03:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"239032","timestamp":"1733733780.0","poster":"Alisonw","content":"This is not in the most recent version","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Repeated question.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"176132","timestamp":"1725832980.0","poster":"Mopar"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":130,"unix_timestamp":1599602580},{"id":"2jz3zoRXW5HjTvmyXmoZ","unix_timestamp":1600436160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/31575-exam-pmi-sp-topic-2-question-30-discussion/","question_id":53,"answer_description":"Of all six processes, the control schedule process will take the majority of the time in the project time management knowledge area.

Three-point estimate is a way to enhance the accuracy of activity duration estimates. This concept is originated with the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). PERT charts the following three estimates: Most likely (TM): The duration of activity based on realistic factors such as resources assigned, interruptions, etc. Optimistic (TO): The activity duration based on the best-case scenario Pessimistic (TP): The activity duration based on the worst-case scenario The expected (TE) activity duration is a weighted average of these three estimates: TE = (TO + 4TM + TP) / 6 Duration estimates based on the above equations (sometimes simple average of the three estimates is also used) provide more accuracy.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: This is not a valid formula.\nB: This is the formula for the three-point estimate.
