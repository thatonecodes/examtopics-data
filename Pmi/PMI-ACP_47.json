High-risk and low-value.\n\nExplanation: The goal in Agile is to deliver the most valuable features as early as possible and to tackle risks while doing so. Thus, features that are high-risk and high-value should not be deferred but tackled head-on. On the contrary, features that are high-risk and low-value don't provide enough value to justify the associated risk, so these should be deferred or even avoided.\n\nLow-risk and high-value features (Option D) are desirable as they give the team valuable output with minimal risk. Low-risk and low-value features (Option C) could be deferred or might be tackled as time and resources allow, but they wouldn't be a first priority.\n\nRemember, the goal is to provide the maximum value with minimal risk, and the team should focus on high-value work first.
