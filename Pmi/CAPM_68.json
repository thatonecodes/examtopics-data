An iterative scheduling and on-demand, pull-based scheduling will be required.\n\nIn an adaptive environment, where requirements and project conditions are likely to change, traditional linear scheduling approaches may not be effective. Instead, an iterative scheduling approach is needed, where work is planned and scheduled in shorter iterations or increments. This allows for flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing requirements and priorities as new knowledge is gained throughout the project.\n\nOn-demand, pull-based scheduling is also important in an adaptive environment. Rather than pre-determining the entire schedule upfront, work is scheduled based on the actual need and demand. As the project progresses, work is pulled into the schedule based on the availability of resources, the evolving priorities, and the feedback received.","comment_id":"919982","poster":"Tadpole1"},{"comment_id":"837425","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CalvinthePM","timestamp":"1678657260.0","content":"Ch. 6 Project Schedule Management Pg. 178.
