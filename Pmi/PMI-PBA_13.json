Interface\nInterface analysis is a technique to describe how different components or systems interact with each other and exchange information. Interface analysis can help to identify the inputs, outputs, and dependencies of each system, and to ensure that they are compatible and consistent with each other. Interface analysis can also help to detect potential integration issues, gaps, and conflicts among the systems. An organization that is in the process of replacing its current system should conduct interface analysis to facilitate a successful migration, as it would help to ensure that all current connections to other systems remain functional after the upgrade.
