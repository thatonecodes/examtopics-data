By discussing mistakes and their causes during the retrospective, the team can collaboratively identify process improvements and prevent similar issues in the future. This approach promotes learning and continuous improvement without placing blame on individuals.\nA. While following processes is important, this option does not address the specific mistake or provide a mechanism for improvement.\nB. Peer reviews are beneficial, but they do not address the root cause of the mistake or promote a culture of continuous improvement.\nD. This approach can create a fear of making mistakes and discourage risk-taking and innovation. It does not foster a learning environment or address the underlying issues.","timestamp":"1725793380.0","comment_id":"1280319"},{"timestamp":"1692794940.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Petrevski","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC = correct","comment_id":"988336"}],"unix_timestamp":1692794940},{"id":"xamVEUu0WOgpbRmmFNNb","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/119043-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-271-discussion/","question_text":"For what is the MoSCoW method used?","question_id":192,"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-08-25 13:42:00","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"Tracking progress","C":"Validating a product","A":"Estimating story size","B":"Prioritizing stories"},"answer":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1724586120.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB = correct","poster":"Petrevski","comment_id":"990007"}],"exam_id":127,"unix_timestamp":1692963720,"question_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"q2HON2dfJp1rxxGvvpXL","answer":"A","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1692963840,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/119044-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-272-discussion/","question_text":"During a retrospective, a team member claims that a specific set of documentation that is continuously updated during iterations is not being used by any stakeholder.

This prevents any potential gaps in knowledge that might arise if the documentation is suddenly stopped. Value Analysis: Initiating an analysis to identify the value of the documentation helps the team understand whether the documentation is necessary and how it can be improved or repurposed to better serve stakeholders. Data-Driven Decision: This approach allows the team to make data-driven decisions based on the findings of the analysis, ensuring that any changes to the documentation process are justified and beneficial.
