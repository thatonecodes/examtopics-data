Risk analysis\n\nIf multiple workstreams are showing issues three months into a program, and the program manager requires that a risk impact assessment be conducted, it is likely that risk analysis will be the most effective approach for calculating the impact of these risks.\n\nRisk analysis is a process that helps to understand the likelihood and impact of identified risks, and to determine the appropriate risk response strategies. It involves evaluating the potential consequences of a risk, as well as the likelihood of that risk occurring. This helps to prioritize risks and focus risk management efforts on the most important risks."}],"question_id":92,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1671749520,"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"B":"Risk analysis","C":"Risk treatment","D":"Risk evaluation","A":"Risk identification"},"timestamp":"2022-12-22 23:52:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Three months into a program, multiple workstreams are showing issues.

Conduct a risk reassessment and reserve analysis.\n\nIf budget overruns during the execution phase have put serious constraints on the remainder of the project's budget, it is important for the project manager to take steps to reassess the project risks and reserve analysis. This will help to identify any potential risks that may arise as a result of the budget constraints and to develop contingency plans to mitigate or manage these risks effectively.\n\nThe project manager may also want to consider requesting a budget relief using the management reserve, which is a set aside of funds that can be used to address unexpected events or risks that may arise during the course of the project. By conducting a risk reassessment and reserve analysis, the project manager can ensure that the project is well positioned to handle any potential risks and to meet the project's objectives within the available budget."}],"answer":"C","question_text":"Stakeholder deliverable reviews will start soon and additional work is expected to resolve any issues or required adjustments.
