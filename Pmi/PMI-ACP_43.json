Teams that struggle with technical decisions often lack the skills and processes for effective collaboration. Training in group decision-making techniques (like consensus-building, voting, or structured problem-solving) and conflict resolution can empower the team to make better decisions together.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less ideal:\nOption B: While the product owner has a key role, giving them sole decision-making authority can stifle creativity and ownership within the team. It's important to involve the team in the decision-making process.\nOption C: Assigning decision owners can lead to silos and a lack of shared understanding. It's better to have a collaborative approach where everyone feels responsible for the outcome.\nOption D: Servant leadership is valuable, but relying on one individual to facilitate all decisions can create a bottleneck and limit the team's overall growth."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA = correct","poster":"Petrevski","comment_id":"993066","timestamp":"1693312020.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/119286-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-289-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","question_text":"During team meetings, the team often struggles with making decisions about their technical approach.
