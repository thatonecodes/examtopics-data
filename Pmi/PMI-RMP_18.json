When a risk event occurs that was not previously identified, it is important for the project manager to review the project's risk management plan and identify any potential gaps or weaknesses in the risk identification process. One way to do this is to perform a new assumptions and constraints analysis to identify any potential risks that may have been overlooked or underestimated. This can involve reviewing the project's assumptions, constraints, and dependencies, as well as examining any changes that may have occurred since the initial risk assessment was conducted. By performing a new assumptions and constraints analysis, the project manager can identify any new or emerging risks that may impact the project, and can develop appropriate response strategies to mitigate or reduce the impact of those risks. This can help to ensure that the project is able to effectively manage risks throughout the project lifecycle and avoid similar risks in the future.","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A project manager was informed that the testing of the latest component in the project’s software update release was not successful.

Risk exposure refers to the potential impact or cost of a risk on a project, and is typically calculated by multiplying the probability of the risk occurring by the potential impact or cost if it does occur.\n\nIn this situation, the IT project is 40% complete, and two risks (A and B) have been identified.

After implementing the planned risk response for risk B, the probability of risk B has been reduced to 0.3. To calculate the current risk exposure for the project, the risk manager would need to multiply the probability of each risk occurring by the potential impact or cost if it does occur. For risk A, this would be 0.6 * $50,000 = $30,000, and for risk B it would be 0.3 * $60,000 = $18,000. The total risk exposure for the project would then be $30,000 + $18,000 = $48,000.

The purpose is to minimize threats, optimize opportunities, support the organization in achieving its objectives and support stakeholders to take informed decisions. For these purposes, budget is allocated to risk management. In case stakeholders are unable to see the added value Risk Management is brining to the organization, then one of the cause can probably be poor communications.","comment_id":"1076181","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732183680.0"},{"poster":"AhmedRashad","comment_id":"1045070","content":"C is the correct answer","timestamp":"1729089840.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1727020440.0","poster":"Lunk","comment_id":"1014301","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is most correct.
