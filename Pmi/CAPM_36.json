Keeps the focus on the position of the stakeholder or group with respect to the project team\n\nThe hierarchical focus of stakeholder communications serves to keep the focus on the position of the stakeholder or group with respect to the project team. In other words, it helps in understanding the level of influence, interest, and importance that various stakeholders or stakeholder groups have in relation to the project. By categorizing stakeholders hierarchically, project managers can tailor their communication strategies and efforts based on the specific needs, expectations, and concerns of different stakeholder levels. This approach helps in managing stakeholder relationships effectively and ensuring that communication efforts are targeted appropriately.","comment_id":"1098538","poster":"041ba31","timestamp":"1718572140.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPMBOK pg 361","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1704476340.0","comment_id":"943897"},{"comment_id":"927428","content":"Selected Answer: D\nRight answer is D","upvote_count":"2","poster":"PM01950","timestamp":"1702993740.0"},{"timestamp":"1698871320.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"D Pls Refer PG 361","poster":"sapku","comment_id":"886616"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1693953180.0","poster":"Hungdv","content":"A is answer","comment_id":"830458"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"748840","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD as per pag 361","timestamp":"1687084560.0","poster":"anfacer"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"722544","content":"it should be D","timestamp":"1684572240.0","poster":"AZIZ196"}],"timestamp":"2022-11-20 11:44:00","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1668941040,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/88040-exam-capm-topic-1-question-261-discussion/"},{"id":"u1Shd3MeSLZbiuYgZvxv","exam_id":126,"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/128763-exam-capm-topic-1-question-262-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":179,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-12-17 00:08:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1702768080,"question_text":"A project team of telecommuters located in three different time zones regularly misses project deadlines.

Feedback/response communication\n\nIn the scenario described, the daily meetings seem to be lacking effective feedback or response communication. Effective communication in a team involves not only the transmission of information (which can be considered as push communication) but also the exchange of feedback, questions, and responses (which can be considered as pull communication). It's important for team members to have the opportunity to ask questions, seek clarifications, provide feedback, and engage in a two-way dialogue during meetings to ensure that everyone is on the same page and to address any issues or concerns. In this case, it appears that the meetings are mostly one-sided, with limited feedback or interactive communication. Adding this step can improve the effectiveness of the meetings and address the communication issues within the remote team."}]},{"id":"MlwwW8WwFJg8mdO1Ph4X","answer_ET":"C","answers_community":[],"choices":{"D":"It communicates product or service failures discovered by the project team","C":"It accounts for costs used to avoid poor quality in the product or service","A":"It details product or service failures experienced by the customer","B":"It clarifies the costs associated with assessing the quality of the product or service"},"discussion":[{"content":"C.
