Contingency reserves are estimated costs to be used at the discretion of the project manager to deal with anticipated, but not certain, events. These events are \"known unknowns\" and are part of the project scope and cost baselines. The contingency reserve is calculated by multiplying the probability and the impact for the risk event value for each risk event. The sum of the risk events equals the contingency reserve for the project. The sum of the risk events equals the contingency reserve for the project. In this question, the value is $41,700. If Risk D happens, it'll cost the project $35,000. The difference of $35,000 and $41,700 is $6,700.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: This is the impact of Risk Event\nB: $41,700 is the amount of the contingency reserve.\nD: $14,000 is the risk event value of Risk Event","question_id":57,"answer_images":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02362/0011200001.png"],"isMC":true,"topic":"2","discussion":[{"poster":"Alisonw","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"239814","timestamp":"1733812740.0","content":"risk events have a % chance to happen but if they do they still cost the full amount if the impact."},{"timestamp":"1726668360.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mopar","content":"0.6 12000 7200 \n0.15 45000 6750 \n0.35 15000 5250 \n0.4 35000 14000 \n0.5 17000 8500 \n 0 \n 41700 =27700","comment_id":"181707"},{"content":"If risk (D) does happen it will cost 0.4*35,000 = 14,000.\nWhat left is 41,700 - 14,000 = 27,700","timestamp":"1715291100.0","poster":"jalaljaafarsalman","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"86249"}],"exam_id":130,"timestamp":"2020-05-09 23:45:00","unix_timestamp":1589060700,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/20113-exam-pmi-sp-topic-2-question-45-discussion/","question_text":"Donna is the project manager of the QSD Project and she believes Risk Event D in the following figure is likely to happen.\n//IMG//\n\nIf this event does happen, how much will Donna have left in the risk contingency reserve if none of the other risk events have happened?"},{"id":"djHPBnMUNT0uXJaezAIw","unix_timestamp":1600448220,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"181822","upvote_count":"2","content":"These aren't correct inputs from the 6th edition.","timestamp":"1726678620.0","poster":"Mopar"}],"topic":"2","answer_description":"Performance report is an input of monitor and control project work.
