Analogous\nExplanation:\nAnalogous estimating relies on historical data from similar projects to estimate the cost of a new project.\nBy comparing the current project to past projects, the project manager can develop a cost estimate based on those previous figures.\nLet's briefly review the other options:\n\nBottom-up estimating involves breaking down a project into its smallest components and estimating the cost of each, then summing them up for a total project cost.\nThree-point estimating involves creating an optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimate for each project activity.\nParametric estimating uses statistical models based on historical data and project parameters to estimate costs. While it uses historical data, it differs from analogous estimating as it involves statistical modeling and parameters.\nSince the prompt explicitly mentions using historical data from a previous project, analogous estimating is the most fitting choice.","comment_id":"1257881","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Vangelis_1980","timestamp":"1722316440.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Andrew_1980","comment_id":"1243855","timestamp":"1720356840.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNothing is said about the similarity of the project completed.
