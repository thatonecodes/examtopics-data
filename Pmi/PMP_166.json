Lessons learned are before project starts, so this should have been done.\n2. Make a detailed analysis on vendor issues during the project- why for one issue we should do this.

If only after vendor provide the input we can continue, then there is no contingency.\nConsidering we might be relaying on this vendor this twisted questions points to A.
