Review the existing service contracts to find an option to help procure the vehicles.\n\nIn this situation, the project manager should review the existing service contracts to see if there are any provisions or clauses that could help address the issue with the vehicle supplier. This may involve checking if the contract with the construction services provider has any flexibility or options for additional services, including vehicle procurement. By doing so, the project manager can explore existing contractual arrangements to find a solution that minimizes project delays and additional costs. It's essential to engage legal and contract management experts if needed to navigate the contractual terms effectively. If no contractual provisions are found, then the project manager should consider engaging the change control board (CCB) to assess and approve any necessary changes to the project's scope, schedule, or budget related to this issue.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1048770"},{"timestamp":"1722560340.0","poster":"sshe0882","upvote_count":"1","content":"C is correct as contract can include some additional information/options for such a case.
