Estimate at Completion (EAC).\n\nThe Estimate at Completion provides the projected total cost of the program at its completion. It takes into account the actual costs incurred to date and an updated estimate of the costs required to complete the remaining work. This figure is especially relevant in this context as it directly addresses the customer's concern about the overall cost of the system, providing them with a comprehensive view of the expected total expenditure by the end of the program.

Estimate at Completion\n\nGiven the customer's concern about the new system's cost and their lack of interest in intermediate details, the Estimate at Completion (EAC) would be the most relevant metric for them to review. EAC provides an estimated total cost of the program at its completion, based on performance to date. This metric will give the customer a clear picture of what the final cost is expected to be, which is particularly important in light of their concerns about the program's financial health.

Escalate the issue to the stakeholder's supervisor.\n\nEscalation to the stakeholder's supervisor is a direct and appropriate approach to address the lack of response. It allows for involvement from a higher authority who may have more influence over the stakeholder, potentially leading to a resolution. Given the stakeholder's significant influence and the potential impact on the program, it's important to address this issue promptly and effectively at the appropriate level of authority within the stakeholder's organization.

Next, meet with the program sponsor to revise the program budget, implementation plan, and risk management plan for governance board approval.\n\nThis approach is comprehensive and proactive. It involves updating all relevant documentation and plans to reflect the current state of the project, including the increased risks due to the delay. By then meeting with the program sponsor and seeking governance board approval for the revised plans and budget, the program manager ensures that all changes are communicated effectively to key stakeholders and that the program aligns with the new reality.
