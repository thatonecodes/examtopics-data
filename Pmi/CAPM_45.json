Add the two milestones to the project plan, as they are mandatory.\nDetailed Explanation:\nMandatory Milestones: The contract specifies that the house must be built in one year and the foundation must be completed in 30 days. These are mandatory milestones that must be adhered to.\nProject Plan Integration: By adding these milestones to the project plan, the project manager ensures that these critical deadlines are tracked and managed effectively.\nAlignment with Contractual Obligations: Including these milestones in the project plan aligns the project activities with the contractual obligations, ensuring compliance and reducing the risk of contractual breaches.\nMonitoring and Control: Adding these milestones allows for better monitoring and control of the project schedule, enabling timely interventions if there are any deviations.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"easicertif","timestamp":"1725724500.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe project manager should calculate the duration of the two milestones stated in the contract.

Schedule the tasks in parallel\nExplanation:\nTo ensure on-time delivery for a small project with time constraints, scheduling tasks in parallel is the most effective approach. This means performing multiple tasks simultaneously, whenever possible, to reduce overall project duration.\n\nIncreasing quality review cycles might improve quality but would likely extend the project timeline.\nScheduling tasks in sequence means doing one task at a time, which is generally less efficient for time-constrained projects.\nExpanding the project scope would almost certainly increase the project duration, contradicting the goal of on-time delivery.\nBy maximizing parallel work, the project manager can optimize the use of available resources and accelerate project completion."}],"isMC":true,"question_id":223,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/144740-exam-capm-topic-1-question-315-discussion/"},{"id":"L7XIkptqnePHvofv9gFk","choices":{"D":"Complete these user stories in the current sprint and extend the sprint length.","C":"Move these user stories back to the product backlog for reprioritization.","B":"Remove these user stories as they are not important.","A":"Advance these user stories to the top of the next sprint backlog."},"question_images":[],"exam_id":126,"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1722326760,"timestamp":"2024-07-30 10:06:00","topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1338782","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn Scrum, incomplete user stories from a sprint are returned to the product backlog.
