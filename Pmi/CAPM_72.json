Regular interactions with the \nstakeholder community throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support adjustments earlier in the project \ncycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of success for the project.\nIn order to accelerate the sharing of information within and across the organization, agile methods promote aggressive \ntransparency.
