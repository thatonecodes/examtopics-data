Review the agreed-upon risk tolerance\n\nIf different stakeholders have different views on the acceptable level of risk related to rain and construction, it is important for the risk manager to review the agreed-upon risk tolerance for the project. The risk tolerance is the level of risk that the project team is willing to accept in order to achieve the project's objectives.\n\nTo determine the correct limit for construction in the event of rain, the risk manager should review the agreed-upon risk tolerance and consider the potential impacts of different levels of risk on the project. This may involve performing a sensitivity analysis of the risk to understand how different levels of risk will affect the project schedule, budget, and other project objectives. By reviewing the agreed-upon risk tolerance and performing a sensitivity analysis, the risk manager can help to ensure that the project team is making informed and strategic decisions about risk management.","timestamp":"1719089160.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":129,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/92500-exam-pmi-rmp-topic-1-question-253-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-12-22 23:46:00","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"A risk manager manages risks in a construction project.

Assumption analysis is something that you do at the beginning of the project or when the assumptions change constantly.

Review the assumptions analysis\n\nWhen the project sponsor asks the project manager about the accuracy of the project data, the project manager should review the assumptions analysis to ensure that the project data is accurate and up-to-date. The assumptions analysis is a tool that helps to identify and document the assumptions that are being made about the project, including assumptions related to risks.\n\nIf the project manager realizes that some risks have not been updated recently, it is important to review the assumptions analysis to ensure that the project data is accurate and up-to-date. This may involve revisiting the risk register to check for new risks, conducting a checklist analysis on each risk, or creating a risk response plan for those risks. By reviewing the assumptions analysis, the project manager can help to ensure that the project data is accurate and that risks are being managed effectively.","timestamp":"1687467000.0","poster":"IBANGA007","comment_id":"753718","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":129,"timestamp":"2022-12-22 23:50:00","question_id":98,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Review the risk register to check for the new risks","B":"Create a risk response plan for those risks","D":"Conduct a checklist analysis on each risk","A":"Review the assumptions analysis"},"question_text":"The project sponsor asks the project manager about the accuracy of the project data.

It's determined through Monte Carlo analysis, which is a statistical technique used to analyze the impact of risk and uncertainty in project schedules. The P90 date indicates a level of confidence in project completion, with only a 10% chance of it being delayed beyond that date.\n\nRisk mitigation to make it P99!","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"IBANGA007","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Hire more resources and crash the schedule\n\nThe P90 date, which is the date that has a 90% probability of being achieved based on the Monte Carlo analysis, is an important target for the project. To ensure that this date is met, the project manager may need to take steps to accelerate the project schedule, such as hiring additional resources or \"crashing\" the schedule. Crashing the schedule involves identifying ways to reduce the duration of certain project activities or tasks in order to meet the P90 date.\n\nIn addition to crashing the schedule, the project manager may also want to consider other risk management strategies to help ensure that the P90 date is met. This could include mitigating risks identified on the sensitivity analysis, updating the assumptions/exclusions register, or performing a qualitative risk analysis for the project. By taking a proactive and systematic approach to risk management, the project manager can help to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.","comment_id":"753711","timestamp":"1687466700.0"}],"answers_community":["D (67%)","C (33%)"],"answer":"D","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Mitigate risks identified on the sensitivity analysis","B":"Update the assumptions/exclusions register","A":"Perform a qualitative risk analysis for the project","D":"Hire more resources and crash the schedule"},"timestamp":"2022-12-22 23:45:00","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"id":129,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Pmi","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":174,"name":"PMI-RMP"},"currentPage":20},"__N_SSP":true}
