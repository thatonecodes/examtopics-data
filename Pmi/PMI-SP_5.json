If Activity B takes a total of eight days, it will consume three days of float. However, the total duration of the path ABEHJ may not exceed 26 days, as this is the total duration for the project. Although Activity H has a total of four days of float available, the consumption of three days of float on this path will reduce the total float for Activity H to just one day. If Activity H is delayed by more than one day, then the project will be late.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA, C: These are not the valid answers, as there is just one day of float available for Activity H.\nD: There is one day of float still available for Activity H.","topic":"1","question_text":"Examine the figure given below:\n//IMG//\n\nIf Activity B takes eight days to complete instead of five days as schedule, how long can you now delay Activity H?"},{"id":"XjFT8AlONHQQAyKWsoqK","question_images":[],"exam_id":130,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/72866-exam-pmi-sp-topic-1-question-60-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-03-17 01:15:00","choices":{"B":"Fast tracking","D":"Using the critical chain method","A":"Adding leads to the project work","C":"Crashing"},"answers_community":[],"answer_description":"Crashing adds labor to the project.

Two Factor Theory states that there are certain factors in the workplace that cause job satisfaction, while a separate set of factors cause dissatisfaction. Two Factor Theory distinguishes between the following: Motivators (e.g. challenging work, recognition, responsibility) which give positive satisfaction, arising from intrinsic conditions of the job itself, such as recognition, achievement, or personal growth. Hygiene factors (e.g. status, job security, salary and fringe benefits) which do not give positive satisfaction, although dissatisfaction results from their absence. These are extrinsic to the work itself, and include aspects, such as company policies, supervisory practices, or wages/salary. Essentially, hygiene factors are needed to ensure an employee is not dissatisfied. Motivation factors are needed in order to motivate an employee to higher performance, Herzberg also further classified our actions and how and why we do them, for example, if you perform a work-related action because you have to, then that is classed as movement, but if you perform a work-related action because you want to, then that is classed as motivation.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: It describes the five layer of needs we all have.\nC: McGregor's X and Y theory describes the team members and their behavior on the project and how management responds.\nD: It explains the processes that an individual undergoes to make choices.","answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","exam_id":130,"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Maslow's Hierarchy theory","D":"Expectancy theory","C":"McGregor's theory","A":"Herzberg's theory"},"question_text":"Which organizational theory explains the factors that promote performance of people in any organization?","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2020-09-09 23:08:00","discussion":[{"content":"This is a repeated question.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"176736","timestamp":"1725916080.0","poster":"Mopar"}]},{"id":"MGpTd9JK0qXF7TVvCcW6","answer_images":[],"exam_id":130,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe “Develop Schedule” process involves analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule constraints to create the project schedule model.","timestamp":"1724061420.0","poster":"AvidehParisa","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1268565"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/145998-exam-pmi-sp-topic-1-question-69-discussion/","answer_description":"In severe cases, new schedule duration estimates with new forecasted start and finish dates are needed.

Control schedule process is a method of monitoring the status of the project to update project progress and deal with the changes to the schedule baseline.
