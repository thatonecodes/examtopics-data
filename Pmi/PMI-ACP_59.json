I found this source. \nMany in the agile community have proposed variations on the term MMF, which in many cases alter the intended meaning of the concept. Examples include Minimum Marketable Product and Minimum Releasable Feature.\n\nMMF is erroneously equated to MVP. MMF is about delivering value to customers, whereas MVP is about learning more about the ultimate product. An MVP could range anywhere from not having any MMFs, to having a single MMF, to having several MMFs. They are not the same concepts, but both reinforce the idea that we should seek the minimum functionality in order to accomplish a specific outcome.\nhttps://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mmf/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'mmf))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Petrevski","comment_id":"866195","timestamp":"1728556860.0","content":"https://premieragile.com/mmp-vs-mvp-vs-mmf/#:~:text=The%20Minimum%20Marketable%20Product%20is,the%20needs%20of%20the%20customer."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Minimum Viable Product (MVP) helps product teams validate their ideas so it is very basic in terms of functionality and UX.\n\nThe Minimum Marketable Product (MMP) is ready to be sold, so it is better developed and offers a better overall user experience\n\nThe MMF is a part of MMP where the self-sustained and small features are identified and integrated into the product.

These features are designed to be delivered to the customer as soon as possible, providing value and feedback throughout the development process.\n\nWhen faced with a complex project that requires a large initial investment, using the Agile approach of delivering many small MMFs can help to encourage stakeholders to authorize the investment. By breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable pieces, the risk of failure is reduced, and stakeholders can see progress being made throughout the development process.
