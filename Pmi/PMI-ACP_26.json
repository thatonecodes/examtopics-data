The team should reevaluate time and cost estimates to reflect the latest understanding of the work effort. Here's why:\n\nAddressing Inaccurate Estimates: The team member's observation points to a potential issue with the initial estimates. Re-evaluating them is crucial to ensure future estimates are more accurate and realistic.\nLearning from Experience: Agile methodologies encourage continuous improvement. By analyzing why estimates were off, the team can identify areas for improvement in their estimation process.\nImproving Velocity: Accurate estimates are essential for maintaining a consistent velocity and delivering value predictably.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1725369720.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1277614","content":"Why the other options are less ideal:\n\nA. The product owner should reduce the scope of the project so that the items delivering the highest business value can be completed: While reducing scope might be necessary in some cases, it's not the primary solution. The focus should be on improving the estimation process to ensure accurate planning.\nB. The team should perform a spike to conduct research on their technical solutions and prove their viability: Spikes are useful for exploring technical unknowns, but they don't directly address the issue of inaccurate estimates.\nC. The team should consolidate small stories into larger ones so that there are less work items to be estimated: Consolidating stories might make estimation easier, but it can also make it harder to track progress and adapt to changes.","poster":"thewalker"}]},{"timestamp":"1692354960.0","poster":"Petrevski","comment_id":"984384","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD = correct","upvote_count":"2"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/118415-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-211-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"question_id":126,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1692354960,"exam_id":127,"timestamp":"2023-08-18 12:36:00","question_images":[],"answer":"D","question_text":"Halfway through the execution of an agile project, a retrospective meeting is held.

A stakeholder who can prevent the project from achieving these goals poses the most significant risk to the project's success.\nCritical Influence: This stakeholder likely has a high level of influence and can impact key decisions, resources, or approvals necessary for the project's progress.\nAlignment with Objectives: Ensuring that this stakeholder's needs and expectations are met is crucial for maintaining alignment with the project's objectives and overall success.\nRisk Mitigation: By prioritizing this stakeholder, the project manager can proactively address potential risks and obstacles that could derail the project.\nStakeholder Management: Effective management of this stakeholder can lead to smoother project execution, as their support or lack thereof can significantly influence other stakeholders and project outcomes."},{"poster":"PuranDom","timestamp":"1723866540.0","comment_id":"1267422","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI also think B is best.\nBecause achieving product goal is the way to have values throughout product development.\nInstead of option B, budget (Option A), delaying schedule (Option C) and supporting stakeholder (Option D) are lower priority.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"984391","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB = correct (logically, the stakeholder who is accountable for achieving the project goals is the most important stakeholder)","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Petrevski","timestamp":"1692355500.0"}],"question_id":127,"answer_description":"","question_text":"When considering impact on a project, to whom should an agile project manager give top priority on the stakeholder list?","exam_id":127,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"7bpKa1JGKvn1gKEOJmmH","timestamp":"2023-08-18 12:47:00","exam_id":127,"choices":{"A":"A formalized agile approach offers controlled flexibility in dealing with unknown variables in a manner that adds business value.","B":"Agile is focused only on digital transformation project management, whereas a predictive approach focuses on traditional \"brick and mortar\" projects.","D":"Agile is relativity new; therefore, it is inherently more aligned with data-analytic-based efforts.","C":"The agile formal change management system is better able to deal with unknown variables."},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725417660.0","comment_id":"1277922","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A. A formalized agile approach offers controlled flexibility in dealing with unknown variables in a manner that adds business value.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nControlled Flexibility: Agile methodologies are designed to be adaptive and iterative, allowing teams to respond to changes and unknown variables effectively. This flexibility is crucial in environments driven by data analytics where new insights can emerge frequently.\nBusiness Value: Agile focuses on delivering incremental value through continuous feedback and improvement, ensuring that the project remains aligned with business goals and can adapt to new data and insights.","poster":"thewalker","comments":[{"comment_id":"1277923","poster":"thewalker","timestamp":"1725417720.0","content":"Options B, C, and D contain inaccuracies:\n\nB: Agile is not limited to digital transformation projects; it can be applied to a wide range of project types, including traditional ones.\nC: While agile does have change management practices, the key advantage is its flexibility rather than a formal change management system.\nD: Agile’s alignment with data-analytic-based efforts is due to its iterative nature and adaptability, not merely because it is relatively new.","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"comment_id":"1267423","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723867140.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nB.
