By completing each iteration and getting feedback, the project team can identify issues and address them before moving onto the next iteration. This process can help to reduce the number of change requests that arise later in the project.\n\nBy initiating more iterations, the project team can catch potential issues earlier in the project and make necessary adjustments.
