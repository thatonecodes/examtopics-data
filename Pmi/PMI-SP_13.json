It comprises the following processes:\n✑ Develop Project Charter\n✑ Develop Preliminary Project Scope Statement\n✑ Develop Project Management Plan\n✑ Direct and Manage Project Execution\n✑ Monitor and Control Project Work\n✑ Integrated Change Control\n✑ Close Project\nThese processes occur throughout the project and are repeated quite often during the working of the project. They ensure that the various elements of the project are properly coordinated. What are the Project Management Knowledge Areas? The Project Management Knowledge Areas are groupings that bring together processes that have things in common. For example, Resource Planning, Cost Estimating, Cost Budgeting, etc., are part of the Project Cost Management knowledge group. These processes may or may not be part of different or same process groups. Guide to the PMBOK identifies forty- two processes that are arranged in nine knowledge areas. The knowledge areas are as follows:\n✑ Project Integration Management\n✑ Project Scope Management\n✑ Project Time Management\n✑ Project Cost Management\n✑ Project Quality Management\n✑ Project Human Resource Management\n✑ Project Communications Management\n✑ Project Risk Management\n✑ Project Procurement Management\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: Quality Assurance is a part of the Project Quality Management knowledge area.","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731276420.0","poster":"jalaljaafarsalman","comment_id":"86730","content":"and \n✑ Stakeholder Management","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/20237-exam-pmi-sp-topic-2-question-65-discussion/","answer":"BCD","timestamp":"2020-05-10 22:07:00"},{"id":"9yuEWKlONvF8H1dthvGf","answer_description":"Management reserve is an allotment of time added to the end of the project schedule.

What is resource leveling heuristics? Resource leveling heuristics is a prioritization method that allocates inadequate resources to critical path activities first. It is a schedule network analysis technique useful to a schedule that has already been analyzed by the critical path method. It is used when shared or critical essential resources are only available at certain times, in limited quantities, or to keep resource usage at a constant level. It is a technique that resolves resource conflicts by delaying tasks within their slack allowances. Resource leveling is the process in which project teams come across problems when developing their project schedules. If a company has multiple projects running simultaneously that require the same resources, then problems can arise. It can often cause the critical path method to change.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: The 45-hour limit is a restriction on the project.\nC: The project will not take less time to complete because the project team members won't be able to complete as much work in the same amount of time.\nD: The project may require more resources if the project manager and management want the project to finish by a particular date.
