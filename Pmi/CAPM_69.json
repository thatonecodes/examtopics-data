Predictive Life cycle. \n\nSee when you are expecting something to happen, it means you are predicting and anticipating a change. Secondly, the statement says that the software has been implemented at multiple branches domestically. So, there is no much changes in software as such. However, a foreign land has its own laws, which have to be complied by the participating businesses. For which we might have to do some changes. Now, what changes you have to make, will depend on rules, regulations, policies & laws of the foreign land. So, if you read those set of rules, you can predict what changes can creep in.

Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. This strategy \nmay be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective \nto address a threat in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active \nacceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to \nhandle the threat if it occurs.
