Having focal points for key subjects aids in directing communications to address uncertainties effectively. Additionally, promoting formal and transparent communication helps in managing expectations and ensuring stakeholders are informed.\n\nWhile options like involving stakeholders in project meetings (A), inviting customers to certain meetings (B), or using social networking for engagement (C) have their merits, in an environment with uncertain requirements, having a structured change control process and transparent formal communication channels is crucial to manage changes and keep stakeholders informed of developments and adjustments in the project.","timestamp":"1733565480.0","comment_id":"1090125","poster":"Pradnyasachin"},{"timestamp":"1720704540.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"948982","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPer the PMBOK in an agile/ adaptive environment one should co-locate team members as much as possible and have frequent checkpoints","poster":"Rocket20"},{"timestamp":"1720103880.0","comment_id":"942877","content":"For those of you who think that this seems too old school, I don't necessarily disagree, but this is good for types of consulting firms in large cities with agile methodologies and developers that can sit together and code together get real-time business analyst feedback etc. I have been a project coordinator on this exact type of project for my firm a few years back.\n\nThe key here is that in agile/adaptive environments, an emerging trend is to involve stakeholders in frequent checkpoints (we did progress meetings with our higher ups every two weeks at the end of every sprint before we got their sign off on the sprint deliverables, our product owner (project sponsor for agile) was in contact with higher ups frequently and he himself was in our daily scrums), etc.\n\nA. makes sense.
