This approach is more detailed and accurate compared to analogous estimating, especially when there might be missing details in the estimates. By breaking down the project into smaller components and estimating each one separately, a more accurate and reliable cost estimate can be obtained. This method is particularly useful when there is uncertainty or complexity in the project. Utilizing three-point estimates and including lessons learned from past projects can also contribute to better estimating accuracy.","poster":"Abdelmonm","timestamp":"1704432960.0","comment_id":"1114287"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Hanbyul","timestamp":"1701401280.0","comment_id":"1084911","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
