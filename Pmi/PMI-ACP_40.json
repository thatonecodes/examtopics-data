The primary goal is to get something in the hands of users quickly to validate the idea and gather feedback.\nValue Proposition: The prioritization factor should directly relate to the value proposition of the MMF.

Risk: While risk is a factor in any development, it's less critical for an MMF. The goal is to release something small and quickly, so the risk is inherently lower.\nC.
