Hold a kick-off meeting to assign roles.\n\nReason: While assigning roles is important, it does not ensure alignment with external stakeholders on the project's goals and vision.\nC. Ask the product owner for a detailed product-specification document.\n\nReason: Detailed specifications can be useful, but they may not provide the high-level alignment and shared understanding that a vision statement offers. Agile methodologies also emphasize flexibility over rigid specifications.\nD. Work with the scrum master to ensure that agile principles are followed.\n\nReason: Ensuring adherence to agile principles is important for the team's process, but it does not directly address alignment with external stakeholders on the project's vision and goals.","poster":"thewalker","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1725595980.0"},{"poster":"PuranDom","content":"simply B","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1267858","timestamp":"1723935000.0"},{"comment_id":"988200","timestamp":"1692787620.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB =correct","poster":"Petrevski","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":171,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"When working on a new product, what should an agile team do to ensure alignment with external stakeholders?","question_images":[]},{"id":"JZYliOf9EjxbSlgiqx03","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","exam_id":127,"answer":"B","question_id":172,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"question_text":"On an agile project, it is important to identify and engage business stakeholders throughout the project and to ensure the team understands the stakeholders' business needs.
