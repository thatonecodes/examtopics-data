In this case, requiring at least four licensed electricians is an explicit condition vendors must meet to be considered.\nThese criteria are used during the procurement process to evaluate proposals and ensure that vendors meet the minimum requirements for the work.\nWhy not the other options?\nA. Screening system: A screening system may include evaluation criteria, but it is a broader process for filtering vendors based on various factors.\nB.
