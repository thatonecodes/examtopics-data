Official\n\nWhen creating reports for government bodies, project managers should use official communication. Official communication is typically more formal, follows specific protocols, and adheres to the established standards and regulations of the government. It is important to convey information accurately, clearly, and in a manner that aligns with the official requirements and expectations of the government body.\n\nWhile formal communication is a general characteristic of official communication, the term \"official\" specifically emphasizes the authoritative and sanctioned nature of the communication when dealing with government entities.","poster":"shubu2276","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Cam77","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's D, Official.","timestamp":"1686766200.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"923473"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"903643","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFrom Bing.\nFor creating reports for government bodies, it seems that a formal type of communication would be appropriate.","timestamp":"1684720740.0","poster":"ChymKuBoy"},{"timestamp":"1682707320.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"883827","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct. among the options, Formal communication is the only type of communication that includes official communication. official communication is NOT a communication type itself.","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"comment_id":"890135","timestamp":"1683301320.0","content":"According to PMBOK 6th (pg 361), formal communication is a *dimension*, not a type.","poster":"DSOO","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"comment_id":"864839","timestamp":"1680970380.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"k_I_N_G","content":"official is right"},{"timestamp":"1680007320.0","content":"Pg 361 PMBOK 6th\n Official.
