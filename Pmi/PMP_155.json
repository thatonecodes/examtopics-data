Comparing story points between teams (e.g., 100 vs. 125) is invalid because each team defines points differently.\n\nPerformance in Agile is measured by a team’s ability to deliver working increments consistently.

Story points are a relative measure of effort, and different teams may assign story points differently based on their estimation practices. Comparing raw story point totals across teams is not a reliable measure of performance. A is incorrect: ewer story points do not necessarily indicate better performance; they may represent a difference in estimation style, team velocity, or story complexity. B is incorrect: More story points do not mean better performance. Story points are subjective and team-specific. A higher total could reflect overestimation rather than efficiency or effectiveness.
