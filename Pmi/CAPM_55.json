System thinking\n\n- Active listening is important for understanding user feedback and gathering requirements, but it does not directly facilitate the communication of these needs to the technical team. It is more about receiving information than articulating it.\n- User acceptance testing relates to verifying that the system meets user requirements before going live. While important, it is not directly relevant to explaining the need for reducing clicks in data entry during the requirements workshop.\n+ System thinking involves understanding the application as part of a larger system and recognizing how different components interact. By applying system thinking, the practitioner can illustrate how the current workflow of requiring multiple clicks affects efficiency, user productivity, and overall application performance.
