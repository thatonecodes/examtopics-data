Cumulative probability distribution representing probability of achieving a particular outcome\n\nAn S-curve from a Monte Carlo analysis typically shows a cumulative probability distribution representing the probability of achieving a particular outcome. Monte Carlo analysis is a probabilistic modeling technique that uses random sampling to simulate the uncertainty and variability in a project's various parameters, such as cost or schedule. The resulting S-curve provides a visual representation of the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of achieving different levels of performance or completion within a given project. It helps project managers assess and manage project risks and uncertainties by understanding the probability distribution of project outcomes.","timestamp":"1702769640.0"},{"poster":"MoonManBlue","content":"A-Cumulative probability-11.4.2.5","comment_id":"187100","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1601045940.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":"Individual project risks or uncertainties that have the most potential impact on outcome","A":"Cumulative probability distribution representing probability of achieving a particular outcome","D":"Diagram for all project uncertainties and their influence over a period of time","C":"Best alternative out of the possible solutions, incorporating associated risks and opportunities"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1601045940,"answer":"A","isMC":true,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32743-exam-capm-topic-1-question-237-discussion/","question_id":151,"exam_id":126,"timestamp":"2020-09-25 16:59:00","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_text":"What does an S-curve from a Monte Carlo analysis show?","question_images":[]},{"id":"b2yC3ZgqP17qeAkdqnFt","question_text":"Project managers play a key role in performing integration on a project.

Expert judgment\n\nExpert judgment is an example of tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge refers to knowledge that is difficult to express or codify and is typically acquired through personal experience, intuition, or expertise. Expert judgment is the knowledge and insights that experienced individuals bring to a project based on their past experiences and expertise in a particular domain. It is not easily documented and is often transferred through interactions, mentorship, or shared experiences, making it a prime example of tacit knowledge.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1702769460.0","comment_id":"1098562"},{"content":"C-Expert Judgement-p.100","comment_id":"186502","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1600979340.0","poster":"MoonManBlue"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":153,"topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32642-exam-capm-topic-1-question-239-discussion/","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1600979340,"choices":{"A":"Risk register","D":"Make-or-buy analysis","C":"Expert judgment","B":"Project requirements"},"isMC":true},{"id":"VZn60H0QAN9BcHHuhfFa","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-09-23 17:35:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":126,"question_text":"Which tools and techniques will a project manager use to develop a project charter?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"992921","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Shared portal\n\nWhen managing virtual project teams, a shared portal is often the most effective technology platform for sharing information. Shared portals, also known as project collaboration or document management systems, provide a centralized location where team members can access project documents, data, schedules, and other relevant information. They offer features like document version control, access controls, discussion forums, and notifications, making it easier to collaborate, share updates, and ensure that all team members have access to the latest project-related information.\n\nWhile video conferencing (Option A) and audio conferencing (Option B) are valuable for real-time communication and meetings, they may not be as efficient for document sharing and ongoing access to project information. Email/chat (Option D) can be useful for communication but may not provide the same level of organization and access control as a shared portal.","poster":"041ba31","timestamp":"1702769340.0"},{"timestamp":"1688572080.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"943907","content":"Page 340 in PMBOK, Shared Portal is for shared repository regarding information sharing; email/chat is for regular communications.

Video conferencing is generally considered the most effective technology platform for sharing information when managing virtual project teams. Video conferencing enables face-to-face communication and allows team members to see each other's body language and nonverbal cues, which can help to build stronger relationships and increase understanding. Additionally, video conferencing can be used for virtual meetings, video calls, and screen sharing, which can facilitate collaboration and information sharing among team members. While other technology platforms like audio conferencing, shared portals, and email/chat can also be effective for sharing information, video conferencing is often the preferred option for virtual project teams due to its ability to provide a more engaging and collaborative communication experience.","comment_id":"871496"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"831753","timestamp":"1678184580.0","poster":"Hungdv","content":"C should be answer"},{"timestamp":"1604012940.0","comment_id":"208924","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Haddie","content":"C - could be the correct ans.
