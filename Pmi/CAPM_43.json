This clarity in requirements is a key characteristic that favours a predictive approach.\nAlso companies have been given one year to implement the changes. This fixed timeline allows for better scheduling that aligns well with predictive methodologies.\nAlthough the changes may be new to the company (as suggested in option B), this doesn’t necessarily require an adaptive approach.

Predictive, because of the high risk that the company can be fined\nThis option is the best fit because the predictive approach emphasizes planning, structure, and adherence to timelines. Since there is a high risk associated with non-compliance, it is crucial to follow a well-defined plan to implement the changes promptly and correctly.\nWhile the tax law is likely clear and stable, the context of implementation—including the urgency, potential risks, and the complexity of modifying an accounting system—leans more towards C (predictive). It emphasizes the need for a structured and comprehensive approach to minimize risks associated with compliance.\n\nIn situations where regulations are involved, erring on the side of caution and thoroughness (as in the predictive approach) is generally more prudent.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729367640.0","poster":"MonBouj"},{"timestamp":"1729266900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA - a new tax law would be clearly defined and would not change within the year.","comment_id":"1299740","poster":"xenophanes__","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - Adaptive, this is a new tax law in a short period of 1 year","comment_id":"1252108","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Cyberpleb","timestamp":"1721524620.0"}],"answers_community":["A (71%)","14%","14%"],"exam_id":126,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Adaptive, because the changes have never been implemented before.","C":"Predictive, because of the high risk that the company can be fined.","D":"Adaptive, because the government will provide constant feedback.","A":"Predictive, because the requirements are clearly defined up-front."},"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1721524620,"question_text":"Recently, the government published a new tax law giving companies one year to implement the changes.
