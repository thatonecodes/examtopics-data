According Mike Griffiths , PMI-ACP Exam Prep, 1st Ed, Velocity is defined as the “measure of a team’s capacity for work per iteration.” This powerful metric allows\nthe team to gauge how much work they will be able to do in future iterations, based on the amount of\nwork they completed in past iterations. This provides a way to track and communicate what they have\naccomplished, anticipate what they will be able to accomplish in the future, and forecast when the project\n(or release) is likely to be done.","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"224782","timestamp":"1606026360.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1275074","content":"Selected Answer: D\nHistorical Velocity: Utilizing the team's historical velocity allows for a data-driven approach to estimating future work. Velocity is the amount of work a team can complete in a given iteration, measured in story points or other units. By analyzing past performance, the scrum master can make more accurate predictions.\nRange of Features: Instead of committing to a specific set of features, providing a range offers flexibility and accounts for uncertainties. This approach acknowledges that exact predictions are challenging in agile projects and helps manage stakeholder expectations.\nRealistic Planning: Using historical data helps in setting realistic goals and avoids overcommitting. It ensures that the team can maintain a sustainable pace without compromising quality.\nTransparency: This method promotes transparency with stakeholders by showing how estimates are derived and the factors considered, fostering trust and understanding.","poster":"thewalker","timestamp":"1725021420.0"},{"timestamp":"1705259940.0","poster":"Michaela0015","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI would go with D. \nThe questions says „provide an estimate“.\nA. „commit to..“ - nobody asks for a commitment\nB. „commitment will be provided“ - same as above\nC. „commit to“ - same as above\nD. „.. to calculate a range of features that CAN be delivered“ - this looks like an answer that will provide an ESTIMATE, not commitment","comment_id":"1122778"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nC IS RELATIVE\nD THERE IS NO PROOF THAT THERE ARE PAST SPRINTS","comment_id":"909027","timestamp":"1685333040.0","poster":"Agile_Dario_Conde","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"I think of 'D'.

The team's historical velocity is a useful metric to estimate what can be delivered in a given time frame. Based on the team's past performance, the scrum master can calculate a range of features that can be delivered in six months.

This makes C an incomplete answer because you do not only use story points to estimate PBIs, but you also need velocity. Think about it, how else can you decide if you can deliver let's say 200 story points in a 3-month release? You need another metric, which is your team's or similar project's past performance (velocity).","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"792480","timestamp":"1675060020.0","poster":"InvisibleBeing"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.\nLook at \"Admirable\" response to understand.","poster":"InvisibleBeing","comment_id":"790345"},{"poster":"cozyhead","comment_id":"649084","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nC and D make sense.

However, non-functional requirements such as integration with a 3rd party system are also critical to the success of the project. The project leader should suggest developing and documenting a detailed architectural design, peer review with the development team, and implement/test.
