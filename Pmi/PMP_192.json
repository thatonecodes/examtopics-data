For example, a project to build a new bridge may have a risk of delays due to bad weather conditions.\n\nA project issue is a problem that has already occurred and needs to be addressed in order for the project to continue successfully. For example, during the construction of the bridge, it may be discovered that there is an issue with the quality of materials being used.\n\nA response strategy is a plan for how to respond to a project risk in order to minimize its impact on the project. There are several types of response strategies including avoidance (eliminating the risk), mitigation (reducing the likelihood or impact of the risk), transfer (shifting responsibility for the risk to another party), and acceptance (accepting the consequences if the risk occurs). For example, in response to the risk of delays due to bad weather conditions during bridge construction, a response strategy could be to adjust the schedule and plan for additional time in case of bad weather.","poster":"mrbottomwood","comment_id":"848819","timestamp":"1679618460.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"poster":"Bobbie30"}],"answers_community":["C (45%)","B (36%)","Other"],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"During project execution, the risk owner is monitoring the critical speed rate of a power engine to eventually trigger the defined risk-response strategy.
