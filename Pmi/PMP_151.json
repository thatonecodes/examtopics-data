At the end of each sprint, a review meeting, often referred to as a sprint review or demo, is held to showcase the completed work to stakeholders. This provides an opportunity to assess the quality of the deliverables against the project's objectives and requirements.\n\nStandup review meetings, also known as daily standups or daily scrums, are short daily meetings where team members discuss their progress, any challenges, and plans for the day. While these meetings primarily focus on coordination and communication, they also create an environment for identifying potential quality issues early on and addressing them promptly.\n\nBy using time-boxed iterations and conducting regular standup review meetings, the project manager can keep track of the project's progress, assess the quality of the deliverables, and make necessary adjustments to ensure quality is maintained throughout the project.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1687573920.0","poster":"aqz_111","comment_id":"932113","content":"The question is asking a mechanism which can improve productivity.
