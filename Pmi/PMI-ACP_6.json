Conducted frequent review meetings with the customer to continually enhance delivery effectiveness\n\nFrequent Review Meetings: Regular review meetings with the customer allow for ongoing feedback on the product. This helps ensure that the delivered work meets the customer's expectations and quality standards. By involving the customer throughout the development process, any issues or misalignments can be identified and addressed promptly.\n\nContinuous Feedback Loop: Frequent reviews provide a mechanism for continuous feedback, allowing the team to make adjustments based on the customer's evolving needs and preferences.
