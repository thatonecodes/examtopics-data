If a new team member is struggling to develop a concise user story, the agile practitioner should advise them to break the story up and focus on the most valuable parts. This approach allows the team member to focus on specific features or functions of the story and develop a more detailed understanding of the user's needs and requirements.\n\nBreaking the story up also helps to simplify the development process, making it easier for the team member to manage their workload and track their progress. By focusing on the most valuable parts of the story, the team member can ensure that the product meets the user's needs and delivers value to the customer.","timestamp":"1711008420.0","poster":"Smokeyofficiial","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706331900.0","comment_id":"789336","poster":"InvisibleBeing","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"784990","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI first thought C, but this is What advice should the agile practitioner give to assist with developing the story, retrospective will come later so B is the answer.","timestamp":"1705985760.0","poster":"Raag27"}]},{"id":"TtppdMcQkmp4MhsYBVBY","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/49756-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Jointly meet with the team and product owner to discuss options and determine the end date","D":"Ask the team to decrease velocity to meet contractual obligations and document this decision","B":"Announce that the team has exceeded the predicted velocity, and that the end date will be earlier than planned","C":"Ask the product owner to include additional features in the product backlog, then re-plan subsequent iterations"},"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nI was confused between A & C, but there is no subiteration in Agile.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1292436","timestamp":"1727876580.0","poster":"AmatullahSulaiman"},{"poster":"Srinath_C","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1003217","timestamp":"1694263560.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption A is right"},{"comment_id":"862911","poster":"Petrevski","timestamp":"1680781440.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA = correct"},{"content":"Option A.\nIn Agile, the team and product owner collaborate to determine the end date based on the team's velocity and progress.
