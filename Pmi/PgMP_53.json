It acknowledges the interdependencies between projects within the program and ensures that the response is coordinated and effective at the program level, rather than being handled in isolation at the project level. This approach is vital for managing risks that have implications across multiple projects within a program.","timestamp":"1720827240.0"},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Incorporate the project risk into the program risk response strategy.\n\nThe program manager should integrate the project risk into the overall program risk response strategy. This is because the risk has an interdependency with another project within the program (the sewage line construction project) and has exceeded its risk threshold. The program manager is responsible for overseeing risks that affect the program as a whole and for ensuring that interdependent risks across projects are managed in a coordinated way. By incorporating the risk into the program risk response strategy, the program manager can ensure that a holistic approach is taken to mitigate or manage the risk, which can involve adjustments across multiple projects within the program if necessary.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1106211","timestamp":"1719412020.0"},{"comment_id":"1103162","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719027000.0","poster":"hanyulin","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the right answer."},{"timestamp":"1719026820.0","poster":"hanyulin","comments":[],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the right answer.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1103158"},{"content":"what about D ?","poster":"ekk1983","timestamp":"1714896180.0","comment_id":"1062755","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"I pick B, Program sponsor is not directly work to resolve the program risk.","comment_id":"325609","poster":"tsangckl","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1633072800.0"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/48621-exam-pgmp-topic-1-question-436-discussion/","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1617261600,"choices":{"B":"Incorporate the project risk into the program risk response strategy.","D":"Ask the road construction project manager to manage the risk at the project level.","C":"Instruct the project manager to escalate the risk to the program sponsor.","A":"Modify the program schedule to accommodate the risk."},"question_images":[],"exam_id":132,"question_id":261},{"id":"ri2YfRy8z458ycT7nK5V","choices":{"D":"Update the program schedule, and escalate the issue to the program management office (PMO) to accelerate shipyard work.","A":"Conduct a program performance analysis based upon the deviation, and update the program business case to reflect the schedule delay.","B":"Inform the program sponsor and the steering committee of the delay, and validate the program business case.","C":"Analyze the impact of the delay, review risks identify any corrective actions, and update the benefits management plan."},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"A program manager for the construction of a ship reviews the program management plan with a shipyard representative.
