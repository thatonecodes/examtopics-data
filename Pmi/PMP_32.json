This approach allows the current team to acquire the necessary skills gradually, minimizing the impact on the project schedule. It also aligns with a proactive risk management strategy, acknowledging the skills gap and addressing it through a planned training period.\n\nIntroducing a mentoring program (option A) is a good practice, but it might not provide an immediate solution to the skills gap. Changing the scope (option B) might compromise the project's objectives. Using the management reserve (option D) is typically reserved for unforeseen risks or changes that impact the project and is not a sustainable solution for skills development.","poster":"Abdelmonm","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704790020.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nextra time means increasing in cost. company cannot afford hiring a new team member how organization/project can afford extra cost.
