Continues feedback","timestamp":"1617558780.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is C. Using active stakeholder involvement to build features in an increment and iterative approach. Here's why:\n\nActive Stakeholder Involvement: The agile facilitator is bringing the executive team into the mid-sprint review, demonstrating active stakeholder involvement. This is a key principle of agile methodologies, where stakeholders are not passive observers but actively participate in shaping the product.\nIncrement and Iterative Approach: The executive team's review of the iteration charts and discussion of changes to the functional goal reflects an iterative approach. They are actively reviewing progress, identifying areas for improvement, and making adjustments mid-sprint, which is a core aspect of iterative development.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1276413","comments":[{"content":"Let's analyze why the other options are less relevant:\n\nA. Building openness and transparency on the project's health and status: While the meeting promotes transparency, it's not the primary focus. The facilitator is actively engaging stakeholders in decision-making, not just providing information.\nB. Facilitating conflict resolution among executive team members: The facilitator is facilitating the meeting, but the conflict resolution is happening among the executives themselves. The facilitator's role is to guide the process, not to resolve conflicts directly.\nD. Seeking continuous feedback from executive team members: While feedback is being sought, the focus is on using that feedback to make immediate adjustments to the iteration's functional goal, demonstrating an iterative approach.","poster":"thewalker","timestamp":"1725255060.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1276414"}],"timestamp":"1725255000.0","poster":"thewalker"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe scenario emphasizes the facilitator facilitating the executives' review of charts and proposing changes to the functional goal. enabling active engagement by executives in reviewing and potentially modifying the iteration's goals.","poster":"chlaithem","timestamp":"1705240020.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1122562"},{"poster":"Petrevski","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1683631680.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD = correct.","comment_id":"893047"},{"content":"Vote D","poster":"Minhha3","comment_id":"868547","timestamp":"1681316940.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"richck102","timestamp":"1658372220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"634332","content":"i vote A"},{"comment_id":"572987","poster":"thuha1704","timestamp":"1647958260.0","content":"D is correct","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1622902740.0","comment_id":"375235","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Dsugandhi","content":"D - Removing impediments (resolve conflicts and correcting functional goals) by continuous feedback from stakeholders"},{"content":"I would go for A","comment_id":"368887","timestamp":"1622219700.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"HTTPS"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":71,"answer":"D","timestamp":"2021-04-04 19:53:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Using active stakeholder involvement to build features in an increment and iterative approach","A":"Building openness and transparency on the project's health and status","B":"Facilitating conflict resolution among executive team members","D":"Seeking continuous feedback from executive team members"}},{"id":"qAD2Tqs0HSVKikn6qII8","unix_timestamp":1605554760,"question_text":"What can a team use to prioritize stories?","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2020-11-16 20:26:00","choices":{"C":"Weighted average calculation","A":"MoSCoW method","B":"Planning poker technique","D":"INVEST scale"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","isMC":true,"question_id":72,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":127,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725254700.0","comment_id":"1276404","upvote_count":"1","poster":"thewalker","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMoSCoW Method: This prioritization technique categorizes user stories into four groups:\nMust have: Essential features that are critical for the product's success.\nShould have: Important features that are not critical but add significant value.\nCould have: Desirable features that can be included if time and resources permit.\nWon't have: Features that are not a priority for the current release but may be considered for future releases.\nPrioritization: The MoSCoW method helps teams focus on delivering the most critical and valuable features first, ensuring that the product meets its essential requirements.\nStakeholder Alignment: This method facilitates discussions with stakeholders to agree on the priorities and manage expectations effectively.\nFlexibility: It allows teams to adapt to changes and re-prioritize based on feedback and evolving requirements."},{"comment_id":"1122565","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPrioritization: Use MoSCoW.\nEstimation: Use planning poker.\nSummarizing multiple attributes: Use weighted average (with caution).\nEvaluating story quality: Use INVEST scale.","poster":"chlaithem","timestamp":"1705240260.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Petrevski","timestamp":"1683631860.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"893048","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA = prioritization\nB = estimation & sizing\nC = calculations\nD = related to quality of the user stories"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Vote A","timestamp":"1681317000.0","poster":"Minhha3","comment_id":"868548"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675212360.0","poster":"InvisibleBeing","content":"For prioritization, there is no such thing as:\n\nC.
