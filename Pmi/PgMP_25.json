Assign ownership of risks with appropriate responsibilities, document agreed-upon response strategies, and provide the foundation for the risk management plan.\n\nThe program risk register is a key tool in risk management that helps to identify, assess, and manage risks throughout the life of a program. The register typically includes:\n\nThe identification of risks.\nAn assessment of their impact and probability.\nStrategies for their management.\nThe assignment of ownership for each risk.\nIt serves as a foundation for the risk management plan by outlining how identified risks are to be approached and handled. This plan is used to guide the ongoing risk management activities within the program and is regularly updated as risks evolve or new risks are identified.","timestamp":"1703512680.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702636980.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the right answer.","comment_id":"1097212","poster":"hanyulin"}],"question_id":121,"question_text":"What actions are taken in the process of developing and maintaining a program risk register?","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-12-15 11:43:00","answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/128635-exam-pgmp-topic-1-question-291-discussion/","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1702636980,"answers_community":["B (50%)","A (50%)"],"choices":{"C":"Assign ownership of risks with appropriate responsibilities, document agreed-upon response strategies, and proactively manage program issues.","D":"Assign ownership of risks with appropriate responsibilities, document agreed-upon response strategies, and identify residual risks.","A":"Assign ownership of risks with appropriate responsibilities, document agreed-upon response strategies, and provide the foundation for the risk management plan.","B":"Assign ownership of risks with appropriate responsibilities, document agreed-upon response strategies, and identify the root cause of potential risks."},"exam_id":132},{"id":"qO2D2VE9u3fzu2FYWC36","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1683339660,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-06 04:21:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the right answer.","poster":"hanyulin","comment_id":"1097139","timestamp":"1718434620.0"},{"content":"I would go with C.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699244460.0","comment_id":"890416","poster":"Salim_7"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":122,"choices":{"A":"Utilize team members that are currently available, even though they do not have the expertise needed.","B":"Assign the tasks on the critical path to the resources available to adhere to the project schedule.","C":"Delay the start of the program until the assigned resources are available.","D":"Apply resource leveling considering the constraints of time, budget, and quality."},"exam_id":132,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/108597-exam-pgmp-topic-1-question-292-discussion/","question_text":"A hotel chain initiates a program to expand meeting offerings to include telecommunications technology and virtual meetings.

Assign a different project manager\n\nWhen a client rejects a project manager due to a lack of proper qualifications, the immediate priority for the program manager should be to address the client's concerns and ensure the project has the right leadership. This involves assigning a different project manager who meets the client's expectations and qualifications criteria for managing the project. While reassessing credentials, reviewing skill requirements, and applying competence assessment techniques are important, they are more time-consuming and do not immediately address the client's concern. The prompt assignment of a new, suitably qualified project manager can help maintain the client's confidence and ensure the smooth progression of the project.","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1719318540.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"hanyulin","timestamp":"1718435220.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the right answer.","comment_id":"1097147"}],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1702631220,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-12-15 10:07:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/128629-exam-pgmp-topic-1-question-297-discussion/","answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (50%)","B (50%)"]},{"id":"D8X13hcI84NuFPbFE3b4","choices":{"C":"Plans for program schedule control to meet the shorter timeline","D":"Plans for defining metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs), and procedures to measure benefits.","A":"Plans for tracking and communicating risks associated with the program","B":"Plans for conducting program quality assurance and control on a regular basis"},"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-12-25 15:33:00","answer":"D","question_text":"A program manager concurrently implements a software program at four client locations.

Plans for defining metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs), and procedures to measure benefits.\n\nIn the context of a software program implementation with the objective of maintaining quality while shortening the timeline, the benefits register should include plans for defining and tracking metrics and KPIs that are aligned with these goals. This will involve setting clear, measurable criteria for assessing both the quality of the software and the efficiency of the implementation process. Procedures for measuring these benefits are also crucial, as they will provide a systematic way to evaluate whether the program is achieving its intended objectives. Regular measurement and assessment against these metrics and KPIs will enable the program manager to track progress, identify areas needing improvement, and ensure alignment with the client's goals.","poster":"[Removed]"}],"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"id":132,"provider":"Pmi","numberOfQuestions":311,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"PgMP","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":25},"__N_SSP":true}
