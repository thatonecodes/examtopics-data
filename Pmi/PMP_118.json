Update the schedule to reflect the holidays and share the workload among offices to mitigate schedule slippage.\n\nThe project manager should update the schedule to reflect the holidays in the overseas offices, and share the workload among offices to mitigate schedule slippage. This can be done by identifying which activities are scheduled over the holidays and re-sequencing them to be completed before or after the holiday period. This can also be done by redistributing the work among the offices, so that the workload is more evenly spread out. Additionally, the project manager should communicate the updated schedule to all relevant parties and ensure that all team members understand their responsibilities during the holiday period.\n\nHiring additional personnel on a temporary basis to cover the extra workload during the holiday seasons, or requesting that the offices in overseas locations work overtime to mitigate schedule slippages, may not be feasible or sustainable.
