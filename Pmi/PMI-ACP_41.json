I believe C is a better option. You cannot really go and convince people by just words or lessons learned, they need to some proof/evidence that Agile works. The best proof/evidence is the release and project retrospectives. The other benefit of inviting other people from the organization is that you don't need to go schedule separate meetings with others and repeat the same thing over and over again. Option C is talking about PROJECT retrospectives and not the sprint retrospectives.\n\nI would like everyone to know that there are 2 kinds of retrospectives: The first is short at iteration level, which occurs after every sprint, and the second is long at project or release level. The main purpose for the second one is to extend beyond the core sprint team in order to improve the organization.

Request the team work overtime to get the work done on time and within the allocated budget.\n\nReason: Asking the team to work overtime is not a sustainable solution and can lead to burnout and decreased productivity.

It may also put undue pressure on the individual without addressing systemic issues.\nD. Informing stakeholders about the delay is important, but it should not be the first step.
