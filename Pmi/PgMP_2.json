It performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values—a probability distribution—for any factor that has inherent uncertainty. It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions. This method is particularly useful for analyzing the range of possible outcomes in a project's schedule, cost, or other key variables.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1098009","timestamp":"1702716780.0","poster":"[Removed]"},{"content":"PERT, A","timestamp":"1669235160.0","comment_id":"725378","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Cindyl"},{"comment_id":"594319","poster":"encqizo","content":"A is the right answer.\nThe PERT estimate (E) is based on a formula that includes your optimistic time estimate (O), your most likely time estimate (M) and your pessimistic time estimate (P).
