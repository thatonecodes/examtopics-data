Conduct a quality audit\n\nA project manager can determine if the project activities comply with organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures by conducting a quality audit. Quality audits involve a systematic examination of project activities and deliverables to ensure that they adhere to established organizational and project standards, policies, processes, and procedures. During a quality audit, the project manager or a designated auditor reviews the project's processes, work products, and documentation to identify any non-compliance issues. Corrective actions can then be taken to address any deviations and ensure compliance with the required standards and practices. Quality audits are a valuable tool for assessing and improving the overall quality of project execution.","comment_id":"1098579","timestamp":"1718575020.0"},{"content":"Conduct a quality audit","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1652273280.0","comment_id":"476303","poster":"[Removed]"},{"poster":"UlrichIng","comment_id":"203712","upvote_count":"1","content":"D.
