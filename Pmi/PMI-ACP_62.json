It is the responsibility of the agile practitioner to foster and facilitate this engagement throughout the project. If stakeholders were largely uninvolved in the project, it is possible that they were not sufficiently engaged, leading to their dissatisfaction with the product's software.\n\nOption A is not entirely correct as communication is only one aspect of stakeholder engagement. While communicating early and often is important, it is not sufficient on its own. Option C is also not entirely correct as additional stakeholder reviews and demos may not necessarily lead to improved stakeholder satisfaction if they were not sufficiently engaged in the project. Option D is not appropriate as working with the product owner to prioritize user stories is a standard Agile practice and does not specifically address the issue of stakeholder engagement.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726913340.0","poster":"Smokeyofficiial"},{"poster":"InvisibleBeing","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct.","timestamp":"1722118980.0","comment_id":"790112","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"637866","timestamp":"1706344560.0","content":"i vote B","poster":"richck102"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Elli_Low1990","timestamp":"1694086680.0","comment_id":"562647"},{"poster":"Safwa","upvote_count":"1","content":"The main perpouse of the prioritization the stories to select which of them provide the high value an customer satisfaction.","comment_id":"465572","timestamp":"1682056500.0"},{"poster":"tpkhoa","timestamp":"1680958080.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"I would go with B.\nIf stakeholders are displeased, PO need to work with them to find out what was wrong.
