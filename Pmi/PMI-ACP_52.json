This aligns with the Agile principle of \"Welcome changing requirements, even late in development\" and the Agile practice of \"Continuous planning and risk management.\" When risks exceed the upper threshold of tolerance, the team should add risk mitigation tasks to the product backlog and prioritize them alongside other product requirements.

Sprint velocity is a measure of the amount of work a team can complete in a sprint based on past performance.
