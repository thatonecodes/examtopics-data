In this project, it's $447,000 divided by the $558,750 for a value of 0.80. Schedule performance index (SPI) is the measure of schedule efficiency on a project. It is used in trend analysis to predict future performance.\nSPI is the ratio of earned value to planned value. The SPI is calculated based on the following formula:\nSPI = Earned Value (EV) / Planned Value (PV)\nIf the SPI value is greater than 1, it indicates better than expected performance, whereas if the value is less than 1, it shows poor performance. The SPI value of 1 indicates that the project is right on target.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: \"80\" is not the same value as \".80\".\nB: 1.02 is the cost performance index.\nC: 102 is not a valid calculation for this question.","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/25053-exam-pmi-sp-topic-1-question-12-discussion/","exam_id":130,"answers_community":[],"choices":{"A":"80","B":"1.02","C":"102","D":"0.80"},"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1594158060,"question_id":6,"isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"xiQpUnXUq9l2SNFD0SX9","answer_description":"The Precedence Diagramming Method uses both predecessors and successors as nodes in the project network diagram.
