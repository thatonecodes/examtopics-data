Decompose the product backlog into user stories with tasks/acceptance criteria and estimate to commit to an accurate schedule: While decomposition and estimation are important, they do not provide the empirical data needed for an accurate schedule. This method relies heavily on initial estimates, which can be inaccurate.\nC. Use analogous estimating techniques based on projects with a similar velocity: Analogous estimating can provide a rough estimate but lacks the precision and reliability of using the team's actual velocity. Each project has unique variables that can affect the schedule.\nD. Provide a delivery range based on the team's estimated velocity: Providing a range can be useful, but it may not satisfy the need for an accurate schedule.
