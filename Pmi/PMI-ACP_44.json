Frequent integration is actually a best practice in agile methodologies, as it helps to identify issues early and ensures that the work is continuously tested and integrated. It is not a risk but rather a benefit of agile practices.\n\nC. While training and learning agile practices in multiple locations can be a logistical challenge, it is not a primary risk associated with the use of agile in distributed teams. The main risk lies in communication and collaboration issues.\n\nD. Agile methodologies emphasize clear roles and responsibilities within the team. While distributed teams may face challenges in maintaining clarity, this is not as significant a risk as the lack of shared knowledge of user stories.","timestamp":"1725854580.0","comment_id":"1280707","upvote_count":"1","poster":"thewalker"}],"comment_id":"1280706","content":"Selected Answer: B\nLack of shared knowledge of user stories is a significant risk in distributed agile teams. When team members are not co-located, it can be challenging to ensure that everyone has a consistent and thorough understanding of the user stories. This can lead to miscommunication, misunderstandings, and ultimately, a decrease in the quality and effectiveness of the work produced.","poster":"thewalker","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Petrevski","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"993928","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB = correct","timestamp":"1693389480.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1693389480,"choices":{"C":"Need for more locations to learn agile","D":"Unclear team structure","B":"Lack of shared knowledge of user stories","A":"Frequent integration of work produced"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/119382-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-293-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer":"B","timestamp":"2023-08-30 11:58:00","isMC":true,"question_id":216,"exam_id":127,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","question_text":"What is the risk of using agile in a distributed team?"},{"id":"BMJeWcmsFvXBgyBAkvCz","answer":"C","question_images":[],"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Request that the product owner include a spike in the next iteration's backlog so they can perform an initial investigation.","D":"Propose alternative components with which the team has experience.","A":"Ask for a team extension so that an engineer with the needed experience can be added to the team.","B":"Suggest that the product owner perform the initial investigation and present the outcome to the team."},"timestamp":"2023-08-30 12:03:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/119384-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-294-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1693389780,"isMC":true,"exam_id":127,"answer_images":[],"question_id":217,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"The team is aware that they will need to integrate a new component to their solution in the next few weeks.
