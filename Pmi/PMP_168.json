However, a common practice is to estimate the story duration over two iterations. \n\nDuring the first iteration, the project manager can estimate the high-level epics, capabilities, and features, which will allow them to get a broad understanding of the project's scope and requirements. \n\nDuring the second iteration, the project manager can break down the features into smaller, more manageable user stories and estimate their durations more accurately. This approach allows for a more iterative and flexible estimation process that can adapt as the project progresses. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: C.
