Review the definition of done (DoD) with the product owner.\n\nThe confusion from the team likely stems from a misalignment or misunderstanding of the definition of done (DoD)â€”what it means for a sprint or user story to be considered complete. By reviewing and clarifying the DoD with the product owner, the team can ensure that everyone, including the product owner, has the same understanding of what is required for sprint completion. This will help set clear expectations and prevent confusion during sprint reviews or meetings.","comment_id":"1293205","timestamp":"1728061860.0"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1728061860,"answer_description":"","question_text":"At a meeting, the project manager for an agile project indicates that the sprint goals were not met.
