When managing threats, it is important to prioritize them based on their criticality and timing. This allows the team to focus their attention and resources on addressing the most significant risks first. By prioritizing the risks, the team can allocate appropriate efforts to mitigate or respond to them effectively.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to track actions related to each risk and ensure that they are followed through to closure. This involves assigning ownership of the actions to responsible individuals and monitoring their progress.
