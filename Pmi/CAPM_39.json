New knowledge is added to organizational process assets.\n\nEffective management of project knowledge involves capturing and documenting lessons learned, best practices, and other valuable insights gained throughout the project. By doing so, this knowledge becomes part of the organizational process assets, which are resources, tools, and knowledge that can be used by the organization in future projects. This contributes to organizational learning and continuous improvement.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C are important aspects of project management, they don't specifically capture the broader organizational benefit of adding new knowledge to the organizational process assets.","poster":"shubu2276","timestamp":"1705811160.0"},{"comment_id":"1098521","timestamp":"1702766820.0","content":"D. New knowledge is added to organizational process assets.\n\nWhen a project manager effectively manages project knowledge, one of the key benefits is that new knowledge and lessons learned from the project are captured and added to the organization's process assets. This means that the organization can benefit from the knowledge and experience gained during the project, which can be used to improve future projects and processes. While options A, B, and C are also important benefits of effective knowledge management, the primary long-term benefit for the organization is the accumulation of knowledge and its incorporation into organizational processes and practices.","poster":"041ba31","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's D","poster":"Krasiva","comment_id":"1063897","timestamp":"1699279080.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1059181","poster":"lifelong_learner","content":"D is the right answer according to ChatGPT and Bing","timestamp":"1698783900.0"},{"comment_id":"1048998","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1697825100.0","poster":"jesslhong","content":"I thought D should be the correct answer??

Define Activities\n\nThe process in Project Schedule Management that identifies and documents specific actions to be performed to produce a project's deliverables is \"Define Activities.\" In this process, the project manager and team break down the work packages or higher-level activities into smaller, manageable tasks or activities. These activities are then documented and defined in a way that makes them clear and actionable. This is an important step in developing the project schedule because it lays the foundation for further scheduling activities, such as sequencing and estimating durations, which are part of the overall schedule development process.","comment_id":"1098520","upvote_count":"1","poster":"041ba31"}]},{"id":"XRi7SCVQUxOU4E9D4Lsk","question_text":"A project manager is working on project cost management.

Iterative scheduling with backlog\nExplanation:\nIterative scheduling with backlog is the correct answer. This approach aligns with agile methodologies where user stories are prioritized and refined in a backlog.\nThe team continually refines the backlog, estimating and prioritizing user stories before each iteration. This allows for flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.","poster":"Vangelis_1980","comment_id":"1258108","timestamp":"1722335580.0"},{"content":"A. Iterative scheduling with backlog\n\nWhen project requirements are documented in user stories and then prioritized and refined just prior to construction, it typically reflects an iterative scheduling approach with a backlog. In this approach, work is scheduled based on the backlog of user stories or tasks, and these items are iteratively refined and scheduled as the project progresses. This is commonly seen in Agile project management methodologies like Scrum, where work is planned in short iterations (sprints) and the backlog is adjusted and reprioritized as needed.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702766700.0","poster":"041ba31","comment_id":"1098519"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/128753-exam-capm-topic-1-question-278-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Life cycle scheduling with backlog","A":"Iterative scheduling with backlog","D":"Defining iterative activities","B":"On-demand scheduling"},"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"exam_id":126},{"id":"8e69nWDlOTxu4B28paYY","question_text":"The project manager released a report.

Clear purpose and expression directed to the needs of the reader\n\nThe issue where some stakeholders express that the report should not have been directed to them suggests a problem with ensuring that the communication has a clear purpose and is directed to the needs of the reader. In other words, the project manager needs to ensure that the report is appropriately targeted to the specific stakeholders who should receive it, and it should align with their needs and interests. This is a key aspect of effective written communication, which falls under the \"Clear purpose and expression directed to the needs of the reader\" aspect of the 5Cs of written communications.","comment_id":"1098518"}],"unix_timestamp":1702766640,"answer_images":[],"question_id":195}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":374,"isImplemented":true,"name":"CAPM","id":126,"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Pmi","isBeta":false},"currentPage":39},"__N_SSP":true}
