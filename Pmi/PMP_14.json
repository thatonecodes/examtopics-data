In this scenario, the project manager has identified a change request related to adding a new feature, and during the analysis, it's discovered that the necessary equipment won't be available in time, leading to potential project team idle time. To address this, the project manager should follow the integrated change control process, which includes assessing the impact of the change, considering alternatives, and making decisions about whether to approve or reject the change. This process ensures that changes are evaluated comprehensively and that their implications on resources, timelines, and other aspects are thoroughly considered before implementation.","poster":"Abdelmonm","timestamp":"1705216260.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1275266","poster":"Kim222","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725050700.0","content":"thank you"}],"comment_id":"1122331"},{"timestamp":"1702560480.0","poster":"wisegik","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe project manager should perform integrated change control to determine the impact of the change request on the project schedule, budget, and resources","comment_id":"1096499","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":67,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/128583-exam-pmp-topic-1-question-1058-discussion/","topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":131,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"During project execution, a client asks to add one more features to the product.

Log the concern as a risk in the project risk register and assess the impact and severity of the risk.\n\nIn this situation, the project manager should proactively address the concern by engaging stakeholders in a risk workshop to identify and assess potential risks to the project. This includes assessing the risk related to the project implementation date coinciding with the company's financial budget planning period. Logging this concern in the project risk register and assessing its impact and severity will provide a structured way to manage and mitigate the risk throughout the project lifecycle. It allows the project manager to develop a risk response plan and keep the sponsor informed about the actions taken to address the concern.","poster":"Abdelmonm","comment_id":"1114310"}],"answers_community":["BC (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/130391-exam-pmp-topic-1-question-1059-discussion/","question_id":68,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":131,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A project for developing software for a retail company's procurement system is in the initiation phase.
