Restate to the developers the importance of focusing and meeting the sprint goal. In Scrum, the sprint goal is a commitment made by the development team, and it’s crucial to focus on the agreed-upon work to achieve this goal. While it’s important to address technical debt and potential issues, these should ideally be planned for and included in the sprint backlog during the sprint planning meeting. If the refactoring is critical, it could be discussed with the product owner and potentially included in a future sprint. Remember, the key to successful Scrum is transparency, inspection, and adaptation.","poster":"josephsafiran","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1120039"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ngcy2023","content":"i think shiuld be A, because spring shoukd empower team to make decision and trust them can done their work?","comment_id":"1089295","timestamp":"1717668300.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714664040.0","poster":"Lucky_Cindy","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

This will help to ensure that the client is aware of the problem and that the change is made in a controlled manner.\n\nThe other options are not as effective. Option A would involve making a change request and getting formal approval from the project owner. This would not be necessary, as the client is the one who needs to approve the change. Option C would involve conducting a proof of concept to make sure there are no problems in the revised design. This would be unnecessary, as the client has already agreed to the change. Option D would involve amending the design specifications and passing them to the development team for reprogramming. This would be premature, as the client has not yet approved the change.","comment_id":"916518","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1701892140.0","poster":"AbbasTaki"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"duyun","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe change should have been approved by the CCB","timestamp":"1700358120.0","comment_id":"901559"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"901212","content":"Change approval should be released by CCB instead of project owner.
