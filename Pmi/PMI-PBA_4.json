It helps to ensure that all requirements are properly traced and linked to the relevant design, implementation, and testing activities. This can be useful in determining the scope of a change to an existing feature, as it can help to identify which requirements are impacted by the change and what work needs to be done to implement it.","poster":"Proctored_Expert"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"name":"PMI-PBA","isImplemented":true,"id":128,"numberOfQuestions":156,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Pmi","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":4},"__N_SSP":true}
