The variance notifies that the schedule is ahead or behind what was planned for this period in time. The schedule variance is calculated based on the following formula: SV = Earned Value (EV) - Planned Value (PV) If the resulting schedule is negative, it indicates that the project is behind schedule. A value greater than 0 shows that the project is ahead of the planned schedule. A value of 0 indicates that the project is right on target. The earned value in this instance is forty percent of the project budget, $778,000, and the planned value is $398,000 because George is to be fifty percent done at the end of the second quarter, as the work is spread evenly across all quarters. The schedule variance is -$77,800 for the project.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: .96 represents the cost performance index.\nC: -$34,500 represents the project's variance at completion if the project continues as is.\nD: -$13,800 is the cost variance for the project.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/3897-exam-pmi-sp-topic-1-question-9-discussion/","topic":"1","exam_id":130,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"George is the project manager of the NHQ Project and has a budget of $778,000.

A hammock activity is a schedule or project planning term for grouping of subtasks that \"hangs\" between two end dates it is fixed to. It groups subtasks that are not related in the hierarchical sense of a Work Breakdown Structure. It also groups subtasks that are not related in a logical sense of a dependency where one subtask must wait for another. A hammock activity usually refers to report information that is time-dependent and lasts from the initial to the latest date of the activities it encompasses. By using a hammock activity, the top management is able to see an overview of the project without being besieged by details.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: Project management overhead describes the work that supports the project objectives, but is not linked directly to the project deliverables.\nC: A subproject is a discrete set of work that contributes to the project, but branches off the primary project work.
