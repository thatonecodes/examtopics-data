This will help to build trust and ensure that the funds are released. Simply instructing the billing team to issue the invoices immediately without understanding the reason for the delay may not solve the underlying issue and may lead to further problems. Reviewing previous billing information and preparing a corrective action plan may be necessary, but it should not be the first step taken in this situation. Communicating and informing the client to go ahead and release the funds without providing the invoices may not be a good approach as it may create doubts in the client's mind about the project's financial management.","poster":"RevZig67","comment_id":"868812"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1276590","content":"Can Option B the answer ?
