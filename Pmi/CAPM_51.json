For a project involving the merger of a legacy system from an acquired company, the scrum board should primarily include the product backlog and sprint backlog.\n\nProduct Backlog: This is a prioritized list of all features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product. In this case, it would include all the tasks necessary to merge the legacy system successfully.\nSprint Backlog: This is a subset of the product backlog, containing the items selected for the current sprint, along with the plan for delivering them. It represents the team’s immediate focus and commitment for the ongoing sprint.","comment_id":"1559165"},{"content":"The Scrum board is a visual tool in Agile that tracks work progress. It shows tasks from the product backlog (all project tasks) and the sprint backlog (tasks for the current sprint), helping the team see what’s in progress and what’s done.","poster":"Fav24","comment_id":"1289708","timestamp":"1727378040.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"flee","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719237660.0","comment_id":"1236385","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBurndown and burnup charts are essential tools in Scrum for tracking progress. They provide visibility into the remaining work (burndown chart) or the completed work (burnup chart) over time. These charts help the team and stakeholders understand if the project is on track to meet its goals and deadlines.\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) and baseline measurements (option A) are used for monitoring overall project health and performance but are usually tracked separately. Product and sprint backlogs (option B) are managed and updated within the team but are not typically displayed on the scrum board itself. Increments and bottlenecks (option D) are important to identify and address during project execution but are not commonly shown on the scrum board."}],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["C (50%)","B (50%)"],"unix_timestamp":1719237660,"exam_id":126,"question_images":[]},{"id":"XjFKayiGM7QyASdPe3u3","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","topic":"1","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/142120-exam-capm-topic-1-question-366-discussion/","choices":{"A":"5","B":"2","D":"4","C":"3"},"question_text":"Given the following information, what is the schedule variance (SV) for this project?\n\n\nEarly start date (ES): 16 weeks -\n\nActual time: 12 weeks -\nSchedule performance index (SPI): 1.3","question_id":252,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nES = 16\nAT=EV=12\n\nSPI = EV/PV\nSV = EV-PV\n\n1.3 = 12/PV\nPV = 9.23\n(To confirm : SPI=EV/PV\n= 12/9.23\n= 1.3 \n= same with the information given.)\n\nThus \nSV = 12 - 9.23\nSV = 2.769\nSV ~ 3","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1719239280.0","poster":"flee","comment_id":"1236390"},{"comment_id":"1226198","content":"SPI = EV/PV so EV =12 weeks.
