The receiver responds to the message with feedback\n\nIn an interactive communication model, the sender ensures that the message was understood by the receiver when the receiver responds to the message with feedback. This feedback can take the form of questions, comments, clarifications, or any other response that indicates the receiver's comprehension and engagement with the message. It allows the sender to confirm that the message was received, interpreted correctly, and that there is a mutual understanding between the sender and receiver. Effective feedback is a critical component of interactive communication to ensure clear and accurate communication between parties.","poster":"041ba31","comment_id":"1098542","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702768320.0"}],"question_text":"In an interactive communication model, how is the sender ensured that the message was understood by the receiver?","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1702768320,"answer_ET":"B","question_id":171,"choices":{"D":"The receiver acknowledges their receipt of the message.","B":"The receiver responds to the message with feedback","A":"The receiver decodes the message.","C":"The receiver transmits the message."},"exam_id":126,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-12-17 00:12:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/128765-exam-capm-topic-1-question-255-discussion/","answer":"B","topic":"1","answer_images":[]},{"id":"iKiT7IqH2xRpGftVEV1D","choices":{"A":"Demands on the same resources","B":"Requirements that impact the scope","D":"Project charter","C":"Uncertainty of emerging issues"},"timestamp":"2023-12-17 00:11:00","exam_id":126,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722336600.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1258124","poster":"Vangelis_1980","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Demands on the same resources\n\nBy proactively meeting with other project managers, the project manager can identify potential conflicts or competition for shared resources, such as:\n\nHuman resources: Overlapping skill sets or team members.\nEquipment: Shared tools or machinery.\nBudget: Competing for limited funds.\nUnderstanding these demands upfront allows for effective resource planning, negotiation, and potential mitigation strategies."},{"poster":"041ba31","content":"A. Demands on the same resources\n\nTo minimize the impact that other projects within the same program may have on their project, the project manager should be aware of the demands on the same resources. In a program environment, multiple projects often share common resources, such as personnel, equipment, or facilities. If these resources are overallocated or not available when needed due to conflicts with other projects, it can negatively impact the project's schedule, cost, and overall success. Therefore, effective resource management and coordination with other project managers in the program are crucial to mitigate resource-related risks.","comment_id":"1098541","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702768260.0"}],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1702768260,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/128764-exam-capm-topic-1-question-256-discussion/","question_id":172,"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A project manager proactively meets with other project managers who manage other projects in the same program.

Orchestra conductor\n\nThe role of a project manager is often best likened to that of an orchestra conductor. Like a conductor, a project manager is responsible for coordinating and harmonizing the efforts of various individuals or team members (akin to musicians) to achieve a common goal or project objective.
