Provide opportunity for team members to learn and adjust to the technology.\n\nThe team’s reduced velocity is likely due to the learning curve associated with the new technology. By providing the team with the necessary time, resources, and training to become proficient with the technology, they can improve their performance and regain their previous velocity. This approach also aligns with the principles of self-organizing teams, allowing them to grow and adapt to new challenges rather than bringing in new members or reassigning the project.","comment_id":"1293416","poster":"Ngho"}],"exam_id":131,"timestamp":"2024-10-05 11:34:00","topic":"1"},{"id":"EmohHpmko7DcGAhmqeml","choices":{"E":"Raise a change request with high priority to be discussed in the upcoming governance meetings.","A":"Consider schedule compression techniques to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the project scope.","B":"Consider using resource leveling to more accurately reflect the work commitments of the resources.","D":"Analyze the budget based on the revised estimates and responses from similar situations in the past.","C":"Apply data analysis techniques, variance analysis, and trend analysis."},"isMC":true,"exam_id":131,"timestamp":"2024-08-11 15:34:00","topic":"1","question_text":"A project manager’s transformation project has been delayed due to unexpected issues with the information technology (IT) systems.
