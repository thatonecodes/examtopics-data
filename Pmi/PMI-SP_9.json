The entire project will take 19 days to complete. Float, also called slack, is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting any subsequent activities. There are two types of floats available: Free Float: It is the amount of time a schedule activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any immediately following schedule activities. Total Float: It is the total amount of time that a schedule activity may be delayed from its early start date without delaying the project finish date, or violating schedule constraint. Float is calculated by using the critical path method technique.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB, C: These are incorrect calculations of the amount float available for Activity\nD: Activity E is not on the critical path.","question_text":"You are project manager of HHK project.

It is used in trend analysis to predict future performance. CPI is the ratio of earned value to actual cost. The CPI is calculated based on the following formula: CPI = Earned Value (EV) / Actual Cost (AC) If the CPI value is greater than 1, it indicates better than expected performance, whereas if the value is less than 1, it shows poor performance. The CPI value of 1 indicates that the project is right on target. In this instance, it's\n\nEV = 0.40 * 750,000 -\n= 300,000\n\nCPI = EV/AC -\n= 300,000/325,000\n= 0.92","exam_id":130,"question_text":"John works as a project manager for BlueWell Inc.
