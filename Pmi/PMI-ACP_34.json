By asking the team to estimate the rework, the Scrum Master ensures that the project and release plan remain realistic and achievable. This approach allows for transparency and informed decision-making, maintaining a balance between quality and progress.","poster":"thewalker","comment_id":"1279308","comments":[{"content":"A. Ask the product owner to revisit the scope of the release and revise it so that the team can keep the current commitment schedule.\nWhile revisiting the scope might be necessary later, the team first needs to understand the scope of the rework. Adjusting the release plan should come after that estimation.\n\nB. Ask the team to find a workaround so that they can continue with the current project management plan.\nA workaround might introduce technical debt and quality issues. It's better to address the root cause and handle the rework properly.\n\nC. Advise the team to continue working on the sprints as the release plan has been set.\nIgnoring the rework could lead to further issues down the line and compromise the quality of the product. Adjusting plans to accommodate necessary rework is a more sustainable approach.","comment_id":"1279309","poster":"thewalker","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725592860.0"}]},{"timestamp":"1692784260.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD = correct (the most logical option)","poster":"Petrevski","comment_id":"988159"}],"choices":{"C":"Advise the team to continue working on the sprints as the release plan has been set.","A":"Ask the product owner to revisit the scope of the release and revise it so that the team can keep the current commitment schedule.","B":"Ask the team to find a workaround so that they can continue with the current project management plan.","D":"Ask the team to estimate the amount of rework needed so that adjustments can be made to both the project and release plan."},"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","question_id":166,"unix_timestamp":1692784260,"exam_id":127,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-08-23 11:51:00","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"A project team is currently working on sprint seven of a release that is estimated to require twelve sprints to complete.
