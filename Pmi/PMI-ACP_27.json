Work overtime to meet the customer request and the iteration commitments: This is not sustainable and can lead to burnout. It also sets a precedent that urgent requests will always be handled by overworking, which is not a healthy practice.\n\nB. Ask another team that is less busy to handle the situation: This might not be feasible if the other team lacks the necessary context or expertise. It can also lead to dependencies and potential delays.\n\nD. Work on the customer request in the next iteration as a top priority: This might not be acceptable if the request is truly urgent and cannot wait until the next iteration. It also does not address the immediate need of the customer."}],"poster":"thewalker","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWork with the product owner: The product owner is responsible for managing the backlog and prioritizing work items based on business value and urgency. Collaborating with the product owner ensures that the team makes informed decisions that align with overall project goals and stakeholder needs.\n\nAssess the impact: Evaluating the impact of the urgent request on the current iteration's commitments helps in understanding the trade-offs. This assessment includes considering the importance of the urgent request versus the planned work.\n\nReprioritization: Based on the impact assessment, the product owner can reprioritize the backlog. This might involve deferring some of the current iteration's work to accommodate the urgent request or finding a balance that minimizes disruption.","comment_id":"1277959","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Petrevski","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC = correct","comment_id":"984398","timestamp":"1692355860.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/118420-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-216-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-08-18 12:51:00","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"C","question_id":131,"answer_description":""},{"id":"bouXhBuIW2VKsTIYiQOZ","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"choices":{"B":"A list of tools used for implementation","C":"A list of open technical issues","D":"Up-to-date project radiators","A":"Team capacity and competence profiles"},"answer":"D","exam_id":127,"timestamp":"2023-08-18 12:53:00","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":132,"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"thewalker","comment_id":"1278013","content":"Selected Answer: D\nUp-to-date project radiators: Project radiators are visual tools that display the current status of a project in an easily digestible format.
