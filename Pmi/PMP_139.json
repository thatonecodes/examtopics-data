Discuss this with the team and reprioritize the backlog to deliver maximum value by including a portion of the complex work.\n\nIn this situation, the PRODUCT MANAGER should discuss the technical, complex requirement with the team and reprioritize the backlog to deliver maximum value by including a portion of the complex work. This approach will allow the team to focus on delivering the most important features and functionality to the customer while also addressing the complex requirement. The product manager should also work with the team to identify ways to deliver visual representations of the complex work to the customer, such as diagrams, flowcharts, or mock-ups. It is important not to lower the priority of the complex activity because it will increase the risk of finding issues later in the project and not to inform the customer that there will not be any deliverable due to the complexity involved in the requirement because it could create dissatisfaction with the product.","comment_id":"776587","timestamp":"1673789100.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"TheAWSGuru","timestamp":"1671418200.0","comment_id":"749398","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSry, as mentioned, C is the right answer.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1667120700.0","poster":"Balaraju","comment_id":"707720"},{"content":"I think its B, as mentioned in option C, PM can not reprioritize backlogs.","timestamp":"1667120520.0","poster":"Balaraju","comments":[{"poster":"ChezQW","comment_id":"1054034","content":"I believe the backlog being referenced here is the sprint backlog not the product backlog.","timestamp":"1698273300.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"707716","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/86673-exam-pmp-topic-1-question-345-discussion/","answers_community":["C (80%)","B (20%)"],"exam_id":131,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-10-30 10:02:00","answer_images":[],"question_id":691,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1667120520,"question_text":"An agile team is required to address a technical, complex requirement that has no visual deliverable to show the customer.\nWhat guidance should the product manager provide to improve the requirement development?"},{"id":"jMzlSf2mQMbYhyu3RVV1","answer":"A","question_text":"A project manager is leading an electrical project that spans five towns.
