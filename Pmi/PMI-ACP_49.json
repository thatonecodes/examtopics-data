Let the new release manager participate in the daily standup.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe daily standup is a key Scrum event for communication and transparency. It's a great opportunity for the new release manager to get up to speed on the team's progress and challenges.\nThe Scrum Master should facilitate the new release manager's integration into the team. This includes making sure they understand the team's goals, challenges, and how they can contribute.\nOption A is a good step, but it's not the most effective way to address the issue. The Scrum Master should involve the new release manager directly.\nOption C is not a good idea. The sprint demo is for showcasing the Increment, not for problem-solving.\nOption D is a passive approach. The Scrum Master should actively involve the new release manager in the team's work.","comment_id":"1280758","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn Agile, particularly in Scrum, the daily standup (or daily Scrum) is primarily intended for the development team, the Scrum Master, and the Product Owner. The purpose of the daily standup is to provide a quick status update, synchronize the team's efforts, and identify any impediments or blockers. It is a focused, time-boxed meeting that usually lasts around 15 minutes.\n\nthe arrival of a new release manager can be considered a special circumstance that justifies their temporary attendance at daily standups. This approach ensures a smooth transition, fosters a better understanding of the team’s needs, and facilitates a quicker resolution of any environmental or external challenges affecting the team. However, it’s important to ensure that the standup remains focused and that this is not turned into a long-term practice.","poster":"zayn_1983","comment_id":"1271938","timestamp":"1724544540.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nImmediate Visibility and Engagement: The sprint demo provides a direct and comprehensive overview of the team's progress, challenges, and the tangible impact of the unstable environment. It allows the release manager to quickly grasp the situation and offer valuable insights.\nFocus on Completed Work and Impact: The demo showcases the team's accomplishments and where they're facing roadblocks. \nOpportunity for Direct Help: By actively seeking help during the demo, the Scrum Master encourages the release manager to contribute solutions and expertise immediately. This proactive approach fosters collaboration and accelerates problem-solving.\nFoundation for Future Involvement: Participating in the demo introduces the release manager to the team's work and dynamics, laying the groundwork for their continued engagement in daily standups and other Scrum ceremonies.","timestamp":"1705223640.0","comment_id":"1122415","poster":"chlaithem","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"patti13","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn the exam, I voted for B.
