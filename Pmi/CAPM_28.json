Backlog\n\nIn agile projects, the definition of requirements is typically represented by the \"Backlog.\" The backlog, often referred to as the Product Backlog or Sprint Backlog, is a prioritized list of user stories, features, or items that describe what needs to be built or delivered in the project. It serves as a dynamic document that captures and represents the requirements of the project.\n\nUser stories within the backlog are written in a way that describes the desired functionality or feature from the user's perspective, making them a key element of requirements in agile project management. The backlog is continually refined, reprioritized, and adjusted throughout the project to ensure that it reflects the evolving understanding of the project's requirements.","timestamp":"1718574960.0","poster":"041ba31"},{"poster":"MoonManBlue","timestamp":"1616621280.0","comment_id":"186460","content":"D-Backlog-p.131","upvote_count":"2"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32617-exam-capm-topic-1-question-223-discussion/","answer":"D","timestamp":"2020-09-24 21:28:00","exam_id":126,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"RNHuh5nHaxbgqjAAVSrl","choices":{"A":"Project charter and requirements documentation","D":"Business documents and requirements traceability matrix","B":"Project charter and business documents","C":"Project charter and stakeholder requirements"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1718574900.0","poster":"041ba31","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
