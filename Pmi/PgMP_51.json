Tailoring these activities means the program manager will consider the company's relaxed culture and process aversion while ensuring that there is continuous, albeit not necessarily rapid, progress.

The program manager should focus on keeping stakeholders informed about the continuous progress in protecting intellectual property, aligning with the company's tolerance for long-term activities and its expectations for gradual progress.
