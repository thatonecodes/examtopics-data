Project complexity\n\nOne of the key tailoring considerations for the application of Project Risk Management processes is the complexity of the project. Project complexity can significantly impact the way risk management processes are applied and customized to suit the project's unique characteristics.\n\nFor example, in a highly complex project, more extensive risk identification, analysis, and response planning may be required. Additionally, the risk management approach may involve a broader range of stakeholders and require more sophisticated risk assessment techniques. On the other hand, for less complex projects, a simpler and more streamlined approach to risk management may suffice.\n\nTailoring the risk management processes based on the project's complexity helps ensure that resources are allocated appropriately and that the risk management efforts are commensurate with the project's specific needs and challenges.","comment_id":"1098596","timestamp":"1718576820.0"},{"timestamp":"1705250700.0","content":"A. 6th edition book. pg. 400","upvote_count":"2","poster":"alex903","comment_id":"951619"},{"timestamp":"1705182780.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"garlicbread","comment_id":"957812","timestamp":"1705774380.0","content":"That's stakeholder engagement, question is about risk management"}],"content":"The correct answer is B.
