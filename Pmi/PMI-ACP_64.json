According to Mike Griffiths, PMI-ACP Exam Prep, 1st Ed, Spikes are a key tool that agile teams use to head off problems and resolve them as early as possible. A spike is a short effort (usually timeboxed) that is devoted to exploring an approach, investigating an issue, or reducing a project risk. Although spikes can be done at any time during a project, they often take the form of brief exploratory iterations or proof-of-concept efforts that are done at the start of a project, before the development effort begins.","comment_id":"225100","timestamp":"1653234060.0"},{"comments":[{"content":"Retrospective accounts for \"what can be done better to improve\", I believe this can be discussed in the retrospective meeting","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1651576440.0","comment_id":"211936","poster":"Abdulafou_K"}],"timestamp":"1651423740.0","comment_id":"210670","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Mokel","content":"That is not a topic for retrospective.
