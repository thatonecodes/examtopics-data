Salience model\n\nThe Salience model is used to classify stakeholders based on their assessments of power, urgency, and legitimacy. This model helps project managers and teams prioritize stakeholders by considering these three factors:\n\nPower: The extent to which a stakeholder can influence the project's objectives and outcomes. Stakeholders with higher power have a greater ability to impact the project.\n\nUrgency: The degree of time sensitivity or importance that a stakeholder places on their needs or concerns related to the project. Urgent stakeholders require more immediate attention.\n\nLegitimacy: The perceived appropriateness or validity of a stakeholder's involvement in the project. Stakeholders with high legitimacy are those who have a genuine and recognized interest in the project.","comment_id":"1098583","poster":"041ba31","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718575560.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"186368","content":"C-Salience Model p.513","timestamp":"1616612700.0","poster":"MoonManBlue"}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32581-exam-capm-topic-1-question-212-discussion/","exam_id":126},{"id":"rrzxX7D4QUGYHFr9gWJ6","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/32651-exam-capm-topic-1-question-213-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Validate Quality","A":"Control Quality","B":"Validate Scope","D":"Control Scope"},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-09-24 22:55:00","question_images":[],"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1662972720.0","comment_id":"308779","poster":"Olamipo","content":"B.
