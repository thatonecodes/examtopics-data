Foster stronger communication by hosting cross-organizational meetings between the two teams. \n\nExplanation: The issue of integration suggests that there is a lack of communication and collaboration between the two teams. Hosting cross-organizational meetings will allow both teams to discuss their progress, identify any potential issues, and work together to find solutions. This will also help build trust and understanding between the teams, which is essential for successful integration.\n\nOption B, suggesting merging the teams, may not be feasible or practical as it could lead to larger team sizes and potential conflicts in working styles.\n\nOption C, creating stories from full technical specifications, may not address the underlying issue of communication and collaboration between the two teams.\n\nOption D, co-locating the teams, may not be possible if they are located in different geographical locations or if it disrupts their established working arrangements","poster":"SohaibMahmoud"},{"poster":"TompaL111","upvote_count":"1","content":"A correct \nD agile team and a traditional development team --> co-locate NO !","timestamp":"1677066480.0","comment_id":"817785"},{"poster":"richck102","content":"D sure","timestamp":"1658214120.0","comment_id":"633420","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"thuha1704","content":"A is correct","comment_id":"572959","timestamp":"1647956160.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Abbey2","timestamp":"1628496960.0","content":"You can co-locate the teams without integrating their deliverables.
