Coordinate a collaboration session so all the team members are involved in the solution process. Here's why:\n\nInterdependent Epics Require Collective Problem Solving: When epics are highly interdependent, solutions often require a holistic understanding of the project. A collaborative session allows everyone to contribute their expertise and perspectives, leading to more comprehensive and effective solutions.\nCross-Functional Collaboration: This approach encourages cross-functional collaboration, bringing together technical leads, developers, testers, and potentially even product owners and stakeholders. This diverse input can lead to innovative solutions that address both technical and business needs.\nShared Ownership and Understanding: By involving everyone in the solution process, the team develops a shared understanding of the challenges and the solutions. This fosters a sense of ownership and commitment, leading to better execution.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725341520.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725341520.0","comment_id":"1277278","poster":"thewalker","content":"Why the other options are less ideal:\n\nB. Plan a minimum viable product (MVP) in collaboration with the product owner to reduce technical complexity and move issues to the next release: While an MVP can be a good strategy, it might not address the root cause of the problem, which is the lack of collaboration and shared understanding.\nC. Provide training for all team members to enable higher technical skills and the ability to resolve complex issues: Training is valuable, but it takes time and might not be immediately effective in addressing the current bottleneck.\nD. Hire external consultants to advise on solution options and train team members in any technical gaps: External consultants can be helpful, but they can be expensive and might not fully understand the project's context.\nIn short, a collaborative session is the most efficient and effective way to leverage the collective expertise of the team and find solutions for complex, interdependent epics."}],"poster":"thewalker","comment_id":"1277277"},{"comment_id":"984326","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1692350220.0","poster":"Petrevski","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA = correct"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/118405-exam-pmi-acp-topic-1-question-207-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A large project team is assigned to a complex technical project with many interdependent epics.

Ask management to ensure that the resource is available to only one project at a time. Here's why:\n\nFocus and Productivity: Switching between projects can lead to context switching, which is a major productivity killer. It takes time to re-orient oneself to a new project, and this can lead to errors, delays, and decreased overall efficiency.\nProject Impact: When a key resource is spread thin across multiple projects, it can negatively impact the progress and quality of each project. This can lead to missed deadlines, frustrated stakeholders, and a decline in customer satisfaction.\nBurnout: Constantly switching between projects can lead to burnout and decreased motivation. This can affect the resource's performance and overall well-being.","comment_id":"1277292","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"thewalker","timestamp":"1725341880.0","content":"Why the other options are less ideal:\n\nA.
