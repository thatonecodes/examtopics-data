Develop the program roadmap.\n\nThe program roadmap is a strategic tool that outlines the major milestones and benefits throughout the lifecycle of the program. By developing a program roadmap, the program manager can identify when and how incremental benefits can be realized in alignment with the organization's expectations. The roadmap provides a high-level timeline that helps to visualize the delivery of benefits and can inform more detailed planning, including the program management plan and component project schedules. It is a foundational document that guides the subsequent planning and execution phases of the program.","comment_id":"1102708","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718978580.0"},{"comment_id":"1102269","poster":"hanyulin","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the right answer","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718951760.0"},{"timestamp":"1637745180.0","content":"+1.

The component has met the benefits realization criteria to meet program objectives.\n\nBefore the closure or transition of program components, it is essential to review that the benefits were delivered according to the criteria documented in the governance plan. This includes ensuring that the component's deliverables have been produced, successful delivery has been coordinated, and any transition activities necessary for ongoing benefits have been established. It is crucial that these steps are taken to confirm the component's alignment with the overall program objectives and its contribution to the expected benefits before formal program closure is authorized."},{"comment_id":"1095237","content":"D is correct answer.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718257860.0","poster":"hanyulin"},{"content":"+ 1.
