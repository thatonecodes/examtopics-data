Take action to reprioritize the backlog after every iteration to evaluate if user stories are still valuable to the business**.

Regularly reprioritizing the backlog ensures that the team is always working on the most valuable features. This approach allows the project to adapt to changes in the business environment and ensures that the project continues to deliver value.
