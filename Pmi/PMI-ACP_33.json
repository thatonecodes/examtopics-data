This approach supports ongoing collaboration and feedback, which is key in Agile, particularly when requirements are unclear.\n\nOption A: Creating a spike story focuses on reducing technical risk, but in this case, the main issue is understanding the feature's functionality, not necessarily technical uncertainty.\n\nOption B: Starting an iteration 0 to investigate may cause unnecessary delays and isn’t always needed unless there are significant unknowns.
