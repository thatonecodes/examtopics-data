This type of analysis can be particularly useful when there is historical data available that can be used to simulate the overall risk outcome. By using quantitative analysis, the project manager can take a more objective and data-driven approach to risk assessment, and can use the results of the analysis to inform risk management strategies. Some common techniques for quantitative risk analysis include decision tree analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and expected value analysis.","poster":"IBANGA007","comment_id":"753695"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":66,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (71%)","A (29%)"],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","choices":{"B":"Quantitative analysis","A":"Check list analysis","C":"Cause and effect","D":"Specialized meeting"},"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"d0BY2JwaKdwchmXYXrpY","unix_timestamp":1671747060,"timestamp":"2022-12-22 23:11:00","choices":{"B":"US$100,000 profit","A":"US$20,000 loss","C":"US$40,000 loss","D":"US$20,000 profit"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/92494-exam-pmi-rmp-topic-1-question-183-discussion/","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_id":67,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"753686","poster":"IBANGA007","timestamp":"1719087060.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. US$20,000 profit\n\nThe expected monetary value (EMV) of a project is a measure of the expected value of a potential outcome, calculated by multiplying the probability of that outcome occurring by the monetary value associated with it.\n\nIn this case, the project has a 60% chance of a US$100,000 profit and a 40% chance of a US$100,000 loss. To calculate the EMV, we can use the following formula:\n\nEMV = (Probability of Profit x Monetary Value of Profit) + (Probability of Loss x Monetary Value of Loss)\n\nPlugging in the values from the problem statement, we get:\n\nEMV = (0.6 x US$100,000) + (0.4 x -US$100,000)\n\nEMV = US$60,000 + -US$40,000\n\nEMV = US$20,000\n\nTherefore, the EMV for this project is US$20,000. This means that, on average, the project is expected to generate a profit of US$20,000.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Thank you for the explanation.","timestamp":"1727727720.0","comment_id":"856219","poster":"aws_guru1"}]}],"exam_id":129,"answer":"D","isMC":true,"question_text":"A project has a 60% chance of a US$100,000 profit and a 40% chance of a US$100,000 loss.
