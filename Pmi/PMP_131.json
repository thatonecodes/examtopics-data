Ensure team B prioritizes the dependent activity in iteration three.\nIt is important for the project manager to ensure that the dependent activity from team B is prioritized in iteration three so that team A can start the critical activities in iteration four without delay. This will help ensure that the project stays on schedule and that the critical activities are completed on time. Canceling the current iteration and rescheduling it with the dependent activity would cause unnecessary delays and added costs to the project. Assigning the two critical activities to team B in iteration two would not address the dependency on the activity from team B and could lead to further delays or complications.","comment_id":"775363","timestamp":"1673699040.0","poster":"Adeshola1960","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Arulanandam","timestamp":"1672314180.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree with B.
