Installation of these derricks requires precision placement and stable seas for the transport and installation ships to properly install the deep water structure. There are several schedule and cost incentives for early completion, and the project manager asks the project risk coordinator to perform an analysis, which will predict the probability of meeting the incentive dates. While researching methods that could be used for performing this analysis, the risk manager realizes that there are readily available spreadsheets within the organization. The risk manager is considering performing a Method of Moments (PERT) analysis with software already owned, or the other option is to buy a commercial risk analysis software suite that will perform Latin Hypercube Monte Carlo simulations at a cost of US$975.\nWhat would be the best analytical option for this probability assessment?","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1716138780,"choices":{"A":"Schedule based Method of Moments analysis is a time proven, highly accurate method for schedule risk and is not impacted by Monte Carlo simulation's limitation of summation modeling where only addition and subtraction of uncertain values are used.","D":"Since a schedule risk assessment involves multiplication and division of schedule durations against specific risk events, the Monte Carlo simulation software is the best option.","C":"Because a schedule risk assessment involves multiplication and division of schedule durations against specific risk events, a spreadsheet and using a Method of Moments analysis is the best option.","B":"The commercial product that performs the Monte Carlo simulations is the best option, because a schedule risk assessment involves summation of uncertainties added or subtracted from or to schedule dates."},"isMC":true,"exam_id":129,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/140871-exam-pmi-rmp-topic-1-question-150-discussion/","topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1213893","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MikeMarlo","timestamp":"1732043580.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nMonte Carlo simulation is to be preferred not only because the arithmetic operations, but for handling a wider range of uncertainties and dependencies in a complex project."}],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-05-19 19:13:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"SwuVGosdXygq2e31fnx7","answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1721219940,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":129,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the answer","poster":"TheAWSGuru","comment_id":"1249593","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721219940.0"}],"answer_description":"","question_id":44,"choices":{"D":"Effectiveness of response plans","C":"Number of defects identified","B":"Number of approved project change requests","A":"Effectiveness of the work breakdown structure"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/144022-exam-pmi-rmp-topic-1-question-152-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-07-17 14:39:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"The project manager wants risk metrics established for the new project.
