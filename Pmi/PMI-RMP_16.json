By performing a sensitivity analysis, the risk manager can evaluate the risks and determine which ones need the most attention and resources based on their potential impact on the project.

To determine the total contingency budget that should be created, the risk manager should calculate the expected monetary value (EMV) of each risk by multiplying the probability of the risk occurring by the monetary impact of the risk.\n\nFor risk A, the EMV is 40% x $100,000 = $40,000. For risk B, the EMV is 60% x $20,000 = $12,000. The total contingency budget is the sum of the EMVs for each risk, which is $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000. Therefore, the total contingency budget that should be created is US$80,000.\n\nOther potential total contingency budgets could include US$120,000 or US$68,000.
