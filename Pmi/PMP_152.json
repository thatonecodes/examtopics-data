Evaluate the situation and identify ways to compress the schedule without impacting baselines.\n\nWhen a project experiences a schedule overrun on a specific activity or module, the project manager should first evaluate the situation to understand the root causes of the delay. It's essential to identify potential solutions to compress the schedule without altering the project baselines (scope, cost, and quality). This may involve adjusting resource allocation, optimizing task sequencing, or finding efficiencies in the remaining work to bring the project back on track. Submitting a change request or immediately resorting to overtime should be considered after a thorough evaluation of alternatives to avoid unnecessary impacts on the project."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"adingmaki","comment_id":"1046016","content":"D. \n\nIt's basically root cause analysis.","timestamp":"1729169880.0"},{"timestamp":"1727943120.0","poster":"Martinussantika","comment_id":"1023749","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer should be A, the situation already happening, so better to do evaluate it.\nTo look at scope creeps (answer D) is not to related directly on the action for situation","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
