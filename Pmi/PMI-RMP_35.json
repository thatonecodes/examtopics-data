An early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce the probability, a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact of a failure of the original component.
