Reevaluate the duration of the cycles, as faster cycles may allow for earlier detection of defects.\n\nReason: While shorter cycles can help in early detection of defects, they do not address the root cause of the increase in defects and change requests. The focus should be on improving communication and understanding with the client.\nB. Run a sprint to clear all reported defects before taking new stories.\n\nReason: Running a sprint solely to clear defects may provide a temporary fix but does not address the underlying issues causing the defects. It also disrupts the regular flow of delivering new features.\nC. Change the control mechanism so that items are better tested before delivery.\n\nReason: Improving testing mechanisms is important, but it may not fully resolve the issue if the defects and change requests are due to misalignment with client expectations. Ensuring a common understanding with the client is crucial."}]},{"poster":"ImGonnaPassIt","comment_id":"1129754","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1706025900.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThere are two problems to be addressed in this question:\n1. less defects\n2. less change requests\nDefect - Customer is not happy with the results, feature(s) not working as expected\nChange Request - features working as requested but the customer wants something more \nAnswer C, change the control mechanism may solve the first issue (defects) but will not decrease the number of change requests.\nI think it should be D, increased opportunities to confirm common understanding with the client should solve both problems.
