Project management plan\n\nThe project management plan serves as an input to prepare a cost management plan. The cost management plan is a subsidiary plan within the overall project management plan. It outlines how project costs will be estimated, budgeted, monitored, and controlled throughout the project's lifecycle. Therefore, the project management plan provides the foundational information and framework for creating the cost management plan."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe cost management plan is a subsidiary plan within the project management plan.

Progressive elaboration\n\nThe team is using the technique of \"progressive elaboration.\" Progressive elaboration is a project management technique that involves continuously refining and expanding project details and requirements as more information becomes available throughout the project's lifecycle.\n\nIn this scenario, the team initially created a prototype of the drone and sent it to the customer for testing. Based on the feedback received from the customer, the team used that information to refine and expand the project requirements. This iterative process of refining and expanding project details is an example of progressive elaboration, which is commonly used in agile and adaptive project management approaches to accommodate changing customer needs and project insights.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1098599"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704409020.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nPage 715, PMBOK 6th Edition\nThe iterative process of increasing the level of detail in a project management plan as greater amounts of information and more accurate estimates become available.\n\nRisks and costs are reduced when this is used.","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"943158"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":126,"timestamp":"2023-07-04 22:57:00","answer":"C"}],"exam":{"name":"CAPM","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":374,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Pmi","id":126},"currentPage":17},"__N_SSP":true}
