Decompose the program at a level sufficient to achieve control.\n\nThis principle emphasizes the importance of breaking down the program work into manageable components or sections to a level that allows for effective planning, monitoring, and control. The decomposition should be detailed enough to provide clear guidance and oversight for all aspects of the program, yet not so granular that it becomes unwieldy or overly complex. This balance is crucial for effective program management.","poster":"happykaur","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705205820.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the correct answer.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1100418","timestamp":"1702971480.0","poster":"hanyulin"},{"comment_id":"361840","content":"D +1 correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1621488120.0","poster":"tsangckl"},{"comment_id":"361182","upvote_count":"3","content":"D.
