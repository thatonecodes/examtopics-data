Have a high-level plan for incremental deliveries and get the customer's feedback as early as possible.\n\nBy adopting an incremental delivery approach and seeking customer feedback early in the process, the project manager can obtain valuable input to guide the development and ensure alignment with the customer's requirements. This iterative approach enables early detection and resolution of any misunderstandings, potential issues, or changes in priorities, reducing the risk of rework or delays later in the project.\n\nThis strategy capitalizes on the experienced project team, stakeholder support, and customer cooperation.
