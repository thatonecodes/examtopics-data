After a long pause, circumstances, priorities, or the economic environment might have changed. Examining the business case ensures that resuming the project is still viable and aligned with the new government’s strategic objectives before committing resources.\n\nWhy not C:\nStakeholder engagement is crucial but should occur after confirming the project’s business case to avoid unnecessary stakeholder discussions for a project that may no longer be viable.","comment_id":"1336792","poster":"Schwery"},{"timestamp":"1728723000.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"victory108","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Call for a team meeting to identify the root cause for the declining performance.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBefore taking any corrective actions or making changes to the project, the new project manager must first understand the root cause of the team’s declining performance. A team meeting will allow the project manager to gather input directly from the team, understand their challenges, and identify issues affecting performance. Without this information, any corrective action might not address the real problem.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n • A.
