Suggest pair programming during the retrospective.\n\nIf an inexperienced software engineer is identified as the source of reduced velocity, one effective way to address this issue is by suggesting pair programming during the retrospective. Pair programming involves two developers working together at a single workstation, with one writing code and the other reviewing it in real-time. This practice can help the less experienced engineer learn from their more experienced colleagues, build skills, and contribute more effectively to the team's velocity.","timestamp":"1692597540.0","poster":"hankun","comment_id":"986241","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"933125","poster":"fletcher_ng","content":"What the team need to do are two things:\n1.
