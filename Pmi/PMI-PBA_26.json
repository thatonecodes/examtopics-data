Explain the value of requirements traceability.\n\nThe business analyst should educate the project sponsor on the importance and benefits of requirements traceability. Traceability artifacts can help ensure that all requirements are addressed and implemented correctly, reducing the risk of scope creep and rework. Additionally, they provide a record of decisions and changes made throughout the project, making it easier to manage and maintain the project in the long term. The business analyst should also suggest alternative solutions to shorten the timeline, such as reducing the scope or increasing the resources."}],"exam_id":128,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/102990-exam-pmi-pba-topic-1-question-71-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"bjp7FjUq8FRwsm3FM9ig","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Compare reported defects with user acceptance test results.\n\nExplanation:\nBefore escalating or taking further steps, it's essential to validate the reported defects against the user acceptance test (UAT) results. This ensures the reported issues were not already addressed or accepted as part of the agreed solution during UAT.\nThis step helps identify whether the defects are new, previously known but accepted by the customer, or overlooked during the UAT phase.\nIf gaps are identified after this comparison, further actions like involving end users (option D) or escalating (option A) can be considered appropriately.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ChrisG1454"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

The Five Whys technique involves asking \"why\" questions to identify the root cause of a problem.
