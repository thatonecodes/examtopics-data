It does not have to be assigned to a specific date, but is usually assigned to the completion of project phases. A milestone is the end of a stage that marks the completion of a work package or phase, typically marked by a high level event such as completion, endorsement or signing of a deliverable, document or a high level review meeting. In addition to signaling the completion of a key deliverable, a milestone may also signify an important decision or the derivation of a critical piece of information, which outlines or affects the future of a project. In this sense, a milestone not only signifies distance traveled (key stages in a project) but also indicates direction of travel since key decisions made at milestones may alter the route through the project plan. To create a milestone, enter 0 (zero) in the Duration field. The task will automatically be classified as a milestone.\nIncorrect Answers:\nB: A project goal is an objective for time, cost, scope, and other metrics.\nC: This is a project constraint.\nD: All activities must be completed in order to complete the project work.

In this instance, it is $938,260-$1,055,543 = -$117,282. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance on a project. The variance notifies that the schedule is ahead or behind what was planned for this period in time. The schedule variance is calculated based on the following formula: SV = Earned Value (EV) - Planned Value (PV) If the resulting schedule is negative, it indicates that the project is behind schedule. A value greater than 0 shows that the project is ahead of the planned schedule. A value of 0 indicates that the project is right on target.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: This is the variance at completion.\nC: This is the inverse of the earned value.\nD: This is the cost variance for the project.","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"exam_id":130,"answer":"B","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Amz66","content":"EV is 40% of total, so 938k","timestamp":"1674138300.0","comment_id":"633540"},{"timestamp":"1582814760.0","poster":"Mopar","comment_id":"8548","content":"Shouldn't the earned value be $950,000?","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"content":"$960,000 is the Actual Cost (AC).

Constructability analysis is a process that starts in the initial planning phases and persists all over the entire planning cycle and into the implementation phase of the project. Constructability analysis during the planning process examines the methods and cost of installed equipment and materials, technology, site conditions, resources, and related infrastructure. The benefit of constructability analysis is to reduce both the time and cost of a project. Constructability analysis is repeatedly performed throughout the life-cycle of a project in order to optimize cost, plan, and schedule while mitigating risk. It is a very important process that needs to be performed early in planning to allow alternatives to be considered and integrated into the design.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: This comes under the quality assurance phase.","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1566911640,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/pmi/view/4196-exam-pmi-sp-topic-1-question-81-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer":"BCD","exam_id":130,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2019-08-27 15:14:00"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":70,"provider":"Pmi","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"id":130,"isBeta":false,"name":"PMI-SP"},"currentPage":6},"__N_SSP":true}
