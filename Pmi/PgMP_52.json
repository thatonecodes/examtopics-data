When acceptance criteria of the project are met.\n\nApproval of project closure should be based on whether the project has met its predefined acceptance criteria. These criteria are usually established at the beginning of the project and are designed to define what constitutes successful completion of the project. Meeting the acceptance criteria ensures that the project has achieved its objectives, even if the full benefits of the project might only be realized later in the context of the overall program. This focus on acceptance criteria allows for a clear and objective measure to decide on project closure.","timestamp":"1720999980.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1719032940.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSorry, D is the right answer.

When acceptance criteria of the project are met.\n\nThe closure of a component project should be approved by the program manager when the project's acceptance criteria are met. These criteria are predefined measures or conditions that determine when the project's outputs are completed to a satisfactory level. It's important to note that project deliverables can be completed, but they still need to meet the agreed-upon acceptance criteria to ensure they align with the required standards and specifications. Approval upon meeting these criteria ensures that the project has fulfilled its objectives and its outcomes are of the expected quality.","comment_id":"1102859","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1718334540.0","poster":"hanyulin","comment_id":"1096043","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the right answer."},{"comment_id":"1068712","poster":"ekk1983","upvote_count":"1","content":"I think A is the Answer","timestamp":"1715527560.0"},{"comment_id":"764345","content":"No need to wait until Program deliverables are complete to close a component project, probably A","upvote_count":"1","poster":"NawrasHamwi","timestamp":"1688367600.0"},{"content":"I picked A","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Salim_7","comment_id":"728777","timestamp":"1685240820.0"}],"choices":{"B":"When the project has delivered the project benefits","A":"When acceptance criteria of the project are met","D":"When project deliverables are complete","C":"When program deliverables are complete"},"answers_community":["A (75%)","D (25%)"],"answer":"A","isMC":true,"exam_id":132,"question_id":256,"unix_timestamp":1669609620},{"id":"QsmtyHX998aL6uV7X5zQ","isMC":true,"question_text":"A company is evaluating the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software.

Identification and documentation of the initial risks for ERP software implementation.\n\nIn the context of the program business case as described in the document, after performing an analysis to confirm the program's feasibility, the next important step the program manager should complete is the identification and documentation of the initial risks for ERP software implementation. This is crucial as it aligns with the need to address potential high-level risk and opportunities assessment, key assumptions, business and operational impact, cost-benefit analysis, alternative solutions, and other factors that could influence the program's success. Understanding and planning for these risks early on is essential for developing a robust business case that justifies the program and outlines how potential risks will be managed throughout the program's lifecycle.","poster":"[Removed]"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nBusiness case includes High level Risk.","comment_id":"1106206","timestamp":"1719411600.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1096925","timestamp":"1718403480.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the best answer","poster":"hanyulin"}],"answers_community":["C (80%)","B (20%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":132},{"id":"fP2GLoAhl5EB9JbP1iwU","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A new component project is approved by the program governance board.

It involves setting aside resources (such as time, money, or manpower) to address potential risks that may materialize during the course of the project. This reserve acts as a buffer to manage risks that were not completely eliminated or mitigated during the risk planning phase.","poster":"happykaur"}]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Pmi","isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":311,"id":132,"name":"PgMP","isBeta":false},"currentPage":52},"__N_SSP":true}
