The team needs to acknowledge the risk, assess its impact, and decide on a response.\nArchitectural Spike: An architectural spike is a short, focused effort to investigate and validate a technical approach. In this case, a spike would help the team understand the integration challenges and explore potential solutions.\nPrioritization: The spike should be prioritized on the product backlog to ensure it's addressed promptly.

Conduct an architectural spike immediately to decide how the functionality will be determined: While a spike is necessary, it shouldn't be done immediately without considering the risk and its impact.\nB.
