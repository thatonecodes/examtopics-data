True.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nWhen you create a custom tab for an object in Salesforce, you can designate that tab as the \"Landing Tab\". The landing tab is the first tab that users see when they navigate to the object. This is particularly useful when you want to provide users with a focused experience by having a specific tab appear first when they access a certain section of Salesforce.\n\nYou can specify which tab should be the landing tab for a given object during the process of creating or modifying the tab in Salesforce.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Priyanka1994","comment_id":"1351349"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. False\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Salesforce, you cannot directly set a tab as a “Landing Tab” while creating it for an object. The landing tab is determined by the Default Tab setting in the app configuration or the user’s last active tab (depending on their session). To make a specific tab the landing tab for an app:\n 1. Navigate to the App Manager.\n 2. Edit the app settings and set the desired tab as the Default Tab for that app.\n\nWhile creating the tab itself, there is no option to designate it as a landing tab.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1323845","timestamp":"1733713620.0","poster":"jeet992014"},{"poster":"MonBouj","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.networks_landing_tab.htm&type=5","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"928817","timestamp":"1718918580.0"},{"timestamp":"1702816320.0","comment_id":"748046","poster":"Plkt","content":"Selected Answer: A\nou can choose \"Default landing tab\" in App manager.
