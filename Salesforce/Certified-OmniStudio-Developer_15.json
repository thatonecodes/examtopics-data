Pre and Post DataRaptor transforms, and large attachments are not supported. When Invoke Mode is set to non-blocking, elements using default values will not receive the response because the element loads before the response returns. To map the response to an element, you must set Response JSON Node to VlocityNoRootNode and Response JSON Path to the name of the element.\n\nFire and Forget\n\nAn Invoke Mode option, Fire and Forget runs the action asynchronously with no callback to the UI. Pre and Post DataRaptor transforms, and large attachments are not supported. A response appears in the debug console but is not applied to the Data JSON.","poster":"studyvikram"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe feature that the developer should enable is B. Invoke Mode Fire and Forget.\n\nEnabling the Invoke Mode Fire and Forget feature in an Integration Procedure Action means that the OmniScript does not wait for a response from the Integration Procedure before proceeding to the next element. This is useful when the response is not needed immediately, or when the response time is expected to be long and the user should not be made to wait.\n\nOption A (Invoke Mode Non-Blocking) means that the OmniScript continues execution while waiting for the Integration Procedure to return a response, but the response is still required before the next element can be executed.\n\nOption C (Toast Completion) is used to display a toast message when the Integration Procedure Action completes. This is not related to the response mode.\n\nOption D (Use Future) is used when invoking Apex code that may exceed the Apex governor limits. This is not related to the response mode.","comment_id":"883042","poster":"ppremy","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698439440.0"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"A developer is configuring an Integration Procedure Action in an OmniScript.
