Territory Management allows you to define territories based on account criteria (e.g., industry, location, size) and automatically share records within those territories with specific users or groups.

The ability to use account criteria to expand a private sharing model: With Territory Management, account records can be automatically assigned to territories based on specified criteria, such as geographic location or industry.

Support for complex and frequently changed sales organization structures: Territory Management allows for the creation of complex territory structures to support a variety of sales organization structures, including those that frequently change. Territories can be defined by geography, product line, industry, or other criteria, and can be nested within each other to create a hierarchy.","comment_id":"854421"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC & D I think","comment_id":"825852","poster":"DavidHolland","timestamp":"1677675900.0"},{"poster":"KTomov","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"750634","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nAnswer is S, D","timestamp":"1671523620.0"},{"comment_id":"737346","poster":"SC22MarkTopics","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nThink this is CD also","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1670376420.0"},{"comment_id":"594682","timestamp":"1651263540.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nJust voting","poster":"Ktoto_Leviy"},{"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1634607960.0","poster":"esj275","comment_id":"464373","content":"C&D....
