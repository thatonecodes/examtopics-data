If the question stated \"Highest performance\" or \"Least Network calls ..\" then the answer would be different ( May be Composite APIs).\nComposite Batch APIs ( /composite/batch) - is out of the box feature to send multiple ( upto only 25 records in one single call) while Standard API can make 1 record in 1 call. However it takes some more development effort ( if not much , but more than for standard apis) to formatt the aggregated request and handle the failures ( especially what do you do when one or two records out of 25 requested fail ?
