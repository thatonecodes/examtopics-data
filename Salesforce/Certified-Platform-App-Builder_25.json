For example, when you configure an action that lets users create opportunities, set Prospecting as the predefined value for the Stage field. All new opportunities users create through that action are automatically assigned to the prospecting stage. You can remove the Stage field from the action’s layout, because the field is going to be assigned a value automatically. If you set predefined values for fields on object records created through an action, you don’t need to add those fields to the action layout. \"C\" is not correct.","poster":"nsharma"},{"content":"B and D are correct - \ncreate actions respect validation rules and field requiredness, and you can choose each action’s fields.\n\nWhen you create actions, use predefined field values to set a value for a field.
