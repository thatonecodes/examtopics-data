Run deployment validations on the change set in the sandbox prior to uploading to production.\nC. Add permissions and access settings to outbound change sets in addition to the dependent component list.\n\n\nYes, that is also a valid practice for ensuring a successful deployment. Cloning a change set can be helpful if the administrator realizes they forgot to include a necessary component or dependency in the original change set. They can clone the change set, add the missing components, and upload it to production. However, it's important to note that cloning a change set can sometimes introduce errors, so it should be used with caution.","timestamp":"1727554260.0","comment_id":"853665","comments":[{"timestamp":"1727729880.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"857425","content":"The answer is CD","poster":"tMana"}],"poster":"tMana","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"id":"KX8mFPRaUmaWv31ohh7L","question_text":"Users at AW Computing are receiving a duplicate message when they enter contacts with common first and last names.
