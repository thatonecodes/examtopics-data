Using too many explanatory variables can result in an overly complex predictive model that captures the noise in your data. To mitigate overfitting, Einstein Discovery uses ridge regression and regularization. \n\nYou will receive a warning, but can still continue executing your build story. \n\nhttps://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.bi_edd_glossary.htm&type=5","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"675368","timestamp":"1679425740.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"667987","poster":"snusmumrick","timestamp":"1678716780.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect!\nhttps://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.bi_edd_prep_data_issues.htm&type=5#:~:text=of%20collinear%20variables.-,Collinearity,-occurs%20when%20two"}],"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"When creating a story in Einstein Discovery, a client is wondering if all potential collinear fields need to be removed before executing the build story.\nWhat would accurately answer the client's question?"},{"id":"0DH4gLJltd7CP2Tx6DmB","topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/82768-exam-certified-tableau-crm-and-einstein-discovery-consultant/","unix_timestamp":1663576440,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-09-19 10:34:00","choices":{"A":"Use a permission set license with two different levels of access.","D":"Grant \"Manage\" access permission to the apps.","B":"Create a permission set license assignment with two different levels of access.","C":"Create two permission sets with different system permissions."},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1679426760.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the correct answer, as they already have the correct license (no need for a permission set license, excluding alternatives A and B).
