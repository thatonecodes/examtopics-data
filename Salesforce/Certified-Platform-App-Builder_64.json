Process Builder\nC. Flow\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo display the number of open cases on the account page, an app builder can use Process Builder and Flow in combination. Here's a possible approach:\n\nProcess Builder (Option B): Create a Process Builder that triggers when a case is created or updated. Configure the process to update a field on the account (e.g., a custom field called \"Open Cases Count\").\n\nFlow (Option C): Create a Flow that is triggered by the update of the \"Open Cases Count\" field on the account. Use the Flow to query and aggregate the number of open cases related to the account and its parent account. Then, display this information on the account page.\n\nBy combining Process Builder to update a field and Flow to perform more complex calculations, you can achieve the desired result of displaying the number of open cases on the account page.
