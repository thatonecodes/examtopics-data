For Opportunities, it typically means when the Opportunity is closed (IsClosed= true), so we do not need isClosed = false. You may also consider filtering for a specific segment of your data as insights that drive faster sales for your enterprise customers may be completely different from your small business customers. \n\nWe are not using StageName, because this field designates the sales process stage. Since we are training when IsWon=true, the model will only know the stage “Closed Won”. When it sees stages like “Qualification”, for example, the model won’t know what to do with that value and consider it out of bounds for the model.\n\nhttps://www.salesforceblogger.com/2020/03/11/preparing-your-data-for-einstein-discovery/","comment_id":"675320","timestamp":"1679423160.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1677007980.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Question was on exam 21 August 2022.","poster":"snusmumrick","comment_id":"649847"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/78142-exam-certified-tableau-crm-and-einstein-discovery-consultant/","question_id":22,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"AB","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["AB (50%)","BC (40%)","10%"]},{"id":"sLpxrN6xR1kKpKaPruNu","question_id":23,"choices":{"B":"Start over again with new dataflows that exclude unused fields with a filter to extract relevant data.","C":"Update the existing data sync (replication) process by removing unused fields with a filter to extract relevant data.","A":"Modify dataflows to exclude unused fields and include a filter to extract relevant data.","D":"Scale down the number of datasets to help improve data sync (replication) performance."},"unix_timestamp":1664278680,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-09-27 13:38:00","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04097/0001800001.png"],"exam_id":227,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/83778-exam-certified-tableau-crm-and-einstein-discovery-consultant/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1097002","upvote_count":"1","content":"C is the best option here.","poster":"RMEZZA","timestamp":"1718411880.0"},{"timestamp":"1690217100.0","comment_id":"786814","content":"C. \nA and B don’t even talk about data sync and D is just silly.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"facemelter2000"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"MonBouj","timestamp":"1679917080.0","comment_id":"680699","content":"C\nUpdate the existing data sync (replication) process by removing unused fields with a filter to extract relevant data."}],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.bi_integrate_replication.htm&type=5","question_text":"A Tableau CRM consultant is notified of a performance issue with data sync (replication).
