Lookup\n\nA lookup relationship allows one object to link to another object by referencing the ID of the related object. In this scenario, the Line Item object would have a lookup field that references the Order object. By using a lookup relationship, the financial representatives can be granted access to the Order object but not the Line Item object, since they do not have access to the related objects in a lookup relationship. This allows them to see the Order amount without seeing the details of the individual Line Items.\n\nDirect and indirect lookups are not actual relationship types in Salesforce, but rather terms used to describe the depth of relationships between objects. A master-detail relationship is not appropriate in this scenario because a master-detail relationship requires sharing settings to be set at the master level, which would give access to both the Order and Line Item objects to financial representatives.","timestamp":"1709058000.0","poster":"tMana"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"AnanandmaniRathor","content":"It has to be Look-up as child inherit security settings similar to parent in M-D relationship.","comment_id":"717854","timestamp":"1699954680.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nYou can't use master-detail if you're planning to hide the child record.","poster":"ApexMike","comment_id":"683993","timestamp":"1696137480.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/60763-exam-crt-450-topic-1-question-193-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Master-Detail","B":"Indirect Lookup","A":"Direct Lookup","D":"Lookup"},"timestamp":"2021-08-26 15:45:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (67%)","C (33%)"],"question_text":"Universal Containers stores Orders and Line Items in Salesforce.
