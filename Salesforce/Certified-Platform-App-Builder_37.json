This means that if a workflow rule or process updates a field, it may not trigger the validation rule associated with that field, even though, technically, validation rules come before workflow rules in the order of execution. for this reason the field will be updated an there will not be an error message, but the validation will fire if you manually try to update the record that has been updated before by the workflow rule because they are designed to run every time a record is saved.","timestamp":"1697805480.0"},{"timestamp":"1686571560.0","poster":"deedeed","content":"The answer is A.
