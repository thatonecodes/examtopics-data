The new version of the FlexCard will be used in a new Console, and the current version of the FlexCard should remain unchanged.\n\nVersioning the FlexCard allows the developer to create a new version of the card while keeping the current version intact. This is useful in cases where the new version of the card needs to be used in a new context or scenario, while still allowing the current version to be used in its existing context without changes. In this case, the fact that the new version will be used in a new console and the current version should remain unchanged is the key factor that would lead the developer to version the FlexCard rather than cloning it.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ppremy","timestamp":"1682624760.0"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","exam_id":221,"answer":"C","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","question_id":46,"timestamp":"2023-04-27 21:46:00","question_text":"A developer needs to change some field labels on a FlexCard.

This will create a \"Cancel\" button in each step of the form, allowing the user to cancel the intake at any time. Option B, adding a Navigate Action and setting the Element Name to \"Cancel\", would create a link or button with the label \"Cancel\" that would navigate to a different element in the same step, not allowing the user to cancel the entire intake. Option A, checking the Enable Cancel checkbox in the Setup tab, would enable a global cancel button for the entire form, but this may not be desirable if the user needs to cancel only the current step. Option D, adding a Navigate Action outside each step and setting the Element Name to \"Cancel\", would create a global \"Cancel\" button that would cancel the entire form, not just the current step.","timestamp":"1682625180.0","poster":"ppremy","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"883002"}],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1682625180,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Add a Navigate Action inside each step and set the Component Name to \"Cancel\".","D":"Add a Navigate Action outside each step and set the Element Name to \"Cancel\".","A":"Check the Enable Cancel checkbox in the Setup tab under Cancel Options.","B":"Add a Navigate Action inside each step and set the Element Name to \"Cancel\"."}},{"id":"oFdWZBLhVbHYK8TmEjRg","question_id":48,"answer_ET":"BD","question_text":"When launching an OmniScript from an action on a FlexCard, the OmniScript displays, but no Salesforce data is populated.\nWhich two errors could cause this behavior?

In the DataRaptor Extract Action, the Input Parameters Filter Value is misspelled.\nC. There is no active version of the DataRaptor Extract.\n\nThese are the two possible reasons why Salesforce data is not being populated when launching an OmniScript from an action on a FlexCard. If the Input Parameters Filter Value is misspelled, the query to retrieve Salesforce data may not work as intended.

Set the Timeout property on the HTTP Action in the Integration Procedure\nC.

A Remote action with timeout settings can also be used to prevent the OmniScript from waiting indefinitely for the Integration Procedure to complete.
