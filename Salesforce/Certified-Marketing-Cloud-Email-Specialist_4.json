Purchasing subscriber lists from third-party sources is generally not recommended as it may lead to low engagement and deliverability issues, and it can also be against anti-spam laws in many regions. Emailing unsubscribed customers to ask them to opt-in again can also be seen as unsolicited and may lead to compliance issues.

Query Activity: This allows you to use SQL queries to segment and manipulate data.
