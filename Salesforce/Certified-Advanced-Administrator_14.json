When MFA is enabled, the session security level must be set to \"High Assurance\" to ensure that users are prompted for MFA verification during login. If the session security level is set to a lower level, such as \"Standard,\" users will not be prompted for MFA verification and may not be able to log in.\n\nOption A, changing MFA to High Assurance, may be a possible solution if the session security level is already set to High Assurance, but would not be the best first step in troubleshooting the issue."}],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"An administrator recently implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) with a standard security level selected.
