This is because Lightning web components can use JavaScript and HTML to handle errors from various sources, such as Lightning Data Service, Apex methods, or child components(1). The developer can use the errorCallback() lifecycle hook to catch errors in the component or its children, and use the lightning-formatted-rich-text element to display the error message in a user-friendly way.\n\n1: https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2020/08/error-handling-best-practices-for-lightning-web-components\n\nB is not correct, because this option assumes that the error is caused by a DML statement in an Apex method. However, the question does not specify what the button does or what kind of error occurs. Moreover, a try-catch block in Apex would only handle the error on the server side, but not display it on the client side.","poster":"moitam","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1000544","timestamp":"1725621780.0"}]}],"exam":{"id":223,"numberOfQuestions":281,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Salesforce","name":"Certified Platform Developer II","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":37},"__N_SSP":true}
