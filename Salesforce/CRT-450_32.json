Execute a batch Apex class to update all contacts\n\nUse anonymous Apex to temporarily execute code that is not stored in your organization. When a large amount of data needs to be updated at one time, such as all contacts, batch Apex can be used to handle large amounts of data operations. Anonymous Apex can trigger batch processing immediately, which is useful for large and irregular updates.\n\nC. Remove 15,000 inactive accounts in one transaction after deployment\n\nAnonymous Apex is ideal for large-scale data manipulation in special situations, such as deleting a large number of accounts. The anonymous Apex execution method allows developers to perform these operations in a single transaction, ensuring that data changes are completed in one go.","comment_id":"1288623","timestamp":"1727185380.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Ke_James0302"},{"poster":"Ke_James0302","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA,C is true","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727185320.0","comment_id":"1288622"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"AC","timestamp":"2024-09-24 15:42:00","isMC":true},{"id":"VF6Nb1ZvpdLrmrM30ir0","choices":{"D":"aura:flow","B":"aura-flow","C":"lightning:flow","A":"lightning-flow"},"exam_id":209,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_text":"A Salesforce Administrator used Flow Builder to create a flow named \"accountOnboarding\".
