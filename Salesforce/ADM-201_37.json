A company can use the standard forecasting option even if they opt to use Custom Fiscal Years.\n\nFiscal years are the accounting period used by a company to record and report financial information. Standard fiscal years follow the calendar year (January 1 to December 31), but companies can also use Custom Fiscal Years that start and end on any date.\n\nForecasting is the process of making predictions about future events or trends based on data and analysis. Standard forecasting is a feature of some software applications that allows users to generate predictions about future events or trends based on historical data. Standard forecasting typically uses a standard time period, such as a calendar year or a fiscal year, as the basis for the predictions.","comment_id":"751701","timestamp":"1671582240.0","poster":"Proctored_Expert"}],"exam_id":208,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/1044-exam-adm-201-topic-1-question-2-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_id":185}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"id":208,"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Salesforce","numberOfQuestions":605,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"name":"ADM-201"},"currentPage":37},"__N_SSP":true}
