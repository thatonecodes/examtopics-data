It would allow for filtering within each widget, but not between them.\n\nOption B, using \"Connect Data Sources\" to create a mapping of the two fields from the two datasets, would not provide the desired interactivity either. This feature allows you to blend datasets, but it does not allow for interactivity between widgets.\n\nOption D, using a results-based interaction and applying it to the query of \"Step_pie_3,\" would allow for filtering the pie chart based on the selection in the list widget, but it would not allow for filtering the list widget based on the pie chart selection.","comment_id":"821689","poster":"BilJon","timestamp":"1692976200.0"},{"comment_id":"727515","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB indeed.\n\nI did some extensive testing in my dev org.\nIt should be noted that a \"selection interaction\" would work too, but Connect Data Source should be prefered when possible.\nHere the statement specifies that the 2 datasets have the SAME dimension (=Type), so it is possible to use \"Connect Data Source\".\nMulti-selection is compatible with this method.

Therefore, it is the most appropriate option for adding new data to an existing dataset, which is what is required in this case.\n\nUsing \"Overwrite\" would replace the entire dataset with the new target data, which is not desirable as it would delete all the previous data. \"Join\" is used to combine two datasets based on a common field, but in this case, there is only one dataset being uploaded. \"Update\" is used to modify existing records in a dataset, but in this case, new records are being added to the dataset, so \"Update\" is not the correct option.","timestamp":"1692976620.0","poster":"BilJon"},{"comment_id":"783920","poster":"Ban09790","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.
