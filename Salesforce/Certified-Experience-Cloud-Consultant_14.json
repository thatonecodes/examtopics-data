Create branding sets, audience targeting, and navigation menu targeting.\n\nBy creating branding sets, each partner can have a branded experience with their colors and logo. Audience targeting allows for specific components or pages to be displayed based on the user's profile or criteria. In this case, Gold and Silver partners can be targeted to have access to the Leads Inbox component, while Bronze partners can be excluded. Navigation menu targeting enables different navigation menus to be displayed based on the user's profile or criteria, ensuring that Bronze partners do not have access to the Leads tab.
