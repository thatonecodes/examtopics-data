Pipeline reports may be overridden.\n\nThis statement is false. Pipeline reports cannot be overridden. The pipeline is a snapshot of opportunities at a particular point in time, and cannot be changed once it has been generated.

True, searches and filters that take a long time may be cancelled in Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce provides a feature called \"Search Timeout\" to cancel long-running searches and filters to prevent overloading the system resources. When a user performs a search or filter, Salesforce sets a time limit on the operation. If the search or filter operation takes longer than the time limit, Salesforce cancels the operation and displays a message to the user indicating that the search or filter could not be completed.\n\nThe search timeout limit can be customized by Salesforce administrators to balance system performance and user experience. The default search timeout limit in Salesforce is 120 seconds, but it can be increased or decreased depending on the organization's needs"},{"poster":"JohnyWalker99","content":"Not sure if A is the right answer.
