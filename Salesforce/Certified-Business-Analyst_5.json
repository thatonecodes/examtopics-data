They should be clear, specific and expressed in a simple language. The Definition Of Done is a shared agreement among team members on the criteria that must be met in order for a user story or product increment to be considered complete. It defines the minimum set of standards and requirements that must be met for the work to be considered done and ready for release to the customer or end user. \n\nBoth A and B in my opinion is acceptance criteria?
