A business owner might own more than one company or a consultant might work on behalf of multiple organizations.

This is the account that appears in Account Name and is usually the company the contact is most closely associated with. Any other accounts associated with the contact represent indirect relationships. The Related Contacts list lets you view current and past relationships, and capture unique and custom details about these relationships so you always know who you’re talking to—or who you should be talking to.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1725273720.0"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":208,"choices":{"B":"Has to be associated with an Account","D":"One Account can have multiple Contacts","C":"One contact can belong to multiple Accounts","A":"Can be associated with an Account"},"topic":"1","isMC":true},{"id":"sSN7OO6aekJogtFJfrbK","unix_timestamp":1607249880,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"The _______ determines if a user can read, create and edit Contact records, the __________ determines if he can see/edit contact records owned by his subordinates.","question_id":490,"choices":{"C":"Sharing rules, Role Hierarchy","D":"Profile, Role","B":"OWD, Sharing rules","A":"Role, Profile"},"exam_id":208,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1217610","poster":"davelivi","timestamp":"1716562020.0","content":"should be C","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Can someone pls explain.
