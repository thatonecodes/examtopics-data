They provide a bridge between custom code and declarative automation. Administrators can invoke these actions in Flows without needing to understand the underlying code. This approach allows for more complex logic to be created by a developer initially but easily maintained and leveraged by an admin.","poster":"ca7d262"},{"comment_id":"1197693","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nMaintained by an Admin: A, D.","timestamp":"1713415500.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"83f117f"},{"timestamp":"1709193060.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"A and C is correct as Invocable Actions allow you to define custom actions that can be invoked from other processes, such as processes created in Process Builder, providing a way to encapsulate business logic that can be reused across the application without the need for custom code.","poster":"MugheesKhan","comment_id":"1162309"},{"timestamp":"1702654380.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"AD is the correct answer.","poster":"Carol3","comment_id":"1097454"},{"content":"It must be A and D.

For API version of 44.0 or higher, you must mark the Apex method as storable (cacheable) and you can get rid of any setStorable() calls in JavaScript code. The Apex annotation approach is better because it centralizes your caching notation for a method in the Apex class. https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/controllers_server_apex_auraenabled_annotation.htm"},{"comment_id":"935189","content":"Selected Answer: D\nif we are talking about Apex classes then it is D.
