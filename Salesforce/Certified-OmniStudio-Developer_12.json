It allows developers to call external systems such as Salesforce or AWS, and pass data to them as input parameters. It can also receive responses from those systems and process them accordingly.\n\nIn this case, the developer needs to save data to both Salesforce and an AWS Order Management system. The Integration Procedure Action can be configured to call both systems and pass the data to them. The action can then wait for the responses from the systems and process them accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
