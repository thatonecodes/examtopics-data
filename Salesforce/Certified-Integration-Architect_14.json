When subscribing to the Salesforce Event Bus, using a ReplayID with a value of -1 will only allow you to see new events. This means that any events that were published before the subscription was established will not be seen.\n\nIn the context of the question, where the requirement is to see all stages of order processing within the retention window, using a ReplayID with a value of -2 (as in Option B) would be more appropriate. This is because a ReplayID of -2 allows you to replay all events from the last 72 hours, which would include both old and new events.\n\nHowever, if the requirement was only to see new events from the point of subscription onwards, then Option C would be a correct choice.","poster":"JLee1","timestamp":"1731749880.0","comment_id":"1072304"}],"answers_community":["BD (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1700127480,"answer":"BD","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":76,"id":217,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"Certified Integration Architect","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Salesforce"},"currentPage":14},"__N_SSP":true}
