The question does not mention an automatic record deletion. It simply requires that a Sales Rep wants permission to delete a record. And in fact, if it were my Users, I would want them to wait for the approval and then simple delete the record. So, a 2-stepApproval Process is the best practice. In the Two-step Approval Process, the sales rep initiates the deletion request, which then proceeds through two approval steps. The first step involves the sales rep's approval, and the second step involves the manager's approval. The process ensures that the manager grants permission before the Opportunity can be deleted.\n\nBy utilizing a Two-step Approval Process, Universal Containers can enforce the requirement of obtaining permission from managers before deleting Opportunities. This approach provides a structured and auditable workflow, ensuring appropriate oversight and control over Opportunity deletions.","timestamp":"1705273380.0","upvote_count":"7"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ExamTube","content":"Right answer is A.
