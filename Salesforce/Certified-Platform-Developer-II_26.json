A part of the requirement to override a button with a lightning component is that the lightning page must be adjusted to not point at the standard layout. Lightning component and lightning pages go hand in hand. Otherwise, a LWC can be written to override a button but it is not required to be adjusted on the lightning page, although this could also happen.","poster":"Sapphire808","timestamp":"1727197140.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Duplicate question, ans is D","poster":"AppleDash","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1708959120.0","comment_id":"822554"}],"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1677423120,"choices":{"A":"Override the edit button for both Lightning and Classic with a Lightning Component","D":"Override the edit button for Lightning with a Lightning Component, and for Classic, override the edit button with a Visualforce page that contains the Lightning Component","C":"Override the edit button for Lightning with a Lightning Page, and for Classic, override the edit button with a Visualforce page that contains the Lightning Component","B":"Override the edit button for both Lightning and Classic with a new Visualforce page"},"answer_images":[]},{"id":"WOp0farLdFGMMzk1nmj3","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/certified-platform-developer-ii/image16.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/124613-exam-certified-platform-developer-ii-topic-1-question-275/","timestamp":"2023-10-25 12:42:00","exam_id":223,"question_text":"A developer creates a Lightning web component to allow a Contact to be quickly entered.
