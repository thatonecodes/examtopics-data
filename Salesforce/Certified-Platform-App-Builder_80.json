The action is that we need to make a callout to a webservice.\n\nAt this point, we know it's a Record-Triggered Flow. To determine if it is a before- or after-save flow is to determine whether or not we are \"updating the triggering record’s field values\" or not. Since we are not (only making a callout), we know we can't use a before-save flow.

It provides the ability to define criteria and actions to be performed based on specific events, such as record changes. In this case, when the inventory of a shoe is reduced due to an order being activated, Process Builder can be used to trigger the communication with the CK web service. After-Save Record-Triggered flow: While a flow can be used to automate processes, the After-Save Record-Triggered flow is not the most suitable option in this scenario. It executes after the record has been saved, which means the web service call would occur after the inventory change has already taken place.","poster":"BorisBoris","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"831664","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA!!!
