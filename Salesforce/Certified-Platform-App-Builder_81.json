Create an SC sharing rule and a corresponding public group.\nHere's why the other options are less suitable:\nB. Give the SC a permission set with the Modify All Data system permission: This option is too broad and overrides the private model, granting the SC access to all records in the org, which could pose security and privacy risks.\nC.
