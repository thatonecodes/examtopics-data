Even in a private sharing model, any user, regardless of location, may be able to see if added to an account team. It opens access, but doesn't limit.\n\nA. is incorrect because solely configuring organization-wide defaults and creating sharing rules might not ensure that only branch managers and branch staff see customers and related information in their geographic location.
