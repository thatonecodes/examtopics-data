The docs for workflow rules provides 3 different evaluation criteria: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.workflow_rules_define.htm&type=5\nBut the question says that the workflow rule is configured on create and update fields events with the latter type of event configured to not fire the workflow rule a second time. So according to options on the docs, the workflow rule in reality it's configured to fire only on creation.\nThe order of execution, https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers_order_of_execution.htm, gives priority to triggers and then to workflow rules. In this case the first event is a record creation event so the trigger won't run since it's a before update trigger. So, workflow rule runs the first time on creation incrementing the field value to 1. This fires an update event that causes the before trigger to run hence incrementing the field value to 2. The workflow rule though ignores this update event, so the final field value remains 2.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"973590"},{"poster":"BeatrizBernardo","timestamp":"1703177760.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"929649","comments":[{"comment_id":"973572","upvote_count":"3","content":"It's a before update trigger so the first time won't run since it's a record creation event.","poster":"gsori","timestamp":"1707207900.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think the correct answer is 3.
