However, it doesn’t address the issue of duplicate records already existing in the system.\n\nOn the other hand, option D, “Implement a de-dupe solution and establish account ownership in Salesforce,” directly addresses the problem of duplicate records. It suggests implementing a solution to identify and merge duplicates, and establishing clear ownership rules for accounts to prevent future duplicates.\n\nTherefore, while both options could be part of a comprehensive solution, option D is more directly aligned with resolving the complaints of the sales team.
