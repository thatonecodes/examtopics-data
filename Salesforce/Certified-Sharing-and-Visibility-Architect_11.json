Put the auditors at the highest level of the Role Hierarchy\n\nThis option involves leveraging the Role Hierarchy, where roles are organized in a hierarchical structure. Users higher up in the hierarchy have access to records owned by users below them in the hierarchy. Placing the auditors at the highest level of the Role Hierarchy could potentially grant them access to all opportunities, assuming the OWD (Organization-Wide Defaults) settings are appropriately configured. This approach offers a more scalable and manageable solution compared to manual sharing or mixing roles on the Opportunity Team.","comment_id":"1194545","timestamp":"1728767760.0"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Put the auditors at the highest level of the Role Hierarchy.","A":"Create a public group and assign the auditors to the group.","B":"Add the auditors to the default Opportunity Team."},"answer":"C","question_text":"At Universal Containers, there's a team of auditors distributed throughout the organization that all need access to high-value opportunities.\n\nWith a Private sharing model, which option should an architect recommend when designing a solution for this requirement?","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"exam_id":226,"answers_community":["C (50%)","A (50%)"],"answer_description":"","question_id":51},{"id":"OGk3ouUmfN7q6cAGt7pC","choices":{"A":"No access","C":"Read access","B":"Read/Create/Edit access"},"exam_id":226,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/132393-exam-certified-sharing-and-visibility-architect-topic-1/","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1706527620,"timestamp":"2024-01-29 12:27:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe sales rep will have implicit read only access, C","poster":"atyagibuff","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1134874","timestamp":"1722245220.0"},{"comment_id":"1335747","timestamp":"1735849020.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct because the OWD for the Account object is set to Private. This means that, by default, only the owner of the Account record or users explicitly granted access through sharing rules, manual sharing, or role hierarchy will be able to see that Account\n\nOwnership of an opportunity does not automatically grant the owner any access to the related Account record.
