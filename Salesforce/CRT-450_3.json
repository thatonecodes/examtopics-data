The order of execution: {!StringMethod} invokes getStringMethod() that calls myString getter in which we have assignment myString = a, and than getter returns first 'a'. Both next {!myString} invokes myString variable getter, so we have 'a' and 'a' again. And getMyString() metod is never called."},{"comment_id":"864996","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe question seems to be wrong since there is no getStringMethod defined - but assuming that it's what \"StringMethod\" was supposed to reference - the answer is a, a, a\n\nEven though getStringMethod is called before the getter, the method then attempts to retrieve the value to check if it's null. This retrieval calls the getter - and causes the value to be set to 'a' before being returned.\n\nBasically, the property is null only as long as you don't check what it is - the first attempt to check its value changes its state.","timestamp":"1712604960.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"govosen887"},{"poster":"Gusfn","timestamp":"1696938420.0","comment_id":"691081","content":"Selected Answer: C\nmyString is an APEX property.

Because as soon as you try to evaluate if myString == null in the debug, you enter in the getter of myString, who evaluate myString to null, and set it to 'a'. So myString is no longer null and the system.debug(myString == null) = false :)","upvote_count":"2","poster":"noox","timestamp":"1673035440.0","comment_id":"518545"},{"content":"it should be b,a,a","timestamp":"1670722080.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"OMsairam","comment_id":"499036","comments":[{"timestamp":"1671987720.0","comment_id":"509193","upvote_count":"6","content":"Nope, A,A,A is the corect answer","poster":"noox"}]}],"unix_timestamp":1639186080,"question_text":"A developer creates a custom controller and custom Visualforce page by using the code block below.\n//IMG//\n\nWhat can the user expect to see when accessing the custom page?","choices":{"B":"a, b, getMyString","C":"a, a, a","A":"a, b, b","D":"b, a, getMyString"},"exam_id":209,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03769/0005100001.png"],"timestamp":"2021-12-11 02:28:00","answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_id":12,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/67602-exam-crt-450-topic-1-question-109-discussion/"},{"id":"0nXt5sLoNbzGC9J8XCbz","unix_timestamp":1687011600,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"A Visualforce page that calculates the total number of hours for a timecard and displays it on the page","B":"A Roll-Up Summary field on the Timecard Object that calculates the total hours from timecard entries for that timecard","C":"A Process Builder process that updates a field on the timecard when a timecard entry is created","D":"An Apex trigger that uses an Aggregate Query to calculate the hours for a given timecard and stores it in a custom field"},"answer_description":"","question_id":13,"isMC":true,"answer":"B","exam_id":209,"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1232151","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct, as option A is not declarative.","poster":"SS1121","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1718665200.0"},{"content":"B is correct","upvote_count":"2","poster":"PriyankN","comment_id":"1159598","timestamp":"1708943460.0"},{"timestamp":"1693403940.0","poster":"HRVMMRVH","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"994183","content":"Certainly not A, since a declarative solution is needed.
