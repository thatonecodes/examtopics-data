False.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nStandard Fiscal Years in Salesforce follow the Gregorian calendar, but they always start on January 1st and end on December 31st. The fiscal year in this case is fixed and follows the standard calendar year.\n\nHowever, Custom Fiscal Years in Salesforce allow you to set a fiscal year that starts on the first day of any month. Custom fiscal years give more flexibility to align your fiscal periods with the company's financial year, which may not always align with the Gregorian calendar.\n\nConclusion:\nThe statement is False because Standard Fiscal Years in Salesforce always follow the Gregorian calendar and start on January 1st. The ability to start fiscal years on any month is only available for Custom Fiscal Years.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1351338","poster":"Priyanka1994","timestamp":"1738671720.0"}],"answer":"B","choices":{"B":"False","A":"True"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":208,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Standard Fiscal Years are periods that follow Gregorian calendar, but can start on the first day of any month of the year."},{"id":"WPF6pa1VU37kJKbULnNm","unix_timestamp":1572335040,"choices":{"A":"True","B":"False"},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","comments":[{"comment_id":"258173","timestamp":"1609645020.0","content":"quoted from your referenced url: \"Fiscal years can be modified any time.

True.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nIn Salesforce, Forecasting can indeed be used with Custom Fiscal Years. When you configure Salesforce to use Custom Fiscal Years, it allows you to define fiscal periods that best align with your organization's specific financial calendar (which may not start on January 1st).\n\nOnce you've set up Custom Fiscal Years, Salesforce will use those fiscal periods in the forecasting process, allowing you to forecast revenue, opportunities, and other data based on your custom fiscal periods.","comment_id":"1351339","timestamp":"1738671840.0","poster":"Priyanka1994"},{"timestamp":"1725568320.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. true","poster":"rdgsolis","comment_id":"1279173"},{"timestamp":"1692221160.0","poster":"watersidepanda","comment_id":"983031","content":"true...","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"najeffda","content":"The correct answer is : Ture\n\nForecasting in Salesforce can be used with custom fiscal years.
