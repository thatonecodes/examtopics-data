Partner Executive: This role is typically at the top of the hierarchy and represents the highest level of access within the partner account.\n 2. Partner Manager: The Partner Manager role is positioned below the Partner Executive and has slightly more restricted access.\n 3. Partner User: This role is usually at the lowest level of the hierarchy and represents standard users within the partner account.\n\nThese default roles are created to provide a basic structure for managing access and permissions within the partner account. However, you can customize the role hierarchy and create additional roles to meet your organization’s specific needs and requirements.
