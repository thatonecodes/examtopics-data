I still cannot tell for sure the right answer.\n\nA : No, running total is not working because it needs 2 measures and 1 dimension. Here Date is not a measure (but a date) and the function is greyed out (even though one could extract the month in a dataflow/recipe).\nB : Maybe. I can obtain what is descried using the \"show subtotal\" setting of Compare table with the proper grouping, or pivot table. However \"show subtotal\" is different than \"show summary\" in description. I don't know what they refer to with \"show summary\".\nC : Maybe. I guess It could work indeed and fill the gaps (there could be a date gap, where no data is reported for specific month, for example).
