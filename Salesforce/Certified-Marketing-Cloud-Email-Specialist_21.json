Set the column with Subscriber Key as Primary Key:\nThe Subscriber Key is a unique identifier for each subscriber, and it is essential for identifying and managing individual subscribers in Marketing Cloud. When setting up the data extension, the column with the Subscriber Key should be designated as the Primary Key. This ensures that each record in the data extension is uniquely identified by the Subscriber Key, preventing any duplicates and allowing for accurate data management.\n\nD. In Properties, check the \"Is Sendable\" option:\nThe \"Is Sendable\" option in the Properties of the data extension should be checked to indicate that the data extension is eligible for use in email sends. Enabling this option allows the data extension to be used as a target for email campaigns and ensures that the data within the data extension can be sent to subscribers.\n\nOptions B (Set the Email address column as Primary Key) and C (Relate the Email Address to Subscriber Key) are not necessary or recommended","poster":"AleAleAleAle"},{"content":"it should be f","timestamp":"1688034600.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"760992","poster":"dselman1"}],"answers_community":["AD (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1672317000,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Relate the Email Address to Subscriber Key","A":"Set the column with Subscriber Key as Primary Key","D":"In Properties, check the ג€Is Sendableג€ option","B":"Set the Email address column as Primary Key"},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-12-29 13:30:00","answer_ET":"AD","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/93156-exam-certified-marketing-cloud-email-specialist-topic-1/","question_text":"An account will be providing a unique key for each subscriber from an external system.
