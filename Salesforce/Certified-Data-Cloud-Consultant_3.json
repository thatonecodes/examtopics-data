Calculated insights are derived from the data model objects and segments are subsets of data model objects that meet certain criteria. Therefore, both of them need to be updated after the data is ingested to reflect the latest changes. Data transformations are optional steps that can be applied to the data streams before they are mapped to the data model objects, so they are not relevant to the issue. Reviewing calculated insights to make sure they're run after the segments are refreshed (option B) is also incorrect because calculated insights are independent of segments and do not need to be refreshed after them.","poster":"ivo100","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724841600.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB and C because calculated insights and segments are both dependent on the data ingestion process.
