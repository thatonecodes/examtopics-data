In your case, it is better to use tools such as Apex Callouts, External Objects or more robust data integrations to ensure better performance, reliability and scalability in managing invoices and other customer-related data.\nSo, I think that Writing an Apex callout and using it to pull data from the on-premise billing system is the most effective solution for ensuring that the sales team has access to real-time, up-to-date customer and invoice data within Salesforce. This approach minimizes the need for manual data updates and ensures that users have a seamless experience directly within Salesforce.","timestamp":"1743865200.0","comment_id":"1540705","poster":"Mrbl","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1729439880.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD because of the link below","comment_id":"1199234","poster":"lizbette","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1726759980.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_large_data_volumes_bp.meta/salesforce_large_data_volumes_bp/ldv_deployments_techniques_using_mashups.htm","comment_id":"1177571","poster":"6967185"}],"choices":{"C":"Write an Apex callout and populate a related list to display on the account record.","A":"Create a visual force tab with the billing system encapsulated within an iframe.","B":"Create a custom object and migrate the last 12 months of invoice data into Salesforce so it can be displayed on the Account layout.","D":"Create a mashup page that will present the billing system records within Salesforce."},"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (67%)","C (33%)"],"exam_id":214,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/136663-exam-certified-data-architect-topic-1-question-7-discussion/","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1710869580,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Universal Containers (UC) has adopted Salesforce as its primary sales automation tool.

Determine if the data is a driver of key processes implemented within Salesforce.\n\nWhy: Understanding how the data will be used in Salesforce is crucial.
