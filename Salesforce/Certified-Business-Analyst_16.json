Since the BA is working with the technical team in the current sprint to identity the metadata dependencies, I think Version Control (C) is the most appropriate tool to use. \nReasons: Change sets can take a while to create as components are added manually. Meaning dependencies are not immediately visible. Deployment errors are also common and can be time consuming to fix. Whereas Version Control Integrates with your favourite hosting provider such as GitHub, to have full visibility into what was changed, why, when, and by whom.\n\nSource: https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-devops/","comment_id":"957321"},{"timestamp":"1698045840.0","poster":"TheMaryJaynnee","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"877980","content":"In this scenario, the business analyst needs to manage metadata dependencies across features to prevent overwriting before the release. Change sets are used to bundle metadata changes and move metadata between Salesforce orgs. By using change sets, the BA can ensure that metadata changes are tracked and managed between features, preventing accidental overwriting of metadata. Setup Audit Trail is a feature that allows you to see changes that have been made to your org's setup and metadata. Version control is a method of managing changes to documents, code, or other files over time. While version control can be used to track changes to metadata in Salesforce, change sets are the best option for managing dependencies between metadata changes in different features.\n\nSource: ChatGPT"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"C\"\nhttps://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-business-analyst-certification-guide-tips/","poster":"Jude1337","timestamp":"1696526040.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"862336"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nChecking metadata dependencies shouldn't be a business analyst work.
