This is known as the “Publish Immediately” behavior. However, it’s important to note that this isn’t transactional, meaning a Salesforce record that an event publisher creates after publishing might not be committed to the database before the subscriber receives the event message. This could lead to potential issues where the event is processed before the Salesforce record in the trigger is committed to the database. Therefore, in most cases, it’s recommended to use the “Publish After Commit” behavior to ensure that the transaction is completed before the event is published.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1071286","timestamp":"1731664560.0","poster":"JLee1"}],"topic":"1","exam_id":217,"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1700042160}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Salesforce","id":217,"isImplemented":true,"name":"Certified Integration Architect","numberOfQuestions":76},"currentPage":11},"__N_SSP":true}
