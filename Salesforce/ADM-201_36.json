Yes we can share, but only people having access to the dashboard will be able to see the data\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Salesforce, you can share a snapshot of a dashboard component in Chatter. However, the visibility of the underlying data depends on the recipient’s access to the dashboard and its source reports.\n • Users who have access to the dashboard can see the data when they view the shared snapshot.\n • Users who do not have access to the dashboard will not see the data but will still see the shared post in Chatter.\n\nThis ensures that Salesforce respects the organization’s security and sharing settings."},{"timestamp":"1729022520.0","content":"correct answer is C.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"OzUser1","comment_id":"1298427"},{"poster":"anomelies","content":"The answer is D.\n\nIMPORTANT Posting a snapshot to a user or group feed makes it potentially visible to the entire organization:\nPosting to a user feed makes the snapshot public.

True\n\nExplanation:\n\nInline editing is available in Visualforce pages, but it must be explicitly enabled and implemented by the developer. Salesforce provides support for inline editing in Visualforce by using the <apex:inlineEditSupport> component. This allows fields to be edited directly on the page without requiring a full page reload.\n\nHowever, it requires:\n 1. Proper configuration and inclusion of the apex:inlineEditSupport component in the Visualforce page.\n 2. Fields to be inline-editable based on user permissions and record access.\n\nIf not implemented or configured, inline editing will not work by default.","timestamp":"1733714460.0","poster":"jeet992014"},{"poster":"villahd","comment_id":"1110208","upvote_count":"1","content":"B. False\nInline editing is generally not natively available in Visualforce pages in Salesforce. Visualforce pages are custom pages that allow for a high degree of customization and control over the user interface, but they do not automatically include some of the standard Salesforce features like inline editing. This functionality can be achieved in Visualforce pages, but it requires custom development using JavaScript or other methods to enable inline editing capabilities. Therefore, by default, inline editing is not available in Visualforce pages without additional customization.","timestamp":"1703988840.0"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"1Om7hXfzC2118OVHFw41","exam_id":208,"question_id":180,"answer":"B","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Yes in every type of Chart","A":"No","B":"Yes but only in Tables"},"timestamp":"2020-12-27 09:44:00","unix_timestamp":1609058640,"question_text":"With Spring'11 release now you can have Photos in Dashboard components?","answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/40848-exam-adm-201-topic-1-question-194-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"253187","timestamp":"1719470640.0","upvote_count":"10","content":"Spring 11 was almost a decade ago.
