Assign record owners based on relationship.\n\nIn Salesforce, every record must have an owner. The owner can be a user or a queue. When migrating data from a legacy CRM to Salesforce, it’s important to maintain the relationships between records. Therefore, assigning record owners based on the relationships identified in the look-up table from the legacy CRM system would be the most appropriate approach.\n\nC. Create custom object to store agent relationships: While creating a custom object to store agent relationships is possible, it’s not necessary. Salesforce has standard objects that can handle relationships, and it’s generally best to use these whenever possible. Furthermore, this option does not address the issue of record ownership."},{"content":"It's either C or D - the question leaves room for abiguity. If the relationships are one to many, then a custom object would be appropriate and C would be the right answer. If the relationships are 1-1, then D is the right answer.","comment_id":"1008751","poster":"ksho","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1710553320.0"}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-06-28 16:28:00","unix_timestamp":1687962480,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_text":"Northern Trail Outfitters is migrating to Salesforce from a legacy CRM system that identifies the agent relationships in a look-up table.\nWhat should the data architect do in order to migrate the data to Salesforce?"},{"id":"xV1zuyL84uhrIgg8D9t3","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"lizbette","timestamp":"1729468020.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct answer","comment_id":"1199387"},{"poster":"ETH777","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNot A - Doesn't address the lack of user clarity.\nNot B - Not sufficient for managing the overall change process and ensuring consistency.\nNot D - Doesn't explain the context and importance of new fields.\n\nC - Controlled change management, transparency and communication.","timestamp":"1719698100.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1109267"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\n+1 to C","timestamp":"1710553380.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ksho","comment_id":"1008752"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe only \"governance measure\" is the \"data dictionary\" => C","poster":"thneeb","timestamp":"1703781000.0","comment_id":"936772"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"C","question_id":32,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/113545-exam-certified-data-architect-topic-1-question-31-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1687962600,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) uses Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to manage their sales and support processes.

Could be C or D, and it's a toss-up which one is better. I think C works slightly better. D makes it sound like the data is bad (and the validation rules previously used don't work) and therefore the data needs to be pre-processed prior to loading. I would select this if they had bad data with no validation rules, but the question doesn't suggest that. It is a best practice to disable apex triggers, workflows, and validation rules when working with LDV, which is what's happening in this case. So it's good that they disabled validation for the load, and to maintain it going forward, they need to re-enable it, which is why I think C works best.","comments":[{"poster":"lizbette","comment_id":"1199390","timestamp":"1729468920.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"oh never mind I see.

Preprocessing the data so that you can leave the validation rules on without hitting them is the best route. This would also cover off on system required fields.\n\nNot A, while you do want your validation rules to be active, the import will still fail without cleansing the data.\nNot B. How would a batch apex process know how to clean the data for current and future validation rules? \nNot C, you don't want to disable validation rules for routine loads. When the rules are off, end users could manipulate data that violates the validation rules. If you need to resort to disabling validation rules and triggers, you need to lock the users out of the system to maintain data quality."},{"poster":"Oleg_M","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"982828","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree, that's D","timestamp":"1708112820.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"914203","content":"I think correct option is C.
