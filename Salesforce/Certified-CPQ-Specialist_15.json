Only a single Discount Schedule will be applied to any given Quote Line even if multiple related objects point to different discount schedules. The information below describes how CPQ selects the discount schedule to use on a Quote Line in this scenario:\nResolution\nThe SBQQ__DiscountSchedule__c field on the Quote Line will be populated in accordance from the following hierarchy:\nContracted Price\nPrice Dimension (MDQ)\nProduct Option\nProduct Feature\nProduct \n\nThe order for these objects and the priority follows the numbering. For example, should the Discount Schedule lookup be populated on both the Product Option (#3) and the Contracted Price (#1), the lookup on the Contracted Price would be take precedence and be applied to Quote Line.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"906410","poster":"bosebose21","timestamp":"1732520460.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nI believe A and C are correct.","poster":"snusmumrick","upvote_count":"5"}]},{"id":"MO94LlaJJ4z332MnNIix","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-12-05 20:25:00","unix_timestamp":1670268300,"topic":"1","question_id":72,"answers_community":["AD (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Set the Component checkbox to True on the add-on Product record.","C":"Create a Product Feature record referencing the add-on Product.","B":"Set the Customer Community Availability picklist on the add-on Product to Never.","D":"Create a Product Option record referencing the add-on Product for each bundle."},"discussion":[{"poster":"snusmumrick","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.cpq_product_fields.htm&type=5#:~:text=Marks%20this%20product%20as%20a%20component%2C%20excluding%20it%20from%20selection%20in%20product%20lookup.\n\nD: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.cpq_bundle_products.htm&type=5","timestamp":"1733426700.0","comment_id":"736227"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/90124-exam-certified-cpq-specialist-topic-1-question-164/","answer":"AD","exam_id":213,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_text":"Universal Containers has an add-on Product that can only be sold as part of bundles.\nWhich two steps should the admin take to meet this requirement?
