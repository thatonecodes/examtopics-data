This is useful when the developer needs to create a new procedure that has the same basic structure as the original, but with some modifications or customizations to meet a specific requirement.\n\nVersioning, on the other hand, creates a new version of the Integration Procedure that includes changes made to the original. This is useful when the developer needs to make changes to an existing procedure but still maintain the original version. Versioning is recommended when the changes made to the procedure are minor or if the developer wants to keep a record of the changes made.","poster":"ppremy","comment_id":"883033","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730068560.0"}],"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Why would a developer clone an Integration Procedure instead of versioning it?","question_id":63},{"id":"IAVizPVYO4tsficayziV","question_id":64,"unix_timestamp":1682629920,"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"B":"Key Value -\nSecondaryAccount %DRExtractAction:Account%","D":"Key Value -\n%DRExtractAction:Account% SecondaryAccount","C":"Key Value -\nDRExtractAction:Account SecondaryAccount","A":"Key Value -\nSecondaryAccount DRExtractAction:Account"},"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-04-27 23:12:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit below.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nThe {Data} modal in the OmniScript provides the input JSON for the DataRaptor Load action. The input JSON from the {Data} modal contains all the field values from the OmniScript and is specific to the current transaction. Copying the input JSON from the {Data} modal ensures that the input data is consistent with the current transaction, and reduces the likelihood of errors in the data load.","poster":"ppremy","comments":[{"upvote_count":"6","poster":"Laurens12345","content":"Correct answer is D.","comment_id":"893044","timestamp":"1699536120.0"}],"upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"2023-04-27 18:56:00","answer":"D","exam_id":221,"answers_community":["D (80%)","C (20%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/107712-exam-certified-omnistudio-developer-topic-1-question-7/","unix_timestamp":1682614560,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Copy the Input JSON from the DataRaptor Action Debug node.","C":"Copy the Input JSON from the OmniScript {Data} modal.","A":"Build the Input JSON node by node in an editor.","B":"Build the Input JSON node by node in the DataRaptor Designer."},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_id":65,"answer_ET":"D"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"name":"Certified OmniStudio Developer","isImplemented":true,"id":221,"isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":77,"provider":"Salesforce"},"currentPage":13},"__N_SSP":true}
