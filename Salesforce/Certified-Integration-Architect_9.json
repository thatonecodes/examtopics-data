Outbound Messaging, which will automatically handle error retries to the service:\n\nWhile Outbound Messaging handles automatic retries, it has limitations in terms of customization and error handling. It may not provide the granular control required to ensure exactly-once delivery.\nB. Button press invokes synchronous callout, with user handling retries in case of error:\n\nRelying on a user to handle retries introduces the risk of human error and does not guarantee that the order will be processed exactly once. This approach lacks the automation and reliability required for critical financial transactions.\nD. Trigger makes @future Apex method, with custom error handling process:\n\n@future methods have limitations, such as not being able to chain jobs or manage complex operations as effectively as Queueable Apex.
