An Authentication App and C. A Security Token are two options that the administrator should consider to use multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\nAn authentication app such as Google Authenticator or Salesforce Authenticator generates a unique code that the user must enter in addition to their username and password to log in to Salesforce. This provides an additional layer of security beyond just the password.\n\nA security token is another method for implementing MFA in Salesforce. When a user attempts to log in, they must enter their username, password, and a unique security token. The security token is a string of characters that is generated by Salesforce and can be sent to the user via email or text message.\n\nIt's important to note that using a username and password alone is not considered multi-factor authentication, as it only requires one form of identification.","comment_id":"852473","poster":"tMana"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1679950080,"question_id":46,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Cloud Kicks wants to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to help better secure its Salesforce org.\n\nWhich two options should the administrator consider to use MFA?

Batch Update would be the best alternative to a Process Builder if the goal is to update multiple records quickly. Batch Update is a tool in Salesforce that allows an administrator to modify or update large numbers of records at once, reducing the time required for manual updates. It is especially useful when dealing with large data sets, and can be set up to run at a specific time or on a recurring basis. The other options listed, Workflow Rule Field Change, Before Save Flow Trigger, and Screen Flow, are all tools that can be used to automate processes in Salesforce, but are not designed for bulk updates of records.","timestamp":"1727470260.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"761918","content":"i think the answer should be B","poster":"ryukakeiii","timestamp":"1719744480.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1672404480,"question_id":47,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"What should an administrator use as an alternative to a Process Builder to expedite the time required to update the records?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/93253-exam-certified-advanced-administrator-topic-1-question-152/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"exam_id":211,"timestamp":"2022-12-30 13:48:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"hvT0nWUfyJ42ba3HYxpv","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"852477","poster":"tMana","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727470320.0","content":"The administrator should look in the Setup Audit Trail to see if any other administrators or delegated administrators are using the \"Log In As a User\" feature.
