It ensures that the data is accurately matched and merged into a single, unified view of the customer.\n\nWithout Identity Resolution, the ingested data may contain duplicate or fragmented profiles, leading to inaccurate segmentation and activation.\n\nData mapping is typically done during the ingestion phase to ensure that the data is correctly structured and aligned with the target schema. It is not a prerequisite for segmentation and activation after ingestion is complete.","timestamp":"1738266900.0","poster":"Ica_carol","comment_id":"1349210","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1348339","timestamp":"1738118640.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis step is crucial because it ensures that the data from different sources is accurately matched and merged to create unified profiles.

This process ensures that data from different sources is unified into a single profile per individual by matching and merging records based on configured rules (e.g., email, phone number, or other identifiers).
