Given the large volume of data generated (100 million records each month) and the need for a 12-month trailing summary, it is advisable to leverage an external data store to handle the data storage and processing. Salesforce Connect allows you to integrate external data with Salesforce seamlessly.\nBy capturing the reward program data in an external data store, such as a separate database or data warehouse, you can efficiently manage and process the large volume of transaction records. Salesforce Connect can be used to establish a real-time connection between Salesforce and the external data store, enabling access to the necessary customer information.\nUsing an external object in Salesforce, which represents the data stored in the external data store, you can surface the 12-month trailing summary of transactions and reward levels within Salesforce.
