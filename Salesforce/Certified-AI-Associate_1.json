Societal bias.\n\nExplanation:\nSocietal bias occurs when a system or algorithm reflects and imposes the broader societal values, stereotypes, or inequalities onto its users. This kind of bias emerges when systems are trained on data that is influenced by societal norms, prejudices, or disparities. As a result, the system may unintentionally reinforce these biases in its outcomes.\n\nAssociation bias refers to the bias that comes from algorithms associating certain characteristics (e.g., gender, race) with specific outcomes due to patterns in the data.\n\nAutomation bias occurs when people place too much trust in automated systems, potentially leading to overreliance on these systems' decisions, even when they are flawed or incorrect.\n\nIn the context of imposing values, societal bias is the type that spreads the existing societal norms and values, often without consideration for fairness or diversity.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"BlatantRegard","timestamp":"1729232160.0","comment_id":"1299566"},{"poster":"hobogo","comment_id":"1291870","timestamp":"1727770260.0","content":"Automation bias imposes a system’s values on others.\nhttps://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed/0D54V00007ifr2CSAQ","comments":[{"content":"Great Materials answer is def.

Inaccurate or inconsistent data can lead to flawed predictions, adversely affecting decision-making processes.\n\nWhile volume (the amount of data) and age (the recency of data) are important considerations, they are secondary to reliability.

Age: While the age or recency of data can be important, it is not the most essential data quality dimension in this case. Older data can still be useful if it's reliable and relevant.\n\nC.

Transparency also means that AI users should be able to access relevant information and documentation about the AI systems they interact with. Flagging sensitive variables and their proxies means identifying and marking variables that can potentially cause discrimination or unfair treatment based on a person's identity or characteristics, such as age, gender, race, income, or credit score.
