Add the following to Send JSON Path: AccountId: %AccountId, ProductId: %Details:ProductId%\n\nExplanation:\nThe Send JSON Path property of the Remote Action element specifies the JSON data to send to the target system. In this case, the method requires two fields as input: AccountId and ProductId. So the Send JSON Path should include these two fields with their respective values from the Integration Procedure data JSON. The correct syntax to reference the values from the Integration Procedure data JSON is %FieldName%. Therefore, the Send JSON Path should be configured as follows: AccountId: %AccountId%, ProductId: %Details:ProductId%. This will correctly pass the AccountId and ProductId fields to the APEX class method being called by the Remote Action element."}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (67%)","B (27%)","7%"],"unix_timestamp":1682623080,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/107738-exam-certified-omnistudio-developer-topic-1-question-33/","choices":{"A":"Check the DataRaptor Transform checkbox, and add the following Key/Value pairs to Output JSON Path:\n\nAccountId: %AccountId -\nProductId: %Details:ProductId%","B":"Add the following to Send JSON Path: AccountId: %AccountId, ProductId: %Details:ProductId%","D":"Set Return Only Additional Output to true, and add the following Key/Value pairs to Additional Input:\nAccountId: %AccountId%\nProductId: %Details:ProductId%","C":"Check the Send Only Additional Input checkbox, and add the following Key/Value pairs to Additional Input:\nAccountId: %AccountId%\nProductId: %Details:ProductId%"},"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-04-27 21:18:00","question_id":26,"answer":"C","isMC":true,"question_text":"An Integration Procedure contains a Remote Action element that calls a method of an APEX class.
