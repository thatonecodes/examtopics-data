C is wrong because the details don't say that sales users shouldn't have access to PII. D is wrong because that's not a Salesforce Shield feature, it's a Network Services feature. Salesforce Shield contains 3 main services, 1) Platform Encryption, 2) Event Monitoring - with Transaction Security, which allows you to build customizable security policies, and 3) Field Audit Trail. Therefore, A is right (Event Monitoring), B is right (Shield Platform Encryption), and E is also right (Transaction Security policies are a part of Event Monitoring, and allow users to build policies).","comment_id":"1199205","timestamp":"1713625200.0"},{"poster":"AlexUp","timestamp":"1707390180.0","comment_id":"1144373","content":"Selected Answer: ABE\nABE are fine","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"ADE is the correct answer","timestamp":"1690743540.0","poster":"supersam1982","comment_id":"967434"},{"content":"ABE is correct as it covers all aspect of question","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"963202","poster":"rahulnwo","timestamp":"1690329480.0"},{"poster":"bssrilakshmi","content":"Correct answer: A B E","timestamp":"1682937120.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"886095"}],"question_text":"A customer is operating in a highly regulated industry and is planning to implement Salesforce.

Loading data into marketing cloud is loading data direct to salesforce. I interpreted the reconcillation process as a deduping/pre-matching exercise.
