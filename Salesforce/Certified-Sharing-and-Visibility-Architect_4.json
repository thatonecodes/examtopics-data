Because some propsals are \"confidential\", this must mean there is some level of criteria on the propsal that marks it as confidentials. \n\nAs for non-confidential proposals retaining visibility, you could use a criteria based sharing rule (for non-cofidential) and share with a public group that has \"Grant Access Using Hierarchies\" enabled. You would all of the managers to the public group. May not be 100% precise if the role set up is all over the place, but assuming a normal sales rep > manager hierarchy, you can meet both sides of the requirements.","comment_id":"1329227","timestamp":"1734659340.0","poster":"ksho","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"D.
