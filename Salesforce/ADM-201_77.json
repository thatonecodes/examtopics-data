Once enabled, Salesforce automatically tracks changes to the selected fields. However, to view these tracked changes, you need to add the corresponding related list to the object's page layout. This ensures that users can access and view the history of field changes directly from the record's page.\n\nFor example, if you enable Field History Tracking for the 'Account' object to monitor changes to the 'Support Plan' field, you must add the 'Account Field History' related list to the Account page layout. This addition allows users to see a history of changes to the 'Support Plan' field when viewing an Account record.\n\nTherefore, the statement is True: To enable Field History Tracking for an object, the system administrator must also add the related list to the page layout."},{"content":"I think you guys are answering this question in the literal sense..
