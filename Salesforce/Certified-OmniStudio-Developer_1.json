To $Details:Customer|0:ID$\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct syntax for referencing a merge code in OmniScript is to use a dollar sign ($) followed by the merge code, which includes the object name, index number, and field name. In this case, the object name is \"Customer\", the index number is \"0\" (since there is only one element in the \"Customer\" array), and the field name is \"ID\". Therefore, the correct merge code to display the ID for the new trial org is \"$Details:Customer|0:ID$\".\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the letter \"n\" instead of the index number \"0\".\n\nOption C is incorrect because it uses the index number \"1\" instead of \"0\".\n\nOption D is incorrect because it uses double percentage signs (%%) instead of a single dollar sign ($), which is not the correct syntax for referencing merge codes in OmniScript.","comment_id":"882827","timestamp":"1714236180.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/101422-exam-certified-omnistudio-developer-topic-1-question-1/","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":221,"timestamp":"2023-03-03 17:39:00","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"C","isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"8jqbGRtE1MzrqkwqIKdf","exam_id":221,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-04-27 19:06:00","unix_timestamp":1682615160,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nBased on documentation it's A and C (response action does only have output value field)","timestamp":"1734195780.0","poster":"Ike300","comment_id":"1326538","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"966772","poster":"cooldeeps","upvote_count":"4","content":"only C is correct. for B, response action does not have additional input values","timestamp":"1722302280.0"},{"poster":"lindem","timestamp":"1720786980.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nJust B is correct , ResponseAction does not have Additional Input values, just Additional Output Values","comment_id":"949759"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think that just B ist correct.
