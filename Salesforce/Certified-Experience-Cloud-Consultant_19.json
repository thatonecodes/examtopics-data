Lightning Bolt Export and Installation\n\nExplanation:\n\nLightning Bolt Export and Installation is specifically designed for migrating Experience Cloud sites between orgs. It packages the site configuration, branding, themes, and other elements into a format that can be easily imported into a separate org. This approach is recommended by Salesforce for transferring sites across unconnected production environments.\n\nOther options:\n\n • A (Metadata API) and D (Change Set) don’t capture all Experience Cloud site components, making them incomplete solutions for site migration.\n • C (Publication via Experience Builder) is used for publishing within the same org and isn’t applicable for cross-org migration.\n\nThis makes Lightning Bolt Export and Installation the most reliable and accurate choice for this scenario.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1303800","poster":"f74dee5"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/150389-exam-certified-experience-cloud-consultant-topic-1-question/","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"xLjgiUfDtSQWyWTxwFhM","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Page Variations","A":"Audience Sets","B":"Partner User Roles","D":"Branding Sets","E":"Audience Targeting"},"answer":"CDE","isMC":true,"exam_id":216,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/112318-exam-certified-experience-cloud-consultant-topic-1-question/","question_id":93,"unix_timestamp":1686868260,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1702686660.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"Selected Answer: CDE\nCDE are correct.

Create an Authentication Provider by choosing Google as the provider type and add relevant parameters to access the customers’ basic profile data.\n\nUsing an Authentication Provider allows you to enable external identity providers like Google to authenticate users accessing your Experience Cloud site.

This approach provides a seamless and secure login experience for customers while allowing you to access the necessary data to personalize their experience on the site."}]},{"id":"dwjtauzSGvb1gXBpg3Uy","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","question_images":[],"exam_id":216,"question_text":"Ursa Major Solar (UMS) is planning to build a portal for its partners.
