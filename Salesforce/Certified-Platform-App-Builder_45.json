Standard report types won't provide the ability to traverse the custom relationships you've created. B-Lookup relationships are appropriate when you want to create a many-to-one relationship between Postings and Positions, and Postings and Websites. C-This allows a single Posting to be related to one Position and one Website.Master-detail relationships create a strong ownership dependency.
