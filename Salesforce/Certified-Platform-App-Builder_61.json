Put the SC in the role hierarchy above the technicians whose work orders they review: In a private sharing model, access to records is determined by the role hierarchy. By placing the SC in a role that is higher in the hierarchy than the technicians, the SC will inherit access to the work orders and related records owned by those technicians. This approach respects the existing security model and provides the necessary access without requiring extensive changes to permissions or profiles.","timestamp":"1722768900.0","comment_id":"1260627"}],"exam_id":222},{"id":"RQHnZcwCPXbFzMuGBeCG","question_id":302,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"Add a rich text component to the Case Lighting page > Set the component visibility of the rich text component to show when the account support level is platinum.","C":"Create a text-only custom Lightning Web Component > Clone the case page layout > Drag the custom Lightning Web Component into the page, and assign the layout to platinum cases.","A":"Clone the Case Lightning page > Add a rich text component to the new page, and assign this page to platinum accounts.","B":"Create a text-only custom Lightning Web Component > Drag the custom Lightning Web Component into the Case page layout > Set its visibility to show when the account support level is platinum."},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1713285180.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThere is no need to create a lightning web component for that.
