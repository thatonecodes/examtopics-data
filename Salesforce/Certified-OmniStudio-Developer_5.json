Therefore, when a contact is selected from the Type Ahead list, the data is fetched correctly but not displayed in the text fields because they are not located within the Type Ahead Block.\n\nTo fix this issue, the developer should move the text fields FirstName, LastName, and BirthDate inside the Type Ahead Block.

Update the ContextId value to specify an id from the production org.\nThe ContextId key/value pair in the Set Values element is used to specify the context record for the OmniScript. This record is used to control the access and visibility of data in the OmniScript, as well as to provide context for any actions that update or retrieve data from Salesforce. Before moving the OmniScript to a production org, the developer should update the ContextId value to specify an id from the production org. This will ensure that the OmniScript is using the correct context record and is accessing the correct data in the production org.\nOption B is not the best choice because deleting or deactivating the Set Values element would remove the context record from the OmniScript, which would cause it to fail in production.","timestamp":"1714244760.0"}],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/107733-exam-certified-omnistudio-developer-topic-1-question-30/","answers_community":["B (75%)","C (25%)"],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"2mNCrTk6w4yljWQsRisE","timestamp":"2023-07-18 01:02:00","question_images":[],"answer":"C","exam_id":221,"unix_timestamp":1689634920,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A developer has a requirement to create a child FlexCard that contains all of its parent FlexCardâ€™s records in a Datatable\nHow should the developer configure the parent FlexCard's Data Node?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/115550-exam-certified-omnistudio-developer-topic-1-question-31/","answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answers is C","poster":"lindem","comment_id":"954684","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1721257320.0"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"{records[0]}","A":"{recordId}","B":"{Params.records}","C":"{records}"},"question_id":24,"answer_description":""},{"id":"jBvwSwbMvq9bLNYjucqd","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (83%)","A (17%)"],"exam_id":221,"timestamp":"2023-04-27 21:08:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/107734-exam-certified-omnistudio-developer-topic-1-question-32/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"887656","content":"Answer must be B.
