Update the flow with a local redirect action.\n\nTo fix the issue of sales reps being kicked back to the initial screen after completing data entry in Screen Flow, the administrator should update the flow with a local redirect action. This will allow the flow to redirect the user to a specific page after they complete the data entry, rather than sending them back to the initial screen. This can be done by adding a new screen to the flow with the local redirect action, and configuring the action to redirect the user to the desired page.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727549640.0","poster":"tMana","comment_id":"853576"}],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/104244-exam-certified-advanced-administrator-topic-1-question-190/","topic":"1","question_text":"The sales team at Cloud Kicks is noticing that sales reps are misusing the new Screen Flow tool for data entry, since they are kicked back to the initial screen after clicking finish.\n\nWhat should the administrator do to fix this?","timestamp":"2023-03-28 20:54:00","question_id":76,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Add a trigger to redirect the user to a new page.","D":"Update the flow with a local redirect action.","B":"Use a Lightning action to redirect the user.","C":"Create a new flow to redirect the user when the other flow finishes."}},{"id":"JzLO4rlj7tay1JLIgvGj","timestamp":"2023-03-28 20:56:00","question_id":77,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","exam_id":211,"answer":"D","choices":{"B":"Create a different record type for deals with Sales Engineers and deals with Account Executives to capture one or the other.","D":"Write a validation rule that checks if the fields are blank and require that one of them be completed in order to save the opportunity.","A":"Assign a task to the owner if an opportunity is created without one of these fields filled out.","C":"Require the Sales Engineer and the Account Executive lookup fields on the page layout."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/104246-exam-certified-advanced-administrator-topic-1-question-191/","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1680029760,"question_text":"The director of sales wants to make sure that every opportunity has either a sales engineer or an account executive assigned to the deal.\n\nHow should the administrator meet this requirement?","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"tMana","content":"D. Write a validation rule that checks if the fields are blank and require that one of them be completed in order to save the opportunity.\n\nA validation rule would be the best approach to enforce the requirement that every opportunity has either a sales engineer or an account executive assigned to it. By writing a validation rule, the administrator can ensure that the fields are not left blank when the opportunity is being saved. If the fields are blank, an error message will be displayed, and the opportunity will not be saved until the required fields are completed. This will help to ensure that all opportunities have either a sales engineer or an account executive assigned to them.","timestamp":"1727549760.0","comment_id":"853579"}],"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[]},{"id":"4XWHKC0e2l8nXg8zdFaw","answer_images":[],"question_id":78,"question_text":"The administrator at Cloud Kicks has been asked to delete a large number of quote line items.

The administrator can then create a profile for the partner consultants that restricts their access to the Profit field on the Opportunity object.
