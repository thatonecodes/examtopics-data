The price in British Pounds is how much the product costs regardless of the exchange rate. The only reason the opportunity amount would change is if there was a discount applied, they had a coupon, you get the picture. The reason the amount in the report changes is because your company is based in the US, and you use USD as you currency, so any fluctuation in the exchange rate would cause the converted amount to change. The converted amount is what's being reflected in the report.\nExample: Opportunity created for $50,000 EUR with an exchange rate of 1.25 = $44.247.79 USD. Change the exchange rate to 1.00 and the reported amount, and the actual amount, will then both be $50,000. Any future changes will only change the converted amount. The opportunity amount will always remain the same as long as no new items are added.
