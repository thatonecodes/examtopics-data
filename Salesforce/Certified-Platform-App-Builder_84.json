Permission Sets: Permission Sets are used to grant additional permissions to users, such as access to certain fields or objects. However, they do not handle the visibility of specific records based on criteria or ownership. They are more about extending user permissions rather than managing record sharing.\n\nTherefore, Sharing Rules are the appropriate tool for granting the necessary access to all job applicants’ salary information for users performing hiring manager functions.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":[],"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"QSwkNTcIMHypLhCviv5I","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-02-23 13:50:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/134444-exam-certified-platform-app-builder-topic-1-question-595/","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722735720.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1260495","content":"Answer - A.
