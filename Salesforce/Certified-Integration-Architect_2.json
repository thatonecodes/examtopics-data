The option that best fits this criterion is:\n\nB. Smaller batch size can trigger “Too many concurrent batches” error.\n\nThis is because reducing the batch size increases the number of batches processed, which directly impacts the concurrent processing capabilities and can quickly lead to hitting the \"Too many concurrent batches\" error, which is a more immediate concern compared to the other options.","poster":"Paul421"}],"choices":{"C":"Smaller batch size may increase time required to execute bulk jobs.","B":"Smaller batch size can trigger “Too many concurrent batches” error.","A":"Smaller batch size may exceed the concurrent API request limits."}},{"id":"LAUtQDeolMtGoQyOsiEB","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1674551340,"question_id":8,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721804940.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"786340","poster":"SFDCArchitecture","content":"Selected Answer: ABD\nhttps://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.214.0.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_considerations.htm"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/96727-exam-certified-integration-architect-topic-1-question-11/","answer":"ABD","answers_community":["ABD (100%)"],"answer_ET":"ABD","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"When an event definition is deleted, it's permanently removed and can't be restored.","A":"Event messages using SOQL are unable to be queried.","B":"A Lightning record page for platform events is unable to be created.","C":"Subscribe to an AssetTokenEvent stream to monitor OAuth 2.0 authentication activity.","E":"Event Monitoring is used to track user activity, such as logins and running reports."},"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which three considerations should an integration architect consider when recommending Platform Event as an integration solution?
