The Action Debugger can help the developer identify which actions in the Integration Procedure are taking the most time and contributing to the high CPU usage. The DataRaptor configuration and Script Configuration may need to be reviewed, but they are less likely to be the root cause of the APEX CPU Limit Exceeded error.","comment_id":"882975","timestamp":"1714245660.0"}]},{"id":"wDGHx6qZLNzqIYIc926J","timestamp":"2023-07-30 05:32:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"A","question_id":32,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730952660.0","comment_id":"1064480","upvote_count":"2","poster":"JohnyWalker99","content":"A is correct !"},{"poster":"cooldeeps","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the right answer","comment_id":"967476","timestamp":"1722369900.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the right answer.Array of cases and a object for contact","timestamp":"1722310320.0","poster":"cooldeeps","comment_id":"966819","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit below.

To limit the output of a DataRaptor Extract to a maximum of one result, you can use the LIMIT filter on the Extract definition. To do this, go to the DataRaptor Extract tab and add the LIMIT filter to the query definition. The syntax for the LIMIT filter is as follows:\n\nLIMIT 1\n\nThis will limit the results to a maximum of one row.","comment_id":"882982","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1682623680.0","poster":"ppremy"}],"timestamp":"2023-04-27 21:28:00","exam_id":221,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/107742-exam-certified-omnistudio-developer-topic-1-question-41/","answer_ET":"C"}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Salesforce","id":221,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":77,"name":"Certified OmniStudio Developer","isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":7},"__N_SSP":true}
