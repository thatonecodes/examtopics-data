Outbound Messages are built exactly for this use case, requiring no code. Apex should only be used if custom processing is needed, which is not stated in the question. Outbound Messages handle this perfectly, while an Apex trigger would be unnecessary complexity and problematic due to the above limits. \n\nEven if you use a future method for the trigger, Salesforce limits the number of concurrent callouts, making this less reliable for high-volume processing. Outbound Messages do not count against these limits and have built-in retry mechanisms, making them more resilient.","poster":"BrainMelt12"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"AntoineX","timestamp":"1731967620.0","content":"D.\nReal-time Notification: An Apex trigger on the Order object can fire automatically when an Order's status changes to 'Paid'.

Outbound Messages are SOAP-based and can be configured to automatically trigger a callout when a record meets specific criteria.
