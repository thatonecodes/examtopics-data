Failure to include all stakeholders in the requirements gathering process\nIn this case, the gap in the user acceptance testing (UAT) scenario likely occurred because not all stakeholders were involved in the requirements gathering process. If the requirements do not fully capture the needs and expectations of all personas, it can result in major gaps in functionality or features, which may only be discovered during UAT.\nC.Incorrect :Validation of the application against functional requirements should occur, but if the functional requirements themselves were incomplete due to not involving all stakeholders, the validation would have already been flawed.

If there was a major gap identified for one of the personas during UAT, it suggests that their requirements were not adequately captured or understood during the requirements gathering process. This failure could occur if key stakeholders, including representatives of all personas, were not included or consulted during requirements gathering. Incomplete or inaccurate requirements documentation can lead to gaps in the implemented solution, which may only be discovered during UAT.
