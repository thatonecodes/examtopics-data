This will allow each loan advisor to be associated with multiple customer accounts, while still maintaining the B2C account model. Option A is, therefore, the correct answer.\n\nOption B is not suitable because it suggests using a B2B account model, which is not the model that DreamHouse Realty is currently using. Option C and D are not suitable because they suggest using a hierarchical lookup, which is not necessary for this requirement and may complicate the data model unnecessarily.","timestamp":"1727459640.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1679939640,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":37},{"id":"kYYLD5elThGy8lImS9Gp","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/104551-exam-certified-advanced-administrator-topic-1-question-136/","question_text":"AW Computing has a new requirement from its security team where audit information relating to an account must be recorded in a new custom object called Audit.

This is because a Lookup relationship allows a many-to-one relationship between two objects, where the Audit object can be linked to an Account record but multiple Audit records can be linked to the same Account record. Also, since the Audit records need to be preserved for 10 years and only accessible by the audit team, a Lookup relationship would provide flexibility in terms of record access and ownership. The audit team could be given access to view and manage the Audit records without necessarily having access to the related Account records.","comment_id":"856406","timestamp":"1711843800.0","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"id":"MYemPbzSKUwAH2MdRXCJ","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","question_text":"An administrator notices that there are two account records in the system with the same name.
