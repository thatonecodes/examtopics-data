All of the ownership-based sharing rules are recalculated.\n\nWhen a user changes roles, it can affect the ownership-based sharing rules for both standard and custom objects, regardless of whether the user moves up or down in the role hierarchy. Salesforce will automatically recalculate the sharing rules for all affected records to ensure that the user has the appropriate access to the records based on their new role. This recalculation takes into account the new role, the role hierarchy, and any sharing rules or manual sharing that has been set up for the object. Therefore, it is important to review and adjust the sharing rules and manual sharing settings as needed to ensure that the user has the appropriate access to the records.","comment_id":"854530","timestamp":"1727621040.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"705409","poster":"nibbler","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nyep its C","timestamp":"1714211280.0"},{"poster":"Ktoto_Leviy","comment_id":"594699","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1698621360.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_sharing_recalculating.htm&type=5"},{"poster":"esj275","comment_id":"464396","content":"The most common causes of recalculation are the addition or removal of people from a group, territory changes, or people changing the role to which they are reporting.","timestamp":"1681870260.0","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"C86SsmYYRhA7YIDSsAST","exam_id":211,"unix_timestamp":1705972080,"answer":"D","question_id":133,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/131846-exam-certified-advanced-administrator-topic-1-question-270/","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-01-23 02:08:00","isMC":true,"question_text":"A new administrator at Cloud Kicks has reported that they are unable to use outbound change sets as requested.\n\nWhat permission should be reviewed to determine if it is missing from the administrator user or profile?","choices":{"B":"API Enabled","D":"Create and Upload Change Sets","C":"Deploy Change Sets","A":"Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions"},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721689680.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.changesets.htm&type=5","comment_id":"1129142","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"id":"zCVOJMxsdtEMfoBnwTyQ","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":134,"timestamp":"2025-03-23 23:28:00","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1742768880,"exam_id":211,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/169741-exam-certified-advanced-administrator-topic-1-question-274/","choices":{"B":"Share an Opportunity sharing rule with a public group containing the East operations profile.","D":"Assign to a role in the role hierarchy positioned above the East sales director.","C":"Utilize territory management to add the operations team to the East territory.","A":"Instruct the operations team members to add themselves to the account teams."},"answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"poster":"GeorgeKluny","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think it's B","comment_id":"1407342","timestamp":"1742768880.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"B","question_text":"AW Computing organizes its sales regions as East, Central, and West.
