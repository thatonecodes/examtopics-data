When @isTest(SeeAllData=True) is used, you're accessing org data in your test, and @testSetup is designed to isolate test data creation. They shouldn't be used together.\n\nB. The main advantage of @testSetup is to create test data once and then use this data in multiple test methods in the test class, reducing repetitive data creation and making tests run faster. The @testSetup method runs once before any test method in the class. Then, each test method runs, starting with a fresh copy of the data created in the @testSetup method.
