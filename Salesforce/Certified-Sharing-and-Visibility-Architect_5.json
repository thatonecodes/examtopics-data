Divisions help segment data and roles based on different business units, departments, or geographic regions within your organization.\n\nBy implementing Divisions, you can:\n\n1. **Isolate Data:** Divisions can be used to separate data so that users in one division can only access and view data within their own division. This helps maintain data privacy and security.\n\n2. **Segment Role Hierarchies:** You can set up separate role hierarchies for each division, allowing for greater flexibility in managing roles and access permissions.\n\n3. **Control Access:** Divisions allow you to control who can see and interact with data and records within their respective divisions, simplifying large-scale realignments.","timestamp":"1713010980.0","poster":"Blablabla39"},{"comment_id":"1351795","content":"The key advantages of granular locking are that:\nGroups that are in separate hierarchies can be manipulated concurrently.","timestamp":"1738749180.0","poster":"5bcfa3b","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"What advanced tool can Salesforce enable for large-scale role hierarchy realignments?","question_id":21,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-10-13 14:23:00","unix_timestamp":1697199780,"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Skinny Table Indexing","B":"Granular locking","C":"Partitioning by Divisions","A":"Set external organization-wide default to public read only"},"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1"},{"id":"cM0gdlduPTzROZFO2yOC","topic":"1","answer":"C","isMC":true,"question_text":"Besides their own team accounts, sales managers at Universal Containers need to have READ access to all accounts of the same segment in other countries.\nRole hierarchy was implemented accordingly (based on countries), but a sales manager in the US is complaining that he cannot view account records of the same segment in Canada.\nWhat should be done to grant access in a proper way?","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1690565160,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-07-28 19:26:00","answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/116691-exam-certified-sharing-and-visibility-architect-topic-1/","discussion":[{"content":"C. \n\nSalesforce's criteria-based sharing rules allow you to share records based on field values.
