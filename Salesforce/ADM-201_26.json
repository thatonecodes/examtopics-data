Opportunity Close Date, Product Date, Schedule Date\nThis means that the forecast can be determined based on the Opportunity Close Date, the dates associated with each product within an opportunity (Product Date), and potentially the Schedule Date. These options provide flexibility in forecasting based on different aspects of sales opportunities and their related products.\nThe key here is that Customizable Forecasting in Salesforce allows for a more nuanced approach than just using the Opportunity Close Date.
