The Verification Webservice API should be able to handle any errors that occur during the communication with the external service and return a meaningful response to the agent. This way, the agent can take appropriate actions based on the error message, such as retrying the request, contacting the service provider, or informing the customer.","timestamp":"1731669300.0","poster":"JLee1","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"994925","poster":"acresposot","upvote_count":"3","content":"Option B is more direct in terms of providing immediate feedback in the event of an error","timestamp":"1725091620.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"972341","content":"Selected Answer: D\nMiddleware is best suited for error handling between multiple systems.","poster":"prabuano","comments":[{"poster":"JLee1","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1071354","timestamp":"1731669240.0","content":"This option D is wrong because it does not handle the errors gracefully.
