The question is between B and C. We can definitely say that workflow will ignore record type specificity when setting a picklist value so B is for sure correct. \n\nThe confusion in the comments comes in because enabling multiple currencies allows you to set different fields with different currencies and when you update those fields they will update with what ever currency the field was last set to use. This means that it is NOT ignoring multiple currencies it is correctly using them, if workflow was ignoring them then it would for example set all currencies to USD not matter what the field previous had written.","timestamp":"1709396940.0","comment_id":"996947","upvote_count":"2","poster":"docxdmd"},{"content":"The three Salesforce functionalities that are ignored when processing field updates in workflow rules and approval processes are:\nA.

Record type picklist value assignments: Record types are used to display different page layouts and picklist values based on the values of the record type field.
