Builder and Experience Admin\n\nThe first colleague needs the ability to create and customize the site, which is covered by the \"Builder\" role. Additionally, the \"Experience Admin\" role provides broader administrative capabilities, such as managing site settings and configurations.\n\nThe second colleague needs to manage contributors and publish the site, so the \"Publisher\" role is appropriate for this task. However, the \"Experience Admin\" role might also be necessary depending on the specific administrative tasks they need to perform.
