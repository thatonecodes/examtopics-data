The order in which those flows are executed is not guaranteed.\n\nWhen multiple record-triggered flows are defined on an object, the order of execution is not guaranteed. Salesforce determines the order of execution based on various factors, such as the type of event, whether the flows are before or after triggers, and whether they are part of the same managed package. To ensure the correct order of execution, it is recommended to consolidate the logic into a single flow or use a combination of before and after triggers to handle the logic."}],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Ursa Major Solar’s administrator has configured multiple record-triggered flows to run before or after the record is saved on the Account object.\n\nWhat should the administrator consider when a record-triggered flow executes first?","unix_timestamp":1680031560,"question_id":92,"choices":{"A":"The flow with the shortest execution time will execute first.","B":"The flow with the longest execution time will execute first.","C":"Assign the highest priority to the record-triggered flow which should execute first.","D":"The order in which those flows are executed is not guaranteed."},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","exam_id":211,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-03-28 21:26:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/104261-exam-certified-advanced-administrator-topic-1-question-204/","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"3YOXm9DNsJ6tXpEYCmBA","timestamp":"2023-03-11 02:55:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","choices":{"C":"Setup Audit Trail","D":"Historical Trending","A":"Analytic Snapshot","B":"Field History Tracking"},"exam_id":211,"discussion":[{"poster":"tMana","comment_id":"853624","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1727551620.0","content":"The correct answer is C.
