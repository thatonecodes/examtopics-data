You can filter the data and select the fields to return. Unlike a standard DataRaptor Extract (which we describe next), a DataRaptor Turbo Extract doesnâ€™t support formulas or complex output mappings. \n\nIt has two advantages over a standard DataRaptor Extract.\n\nSimpler configuration\nBetter performance at runtime\nAn example of when to use a DataRaptor Turbo Extract is to retrieve contacts for an account (having a specified Id)."},{"timestamp":"1682625420.0","poster":"ppremy","comment_id":"883010","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB. It has better performance at runtime\nD. It supports complex field mappings\n\nExplanation:\nA DataRaptor Turbo Extract has better performance at runtime than a standard DataRaptor Extract because it optimizes the number of API calls needed to retrieve data. It also supports complex field mappings, which makes it more versatile and powerful than a standard DataRaptor Extract. It does not have any advantage related to populating data in PDF or DocuSign format, nor is it easier to configure than a standard DataRaptor Extract.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"AB","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/107756-exam-certified-omnistudio-developer-topic-1-question-56/"},{"id":"xImvZCvh0E8xbvuZ5WYJ","discussion":[{"poster":"mullesh","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe developer will format the information as a table - This can be done through an edit block.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1345752","timestamp":"1737682320.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"ppremy","comment_id":"883012","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct OmniScript element to use in this scenario would be the Text Block.
