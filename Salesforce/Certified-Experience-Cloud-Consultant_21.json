{"pageProps":{"questions":[{"id":"rboGJPeiXM2WS6JzByXF","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nI would go with C 'Theme' Not 'Template'\nWhile creating a custom template could help ensure consistency in the layout and structure of Experience Cloud sites, it may not fully address the branding aspect. Templates primarily focus on defining the structure and layout of a site, including page layouts, components, and navigation. \n\nOn the other hand, a custom theme allows for the consistent application of branding elements such as colors, fonts, logos, and styles across multiple sites. It provides a centralized way to manage branding aspects, ensuring uniformity in the visual presentation and user experience across all Experience Cloud sites. This approach simplifies the process of applying the new style guide and facilitates easy updates or modifications to maintain brand consistency over time.","timestamp":"1729590300.0","poster":"Me_71421","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"content":"Therefore, while creating a custom template could be part of the solution, using a custom theme would be more directly aligned with the goal of unifying branding across all Experience Cloud sites.","poster":"Me_71421","comment_id":"1200074","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1729590300.0"}],"comment_id":"1200073"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/139355-exam-certified-experience-cloud-consultant-topic-1-question/","question_id":101,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Universal Containers (UC) has hired UX designers to help improve brand recognition and has a new style guide it needs to implement to unify branding across all of its Experience Cloud sites.\n\nWhat should UC do to accomplish this?","answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-04-22 11:45:00","answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":216,"unix_timestamp":1713779100,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Reference a shared Bootstrap CSS file in all of the sites.","B":"Create a custom template to apply to all Experience Cloud sites.","C":"Create a custom theme to apply to all Experience Cloud sites.","D":"Send the style guide to site managers to implement."}},{"id":"kwHIEKx5j8oAFStZGs96","exam_id":216,"question_id":102,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Customer Community Plus","A":"Authenticated Service Site User","C":"External Identity","B":"External Community Plus"},"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Universal Containers is looking to build a new self-service site.
