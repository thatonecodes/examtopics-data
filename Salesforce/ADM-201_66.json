User has Read-Only access. Here's why...\nI set it as Required via the Page Layout, not during field creation.\nCreate a text field on Contacts, do not check Required in the field create wizard.\nChoose Read Only during field creation.\nAdd field to Layout and a few Profiles (one should be non-Admin Profile to test with because Admins see Read-Only as Editable.)\nOn your chosen Page Layout (mine was Contacts)\nEdit Page Layout. Find field. Hover over it and click Spanner.\nWithin Page Layout check the box for \"Required\".\nSave Layout. \nLog in as another non-Admin user, who has Read and Edit access to the object.\nCan see, but not Edit the newly required field.\nCan save the record without issue.\nSo \"Required\" on Page Layout does NOT override \"Read Only\" at field creation.","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"148876"}],"question_id":327},{"id":"v6aUF3v3ri7Z8A9kfH0Y","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719853440.0","comment_id":"124404","poster":"pgarser","upvote_count":"1","content":"user license is not part of the profile also.
