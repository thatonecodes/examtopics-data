The administrator can create an assignment rule that assigns leads from the APAC region to an external partner queue for review.\n\nAn approval process can be used to get approval from the Sales Director before the lead is transferred to the external partner. The administrator can create an approval process that sends an email to the Sales Director when a lead is assigned to the external partner queue. The Sales Director can then approve or reject the lead transfer, and the lead will either be assigned to the partner or to a sales team based on the outcome.\n\nTherefore, using these two automation tools, the administrator can ensure that leads are assigned to the correct sales team and transferred to the external partner only after the Sales Director's approval."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kunio","comment_id":"570153","content":"I guess workflow rule is used to check approval process status: updating ownership of the record to partner.","timestamp":"1663457160.0"},{"comment_id":"445492","timestamp":"1647388980.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Can anybody explain the answer?
