A team is a group of users that work together on an account, sales opportunity, or case. Record owners can build a team for each record that they own. The record owner adds team members and specifies the level of access each team member has to the record, so that some team members can have read-only access and others can have read/write access. The record owner can also specify a role for each team member, such as “Executive Sponsor.” In account teams, team members also have access to any contacts, opportunities, and cases associated with an account.\n\nthe site: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.managing_the_sharing_model.htm&type=5","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1289815"},{"poster":"Rishi2375","timestamp":"1720588440.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BCD\n3 of them are correct","comment_id":"1245295"},{"comment_id":"1241404","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.managing_the_sharing_model.htm&language=en_US&type=5","poster":"Nand072","timestamp":"1720009320.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nI think BC","poster":"Chiskie","timestamp":"1715783280.0","comment_id":"1211983"},{"timestamp":"1687254420.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mick86","content":"It should be BC.","comment_id":"928321"},{"comment_id":"886522","timestamp":"1682959800.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: BCD\nThe question says : \"In a private sharing model, the following can be used when Role Hierarchy alone isn't sufficient when providing record access to users (Choose all that apply.)\"\n=> https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.managing_the_sharing_model.htm&type=5 :\n*** Teams is another Method for Controlling Access to Records","poster":"MonBouj"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"JCII","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nTeams is just a grouping measure, just like public group.

For each user, you define the record access wich is basically the same to a manual sharing. \nFor me is a vitaminized manual sharing rule. You can give access but including a role and you have the posibility to make a default team that makes easier to share record with same people frequently than manual sharing."}],"poster":"vid25","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1626110400.0","comment_id":"404837","content":"Teams (Account, Sales and Case) - Can this be explained how"}],"question_id":273},{"id":"YHW0b5VOX0ndh3mzkCkE","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which is a capability of the Cloud Scheduler?
