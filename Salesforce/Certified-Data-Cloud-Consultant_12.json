Leverages reconciliation rules\nReconciliation rules are used to determine which value to select when there are conflicting pieces of information in the data model.

Use batch transforms to create a second data lake object.\n\natch transforms in Salesforce Data Cloud allow for manipulating and restructuring data after it has been ingested. You can use batch transforms to split the point balances (hotel points and airline points) into two separate records, each associated with the same customer. This method is efficient for processing the data within the Data Cloud while keeping the ingestion strategy simple.","poster":"chakri04"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727089620.0","content":"A is correct here","comment_id":"1288063","poster":"Dimi_Mous"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the right answer, changing source data models is not in the scope of a data cloud harmonization","comment_id":"1284308","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726439040.0","poster":"sfarchex137"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer","poster":"fantouch","timestamp":"1726390080.0","comment_id":"1283997","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Answer is A.\n\"Batch transforms are a feature that allows creating new data lake objects based on existing data lake objects and applying transformations on them. This can be useful for splitting, merging, or reshaping data to fit the data model or business requirements. In this case, the consultant can use batch transforms to create a second data lake object that contains only the airline points from the original loyalty data object. The original object can be modified to contain only the hotel points.
