Salesforce no longer enhances PushTopic events with new features and provides limited support for this product. Instead of PushTopic events, consider using Change Data Capture events. To learn about Change Data Capture events, see the Change Data Capture Developer Guide and the Change Data Capture Basics Trailhead module.","timestamp":"1707170460.0","poster":"deusexmorte","comment_id":"1141531"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct option is A. Here’s why:\n\nOption A is correct because PushTopic events are used in Salesforce to send real-time notifications to the client app when changes occur to a record of a specified type.\nOption B is incorrect because Platform Events are used for delivering custom notifications within the Salesforce platform or external systems. They are not designed for real-time tracking of record changes.\nOption C is incorrect because Generic Events are not a standard Salesforce feature for tracking record changes.\nOption D is incorrect because Change Data Capture events are used for capturing changes in Salesforce data, not for real-time tracking of record changes.","poster":"JLee1","comments":[{"content":"Disagree.
