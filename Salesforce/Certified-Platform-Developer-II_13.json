Also e.g. for ‘Agency’. This means for type ‘Customer’ you would set the status ‘Active’ correctly, but for EVERY other type (Prospect, but ALSO other types) you would set the status to ‘Pending’.\n\nAnswer B can’t be right as well, because the WHERE clause is filtering for “Status” IN the map’s keySet, means it checks for a status with values “Customer” or “Prospect” (which are the Account’s Type values).
