Simulate user interaction by leveraging Test.setMock()\nIf the controller interacts with external systems or APIs, using Test.setMock() is a best practice to simulate responses during testing. This ensures tests are isolated and do not depend on external systems.\n\nD. Set query parameters by using getParameters().put\nThe example provided demonstrates setting query parameters (e.g., error parameters for the \"Failure\" page) using getParameters().put. This is essential when testing controllers where page logic depends on query parameters."},{"content":"Selected Answer: BD\nOverview: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.pages.meta/pages/pages_controller_error_handling.htm","poster":"lorenac2","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"758649","timestamp":"1719492420.0"}],"topic":"1","exam_id":223,"question_images":[],"question_text":"What is a best practice when unit testing a controller?
