They are concise, specific, and written in a way that describes the user's need, the functionality they desire, and the value it provides. User stories help the development and implementation teams understand the requirements and objectives of the project, enabling them to plan product decisions that align with stakeholder needs and deliver the most value to the users.\n\nEpics, on the other hand, are larger, more high-level requirements that can be broken down into smaller user stories. Requirements is not a standard Agile term and doesn't align with the approach of defining user stories based on stakeholder needs and value.","poster":"aerodarius"},{"comment_id":"920768","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Alokv","timestamp":"1702312200.0","content":"Answer is B.\nBy defining clear requirements, the BA can articulate the intended results of the work in a way that is precise, measurable, and actionable."}],"question_text":"At the start of a new Agile development project, the Universal Containers product owner asked the business analyst (BA) to clearly define the intended results of the work based on stakeholder needs.

It’s about understanding. First, you identify the need of strategic or tactical importance—the business need. This is an important first step; the business need guides the rest of the project.\nThen, you observe the current state and define the future and transition states that will address the business need. This is a gap analysis—identifying what is different between the current and desired state. Now, assess options for achieving the desired state, including the work or scope required, and recommend the highest value approach for reaching that state.\nThe BA should also assess the risks associated with the identified change solution and what effect those uncertainties might have on the project lifecycle or end goal. Develop a plan of action to address the potential risks.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"RhysB5"},{"content":"None of the options seem to describe the analysis that is being carried out by the BA in this question. \n\nRisk Management is about:\n\n1. Identifying Risks\n2. Determining Probability that a Risk would occur\n3. Evaluating the Impact of such occurence\n4. Planning a Response to a Risk occurence\n5. Documenting & Tracking Risks\n6. Communicating Risks\n\nWhilst Risk Analysis is essentially a subset of Risk Management that covers the measurement of the likelihood and potential impact of risks when they occur.\n\nSo, the closest I can associate the activity in this question to Risk Impact Analysis. No of these options is directly synonymous with it.
