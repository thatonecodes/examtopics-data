Moving it to flows and process builders could work but there are other options that would be easier to implement.

It’s not static across the server or the entire organization. The value of a static variable persists within the context of a single transaction and is reset across transaction boundaries. For example, if an Apex DML request causes a trigger to fire multiple times, the static variables persist across these trigger invocations.\n\nTo store information that is shared across instances of a class, use a static variable. All instances of the same class share a single copy of the static variable. For example, all triggers that a single transaction spawns can communicate with each other by viewing and updating static variables in a related class. A recursive trigger can use the value of a class variable to determine when to exit the recursion.","poster":"Liquad","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1630053120,"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Deactivate the trigger and move the logic into a Process or Flow","C":"Use a static variable to prevent the trigger from executing more than once","B":"Deactivate the workflow rule to prevent the field update from executing","D":"Use a global variable to prevent the trigger from executing more than once"},"isMC":true,"answer":"C"}],"exam":{"provider":"Salesforce","isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"name":"Certified Platform Developer II","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"id":223,"numberOfQuestions":281},"currentPage":6},"__N_SSP":true}
