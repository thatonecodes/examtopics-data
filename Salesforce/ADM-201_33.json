Tasks allow you to track the specific actions you plan to perform or have performed.\nB. Email Alerts cannot track specific actions.\n\nExplanation:\n\n • A. Tasks: Tasks in Salesforce are used to track specific actions that need to be completed (planned) or have been completed (performed). They provide a way to document actions like making a call, sending a follow-up, or conducting a meeting.\n • B. Email Alerts: While Email Alerts can notify users about certain events, they do not inherently track actions. They are simply communication tools and do not log or track actions like Tasks do.\n • C and D are incorrect because they reverse the functionality. Tasks track actions, while Email Alerts do not.","poster":"jeet992014","comment_id":"1321410"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1292366","content":"if A is corrrect, D cannot be correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Nand072","timestamp":"1727866260.0"},{"timestamp":"1724488560.0","comment_id":"1271594","content":"D is wrong: Tasks are specifically designed to track actions.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Nand072"}],"timestamp":"1707162420.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"eacunha","comment_id":"1141404","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA.
