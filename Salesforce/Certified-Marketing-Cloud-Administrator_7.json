If they wish to include a campaign identifier to the links within a specific campaign message, the UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) campaign value should be configured at the message level. This means that for each individual marketing message or email, a unique UTM campaign value should be assigned. This will allow for detailed tracking and analytics for that specific campaign.\n\nFor example, if a particular campaign is labeled 'Winter_Sale', the UTM campaign value for all links within messages associated with that campaign would carry the UTM code 'utm_campaign=Winter_Sale'.
