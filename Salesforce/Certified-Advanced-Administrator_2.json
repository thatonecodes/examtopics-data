This information can be used to detect potential security breaches or unauthorized access to data. The administrator can access the Users Login History by going to Setup, then selecting Security Controls, and finally, selecting Login History. From there, the administrator can view login attempts, logouts, and other related events for all users in the organization.\n\nThe Setup Audit Trail tracks changes that are made in an organization's setup area, such as changes to users, profiles, roles, and other configuration settings. The audit trail captures changes made by administrators, developers, or other users with appropriate permissions. The audit trail can be used to identify who made changes to setup areas, when changes were made, and what changes were made. However, the audit trail does not provide information about user login activity or who may be logging in as other users.
