Personalize the email content.\nPersonalizing the email content is a best practice in email marketing. By using personalization, you can tailor the content of the email to each individual subscriber based on their preferences, behavior, or demographic information. Personalized emails are more relevant to the recipients, which can lead to higher engagement and conversion rates. For a targeted email campaign promoting new winter offerings, personalization could include using the subscriber's name, recommending products based on past purchases or browsing history, and customizing content based on their location or preferences related to winter products.\n\n\nOption B, \"Send to the entire subscriber base,\" is not a best practice in email marketing when it comes to targeted email campaigns. Sending emails to the entire subscriber base without proper segmentation can lead to sending irrelevant content to some subscribers, resulting in lower engagement and potentially higher unsubscribe rates.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1700355060.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"It’s not B because it’s targeted email campaign.. should be send to targeted audience with personalized content.","poster":"SFDevGroup","comment_id":"721680"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Why not B ?","timestamp":"1698753360.0","poster":"Pardot","comment_id":"708390"}]},{"id":"DMLHwHgqtM9iCqyirFx2","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/122714-exam-certified-marketing-cloud-email-specialist-topic-1/","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Keep total weight with images at 800KB or lower.","A":"Use one file type for all images in the email.","C":"Increase DPI and file size for image display.","D":"Rely on image-only emails to engage subscribers."},"exam_id":220,"question_id":128,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728234960.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Use one file type for all images in the email.","comment_id":"1026842","poster":"Olsosms"}],"timestamp":"2023-10-06 19:16:00","question_text":"Northern Trail Outfitters wants to ensure a good user experience when subscribers read their emails.\nWhat best practice should be employed?","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1696612560,"answer":"B"},{"id":"90OxpsCznOJcqE9U2q52","answer":"AD","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"If the Customer_ID field does not exist on the All Subscribers List, the email send will fail.","A":"The email address and Subscriber Key will be added to the All Subscribers List.","D":"The subscriber will be added to the All Subscribers List with a status of Active.","B":"The Primary Key and demographic data will be added to the All Subscribers List."},"exam_id":220,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-10-06 19:17:00","answers_community":[],"question_id":129,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1179061","timestamp":"1726900080.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"srikanthreddyw","content":"AD is answer.
