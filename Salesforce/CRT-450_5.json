Look for heap size in debug logs. If heap size is approaching the limit, investigate it and refactor the code.\n\n2. Use the 'Transient' keyword with variables. It is used to declare instance variables that cannot be saved, and shouldn’t be transmitted as part of the view state for a Visualforce page.\n\n3. Use Limit methods. Use heap limits methods in your Apex code to monitor/manage the heap during execution.\n\n4. Reduce heap size during runtime by removing items from the collection as you iterate over it.\n\n5. Use SOQL for loops. To avoid heap size limits, developers should always use a SOQL \"for\" loop to process query results that return many records.","comment_id":"534175","timestamp":"1643323980.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"zanstaszek9"}],"upvote_count":"2","poster":"HR444","content":"But that Salesforce article linked by @ugaponova seems to say using Transient variables IS a good way to do this.... which of you is correct?","timestamp":"1629154800.0"}],"comment_id":"115665","timestamp":"1592751960.0","poster":"AK2020","content":"C & D\n\nA)Use the \"transient\" keyword when declaring variables\n\nYes you were spot on with transient. Declaring a variable as transient wont' make it part of view state. Also declaring a transient variable will make sure its not serialized(JSON.deserialize). But it will still be part of heap. Transient variable has nothing to do with heap, Thus it won't be a correct option.\n\nB)Query and store fields from a related object in a collection when updating related objects\n\nThis feels illogical and overhead to store fields of related object in a collection, and is wrong in my opinion.\n\nC) Remove or set a collection to null after use\n\nThere is garbage collection and heap deallocation. It happens when the block where you have declared the variable ends. If you wanna free up heap before the end of block and you don't have any use of that variable later then it makes sense to make it null and free up some heap. It's correct and good practice to do so if playing with a huge chunk of records\n\nD) Best practice to avoid SOQL for loops","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1727846580.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"PrivateUser","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA & D\nAccording to official information:","comment_id":"1292224"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1285074","poster":"Thanh201","timestamp":"1726557600.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC & D In Correct:\nThe transient keyword is only applicable in Visualforce controllers, not triggers."},{"timestamp":"1708943520.0","poster":"PriyankN","comment_id":"1159600","upvote_count":"1","content":"A&D"},{"poster":"Etwang","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nAD","comment_id":"1140612","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707093540.0"},{"poster":"chucksback","upvote_count":"1","content":"The question is asking for a trigger.
