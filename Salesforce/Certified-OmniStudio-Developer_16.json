Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nWith a conditional FlexCard State, the developer can define conditions that determine which elements are displayed based on the values of specific fields in the input data. In this case, the FlexCard would initially display the account information, and the contact information would be displayed only if the user selects an option or if certain fields have values.\n\nOption A is not recommended because the collapsible property on a block element only hides or shows an entire block, not individual fields or elements within the block.","comment_id":"882859","poster":"ppremy","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":221,"answer_images":[]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true,"name":"Certified OmniStudio Developer","numberOfQuestions":77,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Salesforce","id":221},"currentPage":16},"__N_SSP":true}
