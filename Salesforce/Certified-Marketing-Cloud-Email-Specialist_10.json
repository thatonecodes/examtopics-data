Incorrect Sending Relationship\n\nThe sending relationship defines how the system should send emails to the recipients. If the sending relationship is set up incorrectly, it can prevent emails from being sent to the intended recipients. It's crucial to ensure that the sending relationship is properly configured to send emails to the specified group of customers. The other options, such as having two fields with 'EmailAddress' data type or failure to choose the send classification, might also cause issues but are less likely to be the primary cause of the send failure in this context.","comment_id":"1028295"},{"timestamp":"1724410200.0","poster":"Aisha_Khalid","comment_id":"988203","upvote_count":"1","content":"Why not B?"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1692787800,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/118850-exam-certified-marketing-cloud-email-specialist-topic-1/","exam_id":220,"timestamp":"2023-08-23 12:50:00","answer_ET":"A","answer":"B","question_text":"Northern Trail Outfitters is sending a welcome email to a new group of customers.

The difference between web-safe fonts and web/custom fonts is very important. A web-safe font is a font that is installed on every computer. Examples include Arial, Comic Sans, Courier, Georgia, Tahoma, and Verdana. You can consider them a “safe bet” when rendering the text as you intended.\n\nWeb-safe fonts are the only fonts that work in the desktop Outlooks. Conversely, web fonts, also called custom fonts, are not widely supported; they work only in Apple Mail, iOS Mail, Samsung, Mail, Outlook for Mac, and Outlook App (Android) at the time of writing.\n\nMost brand fonts are custom fonts. To use them, the font files must be hosted on a server somewhere. The most commonly used font file types are woff, woff2, ttf, and oft, though woff is most commonly used.","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2023-03-06 19:57:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/101687-exam-certified-marketing-cloud-email-specialist-topic-1/","question_id":48},{"id":"Lt2pHB1ZQEo1eIuhFTqn","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/105672-exam-certified-marketing-cloud-email-specialist-topic-1/","answer_description":"","question_text":"After receiving approval from their team, a marketer scheduled a promotional email send.
