Use the products related list to associate the different configurations with the opportunity.

Updating the Amount field with the most likely purchase price allows for accurate forecasting of the deal. This approach ensures that the Opportunity remains updated with the most relevant information, while avoiding cluttering the Opportunity list with multiple records for the same deal.","comment_id":"853592","upvote_count":"1","poster":"tMana"}],"answer":"D","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_id":81,"unix_timestamp":1680030480,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"f8C6IbGkoQG2egRw1qpf","isMC":true,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1680030660,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/salesforce/view/104250-exam-certified-advanced-administrator-topic-1-question-196/","choices":{"A":"Customizable product schedule page layouts cannot be modified.","D":"Line Item Schedule is unavailable in Process Builder and Workflow.","B":"To remove a product schedule completely, remove it from the standard price book.","C":"The Product Schedule is unavailable in Process Builder and Flow."},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.products_considerations_for_using_schedules.htm&type=5","poster":"Joel31113","timestamp":"1729680240.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"878223"},{"content":"D:Before enabling product schedules, the administrator at Universal Containers should consider that to remove a product schedule completely, it must be removed from all price books that include it.
