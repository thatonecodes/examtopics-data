Very detailed — It should be prescriptive for new users following an unfamiliar process.\n\nSince the process involves onboarding a new user group to a Service Cloud implementation, it is important to provide a very detailed process map. New users may not be familiar with the system or the specific workflows, so the map should be prescriptive and guide them through the steps in a clear, easy-to-understand manner. This will help ensure the new users understand the process thoroughly, reduce confusion, and lead to a smoother onboarding experience.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1356313","poster":"Salesforceexpert12"},{"timestamp":"1735772700.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1335309","poster":"Froydis","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe answer should be C:\nAccording to Salesforce’s Trailhead module on Business Process Mapping, creating detailed process maps is essential for understanding and improving workflows. Detailed maps help identify flaws in a process and determine where improvements should be made, which is particularly beneficial when onboarding new users to ensure they comprehend each step of the process.

In other words, teams using this workflow are more open to taking on a last-minute request.

It enables teams to visualize work in progress and limit work in progress to a sustainable level. This matches choice B's description of project-based work that can be divided into smaller pieces.\n\nChoices A and C describe types of work, but do not align well with the strengths of Kanban. Kanban would not be ideal if outages require immediate handling or if work lacks planning. It relies on work being able to be managed in an iterative, incremental way.
