Either remote object or @remoteAction requires a JS callback,promise, async&await function to parse the JSON result from back-End to client side. For example, you can easily construct a wrapper class using @remoteAction in Apex where information from multiple queries or proxy variables can be brought together. For remote object you will need JS to do \"promise.all\" in order to cover that kind of wrapper in Apex, which will be very complex and hard to read","upvote_count":"14","timestamp":"1625854980.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
