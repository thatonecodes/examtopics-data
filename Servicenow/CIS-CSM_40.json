Under the Customer Service Executive dashboard there is a Cost Information tab which allows you to see Total Cost per Case as well as the Cost per Case under different indicators (channel, product, & account). This feature is ONLY available through the \"Performance Analytics - Content Pack - Financial Management for Customer Service\". The question doesn't specify which PACP makes it possible but I think that is intentional to test knowledge. \n\nThe only way I can see it being false is if \"Performance Analytics Content Pack for Customer Service\" were a real thing, but it's not. SN doesn't offer a generalized content pack. They're all specialized to match the specific needs of the customer. \n\nSource: https://docs.servicenow.com/en-US/bundle/vancouver-customer-service-management/page/product/customer-service-management/concept/csm-executive-dashboard.html","comment_id":"1026785","poster":"123Destiny","timestamp":"1696608420.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1038839","content":"**CORRECTION** This false.
