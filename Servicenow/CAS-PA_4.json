This is almost verbatim from the docs page: RELATED LIST CONDITIONS: Include a relationship with another table in the conditions. For example, you could create an element filter on the Groups breakdown source, which uses the Group [sys_user_group] table. If you added a related list condition on Incident [incident]->Assignment group, you would get only groups that had an incident assigned to them. If this condition included [[Created][on][Last 6 Months]], you would get groups that were assigned an incident that was created within the last six months.\n\nhttps://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/xanadu-now-intelligence/page/use/performance-analytics/concept/c_BreakdownElementFilters.html","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Shdwklown","timestamp":"1725038280.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"To get only groups that had an incident assigned to them on the Elements Filter record for the ‘Groups’ Breakdown Source, you use the condition:\n\nB.

The indicator facts table is not included in the Breakdown mappings.\n\nFor a Breakdown to be associated with existing Indicators, the Breakdown mappings need to include the facts table used by those Indicators. If the facts table isn't included in the mappings for the Breakdown, the system won't be able to establish the necessary relationships, thus preventing the association of the Indicators with the new Breakdown.
