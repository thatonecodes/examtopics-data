The impact, urgency, and priority of the incident. These factors play a significant role in determining the severity level of a security incident. The severity field reflects the technical severity or criticality of the incident based on its potential impact, urgency for resolution, and the assigned priority. By considering the impact, urgency, and priority, organizations can assess the severity of an incident and allocate appropriate resources and response efforts accordingly.\n\nWhile the cost of the response to the security breach (option A), the time taken to resolve the security incident (option C), and the business value of the affected asset (option D) may be important considerations in incident response, they are not direct influences on the severity field in ServiceNow's Security Incident module. However, these factors can indirectly impact the assessment of impact, urgency, and priority, which, in turn, can contribute to determining the severity of the incident.","comment_id":"920632","timestamp":"1686484500.0","poster":"Remo878"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"949556","timestamp":"1689146100.0","poster":"sephereth","upvote_count":"1","content":"D is wrong, it should be B"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nd is correct","comment_id":"912367","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1685650560.0","poster":"stophs"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (73%)","B (27%)"],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-06-01 22:16:00","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"The severity field of the security incident is influenced by what?","question_id":56,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"gW9LV37OiKdgduHB9tAh","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"What is calculated as an arithmetic mean taking into consideration different values in the CI, Security Incident, and User records?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAccording to the eBook of Security Incident Response ( Tokyo ) page 227\nThe Risk Score is calculated as an arithmetic mean, representing the risk based on CI business impact, Security Incident Business Impact, Security Incident Priority, Sec Incident Severity and User Business Impact","timestamp":"1729418220.0","comment_id":"1048613","poster":"Sazeka","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD IS CORRECT\nhttps://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-security-management/page/product/security-incident-response/reference/setup-assistant-reference.html#title_create-process-definition-sir","timestamp":"1717504500.0","poster":"stophs","comment_id":"914586","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/servicenow/view/111107-exam-cis-sir-topic-1-question-40-discussion/","answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1685882100,"isMC":true,"exam_id":150,"timestamp":"2023-06-04 14:35:00","question_id":57,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Business Impact","C":"Severity","D":"Risk Score","A":"Priority"},"topic":"1"},{"id":"GhW7MEBIV404sQiqnED9","answer":"D","topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"Alice_the_2nd","comment_id":"1067138","timestamp":"1731232740.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe User Reported Phishing inbound actions available prior to the Security Incident Response 9.0 release are now disabled.
