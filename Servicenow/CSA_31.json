It allows Service Desk agents to view the health status of CIs supporting a particular service and identify any active issues or incidents associated with those CIs. By analyzing the CI Health Dashboard, agents can gain insights into the affected CIs and their current status, enabling them to trace the impact of issues on the supporting CIs of a service.\n\nWhile the CI Dependency View provides a visual representation of CI relationships, it may not directly provide real-time information about active issues or incidents associated with specific CIs.
