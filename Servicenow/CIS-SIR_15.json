This role provides access to the REST API Explorer without granting all the administrative privileges associated with the \"admin\" role.\n\nThe correct answer depends on the configuration and permissions in your specific ServiceNow instance. While \"admin\" could potentially access the REST API Explorer, it's not the recommended or specific role for this purpose.
