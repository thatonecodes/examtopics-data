If your work Instance use LDAP or Azure Sync or some other method then good for you but these are not configured OOB and the question doesn't reference them. Either way, the very first step is account setup regardless of means.\nAE - best practice is to assign Role(s) to the Group (especially for dependencies) so ITIL should have been added to these already therefore adding the new user to either Group will allow them to inherit ITIL Role.\n\nCreating a Group specifically to assign the ITIL Role would not be best practice as it could be removed independently of other access that requires it to be in place.
