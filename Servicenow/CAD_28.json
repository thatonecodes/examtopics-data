The property values are the values as they exist in the runtime environment.\n\nThe previous object is also automatically instantiated from the GlideRecord class. The previous object's properties are also all fields from a record and the GlideRecord methods. The property values are the values for the record fields when they were loaded from the database and before any changes were made.
