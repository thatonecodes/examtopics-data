The formula returns the Breakdown score as a percentage of the overall score.\n\nWhen a breakdown is applied to a formula indicator like this, it computes the score for each breakdown element as a percentage of the total number of new incidents. If the curly braces were meant to represent a constant or a manually set number, the formula would not be syntactically correct, but given the context, it seems they are intended to be square brackets, which would indicate a reference to an indicator.","comment_id":"1185079"}],"timestamp":"2024-03-28 23:56:00","answers_community":[]},{"id":"0n14g1qgjXvixMRTEgTH","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1734282420.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's not C.
