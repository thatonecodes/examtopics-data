The frequency of an Indicator can differ from that of an Indicator Source - Indicators can be set to aggregate data at a different frequency than their source, for instance, collecting data daily but rolling it up into a weekly indicator.\n\nD. Indicator Sources with a Monthly frequency can still be collected in a Daily job - While the frequency sets the default collection schedule, it's technically possible to collect data more frequently than the frequency setting would suggest, though this may not always be meaningful or necessary for the given Indicator.","poster":"b3de868","timestamp":"1727558220.0","comment_id":"1185090","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"60BcsrTfKanpUaqEIt5W","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/servicenow/view/137449-exam-cas-pa-topic-1-question-69-discussion/","question_text":"After importing an Update set from another instance, the Indicators, Breakdowns, and Jobs are imported correctly, but all of the Dashboards are completely empty.

If this step is skipped, the dashboards may appear empty on the target instance because their definitions and associated widgets were not properly included in the Update Set.","poster":"b3de868","comment_id":"1185092"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-03-29 00:26:00","exam_id":140,"question_images":[],"answer":"D","answers_community":[]},{"id":"98qUJH6GGcK5oKvF724I","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Team Calendar","B":"Maintenance Calendar","D":"On-Call Calendar","C":"Custom Business Calendar"},"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"What calendar type can you use to analyse scores using time periods?","question_id":64,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-03-25 03:49:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/servicenow/view/137130-exam-cas-pa-topic-1-question-7-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1711334940,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1736021100.0","poster":"draken1107","comment_id":"1336518","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC- Custom is the option selected when you look at the calendar in Analytics hub score trends"},{"timestamp":"1727225340.0","poster":"b3de868","comment_id":"1182120","upvote_count":"2","content":"To analyze scores using time periods, you can use a \"Custom Business Calendar\".

By establishing this relation, when a user drills into an Assignment Group Manager Breakdown element, the system can dynamically filter the subsequent view to show only those Assignment Groups that are related to the selected manager.
