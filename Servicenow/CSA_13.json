I have difficulties figuring out the question itself:\n- The question does indeed state \"...Return the instance...\", to the letter.\n- What on Earth is \"Return the instance\" ? Is it a typo for \"Return TO the instance\" (the original one) ? \n- \"Return TO the instance\" to me would definitely mean answering \"End Impersonation\"\n- \"Return THE instance\" could mean anything (unless it's a specific technical term). And it could, in this case, be answer D.\n\nI did choose \"End Impersonation\", but I was really hesitating. I passed the exam, but am not sure at all what the correct answer was to this question.\n\nSpeaking of which - this exam was way easier than the first one which I failed.
