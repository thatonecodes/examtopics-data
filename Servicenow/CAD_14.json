If there is a matching access control rule, then the system evaluates if the user has the permissions required to access the object and operation. If an access control rule specifies more than one permission, then the user must meet all permissions to gain access to the object and operation. Failing any one permission check prevents the user from accessing the matching object and operation.\nIf a user does not meet the permissions of the first matching rule, the system evaluates the permissions of the next matching access control rule as specified by the access control processing order. If the user fails to meet the permissions of any matching access control rule, the system denies access to the requested object and operation.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"MagdaGrs","comment_id":"968429","timestamp":"1722452220.0"},{"timestamp":"1710160800.0","comment_id":"835977","poster":"Alice_Steele","content":"Selected Answer: C\ncorrect is C","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"789961","poster":"Mike49707","timestamp":"1706385060.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer: C"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/tokyo/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_securingapps_tokyo_access_controls_evaluation_order","comment_id":"739528","poster":"Bob_Loblaw","timestamp":"1702074240.0"},{"comment_id":"634087","poster":"Krundol","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt's C:\nWhen deciding whether to grant or deny access, the ACL is searched from the most specific to the most generic match.","timestamp":"1689861480.0"},{"timestamp":"1689305280.0","comment_id":"631138","upvote_count":"3","poster":"14006044","content":"Correct is C."},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct answer is C","timestamp":"1685195520.0","poster":"parcerocarl","comment_id":"608106"},{"poster":"VarunV007","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption C","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"557588","timestamp":"1677528600.0"}]},{"id":"bE271AsuauAE7wf5KLGo","unix_timestamp":1634257920,"exam_id":139,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Correct answer is B. gs.hasRole\nBusiness Rule is server-side, so it uses GlideSystem API. gs.hasRoleExactly doesn't exist","upvote_count":"16","comment_id":"462320","timestamp":"1634257920.0","poster":"nsmcan"},{"timestamp":"1645809240.0","poster":"Vinothkumar_Rangasamy","content":"Correct ans :B","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"556130"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724156640.0","poster":"RoadtoCad","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOnly gs is for server side, g_form is for client side","comment_id":"1269446"},{"timestamp":"1715500500.0","poster":"adesogus","content":"hasRoleExactly only exists in the Glide User (g_user) class","comment_id":"1210175","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"MagdaGrs","timestamp":"1690829940.0","comment_id":"968433","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOnly gs is for server side, g_form is for client side.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"914072","content":"gs.hasRole is corect. g_form.hasRole and g_form.hasRoleExactly not exist","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Raz_Maz","timestamp":"1685847600.0"},{"timestamp":"1678538460.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nserver side is gs","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Alice_Steele","comment_id":"835979"},{"comment_id":"742155","content":"Selected Answer: B\nserver side api","poster":"SNAngler","timestamp":"1670797020.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer B is correct","comment_id":"634089","poster":"Krundol","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1658325660.0"},{"poster":"arunmech2001","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"577879","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect Answer is B","timestamp":"1648589880.0"}],"answer":"B","question_id":69,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"g_form.hasRoleExactly('admin')","D":"gs.hasRoleExactly('admin')","B":"gs.hasRole('admin')","C":"g_form.hasRole('admin')"},"question_text":"In a Business Rule, which one of the following returns true if the currently logged in user has the admin role?","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-10-15 02:32:00","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/servicenow/view/64118-exam-cad-topic-1-question-29-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"yyW6AYgbnMIAtB06qqLz","answer_description":"","exam_id":139,"choices":{"A":"Enter the name of the Application in the Global search field","B":"Open the list of Update Sets for the instance","C":"Examine the Application Files Related List in the application to be published","D":"Open the artifact records individually to verify the value in the Application field"},"question_id":70,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/servicenow/view/66877-exam-cad-topic-1-question-3-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (88%)","12%"],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2021-11-28 13:33:00","isMC":true,"question_text":"To see what scripts, reports, and other application artifacts will be in a published application:","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1638102780,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1638102780.0","poster":"PR0704","upvote_count":"11","content":"Selected Answer: C\nthis is correct","comment_id":"489120"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733160240.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\ncorrect answer is C","comment_id":"1321048","poster":"AnnaHr"},{"timestamp":"1712127780.0","poster":"BenBose","comment_id":"1188508","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is B because the question states that the application has been published.
