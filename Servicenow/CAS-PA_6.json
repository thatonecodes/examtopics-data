New indicators default to \"Visible to Everyone\". Though, on several new indicators I built in both a D.C. and Xanadu instance had the \"Visible to all roles\" unselected, and no roles defined. None of the options seem to be correct, B is just the closest based on personal observations and testing. Though, C could be close if you interpret \"role required is pa_admin\" as meaning you need pa_admin to create an indicator. The question wording suggests that it's just looking for what the default settings are when creating an indicator though, so I'm still leaning towards B.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1725040920.0","poster":"Shdwklown"},{"poster":"b3de868","timestamp":"1711511220.0","content":"The default Access Control options for a new Indicator are generally set to be more restrictive to safeguard data security.
