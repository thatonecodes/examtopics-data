Conditional Expressions, and E. User Criteria are permission requirements that can be used to define Access Control rules in ServiceNow.\n\nAccess Control rules are used to define what data and functionality can be accessed by different users or groups in ServiceNow. To define an Access Control rule, administrators can specify the permission requirements for the rule, such as the roles or groups that are allowed to access the data or functionality, the conditions under which access is allowed, and any user criteria that must be met. Conditional expressions are used to specify complex conditions for the rule, while user criteria can be used to limit access based on user attributes, such as department or location.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"751215","timestamp":"1671554400.0","content":"ABD are correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"saiakhilpalle"},{"timestamp":"1665069600.0","content":"Selected Answer: ABD\nABD is correct.","comment_id":"687919","poster":"rpersonal2","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2022-05-10 21:14:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":["ABD (80%)","ABE (20%)"],"question_id":326,"exam_id":152,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Assignment Rules","E":"User Criteria","B":"Conditional Expressions","F":"Groups","D":"Scripts","A":"Roles"},"answer_ET":"ABD","answer":"ABD","answer_description":"","question_text":"Access Control rules may be defined with which of the following permission requirements?
