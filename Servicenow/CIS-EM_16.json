Later in this tutorial, you will learn about the dashboard and\nwhat an application service looks like when an alert is associated with a\nCI.\nTypes of application services\nEvent Management classifies application services into the following\ntypes:\nTechnical services\nA technical service is a dynamic grouping of CIs based on some\ncommon criteria. For example, a technical service could be comprised\nof all web servers or all Oracle databases for a specific location, like\nNorth America.\nApplication services\nAn application service can consist of discovered services, manual\nservices, or both. A discovered service is an application service\nthat the Service Mapping application finds (if your organization uses\nService Mapping). A manual service is an application service that your\nadministrator configures by selecting and adding each CI and specifying\nthe relationships between CIs.","comment_id":"1046006","poster":"Pampino_sun"},{"timestamp":"1732101120.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct.\nIn the training material:\nTechnical services are published to service owners and typically underpin one or more business or application services.
