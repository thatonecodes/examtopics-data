For example, if the status of a security incident record changes from \"New\" to \"In Progress\", this could trigger a flow that notifies the assigned security analyst and provides them with relevant information about the incident.\n\nSchedules (B):\n\nA flow can also be triggered based on a predefined schedule. For instance, a flow could be configured to run a network scan for potential security vulnerabilities every night at midnight. In this case, the arrival of the scheduled time (midnight) would trigger the flow.\n\nRecord Inserts (D):\n\nA record insert, or the creation of a new record in a database, can trigger a flow. For example, if a new user account is created in a system, this could trigger a flow that automatically sends a welcome email to the new user and assigns them to the appropriate user groups based on their role.","timestamp":"1717491360.0","comment_id":"914268"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"sephereth","comment_id":"948456","timestamp":"1720653540.0","content":"Selected Answer: ABD\ncorrect answer is A B and D"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/servicenow/view/111080-exam-cis-sir-topic-1-question-18-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-06-04 10:56:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"ABD","unix_timestamp":1685868960},{"id":"WabH2cKyBaYJaMy8eymc","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Any user who has Response Tasks on the incident","D":"The Affected User on the incident","B":"The analyst assigned to the ticket","A":"Any user that adds a worknote to the ticket"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Which one of the following users is automatically added to the Request Assessments list?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/servicenow/view/111912-exam-cis-sir-topic-1-question-19-discussion/","answer":"B","exam_id":150,"question_id":33,"unix_timestamp":1686492900,"discussion":[{"poster":"5650bdf","timestamp":"1742245980.0","comment_id":"1399851","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","poster":"NokoNice","timestamp":"1735325640.0","comment_id":"1332581"},{"timestamp":"1722183540.0","content":"Answer is B, all assigned users/analyst and person who added manually to list","comment_id":"965671","upvote_count":"3","poster":"sgawas"},{"poster":"Remo878","content":"B.
