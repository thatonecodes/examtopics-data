The **`input`** queue is used for incoming messages (like probe results from MID Servers), and the **`output`** queue is used for outgoing messages (like sensor triggers sent to the MID Server). \n\n- **Sensor records** typically have a queue value of **`output`** because they represent commands or triggers sent to the MID Server for further processing. \n- **Probe records** have a queue value of **`input`** because they are results or responses sent back to the ServiceNow instance for processing. \n\nLet me know if you need further clarification!","poster":"16c3e9f","comment_id":"1320551","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733056620.0"},{"content":"A.
