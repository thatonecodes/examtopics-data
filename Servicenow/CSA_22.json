Since we know there are active incidents for the Network and Hardware groups, and there’s no option in the answers to indicate all tasks are assigned to people, then the only option left is that the manager is not a member of the Network and Hardware groups (answer D) \nAnswer B is NOT correct because access to Apps and Modules is controlled by roles, and you have to have either the itil role or the sn_change_task role to access the Service Desk Module. Assuming the manager does not have the itil role, means has at least sn_change_task role to get to My groups work. In this case will see any Change related tasks for the 2 groups.
