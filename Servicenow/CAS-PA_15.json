Once or On Demand\n\nHistorical collection is typically used to capture past data or to initialize indicators with historical values. After the initial data set is collected, regular (daily, weekly, monthly) collections usually take over. Therefore, setting historical collection to run once or on demand is a practical approach to avoid unnecessary load on the system and to ensure that only the required historical data is collected.","timestamp":"1727562780.0","comment_id":"1185108"}],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1711672380},{"id":"jnPbDZEvz7x1V1EZ1XSi","isMC":true,"exam_id":140,"question_text":"When is a script required to perform a Breakdown Mapping for a Breakdown based on a Bucket group?","answer_ET":"A","question_id":73,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1711672560,"answer":"A","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1388246","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
