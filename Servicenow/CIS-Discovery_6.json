Service Mapping and Discovery share a set of preconfigured patterns that cover most of the commonly used devices and applications. Patterns can be of the infrastructure or application type. Infrastructure patterns are used only by Discovery for creating lists of devices. Application patterns serve both Service Mapping and Discovery, which use the same application patterns for their purposes. For example, Discovery runs the horizontal discovery with the Apache Web Server pattern to find and list all Apache Web Servers in your organization. Service Mapping runs the top-down discovery using the same pattern to discover a specific Apache Web Server and place it on an application service map.\n\nhttps://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/vancouver-it-operations-management/page/product/service-mapping/concept/c_MappingPatternsCustomization.html"}],"answer":"CD","question_id":30,"timestamp":"2023-10-27 15:20:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["CD (100%)"]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"id":142,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Servicenow","numberOfQuestions":104,"name":"CIS-Discovery","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":6},"__N_SSP":true}
