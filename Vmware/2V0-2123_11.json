A single Enhanced Linked Mode group consisting of eight vCenter instances in one Single Sign-On domain.\n\nEnhanced Linked Mode (ELM) is designed to provide a single view of multiple vCenter instances within a single vSphere Client session. It allows you to search and manage the inventory across these vCenter instances seamlessly while maintaining a single sign-on domain for ease of administration. This configuration aligns with the stated requirements. Hybrid Linked Mode typically involves linking on-premises and cloud-based vCenter servers, which is not required for the scenario described.","comment_id":"1044259","poster":"StingVN"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: C\nJoin up to 15 vCenter Server appliance deployments with vCenter Enhanced Linked Mode in a single vSphere Single Sign-On domain\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-installation/GUID-4394EA1C-0800-4A6A-ADBF-D35C41868C53.html#:~:text=join%20up%20to%2015%20vCenter%20Server%20appliance%20deployments%20with%20vCenter%20Enhanced%20Linked%20Mode%20in%20a%20single%20vSphere%20Single%20Sign%2DOn%20domain.","timestamp":"1725795000.0","comment_id":"1002398"}],"question_id":55,"question_text":"An administrator is tasked with deploying a new on-premises software-defined data center (SDDC) that will contain a total of eight VMware vCenter instances.\nThe following requirements must be met:\nAll vCenter instances should be visible in a single vSphere Client session.\nAll vCenter inventory should be searchable from a single vSphere Client session.\nAny administrator must be able to complete operations on any vCenter instance using a single set of credentials.\nWhat should the administrator configure to meet these requirements?","timestamp":"2023-05-31 13:31:00","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","answer":"C","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1685532660,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/110670-exam-2v0-2123-topic-1-question-49-discussion/","isMC":true}],"exam":{"name":"2V0-21.23","isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Vmware","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":110,"isBeta":false,"id":235,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":11},"__N_SSP":true}
