This approach allows an administrator to use a single SDDC as the recovery site for multiple on-premises environments and other cloud SDDCs. This provides a centralized, cloud-based disaster recovery solution that can be managed from the VMware Cloud console.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a single SDDC can be paired with multiple remote sites, not just 25.\n\nOption C is incorrect because VMware Site Recovery is not an add-on that is deployed in the vSphere Web Client. It is a standalone product that is integrated with VMware Cloud on AWS.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while VMware Site Recovery can support multiple protected sites and a shared recovery site, this is not the only supported approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
