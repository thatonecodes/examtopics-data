VMkernel networks are not used by these hosts for vSphere HA communications. To contain vSphere HA traffic to a subset of the ESX console networks, use the allowedNetworks advanced option.\n\nOn ESXi hosts in the cluster, vSphere HA communications, by default, travel over VMkernel networks. With an ESXi host, if you want to use a network other than the one vCenter Server uses to communicate with the host for vSphere HA, you must explicitly enable the Management traffic check box."},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"gabrielramos","timestamp":"1589810880.0","content":"Answare is correct!\n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-B1906BCD-E538-4FFF-AAE9-5403FE253F38.html","comment_id":"91372"}],"exam_id":230,"timestamp":"2020-05-18 16:08:00","question_id":26,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-B1906BCD-E538-4FFF-AAE9-5403FE253F38.html","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which type of network traffic is used for vSphere High Availability (HA) by default?","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/20871-exam-2v0-0119-topic-1-question-32-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Management network traffic","C":"vMotion network traffic","D":"VM Network traffic","B":"iSCSI Port Binding network traffic"}},{"id":"tpEGcWuhYGXBIRO7PrYo","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which is a valid requirement for deploying the vCenter Server Appliance 6.x to a DRS cluster?","unix_timestamp":1565338980,"answer":"D","question_id":27,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1565338980.0","upvote_count":"33","comment_id":"6374","poster":"AlexD","content":"B is correct, https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-E278E0F2-8983-4246-9903-50C4022F1273.html","comments":[{"content":"Agree on this","poster":"hpesoj","comment_id":"32641","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1577301420.0"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1588355640.0","poster":"rickyspanish","comment_id":"82279","content":"You must select a data center or data center folder that contains at least one ESXi host that is not in lockdown or maintenance mode."}],"comment_id":"44594","poster":"m0nt0","timestamp":"1580378640.0","content":"point 7 on that doc","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"timestamp":"1572470400.0","comment_id":"18434","poster":"alinouri","upvote_count":"9","content":"B is correct.
