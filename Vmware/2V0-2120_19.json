Configure Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) on the cluster.\n\nExplanation:\nEnhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) is a VMware vSphere feature that ensures compatibility between CPU feature sets of hosts in a cluster, allowing virtual machines to be vMotioned seamlessly without any CPU-related compatibility issues.\n\nWhen EVC is enabled on a cluster, vSphere will automatically mask the advanced CPU features of the host CPUs to a common baseline supported by all hosts in the cluster. This provides a uniform CPU feature set for all hosts, allowing vMotion operations to take place without encountering CPU incompatibility issues, like the one mentioned in the error log message.\n\nTo resolve the error, the administrator should enable EVC on the cluster that includes both the source and destination hosts involved in the vMotion process.
