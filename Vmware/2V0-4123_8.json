Gain insight about micro-segmentation traffic flows:\nDistributed Intrusion Detection in NSX can monitor and analyze traffic flows within micro-segmented networks. Micro-segmentation divides the network into smaller segments to enhance security. Distributed Intrusion Detection helps gain insights into these segmented traffic flows, ensuring that communication between different segments is secure and free from intrusions.\n\nD. Use agentless antivirus with Guest introspection:\nDistributed Intrusion Detection on NSX allows for agentless antivirus solutions through Guest Introspection. This means antivirus scanning can be done without installing any additional agents on individual virtual machines. Distributed Intrusion Detection helps in detecting any malicious activity or threats within these virtual machines, providing security without compromising performance.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714210920.0","poster":"zelele"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/124709-exam-2v0-4123-topic-1-question-37-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-10-27 11:42:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["BD (83%)","CE (17%)"]},{"id":"07mJLGapaTuiHi9lGUz2","answer":"A","choices":{"D":"set service manager log-level debug","C":"set service nsx-manager log-level debug","A":"set service manager logging-level debug","B":"set service nsx-manager logging-level debug"},"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Which command is used to set the NSX Manager's logging-level to debug mode for troubleshooting?","topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA : set service manager logging-level debug\n\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/s/article/55868","upvote_count":"5","poster":"descentguy2021","comment_id":"1042432","timestamp":"1712995860.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\n# set service manager logging-level debug\n, is correct. it can be checked NSX manager CLI.","timestamp":"1712705880.0","comment_id":"1039021","poster":"kruy","upvote_count":"5"},{"comment_id":"1144727","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723128360.0","content":"Correct Answer is D see the official vmware sample question and answer key below - \nchrome-https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmware-2vo-41.20-exam-prep-guide.pdf","comments":[{"timestamp":"1724892600.0","poster":"avid_researcher","content":"no. its logging-level, not log-level","comment_id":"1162154","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"ShiVip"},{"poster":"Auditya","comment_id":"1042645","timestamp":"1713010140.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nset service manager logging-level debug"}],"answer_description":"","exam_id":242,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/123038-exam-2v0-4123-topic-1-question-38-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-10-10 01:38:00","question_id":39,"unix_timestamp":1696894680},{"id":"SOdBzSVD2HxQxHEHKwm5","answer_description":"","question_text":"What are two valid BGP Attributes that can be used to influence the route path traffic will take?
