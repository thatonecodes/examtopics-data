In a Layer 2 broadcast domain, devices can communicate with each other at the Ethernet level, meaning they are in the same broadcast domain, and broadcast traffic can reach all devices in the same domain.\n\n Layer 2 bridge (A): This refers to connecting two different Layer 2 segments together, but in the case described, the VMs are already on the same segment, so this does not apply.\n Layer 2 VPN (C): This would typically be used to extend a Layer 2 network over a Layer 3 infrastructure, not applicable in this scenario where the VMs are already on the same segment.\n Layer 3 route (D): A Layer 3 boundary implies routing between different subnets or networks, which is not the case here, as the VMs are in the same network.\n\nSo, the scenario describes a Layer 2 broadcast domain where both VMs can communicate."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1351534","poster":"amorcle","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAs in the official vmware guide","comments":[{"timestamp":"1739034780.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1353524","poster":"amorcle","content":"I'm sorry, the correct choice is B"}],"timestamp":"1738694940.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/155950-exam-2v0-4124-topic-1-question-16-discussion/","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (67%)","D (33%)"],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1738694940,"exam_id":243,"answer":"B","timestamp":"2025-02-04 19:49:00","question_text":"An administrator has connected two virtual machines on the same overlay segment.
