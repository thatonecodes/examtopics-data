The platform is used to developing applications and services. It is important that the customer be able to accurately benchmark performance of developed applications.\nThe platform has recently commissioned new hosts to update the development cluster.\nThe development cluster host configuration is:\n✑ 4 ESXi hosts with 2 sockets ֳ— 16 cores\n✑ 512 GB RAM divided evenly between sockets\n✑ There is no resource contention\nThe benchmarking cluster host configuration is:\n✑ 8 ESXi hosts with 2 sockets ֳ— 8 cores\n✑ 256 GB RAM divided evenly between sockets\n✑ There is no resource contention\nThe customer is developing an application that includes a database virtual machine. The application developer states that the database virtual machine performs as required only when allocated 8 vCPUs 256 GB RAM. The database virtual machine performance meets the required levels when run from the development cluster. Performance benchmarking for the database virtual machine yields highly variable results when run from the benchmarking cluster.
