The increased network bandwidth allows for faster data transfer during the migration process.\n\nUse at least two port groups:\nUsing multiple port groups and distributing the vMotion traffic across them can help optimize the network utilization and improve vSphere vMotion performance. This allows for parallel processing and load balancing during the migration process.\n\nThe other options mentioned (B, D, and E) are not directly related to improving vSphere vMotion performance and may not address the specific issue of slow and unsuccessful migrations. Option B (vSphere Storage I/O Control) is related to storage performance, while options D (LACP) and E (Disable vSphere Fault Tolerance) are not directly related to network performance.","comment_id":"898622","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Alan_sysadmin"},{"comment_id":"896645","timestamp":"1683978600.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"katbeh","content":"A, C. got 500 today 5-13-23"},{"poster":"LES_LES1","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1682332020.0","content":"What is the correct answer?","comment_id":"879232"},{"timestamp":"1682284920.0","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nYou can have vmotion on 2 portgroup","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Lusciernaga","comment_id":"878816"},{"comment_id":"868922","poster":"SeriousBlack","content":"CE.
