It enables centralized, off-host, LAN-free backup of vSphere virtual machines.\n\nVMware vSphere Storage APIs - Data Protection (VADP) is designed to enhance data protection capabilities for vSphere environments. It allows for centralized, off-host backup operations by enabling third-party backup software to interact with vSphere's storage subsystem directly. VADP helps in performing efficient backups of virtual machines without affecting their production performance, utilizing features such as Changed Block Tracking (CBT) to back up only the changed data, thus reducing backup time and improving efficiency.
