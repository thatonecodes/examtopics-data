Let's go over the answers. \n\nA - Wrong. Creating a network policy that allows pods on the same segment to talk to each other won't work. The question says only the prod app server can access the DB. Well, if you use this rule, then anything on that segment can talk access the DB. Fail!\n\nB - No, this is wrong, we won't use NSX to do this. What if it's not an NSX based solution? Tanzu does not always use NSX!\n\nC - Yes, this will work. The app server and DB reside in the same pod. If we prevent other pods talking to it, then the DB server can only talk to the app server and we satisfy the question requirement.\n\nD - This is the \"joke\" answer that is silly on purpose.
