I'm going to go with \"B\" for this. Here's my reasoning: \n\nFirst, this document describes Kubernetes NetworkPolicies: \n\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/\n\nNote that this document is for Kubernetes, not Tanzu, because this question is about Kubernetes specifically.\n\nA - Supervisor cluster... no. Also Supervisor cluster is a Tanzu specific technology. \n\nB - Yes, NetworkPolicies are defined in yaml and apply to the Pod level. \n\nC - No, this is a VSphere answer not a Kubernetes answer, and thus not relevant.\n\nD - No, this is a VSphere answer not a Kubernetes answer, and thus not relevant.","poster":"obeythefist"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1679625300,"answer_description":"","question_id":91},{"id":"mXRYFcWqJhq6eOGiqM86","question_id":92,"answer_description":"","answer":"DE","timestamp":"2022-11-01 06:18:00","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which two container network interfaces (CNIs) are supported with Tanzu Kubernetes clusters created by the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service?
