Synchronizes time between the guest and the host\nD. Makes a graceful shutdown of the VM possible\n\nExplanation:\nA. VMware Tools help in synchronizing time between the guest operating system running within the virtual machine and the host system. This synchronization ensures that time remains consistent across the guest and host, preventing issues that might arise from time discrepancies.\nD. VMware Tools enable a graceful shutdown of the virtual machine.
