A load balancer provides external access to Supervisor Clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.\n\nIn vSphere with Tanzu using the vSphere networking stack, a load balancer is typically used to provide external access to Supervisor Clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. It helps distribute incoming traffic among the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster and allows external clients to access services deployed in the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. The load balancer ensures high availability and efficient distribution of traffic to the appropriate resources within the environment.","timestamp":"1731753300.0","poster":"KingJ92","comment_id":"1072341","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"obeythefist","timestamp":"1711278000.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNot super sure about this one but will go with C. \n\nA. A load balancer balances pods between Tanzu Kubernetes cluster nodes. - No... balances pods? Doesn't sound right.\nB. A load balancer distributes Tanzu Kubernetes cluster nodes between ESXi hosts. - No, load balancers don't do workload placement, DRS does that.\nC. A load balancer provides external access to Supervisor Clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. - Maybe? \nD. A load balancer performs authentication and authorization for Supervisor Clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. - No, it's not a security/authentication thing.\n\nC seems the best answer.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"849236"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/103771-exam-5v0-2320-topic-1-question-108-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1679612400,"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"A load balancer balances pods between Tanzu Kubernetes cluster nodes.","B":"A load balancer distributes Tanzu Kubernetes cluster nodes between ESXi hosts.","D":"A load balancer performs authentication and authorization for Supervisor Clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.","C":"A load balancer provides external access to Supervisor Clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters."},"answer":"C","exam_id":265,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-03-24 00:00:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which statement accurately describes a characteristic of load balancers in vSphere with Tanzu using the vSphere networking stack?","question_id":11},{"id":"GlPnPSBNW4JBk2ISG9vf","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/103758-exam-5v0-2320-topic-1-question-109-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Use the vSphere Client to grant access to the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster.","B":"Use the vSphere Client to grant access to the Namespace.","A":"Create a custom Role and RoleBinding, and then apply to the Namespace using kubectl commands.","C":"Create a custom Role and RoleBinding, and then apply to the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster using kubectl commands."},"timestamp":"2023-03-24 10:04:00","topic":"1","question_id":12,"answer":"C","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"A Namespace contains multiple Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.\n\nHow is access granted to a single Tanzu Kubernetes cluster?","unix_timestamp":1679648640,"question_images":[],"exam_id":265,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Create a custom Role and RoleBinding, and then apply to the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster using kubectl commands.\n\nAccess to a single Tanzu Kubernetes cluster within a Namespace is typically managed using Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) mechanisms. You would create a custom Role and RoleBinding specific to the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster and then apply them using kubectl commands.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Create a custom Role and RoleBinding, and then apply to the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster using kubectl commands.","timestamp":"1731753300.0","poster":"KingJ92","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1072342"},{"timestamp":"1711271040.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI'm guessing C. \n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-6DE4016E-D51C-4E9B-9F8B-F6577A18F296.html\n\nLet's do the answer elimination: \n\nA - We need a custom role and rolebinding, BUT, this is applied to the whole namespace, not the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster within that namespace.
