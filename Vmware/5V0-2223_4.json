Create uniformly-configured hosts: It's advisable to ensure that the hosts in the vSAN cluster have consistent hardware configurations, especially when it comes to storage devices. This uniformity can help avoid potential issues and ensure predictable performance.\n\nE. Reference the VMware Compatibility Guide: The VMware Compatibility Guide provides a list of compatible hardware components, including storage devices and drivers. Ensuring that the host's hardware is on the compatibility list is essential to avoid compatibility issues and ensure that your vSAN setup works as expected.","comment_id":"1047732","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ansari678","timestamp":"1729328220.0"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"nODLajD0XWdVWmAuUtZ4","unix_timestamp":1697705880,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["CE (83%)","AB (17%)"],"question_text":"What are two characteristics of the vSAN Data-At-Rest Encryption (DARE)?

Durability components were introduced in vSAN 7.0 Update 1 and provided a mechanism to maintain the required availability for VMs while doing maintenance.
