I'll go with \"B\" because it seems reasonable. \n\nA. By routing quota and permission API calls to vCenter Server via the Supervisor Cluster\n\nI'm not sure... why does this have to be API calls? The whole point of Tanzu is that you can do a lot of administration through vCenter and kubectl. \n\nB. By ensuring each TKG cluster has a quotas and permissions system built into it natively which enforces all requests\n\nThis is true, and I guess the best answer. TKG clusters and namespaces leverage inbuilt quota and permissions systems, and these do enforce all requests. \n\nC. By having the Supervisor Cluster poll the TKG cluster periodically to ensure adherence to quotas and permissions\n\nNo... polling is not the way this is done (and a terrible idea because you can do what you want between polls? Ha...)\n\nD. By deploying an external authentication solution\n\nNo, this is certainly handled by TKG, no need for an external one. \n\nWhile \"A\" looks compelling, \"B\" seems a better answer.
