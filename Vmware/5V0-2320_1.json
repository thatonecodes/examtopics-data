Create a storage policy containing the tagged datastores, and apply it to the vSphere Namespace\n\nIt could be D, but the question asks to apply it at a Namespace level.\nAfter creating storage policies, a vSphere administrator can perform the following tasks:\nAssign the storage policies to the vSphere Namespace. Storage policies visible to the namespace determine which datastores the namespace can access and use for persistent volumes. The storage policies appear as matching Kubernetes storage classes in the namespace. They are also propagated to the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster on this namespace. DevOps engineers can use the storage classes in their persistent volume claim specifications. \n\n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-544286A2-A403-4CA5-9C73-8EFF261545E7.html"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI'll go with A as well","timestamp":"1733396160.0","poster":"dmbuil","comment_id":"1088400"},{"comment_id":"1012867","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Correct Answer is A","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726901940.0"},{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","content":"anyone can please confirm if this questions are valid?","comments":[],"comment_id":"887752","timestamp":"1714671120.0"},{"timestamp":"1711182180.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"obeythefist","comment_id":"847970","content":"I will go with \"A\":\n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-1B136277-E46C-41FC-9C8C-3E78E9B97F5C.html\n\n1.

Permissions\n\nWhen creating a Supervisor Namespace in vSphere with Tanzu, adding permissions is essential to ensure that end users can consume the namespace. Permissions define who has access to the namespace and what actions they are allowed to perform within that namespace.
