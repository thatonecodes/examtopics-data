By default, traffic shaping is disabled. A traffic shaping policy sets the average and peak bandwidth and burst size values:\n- Average bandwidth: Amount of bandwidth that is used by each VM under normal operation.\n- Peak bandwidth: If a VM sends a burst of traffic, the VM uses a higher bandwidth, called peak bandwidth, to send data.\n- Burst size: When a VM sends a large amount of data at once, it is called a burst of traffic. The burst size defines how much data is considered a large amount."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723418340.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Traffic shaping\nExplanation: Traffic shaping is a feature of vSphere Distributed Switch that allows an administrator to restrict the network bandwidth that is available to ports. This feature also allows for bursts of traffic to flow through at higher speeds, which is the requirement specified by the administrator. Traffic shaping helps to regulate the flow of network traffic by specifying a maximum and minimum bandwidth limit for each port, which in turn helps to ensure that sufficient bandwidth is available for critical network traffic and prevent network congestion.","comment_id":"805830","poster":"dinosan"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1676164740,"choices":{"A":"Teaming and failover","C":"Monitoring","B":"Traffic shaping","D":"Security"},"question_text":"An administrator would like to enable a switch setting to restrict the network bandwidth that is available to ports, but the solution must also allow bursts of traffic to flow through at higher speeds.\nWhich vSphere Distributed Switch setting accomplishes this goal?","isMC":true,"question_id":41,"exam_id":228,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"0KEBeJ1vkQ5u5lbKsDmM","question_id":42,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nDRS measures VM happiness by computing a DRS score for each VM in the cluster.
