A vSphere cluster that needs to be upgraded without any VM downtime.\n\nvSphere vMotion enables the live migration of running virtual machines from one ESXi host to another within a vSphere cluster without any interruption or downtime. This capability is particularly useful during tasks like vSphere cluster maintenance, upgrades, or patching. vMotion ensures continuous operation of VMs while allowing administrators to perform necessary maintenance or upgrades on the underlying infrastructure without affecting the availability or performance of the VMs.","timestamp":"1731911700.0","poster":"playfulbear","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1073831"},{"timestamp":"1730405640.0","comment_id":"1059176","poster":"Kamal_SriLanka","upvote_count":"1","content":"A vSphere cluster that needs to be upgraded without any VM downtime"},{"timestamp":"1718536380.0","comment_id":"925089","poster":"MaDota","upvote_count":"1","content":"This question should actually be \" Which problem is NOT solved.....\"\nA,B and D are all true regarding VM migration\nbut again \"D\" is tricky cause that can be solved also by Storage Vmotion. \nI don't think anyone will ever face this question even the founders are like wuttttttttttttt"},{"comment_id":"831790","timestamp":"1709809740.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"it'll actually work for A & B, you can actually have the files renamed by Storage Vmotion after renaming the machine. bu since storage Vmotion isn't mentioned then it's B.\n\nRenaming files using storage Vmotion:\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1029513","poster":"Alma30"},{"poster":"robbie_the_menace","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect answer is B","comment_id":"808374","timestamp":"1707914100.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1698765540.0","poster":"zepito","comment_id":"708526","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: B\nfor me is B.\nOthers are with storage vMotion and not vMotion."},{"content":"number B","poster":"ibeech","timestamp":"1698401460.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"705430"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/vmotion.html#:~:text=Live%20Migration%20of%20Virtual%20Machines%20vSphere%20vMotion,they%20need%20to%20stay%20productive.","comment_id":"701075","poster":"Shaima2022","timestamp":"1697908500.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1695213060.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nvSphere vMotion enables zero-downtime, live migration of workloads from one server to another so your users can continue to access the systems they need to stay productive.","poster":"canonlycontainletters1","comment_id":"674145","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1695213000.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"C talks about VM rollback (ie revert to snapshot).
