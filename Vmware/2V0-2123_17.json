You must also deploy an OEM-provided hardware support manager and register it as a vCenter Server extension. The hardware support manager inspects the hardware of the hosts in the cluster and lists available and compatible firmware versions, which you can add to the image for the cluster. The actual firmware update happens upon remediating the cluster against an image that contains a firmware add-on.\"\n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-lifecycle-manager/GUID-6906DCFA-F4A4-4A67-A86D-2F56AB0B3B38.html","timestamp":"1721867880.0","poster":"mkhlszf","comment_id":"962182"},{"poster":"vaaws","comment_id":"1085334","content":"https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-lifecycle-manager/GUID-34AF5B19-FC80-4915-8358-D5FCC8A8E69E.html#GUID-34AF5B19-FC80-4915-8358-D5FCC8A8E69E\nABE","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733069100.0"},{"comment_id":"1001581","poster":"Bert_77","content":"Selected Answer: ABE\nAnswers can be found by using both documents listed below.
