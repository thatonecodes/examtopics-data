Just like most of these questions, 2 answers are very close. Yes, it is true that the template must be shared with the appropriate project, BUT, before you can even use it in ANY project, the template MUST be versioned so that a version can be 'Released' and be available in Service Broker at all. Also, in the question, there is a statement that a 'new' template is created, this further makes it clear since a new template always must have a released version. If there was a comment about an existing template version etc, then projects might make more sense.
