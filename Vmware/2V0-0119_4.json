If the host failed (powered down), all the VMs would also be powered down. Then HA would take over and power the VMs on a different Host. This would report a power event on the guest operating systems.\nAlternatively, if the Host does not fail but looses network connectivity, all VMs remain powered on and the Host has a lock on the VM's so HA fails on the other Hosts because they fail to power on the VM's.\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2034571","comment_id":"131462"},{"content":"D is correct.
