Going over the answers:\n\nA. Implements Kubernetes Ingress with an NSX-T layer 7 load balancer - Yes, other comments link documentation that references layer 7 load balancing as an NSX function with Tanzu\n\nB. Integrates with container-based PaaS such as Docker - No, and I think whenever an answer involves \"Docker\" instead of kubernetes we should be cautious, as the whole purpose of Kubernetes and Tanzu is that you can use Docker without getting your hands dirty with it.\n\n\nC. Creates an NSX-T logical topology for a Kubernetes cluster and a separate logical network for each Kubernetes namespace - Yes, a simple think about multi-guess answers in exams is the longest is often the right one. In this case NSX creates separate segments for namespaces so this is a very reasonable answer.\n\nD.
