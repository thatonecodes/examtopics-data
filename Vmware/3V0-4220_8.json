SNAT also tracks the reply.\n• Destination NAT (DNAT) enables access to internal private IP addresses from the outside world by translating the destination IP address when inbound communication is initiated. DNAT also takes care of the reply. For both SNAT and DNAT, users can apply NAT rules based on the 5-tuple match criteria.\n• Reflexive NAT rules are stateless access control lists (ACLs) that must be defined in both directions. These rules do not track the connection. Reflexive NAT rules are applied when stateful NAT cannot be used. For example, when a Tier-0 gateway is running in active-active equal-cost multipath (ECMP) mode, you cannot configure stateful NAT because asymmetrical paths might cause issues."},{"poster":"tester2478","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nA,B and D are wrong so only C and E remains (reflexive is stateless and stateful is only supported in A/S)","comment_id":"856646","timestamp":"1727675640.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1679346300.0","comment_id":"448403","poster":"BrianOC","content":"Actually, meant to note: C & E"}],"timestamp":"1667689440.0","content":"D & E are correct answers","comment_id":"350572","poster":"BrianOC","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"350571","timestamp":"1667689260.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"Stateful services can’t be in active/active, they need to be in Active/Standby.
