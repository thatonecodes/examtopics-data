Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) provides a consistent, upstream-compatible Kubernetes distribution that is packaged with the necessary tools and services to enable a secure and scalable production-grade Kubernetes deployment. Tanzu Kubernetes clusters can be created and managed using different deployment options, such as TKG standalone, TKG on vSphere with Tanzu, or TKG on AWS. Tanzu Kubernetes clusters can also be upgraded and deleted using the Tanzu CLI, which is a command-line interface tool that enables you to manage your Kubernetes clusters and applications on TKG. Tanzu Supervisor cluster and Tanzu Kubernetes Grid extensions are other TKG components that provide additional functionality for managing Kubernetes clusters and deploying applications, but they are not used specifically for creating, scaling, upgrading, or deleting workload clusters.","timestamp":"1699878660.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"The Tanzu CLI is a command-line interface that provides a unified interface for interacting with various VMware Tanzu products, including Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.
