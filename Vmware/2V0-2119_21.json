This can cause lag on the VM if other VMs are using the host CPU at the time. A good rule of thumb is, when sizing your VM, if the CPU utilization in the guest is on average below 20% at all times, reduce the number of vCPUs. If the VM is at 100% CPU utilization all the time, up the vCPU count. This will help with minimizing and maximizing your VMs to get the most CPU performance that they can get.\n\nAnother metric to watch for when provisioning resources is CPU RDY Time. This is the metric vSphere uses to record the length of time that a VM was scheduled to perform a task but couldn’t due to having to wait for CPU. The threshold to look for is usually 10%. Anything higher will usually be experiencing some slowness. How do I find the CPU RDY time? Easy, just like the example above with the NUMA nodes, we will use ESXTOP.
