Cloud Native Storage (CNS) - Yes, while it's called \"Cloud\", CNS is actually for managing on-prem Vsphere persistent volumes, first class disks etc. \nB. DaemonSet - No, DaemonSet is nothing to do with storage\nC. S3 external volume - No. What if we're not using AWS, and we're using on-prem? This is the silly joke answer.\nD. vSAN Direct for vSphere - No, but I can see why they got confused. VSAN Direct is a mechanism to publish VSAN resources directly for third party Tanzu connections to use to leverage VSAN features, but it is not as clean and nice as CNS - keyword here is \"persistent\", after all, which CNS focuses on as a primary feature, but VSAN Direct is purposed differently.","poster":"obeythefist","timestamp":"1727163300.0"},{"poster":"Abhi333","upvote_count":"1","content":"A Cloud Native Storage (CNS)","comment_id":"849043","timestamp":"1727152140.0"}],"question_text":"What does vSphere with Tanzu integrate with to provision persistent storage for Kubernetes workloads?","topic":"1"},{"id":"kvrYPtwv7T8idBZDcLTG","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","question_id":120,"answer_description":"","question_text":"An administrator is tasked with horizontally scaling an existing Tanzu Kubernetes cluster from 6 to 4 nodes.\n\nWhich action does the administrator need to complete to ensure the cluster scales successfully when updating the YAML definition?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"edsel123","timestamp":"1728404640.0","comment_id":"1191678","content":"B\nYou can't scale in CP\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-7992B7F6-9174-44F4-99BE-C0B5C45FA2EC.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIM4GNIFMAECIFc4BdkCcQBfIA"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nI do like the easy questions.
