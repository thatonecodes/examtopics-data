Virtual SAN may actually create more stripes than the\nnumber specified in the policy.\nStriping may help performance if certain virtual machines are I/O intensive and\nothers are not. With striping, a virtual machines data is spread across more drives\nwhich all contribute to the overall storage performance experienced by that virtual\nmachine. In the case of hybrid, this striping would be across magnetic disks. In the\ncase of all-flash, the striping would be across whatever flash devices are making up\nthe capacity layer.\"\"","comment_id":"602796","upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1652765940.0","poster":"GG_Flo"},{"comment_id":"918741","timestamp":"1686266340.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD makes sense","poster":"ranauro"},{"comment_id":"635287","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOnly D makes sense","timestamp":"1658508660.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"thisissecret"},{"timestamp":"1651521900.0","poster":"jimmyjammer","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nme thinks D","comment_id":"596202"}],"topic":"1","question_id":26,"timestamp":"2022-05-02 22:05:00","isMC":true,"answer":"D","question_text":"A vSAN administrator has been tasked with troubleshooting an application in a Hybrid vSAN environment.
