Spring provides a Dependency Injection container.\n\nTrue. One of the core features of Spring is its powerful Dependency Injection (DI) container, which helps manage the lifecycle and dependencies of the applicationâ€™s components.\n\nE. Spring provides abstractions over infrastructure such as persistence and messaging.\n\nTrue. Spring provides a range of abstractions over various infrastructure concerns, such as persistence (with Spring Data and JPA), messaging (with Spring JMS and Spring AMQP), transaction management, and more.
