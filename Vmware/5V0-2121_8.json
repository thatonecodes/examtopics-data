The first of these is “features” and the second is queue depth.\n\nQueue depth is extremely important, as issues have been observed with controllers that have very small queue depths. In particular, controllers with small queue depths (less than 256) can impact virtual machine I/O performance when vSAN is rebuilding components, either due to a failure or when requested to do so when entering maintenance mode.\n\nDesign Decision : Choose storage I/O controllers that have as large a queue depth as possible.
