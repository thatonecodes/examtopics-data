Quote from article below:\nVMware vSAN Direct Requirements ^\nUnclaimed disks—This feature needs some unclaimed disks on each host within a vSAN cluster. So, if you have already created your disk groups and have no other disk groups available (unclaimed), it might be necessary to simply evacuate the data from an existing disk group and recreate it by specifying the vSAN Direct option. If you are able to add more disks to your host and create another disk group, this would be the second option for achieving the configuration.\nvSAN License—You'll need a VMware vSAN license installed and activated for that particular cluster. But you already knew this if you were going for a vSAN-based cluster, right? If you're new to VMware and if you have a Standard or Enterprise license, this license itself does not entitle you to create and configure a vSAN cluster.
