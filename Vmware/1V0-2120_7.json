In the event of a host failure, vSphere Fault Tolerance automatically creates a secondary virtual machine that is an exact copy of the primary virtual machine. \n\nThe secondary virtual machine runs on a different host and is continuously updated with the state of the primary virtual machine. In the event of a host failure, the secondary virtual machine takes over, allowing users to continue accessing the virtual machine without any loss of data or interruption in service. \n\nThis provides continuous availability and protection for mission-critical virtual machines, ensuring that critical applications are always available to users.","timestamp":"1723340580.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"dinosan","comment_id":"804966"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nFault Tolerance 100%\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-623812E6-D253-4FBC-B3E1-6FBFDF82ED21.html","comment_id":"765097","poster":"cdat","timestamp":"1720037160.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"exam_id":228,"answer":"A","question_id":31,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1672783560,"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which vSphere component provides continuous availability for mission-critical virtual machines so users experience no loss of data and no interruption in service during a host failure?","isMC":true},{"id":"XO4yBXoMwvK2bC2OQ9rz","topic":"1","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nAgree.

Microsoft Windows and C. MacOS are two guest operating systems that are supported when a virtual machine is deployed.\n\nA virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a computer system, which allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. In this context, the guest operating system refers to the operating system that runs inside the virtual machine. Windows and MacOS are both widely used operating systems and are supported by many virtualization platforms, such as VMware, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V.\n\nT/TOS (Tandem Transactional OS) is an operating system used in mission-critical applications, but it is not commonly used for personal computers or servers, so it may not be supported by all virtualization platforms. Android and iOS are mobile operating systems, typically used on smartphones and tablets, and are not designed to run as the guest operating system in a virtual machine.","comment_id":"805811","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723417020.0"}],"isMC":true,"exam_id":228,"timestamp":"2023-02-12 01:57:00","unix_timestamp":1676163420,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/pdf/VMware_GOS_Compatibility_Guide.pdf","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["CD (100%)"],"answer":"CD","answer_ET":"CD","choices":{"E":"iOS","C":"MacOS","B":"Android","A":"T/TOS (Tandem Transactional OS)","D":"Microsoft Windows"},"question_text":"Which two guest operating systems are supported when a virtual machine must be deployed?

Install a Type-2 hypervisor accomplishes this goal.\n\nA virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a computer system, which allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. In order to deploy virtual machines on a Windows 10 desktop, you need to install a hypervisor, which is a piece of software that creates and manages virtual machines.\n\nThere are two main types of hypervisors: Type-1 and Type-2. A Type-1 hypervisor runs directly on the host machine's hardware, and provides a virtualized environment for guest operating systems. A Type-2 hypervisor, on the other hand, runs as a software application on an existing operating system, and provides a virtualized environment for guest operating systems.\n\nTo deploy virtual machines on a Windows 10 desktop, you would need to install a Type-2 hypervisor, such as VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, or Hyper-V.\n\nAdding an additional CD-ROM, installing Windows patches, and adding an additional network interface are not relevant to deploying virtual machines on a Windows 10 desktop.","comment_id":"805816","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723417320.0","poster":"dinosan"}]},{"id":"P7ZWvcbxu73cu0swE5do","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich statement is true about the access privileges of User 1?","unix_timestamp":1662386040,"answer":"C","choices":{"A":"User 1 has administrator privileges to all objects in the Test and Dev folder.","C":"User 1 has read-only privileges to all objects in the Production folder.","D":"User 1 has read-only privileges to the Dev01 VM in the Test and Dev folder.","B":"User 1 has administrator privileges to all VMs in the Production folder."},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-09-05 15:54:00","topic":"1","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04343/0000300001.png"],"answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1696129140.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the correct answer. \nUser 1 has Read-only privileges to the entire Training folder.
