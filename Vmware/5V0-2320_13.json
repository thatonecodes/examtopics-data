Public image registries can be used to store container images. However, for security reasons, it is better to use an on-premises image registry.\nYou use an on-premises image registry for the following purposes: • Store container images securely. • Control access to container images.\nvSphere with Tanzu is integrated with Harbor and is also compatible with other container image registries.","comment_id":"762374","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1688078220.0","poster":"Jiraya22"},{"comment_id":"739632","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDefo A for security","timestamp":"1686264300.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"MattE76"},{"timestamp":"1686246360.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"yushee81","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI would say D: Lack of Enterprise support\nhttps://docs.pivotal.io/vmware-harbor/index.html","comment_id":"739394"}],"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","exam_id":265,"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/90705-exam-5v0-2320-topic-1-question-41-discussion/","answers_community":["A (80%)","D (20%)"],"question_images":[]},{"id":"OCLtOzZ1KqLoRaQ7J4Da","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/90710-exam-5v0-2320-topic-1-question-42-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_id":62,"question_text":"The network topology for a Supervisor Cluster deployed using the vSphere networking stack, and a HAProxy load balancer is being planned.\nIn addition to the control plane management IP range and services IP range, how many non-overlapping IP address ranges are needed?","question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":265,"choices":{"D":"2","C":"4","A":"3","B":"1"},"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-12-08 21:04:00","answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1670529840,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI would say answer D (2 more), so in addition to the control plane management IP range and services IP range I would add Workload network range and Kubernetes range\n\n1. \nAn IP range for the nodes of the Supervisor Cluster and Tanzu Kubernetes cluster (mgmt)\n\n2. \nA dedicated IP range for virtual IPs.
