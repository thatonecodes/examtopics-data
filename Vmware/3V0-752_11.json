Here is the reason:\nEach vSAN node can have up to 5 disk groups, each one with 1 disk for cache and 7 disks for capacity.\nAs the scenario documents, there's only 1 disk group per host (because there is only one SSD drive in each host). This vSAN is hybrid (SSDs+HDDs). This disk group have 1 200GB SSD disk for cache and 4 500GB HDD disks for capacity. The cache disk must be at least 10% of the total capacity disks (which is the case). \nIf you add 3 200GB SSD disk to each of the hosts, you can have 4 disk groups, each one with 1 200GB SSD disk for cache and 1 500GB for capacity, augmenting considerably the cache, improving the performance and the user experience.\nWe could consider the second alternative (B), adding 1 200GB SSD to each of the hosts. So, we could have 2 disk groups in each host, each disk group with 1 200GB SSD disk and 2 500GB HDD disks. It would be a cheaper solution, but performance would not be as good as the first alternative. It would be a cheaper solution, but performance would not be as good as the first alternative.
