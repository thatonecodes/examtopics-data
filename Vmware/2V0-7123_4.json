For example, you want to monitor the performance of all nodes running in your \nCalifornia-based clusters or the performance of only the pricing services within your service mesh. \nFor this purpose, you create a node group and a service group defining the appropriate conditions \n(the cluster is located in California and the service name begins with pricing in our examples). After \na resource group is created, you can monitor relevant performance metrics (such as requests per \nseconds, latency metrics, and error rate) for the group collectively from the resource group details \npage.","timestamp":"1728445380.0"}],"question_id":16,"timestamp":"2023-10-09 05:43:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"API groups","C":"Security groups","A":"Node groups","B":"Cluster groups","E":"Service groups"},"question_text":"Which two groups can be created to collect and manage objects in VMware Tanzu Service Mesh?
