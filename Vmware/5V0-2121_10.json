HCI Mesh brings together multiple independent vSAN clusters for a native, cross-cluster architecture that disaggregates resources and enables utilization of stranded capacity. Simply, vSAN allows one or more vSAN clusters to remotely mount datastores from other vSAN clusters (servers) within vCenter inventory. This approach maintains the essence and simplicity of HCI by not fundamentally changing the existing HCI model or requiring specialized hardware. Now, a cluster with excess compute can mount excess storage from a remote vSAN cluster.","poster":"Lazylinux"},{"content":"Confirm C","comment_id":"469518","poster":"imonard","timestamp":"1635466740.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"topic":"1","answer":"C"},{"id":"jWVLI4gRtgISFMd5rqqt","choices":{"B":"Only single connection per session is supported.","A":"All requirements can be satisfied without any change.","C":"The number of LUNs require additional licensing.","D":"It is a best practice to maintain a LUN size of 8 TB."},"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1696242060.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1023000","poster":"jchampion","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/57344"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/122146-exam-5v0-2121-topic-1-question-51-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_id":48,"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":262,"timestamp":"2023-10-02 12:21:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"During a vSAN design workshop, a customer expressed a requirement to decommission an existing enterprise NAS device that provides iSCSI services for a clustered application.\n\nBased on the current state analysis, the following information was noted:\n\n• Current utilization is 500 LUNs.\n• All clustered workloads are configured for Multiple Connections per Session.\n• LUN sizes range between 10 TB to 30 TB.\n\nWhat should the architect state regarding the requirements?","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1696242060,"answer":"B"},{"id":"hJ88UQZwwcPYmFnjGWCZ","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"jchampion","content":"Selected Answer: BEF\nB E F. https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-planning.doc/GUID-1D3FE3B4-1BFE-4B0E-BDC3-3D388D2BEF61.html","comment_id":"1023001","timestamp":"1696242240.0"}],"answer":"BEF","unix_timestamp":1696242240,"timestamp":"2023-10-02 12:24:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":49,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/122147-exam-5v0-2121-topic-1-question-52-discussion/","topic":"1","question_text":"Which three steps are required to decommission a stretched cluster and convert it to a standard vSAN cluster?
