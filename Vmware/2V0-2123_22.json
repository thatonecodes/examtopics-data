The vertical timeline view provides you with detailed information about the different VM template versions, the updates that privileged users have made, and when the last change was made. By using the vertical timeline, you can revert VM templates back to their previous state or delete the previous version of a VM template.\n\nIn addition, you can deploy a virtual machine from the latest version of the VM template without any disruptions while it is checked out for update. You can update the virtual machine and check it back in into the same VM template.\n\nReference: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vm-administration/GUID-E9EAF7AC-1C08-441A-AB80-0BAA1EAF9F0A.html"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC based on the message that the VM template already exist","poster":"IOS2610","comment_id":"1284918","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726513980.0"},{"poster":"MalGil","comment_id":"1221443","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI went for D, as there is no mention of a Content library.
