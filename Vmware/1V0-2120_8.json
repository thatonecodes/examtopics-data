The vmk port provides a dedicated network connection for that service, separate from the connections used for VM traffic. Each vmk port is assigned a unique identifier, such as vmk1, vmk2, etc., which you can use to identify and manage the port in the vSphere environment."}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":228,"timestamp":"2023-02-12 02:04:00","unix_timestamp":1676163840,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/98848-exam-1v0-2120-topic-1-question-40-discussion/","choices":{"D":"vmk1","A":"vSwitch1","C":"vmnic1","B":"VM Network"}},{"id":"GAML8qO2ifLIMmfUtRfr","answer":"C","question_id":37,"exam_id":228,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/80367-exam-1v0-2120-topic-1-question-41-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1662388980,"timestamp":"2022-09-05 16:43:00","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"It will move the VM to a host in the same cluster with enough resources after the HA restart.","B":"It will pro-actively move the virtual machine to a different host.","A":"It will pro-actively move the virtual machine to a different cluster.","D":"It will move the VM to a host in a different cluster with enough resources after the HA restart."},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"664958","content":"The correct answer is C.

It will move the VM to a host in the same cluster with enough resources after the HA restart.\n\nWhen VMware HA detects a host failure and initiates a restart of the affected virtual machines on other hosts within the same cluster, DRS, if configured in fully automated mode, will then assess the resource availability and load across the remaining hosts in the cluster. If there are hosts with sufficient resources available (CPU, memory, etc.), DRS will take the necessary action to ensure the restarted virtual machines are placed on a host that can accommodate them within the same cluster, optimizing resource usage and balancing the cluster's workload.","poster":"playfulbear"},{"timestamp":"1711837260.0","poster":"MaxMink","comment_id":"856217","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRight, DRS restarts the VM on another host when combined with HA."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-1D8B1384-59A4-41E2-AF05-697FC06D9EF9.html","comment_id":"838395","poster":"Gillactus","timestamp":"1710371160.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"IlCrive","timestamp":"1706809560.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C, same cluster, another node.","comment_id":"795372","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"zepito","timestamp":"1705594380.0","comment_id":"780192","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-1D8B1384-59A4-41E2-AF05-697FC06D9EF9.html"},{"comment_id":"698400","timestamp":"1697650680.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-1D8B1384-59A4-41E2-AF05-697FC06D9EF9.html","poster":"benycom"},{"content":"please provide the link to the answer","comment_id":"660283","timestamp":"1693924980.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"cam505"}],"question_text":"A vSphere cluster running a virtual machine with VMware HA and DRS enabled in fully automated mode is experiencing a catastrophic host failure.\nWhich action can the administrator expect DRS to take?"},{"id":"vgsGo1POpxXujFjmyvSg","question_images":[],"question_text":"An alarm is triggered in vSphere Client due to a failure of a host in a cluster.
