Network administrators can use this feature to troubleshoot any network related issues in the virtual infrastructure and monitor virtual_machine-to-virtual_machine traffic that is flowing on the same ESXi host. Network administrators use network analyzer tool, which captures traffic, along with the port mirror feature to perform monitoring and troubleshooting activities. In the physical network, depending on where the analyzer or debug tool is placed in the network, network administrators choose different port mirroring options. The following are some of the standard port mirroring options available on physical switches.\nReference:http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2012/06/how-to-use-port-mirroring-feature-of-vds-for-monitoring-virtual-machine-traffic.html"},{"id":"P7ujmCE0NRJ2NI8ED7Mc","answer":"B","question_text":"What does Storage DRS do to determine if a particular disk device is overburdened?","answers_community":[],"choices":{"A":"Powers down the storage device.","B":"Monitors disk I/O latency on the shared storage devices.","C":"Takes a count of virtual machines on the storage device.","D":"Reads the data on the storage devices."},"unix_timestamp":1591540560,"exam_id":229,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1591540560.0","comment_id":"104608","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Raeisi1988","content":"B.
