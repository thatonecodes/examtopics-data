The @ComponentScan annotation tells Spring where to look for classes annotated with @Component (and other stereotype annotations like @Service, @Repository, and @Controller).

Field and parameter names are used to select a bean if there is no @Primary or @Qualifier, but multiple beans for the same type.\n\nhttps://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-qualifiers.html\n\nActually F is also valid regarding the spring reference doc. Because the field or parameter name is used to determine the bean if there are multiple bean names for the same type. \n\n Letting qualifier values select against target bean names, within the type-matching candidates, does not require a @Qualifier annotation at the injection point. If there is no other resolution indicator (such as a qualifier or a primary marker), for a non-unique dependency situation, Spring matches the injection point name (that is, the field name or parameter name) against the target bean names and chooses the same-named candidate, if any (either by bean name or by associated alias).","poster":"ihet","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742993880.0","comment_id":"1410358"},{"timestamp":"1729501680.0","comment_id":"1300871","content":"A D and F will fail as they are ambiguous calls to Foo by type, when there is more than one bean of that type.\nThus BCE will work due to the use of the @Qualifier annotation specifying which Foo to use. @Qualifier can be used \non constructors, setters and fields.","poster":"stefumies","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BCE\nin both option C and F, we are using the same method setFoo() to autowire the beans, which would lead to a method redeclaration error upon compilation.","poster":"Evoila_TrainingMaterial","comments":[{"timestamp":"1729501740.0","poster":"stefumies","upvote_count":"1","content":"I don't believe these calls are all in the same class, I think these are options for the answer","comment_id":"1300872"}],"timestamp":"1723623240.0","comment_id":"1265565"},{"poster":"Eymet","timestamp":"1696069260.0","content":"Selected Answer: BCE\nAlthough for E field injection is not recommended, F will conflict with C because of two methods setFoo with the same signature.
