VM Encryption\n\nVM Encryption provides encryption for virtual machines and meets all the specified requirements. It encrypts the VM's data at rest and also ensures that the data is encrypted during transit. Additionally, VM Encryption does not require specific hardware, making it a suitable choice for this scenario.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not directly address all of the specified requirements. Encrypted vSphere vMotion (A) is specifically related to encrypting the vMotion traffic, not the VMs themselves. UEFI Secure Boot (B) is a security feature for booting and does not provide VM-level encryption.
