When a host becomes isolated in the management network or experiences downtime, vSphere HA restarts the virtual machines on unaffected hosts to ensure business continuity. \n\nAdditionally, vSphere HA provides automatic failover protection for virtual machines, helping to ensure that critical applications are available even in the event of a host failure.","poster":"dinosan","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"805799","comments":[{"poster":"amibey","timestamp":"1732988220.0","comment_id":"910387","upvote_count":"1","content":"C is wrong since for HA to restart a VM it needs a datastore access"}],"content":"Disregard the previous answer, please!!!!\n\nThe correct answers are B and C.\n\nB. vSphere HA restarts VMs if their host becomes isolated in the management network. This means that if the host that the virtual machine is running on becomes disconnected from the management network for any reason, vSphere HA can detect this and automatically restart the virtual machine on another host in the same cluster to ensure high availability.\n\nC.

This means that if a datastore that a virtual machine is using becomes unavailable, vSphere HA can detect this and automatically restart the virtual machine on another host in the same cluster that has access to the required datastore.","timestamp":"1723416180.0","poster":"dinosan"}]},{"timestamp":"1721183880.0","comment_id":"778553","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nHA work on host failures not on vCenter server failure"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"BC BC BC BC BC BC BC BC BC BC BC BC BC BC","timestamp":"1714093080.0","comment_id":"704287","poster":"DEAN2048"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB and C is right answer indeed.","timestamp":"1714022580.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"tuloveu","comment_id":"703569"},{"content":"answer should be BC, since HA work on host failures not on vcenter server failure","poster":"aditipa","comment_id":"685155","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1712110080.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/84254-exam-1v0-2120-topic-1-question-34-discussion/","topic":"1","question_text":"Which two characteristics describe vSphere HA?
