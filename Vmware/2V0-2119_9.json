This is something that came up fairly frequent when talking about vMotion, will we ever have the ability to move a VM to a new vCenter Server instance? Well as of vSphere 6.0 this is indeed possible. Not only can you move between vCenter Servers but you can do this with all the different migration types there are: change compute / storage / network. You can even do it without having a shared datastore between the source and destination vCenter aka â€œshared nothing migration. This functionality will come in handy when you are migrating to a different vCenter instance or even when you are migrating workloads to a different location. Note, it is a requirement for the source and destination vCenter Server to belong to the same SSO domain. What I love about this feature is that when the VM is migrated things like alarms, events, HA and DRS settings are all migrated with it.
