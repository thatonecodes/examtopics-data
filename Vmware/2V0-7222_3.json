It automatically supports sending and receiving Java objects.\n\nTrue. RestTemplate is designed to work with Java objects and can automatically serialize and deserialize them to and from HTTP request and response bodies using message converters. You can configure it to work with different data formats such as JSON or XML.\n\nC. It provides convenience methods for writing REST clients.\n\nTrue. RestTemplate provides various convenience methods for making HTTP requests to RESTful services, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. It simplifies the process of making REST calls.","comment_id":"1041741","poster":"Eymet","timestamp":"1728737640.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1722684180.0","comment_id":"971047","poster":"james2033","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nE is wrong.
