When you change VM storage policy settings, vSAN might initiate object recreation and subsequent resynchronization of the objects.\nCertain policy changes might cause vSAN to create another version of an object and synchronize it with the previous version. When the synchronization is complete, the original object is discarded.\n\nvSAN ensures that VMs continue to run, and resynchronization does not interrupt their operation. This process might require additional temporary capacity.\n\nRestarting a host after a failure.\nRecovering hosts from a permanent or long-term failure. If a host is unavailable for more than 60 minutes (by default), vSAN creates copies of data to recover the full policy compliance.\nEvacuating data by using the Full data migration mode before you place a host in maintenance mode.\nExceeding the capacity threshold of a capacity device. Resynchronization is triggered when a capacity device in the vSAN cluster approaches or exceeds the threshold level of 80 percent.","comment_id":"647083","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1660552320.0","poster":"ekarjun"}],"answer":"CD","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/78034-exam-5v0-2221-topic-1-question-37-discussion/","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answers_community":["CD (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"A change to the storage policy is applied to the objects.","B":"HA Virtual Machine Monitoring forced a VM to reboot.","C":"A host failure occurs in the cluster.","A":"DRS is relocating VMs between vSAN nodes.","E":"A VM snapshot is being deleted."},"question_text":"The Resyncing Objects view in the vCenter UI reports that some objects are currently resyncing.\nWhich two actions would cause this situation?
