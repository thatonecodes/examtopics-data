Examples environments include:\n• A three-node cluster with no resources to evacuate the replica or witness while maintaining full protection\n• A four-node cluster with RAID-5 objects already deployed\nIn these cases, deduplication and compression can be enabled using the Allow Reduced Redundancy option. This option keeps the VMs running, but the VMs might be unable to tolerate the full level of failures defined in the VM storage policy. In certain cases, you might need to reduce the level of protection for your VMs. When you enable deduplication and compression in certain cases, you might need to reduce the level of protection for your VMs.\n\nTaken from vSAN 6.7 Deploy and Manage Lecture Manual - Enabling Deduplication and Compression section","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"258798"},{"content":"agreed","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1608963120.0","comment_id":"252472","poster":"bnic"},{"comment_id":"96236","upvote_count":"1","poster":"adelbelkis2","content":"It's C\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.virtualsan.doc/GUID-125B2B04-FBB9-43AB-8AF9-E7179734BC7C.html#GUID-125B2B04-FBB9-43AB-8AF9-E7179734BC7C","timestamp":"1590509280.0"},{"timestamp":"1590507360.0","poster":"LCOJ","content":"Correct answer is C: as per infomation below:\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.virtualsan.doc/GUID-125B2B04-FBB9-43AB-8AF9-E7179734BC7C.html#GUID-125B2B04-FBB9-43AB-8AF9-E7179734BC7C","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"96205"},{"content":"i think C is the correct choice","poster":"Mzoear","comment_id":"91467","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1589817960.0"},{"content":"https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.virtualsan.doc/GUID-125B2B04-FBB9-43AB-8AF9-E7179734BC7C.html","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1589721360.0","comment_id":"90575","poster":"LFC"},{"poster":"LFC","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1589721300.0","comment_id":"90574","content":"Correct answer C."}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_id":56,"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":260,"topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-05-17 15:15:00","choices":{"D":"Enable TRIM/UNMAP.","B":"Use explicit fault domains.","C":"Use the Allow Reduced Redundancy option.","A":"Enable vSAN datastore encryption."},"isMC":true,"answer_description":""},{"id":"Pk8W71OZqlpQNvqdjlOO","choices":{"D":"Provides vSAN analytic data","C":"Stores vSphere HA heartbeats","B":"Allows for maintenance and failure operations","A":"Increases overall vSAN capacity"},"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"question_text":"What is the purpose of slack space in vSAN?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"jasonv","content":"B is correct slack space is used by background operations","comment_id":"141746","upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1595486580.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nis correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"512022","poster":"Lazylinux","timestamp":"1640771400.0"},{"timestamp":"1638313620.0","poster":"Lazylinux","content":"B is right","comment_id":"491055","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"diegof1","content":"B is right.\n\nVMware recommends keeping a minimum of 25-30% of the vSAN datastore free.
