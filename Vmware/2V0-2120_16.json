This instant provisioning is made possible by sharing both the memory and disk state of the SourceVM. From a memory standpoint, all Instant Clones will share the same physical memory pages as its SourceVM. This is true even if Transparent Memory Sharing (TPS) is disabled, which is actually really cool (more details will be updated in KB 2080735 for those interested). In other words, TPS is just one of the techniques that Instant Clone can take advantage of but not solely rely on to help deliver maximum memory efficiencies which ultimately enables greater consolidation ratios.","comment_id":"831045"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct answer.\nWhen an instant clone is created in vSphere, the memory allocation is handled in a unique way that differs from traditional cloning methods. Rather than creating a new copy of the virtual machine's memory, vSphere leverages a feature called Memory COW (Copy-On-Write) technology to allow multiple virtual machines to share the same memory space.\n\nDuring the instant clone process, a new virtual machine is created with a snapshot of the parent virtual machine's disk state. However, instead of creating a new copy of the virtual machine's memory, the new virtual machine is linked to the parent virtual machine's memory space, which is marked as read-only.\n\nAs the new virtual machine runs, any writes to memory are redirected to a new memory page, which is then marked as read-write and is unique to that virtual machine. This means that multiple virtual machines can share the same memory space without interfering with each other.\n\nThis Memory COW technology allows for faster creation of virtual machines and reduced memory usage, as only the memory pages that have been modified need to be stored separately for each virtual machine.","timestamp":"1677796800.0","comment_id":"827511","upvote_count":"2","poster":"cozy101"},{"content":"Correct answer B","poster":"Lou92230","comment_id":"810626","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676550060.0"},{"timestamp":"1675942080.0","poster":"VladiDo","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-\n853B1E2B-76CE-4240-A654-3806912820EB.html","comment_id":"803139","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"800650","content":"B is correct\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-\n853B1E2B-76CE-4240-A654-3806912820EB.html","timestamp":"1675754700.0","poster":"VladiDo"},{"poster":"MohamedZohair","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is Correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"796912","timestamp":"1675415280.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe result of an Instant Clone operation is a virtual machine that is called a destination virtual machine.
