Port Mirroring\nC. NetFlow\n\nPort Mirroring allows mirroring network traffic from a port or set of ports to another port for monitoring or analysis purposes. It's a feature used for network troubleshooting, monitoring, or security analysis.\n\nNetFlow is a networking protocol used for network traffic monitoring and analysis. Enabling NetFlow on distributed switches allows the collection and analysis of network traffic data, providing insights into network usage and patterns.\n\nBoth Port Mirroring and NetFlow functionalities are exclusive to distributed switches and are not available on standard switches in VMware vSphere environments."},{"comment_id":"902025","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nThe correct answers are A and B. Port mirroring and VLAN IDs can only be enabled on distributed switches. Port mirroring allows for the copying of packets to a monitor port, which can be used for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.\nVLAN IDs allow for the creation of logical networks within a physical network, and are essential for managing and securing traffic within a network. NetFlow, NIC teaming, and load balancing can all be enabled on both distributed and standard switches.","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"Zer0C0ld0","content":"wrong : VLans IDs can be set on standard virtual switches as well","comment_id":"1302961","timestamp":"1729877880.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Nope, that's not right.","poster":"Okayfabien","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1699606860.0","comment_id":"1067097"}],"poster":"JokerRWild","timestamp":"1684506780.0"},{"timestamp":"1681399200.0","comment_id":"869526","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA and C","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Repic_NJ"},{"timestamp":"1675910940.0","comment_id":"802754","upvote_count":"2","poster":"dinosan","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA. Port Mirroring and C. NetFlow can only be enabled on distributed switches in vSphere.\n\nPort Mirroring, also known as network monitoring or span, allows you to copy network traffic from a virtual switch port to another virtual switch port for analysis purposes. This feature is only available on distributed switches in vSphere.\n\nNetFlow is a network protocol used for collecting, aggregating, and recording traffic flow data in a network. NetFlow is used to monitor network traffic and can be used to identify network performance issues or security incidents. In vSphere, NetFlow is only available on distributed switches.\n\nB. VLAN IDs, D. NIC Teaming, and E. Load Balancing can be enabled on both standard and distributed switches in vSphere. These features allow you to configure virtual networks, team network adapters for increased reliability, and balance network traffic across multiple physical adapters."},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"ch2023","content":"A and C","comment_id":"795240","timestamp":"1675264080.0"},{"comment_id":"760105","timestamp":"1672246020.0","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA and C obviously","poster":"macxsz","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Answer is A, C\nhttps://vmarena.com/vsphere-standard-switch-vs-distributed-switch/","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"757325","timestamp":"1672048260.0","poster":"kalos"},{"timestamp":"1672048200.0","poster":"kalos","comment_id":"757323","content":"Answer is A, C\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=Distributed+Switch+Features&rlz=1C1CHZN_itIT967IT967&sxsrf=ALiCzsZl_A0udRH3Go_ojToY6SrglaIMpg:1672051749088&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-orOUjpf8AhUkh_0HHZSoCp0Q_AUoBHoECAEQBg&biw=1762&bih=852&dpr=1.09#imgrc=Hz9nSn23DD0I_M","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1667775960.0","comment_id":"712695","poster":"pradeepcv","content":"Answer is A,C","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"VMware vSphere: Install, Configure, Manage Lecture Manual ESXi 7 and vCenter Server 7\n\nDistributed switches include several features that are not part of standard switches. \nFeature Standard Switch Distributed Switch\nInbound traffic shaping No Yes\nVM network port block No Yes\nPrivate VLANs No Yes\nLoad-based teaming No Yes\nData center level management No Yes\nvSphere vMotion migration of virtual networking state No Yes\nPer-port policy settings No Yes\nPort state monitoring of network statistics No Yes\nNetFlow No Yes\nPort mirroring No Yes\nAccess to NSX-T port groups Link No Yes\nLayer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) No Yes","poster":"mmorac","timestamp":"1667366520.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"709627"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nStandard Switch Features: VLAN support, Security policy, NIC teaming and failover policy, and Traffic shaping policy for outbound traffic.\n\nDistributed Switch Features: (All of the aforementioned features on a Standard Switch) Traffic shaping policy for inbound traffic, NetFlow, Port mirroring, and Network I/O Control.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1667039700.0","poster":"rc34yb23","comment_id":"707127"},{"comment_id":"704758","poster":"dinosan","comments":[{"comment_id":"707124","poster":"rc34yb23","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"i second this demolishment of the replied-to argument","timestamp":"1676813700.0","comment_id":"814122","poster":"melmiosis"}],"timestamp":"1667039280.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Your link is speaking of configuring NIC Teaming, Failover, and Load Balancing on DISTRIBUTED PORT GROUPS and DISTRIBUTED PORTS.
