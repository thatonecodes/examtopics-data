For an all-flash vSAN ESX cluster with four nodes, typical configurations would allow for:\n\nB. FTT=2 (RAID-1 Mirroring): This policy would replicate data across two different nodes in the cluster, providing data redundancy. In a four-node cluster, this is achievable.\n\nD. FTT=1 (RAID-1 Mirroring): This policy would replicate data across one other node, which can be satisfied in a four-node cluster.\n\nHowever, the suitability of other policies like FTT=3 (RAID-1 Mirroring) or FTT=2 (RAID-6 Erasure Coding) would depend on the specific configuration, number of nodes, and the capacity and redundancy requirements of your cluster. It's important to choose storage policies that align with your cluster's capabilities and your organization's needs.","comment_id":"1047705","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ansari678"},{"comment_id":"1023599","content":"Selected Answer: CD\n-FTT=3R1 needs 7 nodes 2*3+1\nFTT=2R1 needs 5 nodes 2*2+1 \nFTT=2R6 needs 6 nodes (2*2+1)+1\nFTT=1 EC is 4 nodes min \nFTT=1 Mirror is 3 nodes min","poster":"libraboysg","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1712117760.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"pludbe","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC D correct","timestamp":"1711585980.0","comment_id":"1019247"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/121606-exam-5v0-2223-topic-1-question-8-discussion/","choices":{"E":"FTT=2 (RAID-6 Erasure Coding)","D":"FTT=l (RAID-1 Mirroring)","A":"FTT=3 (RAID-1 Mirroring)","C":"FTT=l (RAID-5 Erasure Coding)","B":"FTT=2 (RAID-1 Mirroring)"},"answer_ET":"CD"},{"id":"NIDx3ENgNkFOOhQlgjQH","unix_timestamp":1695835680,"question_images":[],"answer":"D","isMC":true,"question_text":"A vSAN administrator is investigating vSAN performance related problems but cannot find any vSAN performance statistics on the cluster summary page.\nWhy is this situation occurring?","choices":{"D":"vSAN performance service is not enabled.","C":"vSAN performance statistics are only available via CLI.","B":"The administrator has read-only permissions on the cluster level.","A":"The vRealize Operations Manager is not integrated with vSAN cluster."},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/121576-exam-5v0-2223-topic-1-question-9-discussion/","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1137687","poster":"ShiVip","upvote_count":"1","content":"The performance service collects and analyzes performance statistics and displays the data in a graphical format.
