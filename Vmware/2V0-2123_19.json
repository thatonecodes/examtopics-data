This can be used to ensure that critical virtual machines are restarted first.\n\nIn the scenario described, the database server is the most critical virtual machine, followed by the application server, and then the Web server. You would therefore set the restart priority for the database server to 1, the application server to 2, and the Web server to 3.\n\nThis would ensure that the database server is restarted first, followed by the application server, and then the Web server.
