The use of VM/Host Groups will allow administrators to “pin” virtual machines to sites, preventing unnecessary vMotions/migrations.\n\nhttps://core.vmware.com/resource/vsan-stretched-cluster-guide#vm-groups"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nThe question here talks about the placement of the VMs, not their data.

Create VM/Host groups for the two sites D. Put the VMs in the correct VM group\n\nOption A refers to creating VM/Host DRS groups which are utilized to create DRS rules.
