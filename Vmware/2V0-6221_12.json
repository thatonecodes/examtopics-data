Based on this understanding:\n\nB. **Native MDM enrollment**: This refers to the process where IT admins can enroll devices into management via the Windows 10 built-in MDM client. This is typically IT-driven because it can be pre-configured by IT before the device reaches the end-user.\n\nC. **Command Line Interface (CLI) staging**: This involves using command-line tools to stage or prepare a device for a user. It's a process that's usually done by IT before the device is handed over to the end-user.\n\nThese methods are controlled by IT, rather than being self-service options for end-users, making them IT-driven onboarding workflows. Options A, D, and E involve scanning a QR code, manually adding a device, or scanning a barcode, respectively, which can be part of user-driven enrollment workflows."}],"exam_id":249,"answer":"CD"},{"id":"qI0EHVQMGzv5oQvchjYj","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1678257060,"question_text":"Which of the following features can be used to enable Virtual Assistance?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/101841-exam-2v0-6221-topic-1-question-62-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Workspace ONE Assist","A":"Workspace ONE UEM","B":"Workspace ONE Access","D":"Workspace ONE Hub Services"},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"BJS78","content":"\"D\"\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workspace-ONE-Access/20.10/ws1access-administrator/GUID-A7E8759E-76F1-4BBF-98F3-8334384E9AEB.html","comment_id":"832595","timestamp":"1678257060.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-03-08 07:31:00","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","exam_id":249,"answer_images":[],"question_id":58},{"id":"r0p9WsKEi5l1ljIlYOEP","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which three features from Workspace ONE Hub Services are Cloud only?
