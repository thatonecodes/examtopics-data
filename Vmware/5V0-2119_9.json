This feature enables an iSCSI initiator on a remote host to transport block-level data to an iSCSI target on a storage device in the vSAN cluster, allowing the discovery of vSAN iSCSI targets from a remote host. vSAN 6.7 and later releases support Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC), allowing WSFC nodes to access vSAN iSCSI targets.\nTo ensure high availability of the vSAN iSCSI target, configure multipath support for your iSCSI application. You can use the IP addresses of two or more hosts to configure the multipath.\n\nNote: The vSAN iSCSI target service does not support other vSphere, ESXi clients, initiators, third-party hypervisors, or migrations using raw device mapping (RDM).\n\nTaken from vSAN 6.7 Deploy and Manage Lecture Manual - vSAN iSCSI Target Service Section","comment_id":"257584","upvote_count":"2","poster":"diegof1","timestamp":"1609602480.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1592162760.0","poster":"LCOJ","content":"Answer D is correct, the ISCSI is supported with Oracle RAC, WSFC from Microsoft and to delivery LUNs to physical host out of the box.\n\nhttps://storagehub.vmware.com/t/vmware-r-vsan-tm-network-design/iscsi-on-vsan-limitations-and-considerations/","comment_id":"110314"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/23151-exam-5v0-2119-topic-1-question-45-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1592162760,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"lSAVaOdqmlywveXZDFZM","timestamp":"2020-05-17 14:58:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1640823000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIs correct as per others comments","comment_id":"512876","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Lazylinux"},{"content":"wtkc - please read the question again - it clearly says \"A pre-vSAN 6.6 node\" meaning vSAN 6.5 node or below was added to a new vSAN 6.7 cluster. vSAN 6.5 and below does not support unicast so there's no way to communicate with other nodes in the cluster.
