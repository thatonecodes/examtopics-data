Since Instant Clones are inherently non-persistent and share the same virtual disk with the parent VM, there's no need for additional redundancy in this case. The requirement in the question is to use the least amount of storage possible. Therefore, FTT=0 is the most storage-efficient option for Instant Clone VMs in a vSAN environment.","timestamp":"1709793480.0"},{"content":"Answer is C, its an HA cluster","timestamp":"1707895320.0","poster":"fm313","comment_id":"1149909","comments":[{"comment_id":"1327813","poster":"frogggyyy","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1734425340.0","content":"vCenter HA and vSAN FTT are two different mechanisms for providing high availability, and they work independently of each other."}],"upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nMy answer is B","timestamp":"1706697600.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"John_Bob","comment_id":"1136670"}],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An architect is tasked to plan a VMware Horizon environment using vSAN as the primary storage for a vSphere HA-enabled Cluster, but it must consume the least amount of storage possible.\n\nWhich vSAN Storage Policy should be used for the Instant Clone VMs?","choices":{"A":"FTT=3","D":"FTT=2","C":"FTT=1","B":"FTT=0"}},{"id":"fdykfA2QPus6MCL6g3IQ","exam_id":262,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An architect is reviewing a vSAN cluster that has an unbalanced cluster configuration.\n\nWhich behavior will the architect observe?","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-10-03 16:33:00","discussion":[{"poster":"kernelkraut","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709793660.0","content":"B is correct:\n\nReference: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsan-planning/GUID-57575456-0AD9-4655-9D6B-58509C1DF33C.html\n\nUsing hosts with different configurations has the following disadvantages in a vSAN cluster:\nReduced predictability of storage performance because vSAN does not store the same number of components on each host.\nDifferent maintenance procedures.\nReduced performance on hosts in the cluster that have smaller or different types of cache devices.","comment_id":"1167733"},{"timestamp":"1706697600.0","poster":"John_Bob","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nMy answer is B","comment_id":"1136671"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-planning.doc/GUID-57575456-0AD9-4655-9D6B-58509C1DF33C.html","poster":"jchampion","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1024011","timestamp":"1696343580.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1696343580,"choices":{"A":"Consistent maintenance procedures","C":"Reduced deduplication capabilities","D":"Faster rebuild times","B":"Reduced predictability of storage performance"},"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":87,"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/122266-exam-5v0-2121-topic-1-question-87-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"0plresJU81Q6LLFtxKkM","question_text":"An architect is tasked with designing a solution that includes the following requirements:\n\n• The solution must support 5,000 virtual machines.\n• The solution must include software defined storage.\n• The deployment of the solution must be automated.\n• The solution must provide storage-policy based disaster recovery for all workloads.\n\nWhich combination of three products will fulfill these requirements?

This unfortunately isn't ideal, as it can unfairly represent statistical outliers, which may very well occur when there is little to no I/O activity. The best way to understand the actual behavior of VM and application latencies is to observe in time based performance graphs.\nDepending on the level of detail, you may need to measure at the individual VMDK level. Become familiar with these graphs to determine what is normal, and what is not for that given application. This is where you can use built-in functionality of vCenter and the vSAN performance service metrics to gather this information.\nReference:\nhttps://core.vmware.com/resource/troubleshooting-vsan-performance#_Toc536646873","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Lazylinux","timestamp":"1640388900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC For sure","comment_id":"508899"},{"comment_id":"464862","poster":"dikboy","timestamp":"1634689680.0","content":"Agree with C\n\nPrerequisites\nThe vSAN performance service must be turned on before you can view performance charts.\n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-monitoring.doc/GUID-EF27701E-7BAC-4E76-9D2F-E1C58CAAB06D.html","upvote_count":"2"}],"exam_id":262,"question_id":90,"choices":{"D":"vSAN performance verbose mode is not enabled.","C":"vSAN performance service is turned off.","B":"vSAN proactive tests haven't been run yet.","A":"vSAN network diagnostic mode is not enabled."},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-10-20 02:28:00","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1634689680,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/64373-exam-5v0-2121-topic-1-question-9-discussion/"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"5V0-21.21","provider":"Vmware","isImplemented":true,"id":262,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":95},"currentPage":18},"__N_SSP":true}
