New VMDKs have been added to multiple VMs, but the storage policy has not finished applying.\n\nThe \"Healthy Components\" column shows that the number of components in a fully healthy state is less than the total number of components, which suggests that some components are not fully healthy. When new VMDKs are added to VMs, it can trigger the reconfiguration of storage components to meet the requirements of the storage policy. During this reconfiguration process, some components may temporarily not be in a fully healthy state until the reconfiguration completes.
