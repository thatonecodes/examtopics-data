Virtual CPUs (vCPUs) allow multiple virtual machines to share the physical CPU resources efficiently. The hypervisor manages the scheduling and allocation of CPU time among the virtual machines to ensure fair access and optimal performance.\n\nMemory (RAM): The hypervisor abstracts the physical memory (RAM) of the host machine and partitions it into virtual memory segments allocated to each virtual machine. Each virtual machine operates within its allocated memory space, isolated from other virtual machines running on the same host. The hypervisor manages memory allocation and ensures that each virtual machine has sufficient memory to execute its tasks without contention."},{"timestamp":"1715834640.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nThe two physical resources that are abstracted by the hypervisor and presented to virtual machines are:\n\nB. CPU\nE. Memory\n\nThe hypervisor abstracts physical CPU cores and memory (RAM) from the underlying physical hardware and presents these resources to virtual machines. This abstraction allows multiple virtual machines to share the physical CPU and memory while operating as if they have dedicated access to these resources. This abstraction and sharing of CPU and memory enable the consolidation of multiple workloads onto a single physical server without the need for each virtual machine to have its own dedicated hardware.","comment_id":"1072222","upvote_count":"1","poster":"playfulbear"},{"timestamp":"1714500300.0","content":"CPU and Memory are the physical ressources","poster":"Kamal_SriLanka","comment_id":"1059170","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"910271","content":"No way in hell its C & D.
