However, we don't know how many VMs are required, therefore there's a risk of a high CPU overcommitment (especially in case of failover), which will impact on performance. Also, if the application doesn't need/use 8 cores, their use will be scheduled anyway therefore wasting resources (we don't know that, but if 1 vCPU is enough for the application then it would be counterproductive to configure it with 8)\nB) It'd be good practice to start a VM with lower vCPU possible and then increase if needed.

While in vSphere 6.5 U1 and 6.7 it supports up to 8vCPU per VM, but the same 8vCPU protected on a host and the same 4 VMs protected. It makes no sense to have an OS cluster that offers high availability and spend twice as many resources to protect them with FT in a 3 ESXi cluster with 8 cores. Since it is enough to protect them with HA.\nConsidering that the statement says the highest level of Uptime and Individual Performance then this covers it with FT and 8vCPU per VM. This way you could protect: A single VM per host (in vSphere 6.5U1 or higher) located on host1, the secondary copy would be on the other host2 and host3 would remain for high availability.
