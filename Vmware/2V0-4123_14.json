Partner SVM\n\nAccording to the VMware NSX Documentation, Partner SVM is a valid insertion point for north-south network introspection. Network introspection is a feature that allows you to insert third-party network services into the data path of your traffic. Partner SVM stands for Partner Service Virtual Machine and is a virtual appliance that runs on an NSX Edge node and provides network services from a partner solution.","comment_id":"1042470","poster":"descentguy2021","timestamp":"1712998500.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1042474","poster":"descentguy2021","timestamp":"1712998560.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/administration/GUID-53D6C480-7AD3-4B23-922D-430C89992B57.html"}]}],"question_id":68,"choices":{"B":"Host Physical NIC","C":"Guest VM vNIC","D":"Partner SVM","A":"Tier-0 gateway"},"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which choice is a valid insertion point for North-South network introspection?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/123513-exam-2v0-4123-topic-1-question-64-discussion/","answers_community":["A (80%)","D (20%)"],"answer_description":"","exam_id":242,"unix_timestamp":1697187300,"answer":"A"},{"id":"DpZeLDgfTTRe2F3PWUN5","isMC":true,"question_text":"Where in the NSX UI would an administrator set the time attribute for a time-based Gateway Firewall rule?","question_id":69,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":242,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/123929-exam-2v0-4123-topic-1-question-65-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"content":"Answer is B\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX/4.1/administration/GUID-8572496E-A60E-48C3-A016-4A081AC80BE7.html","poster":"JustBrett","timestamp":"1729220400.0","comment_id":"1046506","upvote_count":"5"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nReference: https://yogovirtual.com/2021/03/02/nsx-t-time-based-firewall-policy/","comment_id":"1057572","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730285820.0","poster":"zelele"}],"unix_timestamp":1697598000,"choices":{"B":"The option to set time-based rule is a clock icon in the policy.","C":"The option to set time-based rule is a field in the rule itself.","A":"There is no option in the NSX UI.
