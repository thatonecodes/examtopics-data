How quickly the resume operation performs depends on how active the virtual machine is. The more active the virtual machine is, the longer it will take to resume. It also depends on whether the virtual machine suspended state (.vmss or .vmem) file set is already in the physical memory of the host system.

So the machine itself is still in memory, and the allocated resources are still allocated to the VM process on the host. This is entirely on the VM side--this isn't handled by the guest OS.\n\nIn suspend mode, the contents of the RAM (as used by the VM) are copied to disk on the host, and the machine itself is suspended--which means that except for the additional disk space caused by the storing of the RAM to disk, there's absolutely no additional resource usage. Any temporary resources requested by the VM while running are stored to disk and will be re-allocated when the machine is restored.","poster":"canonlycontainletters1","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"674185","comments":[{"timestamp":"1710861360.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"halifax","content":"I think your reference still supports answer C here is why.\n\nIn suspend mode, the contents of the RAM (as used by the VM) are copied to disk on the host, and the machine itself is suspended.\nSo, if they are copied to the host's hard disk and under which file name extension do you find them? it must be .vmss as .vmdk doesn't save suspended state. \n\nThe question is asking \"to provide the suspended virtual machine's memory contents.\" they can only be stored on the hard disk!","comment_id":"843872"}],"timestamp":"1695214740.0"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"vm.vmdk","B":"vm.log","D":"vm.vmx","C":"vm.vmss"}}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":228,"provider":"Vmware","name":"1V0-21.20","numberOfQuestions":99,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":19},"__N_SSP":true}
