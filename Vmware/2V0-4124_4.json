This is due to the overhead introduced by Geneve encapsulation used by NSX. While 1600 might work in some very limited cases, 1700 is the officially supported and recommended minimum to avoid potential issues. Using a smaller MTU can lead to fragmentation and performance problems.","comment_id":"1352596","poster":"amorcle"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"huFn4TePLhK8TvmQj0Tu","answer_images":[],"question_id":20,"exam_id":243,"answers_community":["CEF (100%)"],"answer":"CEF","answer_ET":"ACF","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/156056-exam-2v0-4124-topic-1-question-27-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-02-06 20:04:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1738868640,"question_text":"What are three NSX Manager roles?
