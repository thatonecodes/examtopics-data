It includes automation capabilities for deploying and managing the entire stack, including vSAN Stretched Clusters, which helps streamline the deployment process and reduces administrative efforts.\n\nWhile vRealize Automation (option B) and vRealize Orchestrator (option D) are automation tools that can be used for deploying and orchestrating various components, VMware Cloud Foundation is specifically designed to simplify the deployment and management of the entire SDDC stack, making it the most suitable choice for this scenario.","poster":"kernelkraut","timestamp":"1709710980.0","comment_id":"1166990","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706696820.0","poster":"John_Bob","content":"Selected Answer: D\nMy answer is D.","comment_id":"1136626"}]},{"id":"CQmgsHyPRI3aesjUAbaN","question_id":55,"unix_timestamp":1706696940,"choices":{"D":"75%","A":"25%","B":"50%","C":"100%"},"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/132550-exam-5v0-2121-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-01-31 11:29:00","exam_id":262,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Administrator deployed VMs with vSAN Stretched Cluster aware storage policy.\n\nWhich percentage of read locality will be maintained?","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1166994","content":"C is correct. For stretched clusters, read locality is force to 100% to ensure that data is read from the local site.\n\nReference below from: https://core.vmware.com/resource/vsan-stretched-cluster-guide#the-vsan-witness-host\n\nIn traditional vSAN clusters, a virtual machine’s read operations are distributed across all replica copies of the data in the cluster. In the case of a policy setting of NumberOfFailuresToTolerate =1, which results in two copies of the data, 50% of the reads will come from replica 1 and 50% from replica 2. In the case of a policy setting of NumberOfFailuresToTolerate =2 in non-stretched vSAN clusters, it results in three copies of the data, 33% of the reads will come from replica 1, 33% of the reads will come from replica 2, and 33% will come from replica 3.\n\nIn a vSAN Stretched Cluster, we wish to avoid increased latency caused by reading across the inter-site link. The read locality mechanism was introduced to ensure that 100% of reads occur on the site the VM resides on. Read locality overrides the NumberOfFailuresToTolerate=1 policy’s behavior to distribute reads across the components.","timestamp":"1709711340.0","poster":"kernelkraut"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1136629","timestamp":"1706696940.0","poster":"John_Bob","content":"Selected Answer: C\nMy answer is C"}]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":95,"id":262,"name":"5V0-21.21","provider":"Vmware","isBeta":false},"currentPage":11},"__N_SSP":true}
