In NSX-T Data Center, segments are virtual layer-2 domains.\n\nYou can create overlay-backed NSX segments or VLAN-backed NSX segments. Both options create two NSX segments (Region-A and X-Region) on the NSX Edge cluster deployed in the default management vSphere cluster. Those NSX segments are used when you deploy the vRealize Suite products. Region-A segments are local instance NSX segments and X-Region segments are cross-instance NSX segments.","poster":"Doggy95"},{"comment_id":"977534","content":"D and E","poster":"xniclas","timestamp":"1691664300.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_id":127,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-08-10 12:45:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":267,"unix_timestamp":1691664300,"answers_community":["DE (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"DE","choices":{"A":"NSX Load Balancer","B":"NSX Global Manager","C":"NSX Intelligence","D":"NSX Edge Cluster","E":"NSX segments"},"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which two NSX-T Data Center components are present in VMware Cloud Foundation when Application Virtual Networks (AVNs) are deployed?
