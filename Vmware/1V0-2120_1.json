So, unless the host network\nutilization is above 80%, DRS considers the host to be a good candidate in terms of network resource\navailability.\nIf a hostâ€™s network utilization is at or above the saturation threshold, DRS considers it to be network saturated. If\nall the hosts in the cluster are network saturated, DRS will prefer not to migrate VMs with network load, since\nmigrating network loaded VMs to an already network saturated host would result in further degradation of VM\nperformance.
