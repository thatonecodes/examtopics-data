RESTful applications use a stateless architecture.\nThis means that the server does not keep any client state between requests. Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.\n\nB. RESTful application use HTTP headers and status codes as a contract with the clients.\nHTTP headers and status codes are used to communicate the status of the request, any errors that occurred, and metadata about the returned resource. This is part of the uniform interface constraint of REST. \n\nOptions C, D, and E are not principles of REST.
