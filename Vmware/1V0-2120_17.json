This means that it runs directly on the physical hardware of a server without the need for a separate underlying operating system. Type-1 hypervisors are also referred to as \"bare-metal\" hypervisors because they interact directly with the server hardware, abstracting its resources to create and manage multiple virtual machines (VMs). ESXi is designed to provide high performance, reliability, and security for virtualized environments, making it a popular choice for enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructure.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"spar75","comment_id":"1212435"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer D - ESXi sits on the hardware.Type 2 runs on top of an operating system.","comment_id":"1047197","timestamp":"1713469860.0","poster":"MassRattler"}],"exam_id":228,"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1697658660,"choices":{"C":"Oracle VM VirtualBox","B":"VMware Workstation","A":"VMware Fusion","D":"VMware ESXi"}},{"id":"Am3xBHpq3RgD2uHB7OM3","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1663677660,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":228,"choices":{"D":"Look in the guest OS version drop-down menu of the VM.","A":"Snapshot the VM before performing the operating system upgrade.","C":"Check the web page of the guest operating system vendor.","B":"Perform a guest OS and product search in the VMware Compatibility Guide."},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"674152","poster":"canonlycontainletters1","timestamp":"1679323260.0"},{"timestamp":"1731772500.0","poster":"spar75","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1212437","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTo ensure that the selected operating system is supported by VMware ESXi, the administrator should consult VMware's Compatibility Guide.

Block-based storage organizes data in structured fixed blocks that are easily indexed and searched. With file-based storage, data is often laid out in a hierarchy of files and folders. vSAN stores and manages data in the form of objects. Each vSAN object is composed of a set of components. The components are determined according to the specified virtual machine storage policy settings. One of the most important concepts in vSAN is the idea of storage objects and components.The webinar will look at the different object types and components contained in a vSAN datastore, the possible object and component states as well as the impact of storage policy-based management.\"\n\nhttps://learning.customerconnect.vmware.com/site/openlearn.do?dispatch=previewLesson&id=75c6cd02-da13-11e9-b1f7-0cc47a3505aa","timestamp":"1696610640.0","poster":"Repic_NJ","comment_id":"863162"},{"poster":"Metzli","timestamp":"1695400980.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Metzli","timestamp":"1695404160.0","content":"Disregard, it is vSAN","comment_id":"847447"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nvVols is software defined and object based","comment_id":"847397"},{"poster":"halifax","timestamp":"1695145920.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"844158","content":"This one is tough; I will pick B for an answer, because vSAN is not a true object-storage."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kayu_Sai","timestamp":"1689168420.0","comment_id":"773643","content":"Correct answer is D\nvSAN is softer defined and Object based storage.\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-planning.doc/GUID-1D8956A2-3F46-49C8-9231-38F3A9D09A0F.htmlhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-planning.doc/GUID-ACC10393-47F6-4C5A-85FC-88051C1806A0.html\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-planning.doc/GUID-1D8956A2-3F46-49C8-9231-38F3A9D09A0F.html"},{"poster":"tocageek","comment_id":"773437","content":"Selected Answer: D\nvSANs, see link from canonlycontainletters1","timestamp":"1689157920.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Gbenavi1","comment_id":"718371","content":"The right option is vVOLs, it is software-defined, object based storage solution, not traditional iSCSI and vSAN are traditional.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1684101600.0","comments":[{"content":"Upvoted \"vVols represent virtual disks of a virtual machine as abstract objects \".
