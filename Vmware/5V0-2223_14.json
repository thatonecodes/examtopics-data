Active Directory Domain, User Account, Password\n\nThe Active Directory Domain is necessary to integrate the NFS file share with your Windows Active Directory environment, which provides authentication services.

For a cluster to be able to tolerate a single host failure, vSAN requires free space to restore the data of the failed host. The capacity required to restore a host failure matches the total capacity of the largest host in the cluster.\n\nThese values are represented as thresholds in the Capacity Monitor page:\nOperations threshold - Displays the space vSAN requires to run its internal operations in the cluster. If the used space exceeds the operations threshold, vSAN might not operate properly.\nHost rebuild threshold - Displays the space vSAN requires to tolerate one host failure. If the used space exceeds the host rebuild threshold and the host fails, vSAN might not successfully restore all data from the failed host.\n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-monitoring.doc/GUID-CD510EAE-1A9F-45D2-BB66-E893C8AAF20A.html","comment_id":"1053451","poster":"libraboysg"},{"timestamp":"1729084560.0","poster":"jchampion","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1044991","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-monitoring.doc/GUID-CD510EAE-1A9F-45D2-BB66-E893C8AAF20A.html"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/123759-exam-5v0-2223-topic-1-question-71-discussion/","question_id":68,"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"D":"The physical disk has reached an 80% full reactive rebalance threshold.","A":"Underutilized space is above 25-30% of the total capacity threshold.","B":"The used space on vSAN datastore exceeds the suggested host rebuild threshold.","C":"The used space on vSAN datastore exceeds the suggested slack rebuild threshold."},"timestamp":"2023-10-16 15:16:00","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1697462160,"exam_id":264,"question_images":[],"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":""},{"id":"h04paGHGrB2WEvrRQ4TH","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1695945180,"question_id":69,"answer":"C","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/121761-exam-5v0-2223-topic-1-question-72-discussion/","exam_id":264,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"The vSphere Client reports that the state of some components stored on the vSAN datastore are in the reconfiguring state.\nWhich situation causes components to enter this state?","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"The applied storage policy is modified.","B":"The cluster is recovering from a vSAN failure.","D":"Additional storage capacity is added to the cluster.","A":"A host in the cluster enters maintenance mode."},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1020288","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC - correct\n• Active components: Healthy and functioning correctly.\n• Reconfiguring components: In the process of applying storage policy changes.\n• Absent components: No longer available due to a failure.\n• Stale components: No longer in sync with other components of the same vSAN object.\n• Degraded components: Not expected to return due to a detected failure.","poster":"pludbe","timestamp":"1727567580.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"2023-09-29 01:53:00"},{"id":"1puGeaVGqZy27K72JlG8","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"An administrator has deployed a new vSAN OSA cluster that contains eight hosts and needs to configure a storage policy for the currently deployed database virtual machines.
