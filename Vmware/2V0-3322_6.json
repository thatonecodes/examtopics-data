With this method, data migration is done incrementally and continuous synchronization of differential data is performed, minimizing the impact on applications while migrating 300 virtual machines from region A to region B. Additionally, in the event of a migration failure, the migration can be aborted without interrupting application access to targeted virtual machines. Furthermore, it can support concurrent switch over of the application workloads during a maintenance window.\n\nB is incorrect. VMware HCX Bulk Migration is best for migrating a large amount of data at once, but it is not the appropriate solution for this scenario where minimal downtime for application migration is required.","timestamp":"1711473960.0","comment_id":"851209"},{"content":"The selected answer is correct - Bulk Migrations.\n\nThe key line is the concurrent switchover piece which is done with bulk migration, but not with RAV (Serial) \n\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-HCX/4.6/hcx-user-guide/GUID-20EA2946-57CD-4A87-AE25-866E5336AEA9.html","comment_id":"840189","timestamp":"1710528360.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"HornadyHero47","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1717609200.0","content":"Not true, RAV does support multiple VMs replication simultaneously.","comment_id":"915636","poster":"casablankino"}]}]},{"id":"DzNXDDRmiSWkgzmCeDPZ","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/101806-exam-2v0-3322-topic-1-question-27-discussion/","answers_community":["CE (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-03-07 20:37:00","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1678217820,"question_id":27,"answer":"CE","choices":{"E":"Floor and elevator weight capacity between loading dock and datacenter","B":"Distance between loading dock and datacenter","A":"Having enough existing rack space for the components","D":"Having enough people to carry the equipment","C":"Size of the doorways between loading dock and datacenter"},"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","poster":"Marioalfo2","comment_id":"832235","timestamp":"1694108220.0","content":"The correct answers are:\n\nC.
