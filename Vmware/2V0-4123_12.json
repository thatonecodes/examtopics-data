A range of VLANs can also be specified (VLAN X-Y).\nUplink trunk segments specify which VLANs are allowed but do not add 802.1Q VLAN tagging. Tags are added in the uplink interface of VRF gateways.\nYou can configure a dedicated uplink trunk segment for each VRF uplink if the trunk is configured as a single VLAN range (X-X). As a best practice, you should connect the VRF uplinks to the same uplink trunk segment. This method reduces the number of resources required (segments, logical switch ports, and logical router ports).","timestamp":"1714592280.0","comment_id":"1060072","poster":"hello_world67859Y63"},{"timestamp":"1714316700.0","poster":"goal2025","comments":[{"timestamp":"1724905680.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"you are wrong.\nits B is required to set the allowed vlan for a segment, this is connected to the VRF gateway\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/administration/GUID-4CB5796A-1CED-4F0E-ADE0-72BF7B3F762C.html","poster":"avid_researcher","comment_id":"1162268"}],"content":"Selected Answer: AE\nI think answer \"A & E\"","comment_id":"1056276","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"Where does an administrator configure the VLANs used in VRF Lite?
