You don't have to open a SR and wait for the direction of the VMware Support to enable it. There is no official recommendation anymore. If you have an extreme scenario you will probably need to react quickly. I wouldn't advice to do it without a really good reason though and definitely would recommend to involve the Support team especially if you are not familiar with vSAN. but still, you can enable it on your own if you know what you are doing and take the responsibility.\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-monitoring.doc/GUID-8D81FCF6-AC9A-4C2C-A8AC-DE50B9965054.html","poster":"MIP","comment_id":"151147"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"agree look at : https://it2grow.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/vSAN-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ-2019.pdf","poster":"jasonv","comment_id":"141882","timestamp":"1595496780.0"},{"poster":"LCOJ","upvote_count":"3","content":"The correct answer is C: VMware recommends that resynchronization throttling only be used if directed by VMware Support.
