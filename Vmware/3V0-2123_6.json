The customer has informed the architect that the workloads hosted on the solution are managed by application teams who must perform a number of steps to return the application to service following a failover of the workloads to the secondary site. These steps are defined as the Work Recovery Time (WRT). The customer has provided the architect with the following information about the workloads, including the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO):\nCritical workloads have a WRT of 12 hours\nProduction workloads have a WRT of 24 hours\nDevelopment workloads have a WRT of 24 hours\nAll workloads have an RPO of 4 hours\nCritical workloads have an RTO of 1 hour\nProduction workloads have an RTO of 12 hours\nDevelopment workloads have an RTO of 24 hours\nThe customer has also confirmed that production and development workloads are managed by the same team and the disaster recovery solution will not begin the recovery of the development workloads until all critical and production workloads have been recovered at the secondary site.\nWhich three statements would the architect document as the maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) for workloads within the design?
