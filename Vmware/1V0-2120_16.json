Right-click VM > Migrate > Change compute resource only > Select Host > Next > Finish\n\nFollowing these steps allows the administrator to initiate the migration wizard, specifically selecting \"Change compute resource only\" to move the virtual machine to a different host within the cluster. During this process, the administrator can view and select the target host's EVC mode, which provides information about the EVC mode compatibility that the VM must adhere to when running on that specific host. This action helps ensure that the VMs meet the EVC requirements for the application during the migration.","comment_id":"1072228","timestamp":"1731739980.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nChecked on vSphere it is answer B","comment_id":"773425","poster":"tocageek","timestamp":"1705062120.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"vinc26730","comment_id":"719066","content":"Correct ANS is B see link bellow","timestamp":"1700077020.0"}],"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (90%)","10%"],"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"An administrator is working on a cloud migration project.
