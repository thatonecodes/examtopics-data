Since we have to use VM templates due to version control and other requirements of the question, then the way to replicate VM templates to subscribers is to use publishing. VMware is a bit confusing on this topic, but here is the documentation that clearly says you have to publish the library to subscribers in order to replicate VM templates: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-6345F652-4D9C-44AF-9D4C-5495CEB9999D.html\n(this is different than creating a subscription for a published local library)\n\nIn addition, if you publish to a new subscriber then the content is automatically replicated.
