While a single capacity tier drive is the minimum requirement for a disk group, for better performance when there are more VMs, and better handling of rebuild/resync activities, we recommend configuring more than 1 capacity tier drive per caching tier SSD per our guidance above.\"","poster":"m_figuer"},{"timestamp":"1701824460.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1088914","poster":"lromerodl157","content":"A & D is correct\n\nDisk Groups\nOne of the more important aspects of the vSAN wizard is the creation of disk groups. Each host must have at least one disk group. By placing physical disks into them, we make each disk group available for vSAN to consume.\n\nDisk Groups will be either Hybrid or All-flash; they cannot be both.\n\nEach group must contain:\n\nExactly one SSD for cache\nAt least one additional disk (SSD or HHD) for persistent storage, with a maximum of seven additional disks total\nWe can create up to five disk groups per host.

The component is a bulletin with additional metadata specifying the name and the version of the component.
