The failed virtual machines will not be restarted until alternative hosts have been found, which ensures that the DR policy in the vSAN storage policy is still in place.","timestamp":"1732079400.0","comment_id":"1075159"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1729327620.0","comment_id":"1047721","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe impact to virtual machines running on a failed host using vSANPolicy1, which has a \"Failures to Tolerate\" setting of 1 failure with RAID-5 (Erasure Coding), will be as follows:\n\nB. Each virtual machine will be unavailable for up to 90 minutes while the automatic recovery process completes.\n\nWith vSANPolicy1 and a \"Failures to Tolerate\" setting of 1 failure, vSAN will start the resynchronization process automatically to rebuild the data from the failed host. During this time, the virtual machines' data will be reconstructed, and the virtual machines themselves may be temporarily unavailable until the recovery process completes. The duration of the recovery process can vary depending on the amount of data that needs to be rebuilt and the overall cluster load, but up to 90 minutes is a reasonable estimate for recovery time.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1328102","content":"keep in mind it a single site. it must be A","poster":"VMwareARCHI","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1734461880.0"}],"poster":"Ansari678"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1729141680.0","comment_id":"1045536","content":"Selected Answer: A\nD is relevant for policy 2.
