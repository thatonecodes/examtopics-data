Performance degradation is based on how long the snapshot or snapshot tree is in place, the depth of the tree, and how much the virtual machine and its guest operating system have changed from the time you took the snapshot. Also, you might see a delay in the amount of time it takes the virtual machine to power on. Do not run production virtual machines from snapshots on a permanent basis.","comment_id":"188245"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"The correct answer is A. Because the question states \"cluster has not experienced contention\" Share values are only used during periods of contention, had the answer said resource limits that would be a good place to start.","timestamp":"1623686460.0","comment_id":"381980","poster":"jn1977"},{"content":"C is the correct answer.\nThe question is a bit misleading. There is no such thing as a high priority on resource pools. Only resource pool CPU and MEM shares settings (high, normal, low), that \"dictate\" the priority with which the resources are assigned.\nSo in the context of the question, \"High priority\" is the resource pool name. That doesn't tell you anything about the actual shares settings of the resource pool.\n\nAlthough, personally I would also go for the snapshots as a first option.","timestamp":"1608130320.0","poster":"T0mino","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"245666"},{"comment_id":"185915","content":"Correct answer should be A.
