I can't see how Answer A would provide a solution to poorly performing App Volumes.\n B. As tempting as this sounds, the provisioning VM used for creating your App Volumes should resemble your Host VDI Master Image as closely as possible : https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-App-Volumes/4/com.vmware.appvolumes.admin.doc/GUID-BCC67C19-AC5C-4D25-9F1B-9BE8536A2909.html\nC. Again, can't see how this will help apart from a token troubleshooting step.\nD. This seems to be the only viable option and indeed what I have found in my own testing is that App Volumes works best when you group applications together into a single App Volume and restrict access to these apps via other technologies (such as FSLogix App Masking, UEM application blocking etc.) VMware even say that they have only tested a maximum of 5 app volumes mounted to any single VDI VM: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/67354","upvote_count":"1","poster":"crumpet","comment_id":"641241","timestamp":"1722598260.0"},{"comments":[{"content":"So wrong. \n\"Provision the AppStacks on a clean base image, that is a virtual machine, that closely resembles the target environment to which you later plan to deploy the AppStack.\n\nFor example, the provisioning virtual machine and the target should be at the same patch and service pack level.
