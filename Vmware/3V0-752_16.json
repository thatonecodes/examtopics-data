Direct Client Connections wouldn't fit the security rules as we'd expect to use DHCP on the Horizon Agents.\n\nA & B."}],"comment_id":"56568","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1677603480.0","content":"Not sure about this, definitely don't like the AC answer. Direct connect brings you directly to a Desktop, bypassing the Connection server so RDSH apps cannot use Direct connect. Another note is all the users are internal on Corporate LAN so I'm thinking CD but am not certain.
