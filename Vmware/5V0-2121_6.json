First, let’s see what will happen if you have 6 hosts within your cluster, you have applied a policy containing FTT=2/RAID-6, and you want to place a host in maintenance mode using the ‘Full data migration’ option. This means all the data residing on the host will be evacuated to another host within the cluster. With this type of data configuration, the system will prompt you to add an additional host to the cluster in order to preserve the policy compliance. The policy will always require there must be two failures that can be tolerated, even during cluster reduction due to maintenance mode removing a host. Note that a minimum of six hosts is required to support a storage policy with RAID-6(FTT=2) erasure coding","timestamp":"1629983880.0"},{"comments":[{"poster":"Lazylinux","comment_id":"521232","timestamp":"1641867840.0","content":"Point also to add is that FTT=2 RAID 6 requires minimum of 6 hosts and hence when you do full data migration vSAN assumes the host is leaving the cluster and as result is violation of the FTT=2 - RAID 6 and vSAN will NOT allow it and error is thrown and therefore the host will never be able to enter maintenance mode using Full data migration but can using Ensure Accessibility","upvote_count":"2"}],"comment_id":"509428","timestamp":"1640496180.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTricky one but have to agree with B, point to note is that the - . When the host enters maintenance mode, all virtual machines have access to their storage components and are still compliant with their assigned storage policies.

You need a minimum of 6 hosts for FTT2 erasure. Anything less and you're non-compliant at best.\n\nAlso, process of elimination:\nA - This contradicts the question. It calls for FULL data migration, not the accessibility option; therefore, this one is dead wrong.\nC - This sounds silly altogether. So data that has FTT2 won't be accessible, but those without redundancy will be? Haha.\nD - More than one component of any VM will never be on the same host (<255GB) because vSAN treats each host as a separate fault domain.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"GodMan114","comment_id":"719217","timestamp":"1668559800.0"}],"isMC":true,"question_text":"An administrator managing a vSAN cluster of six-nodes with policy FTT-2/RAID-6 decided to put one of the nodes in maintenance mode using the `Full-data migration` option.\nWhat will happen after this action is taken?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/60752-exam-5v0-2121-topic-1-question-33-discussion/","answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2021-08-26 15:18:00","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1629983880,"exam_id":262,"question_id":28},{"id":"W8yX3wKMFJhBnGN4WnAT","question_text":"A 4-node vSAN cluster is configured with an erasure coding storage policy.
