Thin-provisioned\n\nTo mitigate datastore capacity issues without expanding the datastore, the administrator should use the vSphere Storage vMotion migration option called \"Thin-provisioned.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThin-provisioned: When using thin-provisioned storage vMotion, the virtual machine's disk is migrated to the destination datastore, but it only consumes the actual used space on the source datastore. It does not reserve the entire provisioned size of the virtual disk on the destination datastore. This migration option helps to conserve storage space on the destination datastore and is suitable for scenarios where the actual data usage is significantly smaller than the provisioned disk size.","poster":"BowlOfRice","comment_id":"968430","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1690829880.0"},{"comment_id":"751395","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBBB - Easy one","timestamp":"1671564660.0","poster":"Blair77","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[],"question_id":96,"exam_id":234,"choices":{"A":"Lazy-zeroed thick-provisioned","C":"Eager-zeroed thick-provisioned","B":"Thin-provisioned","D":"Same as format source"}},{"id":"HuNxLsok9AAaqIWu6uvA","topic":"1","exam_id":234,"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"D":"The VM is restarted on the same host in the cluster.","A":"The VM is restarted on a different host in the cluster.","B":"The VM is suspended on the same host in the cluster.","C":"The VM is migrated to a different host in the cluster."},"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"bassfunk","upvote_count":"1","content":"A would be true if there was a host isolation but this only refers to VMs.","comment_id":"1073054","timestamp":"1700200860.0"},{"poster":"allalone","comment_id":"999692","timestamp":"1693930980.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAs per this article, it will simply restart the VM and doesn't mention about moving the VM to a different host.\n\nhttps://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2014/03/vsphere-ha-vm-monitoring-back-basics.html"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nvSphere High Availability is a utility that pools the ESXi hosts and virtual machines into a cluster for monitoring and automatically restart failed virtual machines on alternative host to reduce application downtime and ensure business continuity.\n\nhttps://www.ubackup.com/enterprise-backup/vsphere-ha-virtual-machine-monitoring-action.html","poster":"leotoronto123","timestamp":"1690398780.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"leotoronto123","comment_id":"964136","timestamp":"1690399020.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"may be D .. i am also confused now : ("}],"comment_id":"964132"},{"content":"It is VM monitoring service.

The reset ensures that services remain available. To avoid resetting virtual machines repeatedly for nontransient errors, by default, virtual machines will be reset only three times during a certain configurable time interval. After virtual machines have been reset three times, vSphere HA makes no further attempts to reset the virtual machines after subsequent failures until after the specified time has elapsed.
