{"pageProps":{"questions":[{"id":"EjmyLOItwjNKU4vPeEMV","question_text":"How do vSAN fault domains relate to vSAN component placement?","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"content":"I agree with D answer: Each host in a vSAN cluster is an implicit fault domain. vSAN automatically distributes components of a vSAN object across fault domains in a cluster based on the Number of Failures to Tolerate rule in the assigned storage policy. To mitigate this risk, place the servers in a vSAN cluster across server racks and configure a fault domain for each rack in the vSAN UI. This instructs vSAN to distribute components across server racks to eliminate the risk of a rack failure taking multiple objects offline. This feature is commonly referred to as \"Rack Awareness\". \nhttps://storagehub.vmware.com/t/vsan-6-7-update-1-technical-overview/fault-domains-31/","timestamp":"1592483820.0","upvote_count":"6","poster":"LCOJ","comment_id":"113164"},{"timestamp":"1640142480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Lazylinux","comment_id":"506630","content":"D for sure"},{"poster":"AllenHuang","comment_id":"333022","content":"D is correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1618122000.0"},{"comment_id":"257749","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1609610700.0","content":"D is right","poster":"diegof1"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","question_images":[],"exam_id":260,"choices":{"B":"vSAN objects only exist in a single vSAN fault domain.","C":"The number of vSAN fault domains determines the number of components of an object.","D":"Storage policies use vSAN fault domains for component placement.","A":"Storage policies are inherited by vSAN fault domains."},"topic":"1","question_id":61,"timestamp":"2020-06-18 14:37:00","unix_timestamp":1592483820,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/23444-exam-5v0-2119-topic-1-question-63-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","isMC":true},{"id":"q8zTpQ7qiVu7zYa06ttY","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":62,"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-06-18 14:39:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/23445-exam-5v0-2119-topic-1-question-64-discussion/","exam_id":260,"question_text":"A storage policy has these rules:\n✑ Site disaster tolerance: None - standard cluster\n✑ Failures To Tolerance: 2 failures - RAID-1 (Mirroring)\nWhat is the minimum number of hosts required to comply with this storage policy?","choices":{"A":"3","C":"5","B":"4","D":"6"},"unix_timestamp":1592483940,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1592483940.0","comment_id":"113165","content":"I agree with answer C: \nFor vSAN objects that will be protected with Mirroring, there must be 2n+1 hosts or Fault Domains for the level of protection chosen.\nProtecting from 1 Failure would require (2x1+1) or 3 hosts\nProtecting from 2 Failures would require (2x2+1) or 5 hosts\nProtecting from 3 Failures would require (2x3+1) or 7 hosts","upvote_count":"7","poster":"LCOJ"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nc is correct 2N+1","poster":"Lazylinux","comment_id":"510908","timestamp":"1640679660.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1640142840.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"506633","content":"C For sure as per 2N+1","poster":"Lazylinux"},{"poster":"AllenHuang","timestamp":"1618122060.0","content":"C is correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"333025"},{"content":"C is right\n\nHost required = 2n+1 where n= FTT=2, then\nHosr required = 2(2)+1= 5","timestamp":"1609610880.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"257752","poster":"diegof1"},{"poster":"alsmk2","content":"Definitely C: \n\nhttps://storagehub.vmware.com/t/vsan-space-efficiency-technologies/host-requirements-1/","comment_id":"162172","timestamp":"1597921080.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"MkzXFX44mVwuoBIp6gOE","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"exam_id":260,"question_id":63,"discussion":[{"poster":"Lazylinux","comment_id":"506636","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1640143080.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nEasy Plessy little Cheesy"},{"comment_id":"257761","poster":"diegof1","timestamp":"1609611540.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"B is right\n\nConsider networking best practices for vSAN to improve performance and throughput:\n• For hybrid configurations, dedicate at least a 1-GbE physical network adapter.
