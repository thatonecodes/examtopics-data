It's misleading because NE has full access on all networking services, not really restrictive. But... if you follow table 21-1 on page 1048 of https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/nsxt_32_admin.pdf, you'll see only the EA (enterprise admin) and NA (network admin) have full access to Edge/Edge Clusters. Keep that in mind if you see both EA and NA as an option on the exam. VMware likes to be tricksy. NA is more restrictive than EA.","comment_id":"760141","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1672247880.0","poster":"studyexam603"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1657744380.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"631058","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD in my opinion is correct because question ask for most restrictive, Network Eng as per all below comments have full access","poster":"Lazylinux","comment_id":"552526","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"559173","timestamp":"1646196060.0","poster":"Lazylinux","content":"My Baaaaad...
