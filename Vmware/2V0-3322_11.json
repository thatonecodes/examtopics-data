Create a support request with VMware Support to create a private cloud: While VMware provides support for Azure VMware Solutions, creating the private cloud itself happens through Azure portal or Azure CLI, not requiring direct involvement from VMware Support.\nE. Deploy and Configure Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute: ExpressRoute allows private connections to Azure, but it's not essential for initial deployment.
