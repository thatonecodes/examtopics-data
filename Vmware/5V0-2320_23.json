Add a CPU limit to the vSphere Namespace for the development team.\n\nTo manage the potential impact of CPU-intensive applications on other teams within a vSphere Namespace, setting a CPU limit specifically for the vSphere Namespace associated with the development team is a reasonable approach. This ensures that the CPU usage of the applications within that Namespace is restricted to a defined limit, preventing them from consuming excessive resources and impacting other workloads in the same environment.\n\nSetting a CPU limit directly on the Namespace provides a level of resource isolation for the development team, allowing them to conduct their tests without adversely affecting other teams sharing the same vSphere infrastructure.","comment_id":"1072320","timestamp":"1731751260.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"KingJ92"},{"timestamp":"1715453820.0","comment_id":"895329","upvote_count":"1","poster":"HenryDCase","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

It's easier to find the wrong answers. Let's see:\n\nB. Change the size of the Supervisor Control Plane nodes. - Supervisor node? Not even the right ballpark, we're talking about the namespace.\nC. Limit the number of load balancers able to be deployed. - What does this have to do with capacity? It would make only a tiny difference. And load balancers are structural, you have to have the ones you need, you don't deploy spare ones for fun.\nE. Limit the number of Operators able to be deployed. - Less people administering the environment will reduce capacity demand?
