You can create a T1 Gateway and NOT connect it to a T0, which case the segments created under T1 are strictly E-W and never have N-S capability. IF you want to enable multi-tier routing for N-S connectivity, then you must attach it to a Tier-0 gateway and that gateway must be deployed. Logically in a setup you already have T0. I personally think the question is worded badly in a way that one can justify T1 or T0 to be correct, but at the end of the day, T0 is the only routing component that handles N-S traffic."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1629900960.0","poster":"RVivek","comment_id":"431538","content":"C is the answer.

Tier-1 we can deploy if we wan't some new features. Multi-tier means multi Gateways. Main task for that is example for multi tenant environments. So if we plan to deploy multi-tier routing then we have to deploy tier-1. Becouse tier-0 is awalys after initial configuration of the NSX-T.
