Remember that vSAN is a cluster based storage solution, and VM data is not necessarily always residing on the host that the VM is residing. While it might seem odd to check look at performance metrics at this level as the second step, it can often help provide an understanding to the level of activity across the cluster. For example, perhaps a VM latency spikes occur during the middle of the night. After identifying the VM level statistics, viewing the cluster level statistics might show a substantial amount of noise coming from other VMs, or perhaps backend resynchronization traffic. To view the vSAN cluster based performance metrics, highlight the cluster, click on Monitor > vSAN > Performance to view the respective VM, backend, or iSCSI performance metrics.\n\nhttps://core.vmware.com/resource/troubleshooting-vsan-performance","timestamp":"1613566260.0","poster":"Dzma","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"diegof1","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1609692960.0","content":"A is right.","comment_id":"258693"}],"unix_timestamp":1609692960,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"DRS invoking multiple vMotion migrations","B":"Low volume of vSAN vital memory pools","A":"Data resynchronizations","D":"Destaging congestion"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/41408-exam-5v0-2119-topic-1-question-34-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2144493","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-01-03 17:56:00","answer":"A","answers_community":[],"question_id":29,"question_text":"The cluster level backend IOPS performance graph shows a higher-than-average number of IOPS.\nWhat is a possible reason for this?","isMC":true},{"id":"xhS93vsG5aq2PY46lu6k","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1591978980.0","comment_id":"108817","poster":"LCOJ","content":"The answer B is right, as of version 6.6 vSAN does not use Multicast anymore.
