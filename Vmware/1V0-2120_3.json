Storage vMotion is a feature in VMware vSphere that allows administrators to move virtual machine disk files (VMDKs) from one storage location to another without any downtime. This is useful in situations where an existing storage array needs to be replaced, and all virtual machines need to be moved to a new storage location. Storage vMotion provides a convenient and efficient way to evacuate virtual machine storage while ensuring that the virtual machines continue to run without interruption."}],"timestamp":"2023-02-11 03:48:00","question_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/98772-exam-1v0-2120-topic-1-question-18-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"iSiiJ4ZQGj0O05D3TG9X","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/84256-exam-1v0-2120-topic-1-question-19-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1664763840,"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"VMFS","D":"vVols","C":"RDM","A":"NFS"},"answer":"D","exam_id":228,"answers_community":["D (63%)","B (37%)"],"timestamp":"2022-10-03 04:24:00","topic":"1","question_text":"Which object-based storage can be used to store virtual machines?","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":12,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1341250","upvote_count":"1","poster":"stevie89","timestamp":"1736973600.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is D. vVols (Virtual Volumes).\n\nExplanation:\nvVols (Virtual Volumes): vVols is an object-based storage solution provided by VMware.
