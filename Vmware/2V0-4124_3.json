Add NSX Manager as a Service Provider (SP) in VMware Identity Manager: In order to integrate NSX with VMware Identity Manager, NSX Manager must be added as a Service Provider (SP) in vIDM. This allows NSX to recognize the identity source managed by vIDM.\n\n C. Enter the Identity Provider (IdP) metadata URL in NSX Manager: NSX Manager needs to be configured with the Identity Provider (IdP) metadata URL from VMware Identity Manager. This URL helps NSX to authenticate and interact with VMware Identity Manager.","comment_id":"1355787"},{"timestamp":"1732907820.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1319883","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/administration/GUID-EAAD1FBE-F750-4A5A-A3BF-92B1E7D016FE.html","poster":"TheNorthernGeek"},{"timestamp":"1732613100.0","poster":"sajiby3k","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1317994","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nCorrect is D, E"}],"timestamp":"2024-11-26 10:25:00","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1732613100,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"DE","question_id":11,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/152044-exam-2v0-4124-topic-1-question-19-discussion/","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":243,"answer":"DE"},{"id":"KTIRTsJ3GmyxjxfkvSm0","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"General_HCCIE","timestamp":"1744117500.0","comment_id":"1558937","content":"Selected Answer: ABE\nABE is the right answer"},{"content":"Selected Answer: ABE\nIn the official guide","timestamp":"1738599240.0","comment_id":"1350993","poster":"amorcle","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"Arslan7","timestamp":"1735572720.0","content":"Selected Answer: ABD\nExplanation\nAccording to the VMware NSX Documentation, these are three of the capabilities of Network Topology, which is a graphical representation of your network infrastructure in NSX:\n* Display how the different NSX components are interconnected: You can use Network Topology to view how your segments, gateways, routers, firewalls, load balancers, VPNs, and other NSX components are connected and configured in your network.\n* Display the uplink configured on the Tier-0 Gateways: You can use Network Topology to view the uplink interface and segment that connect your tier-0 gateways to your physical network.
