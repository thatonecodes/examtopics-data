Should adding physical CPUs (=in RL most times ordering a new Server) be really be the first/next step after a Problem is reported?\n => Missing VM CPU Ressources would manifest on other Hosts too. (And is ignoring the Hint that the Port Groups have Problems)\n => Missing NIC Throughput would be a good Idea, if the Hosts where not identical configured.\n- TiredofTesting's Explanation assumes a distributed vSwitch and NIOC. Maybe it's a DVS (could be interpreted that way) - but if NIOC is the issue the Problem would not be just on one Host.\n- Ganchev's Explanation ignores the Fact for multiple Uplinks and the Standard Loadbalancing (Orginating Virtual Port ID).
