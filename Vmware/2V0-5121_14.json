CPA creates a global data layer. Global Entitlements are automatically synchronized so there is no need to synchronize pools manually. You initialize CPA at one site, then from the other site join the CPA federation. Next create Global Entitlements and add local pools from each site to the Global Entitlement. You do have to be connected to the Connection Server where the local pools exist in order to add to the Global Entitlement.\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2206/horizon-cloud-pod-architecture/GUID-AE1B4398-B275-40C7-AF45-A727E359E5DF.html","poster":"rsesxi"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1000324","poster":"VCIX_Chris","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2206/horizon-cloud-pod-architecture/GUID-AE1B4398-B275-40C7-AF45-A727E359E5DF.html","timestamp":"1693984260.0"},{"poster":"Boss2","content":"I think the answer is B","timestamp":"1684369440.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"900607"},{"comment_id":"882317","timestamp":"1682578920.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2206/horizon-cloud-pod-architecture/GUID-AE1B4398-B275-40C7-AF45-A727E359E5DF.html","poster":"b0gdan433"},{"comment_id":"835251","poster":"KW1234","content":"Should be B","timestamp":"1678468020.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"766076","poster":"NKB","timestamp":"1672865340.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2206/horizon-cloud-pod-architecture/GUID-AE1B4398-B275-40C7-AF45-A727E359E5DF.html","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1668419700.0","poster":"vkv88","comment_id":"717875","content":"correct Answer B https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2206/horizon-cloud-pod-architecture/GUID-AE1B4398-B275-40C7-AF45-A727E359E5DF.html"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/83219-exam-2v0-5121-topic-1-question-69-discussion/","answer":"B","question_id":66,"unix_timestamp":1663868220,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Having configured two standalone Horizon pods, what steps should be taken to join them in a Cloud Pod Architecture (CPA) deployment?","exam_id":245,"timestamp":"2022-09-22 19:37:00"},{"id":"UtaDOfUAqfEUQ73NLn2l","question_text":"An administrator wants to provision a new Golden Image but doesn't see the VM in the list with golden images.\nWhich could be the cause of the issue?
