To remove the cache disk, you must remove the entire disk group.\nClick More options and click REMOVE.\nIn the Remove Disk Group dialog box, select any of the following data migration mode to evacuate the data on the disks.\nFull data migration - Transfers all the data available on the host to other hosts in the cluster.\nEnsure accessibility - Transfers data available on the host to the other hosts in the cluster partially. During the data transfer, all virtual machines on the host remains accessible.\nNo data migration - There is no data transfer from the host. At this time, some objects might become inaccessible.\nClick GO TO PRE-CHECK to find the impact on the cluster if the object is removed or placed in maintenance mode.\nClick REMOVE to remove the disk group.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"742137","poster":"Bruce949"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"ekarjun","timestamp":"1660459620.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nvSAN does not allow you to remove the cache disk.
