Select the VM's Monitor tab, then select Overview.\n\nIn the vSphere Client, navigating to the Monitor tab and choosing Overview allows the administrator to access performance monitoring and graphs for the selected virtual machine. This view provides various performance metrics, including CPU usage, over a defined period. By selecting the desired time range (in this case, the past month), the administrator can display the historical CPU usage of the VM for the specified duration. This information can be shared with the developer to address concerns about the virtual machine's CPU usage over the past month."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"957777","poster":"HenryN_","content":"Answer is C.","timestamp":"1721490480.0"},{"comment_id":"900635","timestamp":"1715993940.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer is C.\nSummary will only show immediate CPU usage whereas Monitor can show upto the last 1 year","poster":"gikifanatic"},{"comment_id":"869545","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe answer is C.

It balances resources such as CPU, memory, and storage I/O across the cluster in real-time, ensuring that no single host becomes overutilized while others remain underutilized.\n\nBy using vSphere DRS, administrators can improve the performance and utilization of their vSphere environment, while also providing a more stable and predictable infrastructure. Additionally, vSphere DRS can help reduce the risk of downtime by automatically migrating virtual machines to other hosts in the event of a host failure.","poster":"dinosan","timestamp":"1723166760.0","comment_id":"802792","upvote_count":"3"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/vmware/view/98509-exam-1v0-2120-topic-1-question-16-discussion/","question_id":9,"isMC":true,"exam_id":228,"question_text":"Which vSphere feature mitigates common optimization challenges?","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1675913160,"question_images":[],"answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"vSphere Trust Authority","B":"vSphere High Availability","C":"vSphere DRS","D":"vSphere Fault Tolerance"},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-09 04:26:00"},{"id":"AOYF7RKDl6LUMrRbMeBi","question_text":"An administrator has configured a Linux virtual machine and found that it does not have network connectivity.
