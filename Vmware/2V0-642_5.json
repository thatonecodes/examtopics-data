In other words, the transport zone will not be able to constrain the logical switch span to a subset of the clusters. If this logical switch is later connected to a DLR, you must ensure that the router instances are created only in the cluster included in the transport zone to avoid any Layer 3 issues.","timestamp":"1580851500.0","poster":"KC","comment_id":"46683"}],"content":"B.
