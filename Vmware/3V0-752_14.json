These options operate independently. You can\nenable none, one, or both.\n• Mount Local – Forces App Volumes to look at the datastore where the VM resides for local copies of\nvolumes (both AppStacks and writable volumes). If AppStacks and writable volumes exist on local\nstorage, they are mounted. Local storage shortens the time to mount. Otherwise, App Volumes checks\nshared storage for these volumes. Using this option in conjunction with local storage allows local\nmounts of AppStacks, which is faster than sending mount commands through VMware vCenter™ to the\nrespective hosts.\n• Mount on Host – Allows App Volumes to issue a mount command directly to the ESXi hosts instead of\nissuing the command through vCenter. App Volumes attaches AppStacks and writable volumes directly\nto the ESXi hosts. This option shortens the command path and time to mount. You can use local storage\nfor this option.\nNote: For these features to work, ESXi hosts must use the same root-level user credentials\nMy choice is B \"Mount on Host\"","upvote_count":"2","poster":"m0t0rh3ad","comment_id":"356175","timestamp":"1715589540.0"},{"timestamp":"1710089520.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"307319","content":"Mount Local has nothing to do with vcenter. it is a storage performance thing.
