A is correct...\nAn NSX virtual switch (N-VDS or VDS with NSX) can attach to a single overlay transport zone and multiple VLAN transport zones at the same time.\nA transport zone can only be attached to a single NSX virtual switch on a given transport node. In other words, two NSX virtual switches on the same transport node cannot be attached to the same transport zone.\nhttps://communities.vmware.com/t5/VMware-NSX-Documents/VMware-NSX-T-Reference-Design/ta-p/2778093?attachment-id=102745"}],"poster":"_MiDa_","timestamp":"1629355680.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"427275","content":"D is correct...when you prepare an ESXi host or create un TN Profile, you can select multiple TZ for a single N-VDS that will be connected to ESXi."},{"poster":"vcpnv2020","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"201752","content":"http://www.vmwarearena.com/how-to-create-nsx-t-transport-zone-vmware-nsx-t-part-7/\n\n\"You can use the same N-VDS to link to multiple transport zones.

I'm not sure which answer is good for 100%. We can create only single N-VDS per TZ. But it doesn't say that we can't use the same N-VDS in couple of TZs. In the table attached to this question we can see that every N-VDS has the same name. So the most probably answer is D."}],"poster":"mapo","content":"A is the good answer. TZ is more general object then N-VDS. So you need to create N-VDS for each TZ you want to have active/usable on the esxi host."},{"poster":"Lance_D","content":"Correct Answer is D:\n\nSee this link - https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/1-5/nsxt-install-create-tns.html \n\nAbout Transport Nodes\n\nIn NSX-T transport nodes are the hosts running the local control plane daemons and forwarding engines implementing the NSX-T data plane. A transport node runs a NSX-T Virtual Distributed Switch (N-VDS) that is responsible for switching packets according to the configuration of available network services.\n\nA host can serve as a transport node if it contains at least one NSX-T-managed virtual distributed switch (N-VDS). When you create a host transport node and then add the node to a transport zone, NSX-T Data Center installs an N-VDS on the host. For each transport zone that the host belongs to, a separate N-VDS is installed. The N-VDS is used for attaching VMs to NSX-T Data Center logical switches and for creating NSX-T Data Center logical router uplinks and downlinks.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"153906","timestamp":"1596999120.0"},{"timestamp":"1595867160.0","comment_id":"145138","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MuhammadHassan","content":"I think the D is correct simply because when join transport node to these Transport Zones TZ, these TZ will create these N-VDS into the Host, now N-VDS can only support only one type of traffic either overlay or VLAN, and Esxi host can not have two N-VDS with the Same name, but one N-VDS on Esxi host can attach to Overlay and VLAN simultaneously. so 1 N-VDS on Esxi will be sufficient. and 2 can not be created as here both TZ traffic type Overlay and VLAN has the same switch name.
