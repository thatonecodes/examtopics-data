To support this, the administrator has suggested the use of vRealize Automation to provide a consistent portal with a multi-cloud service catalog to enable the users to use self-service to deploy workloads into different clouds. The administrator needs to configure cloud accounts for public clouds to support the new strategy.\n\nWhich two of the public clouds are supported platforms?
