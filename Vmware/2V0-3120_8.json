In this way, administrators can apply governance constraints directly at the project level. All constraints added at this level are applied to every cloud template requested for the applicable project, and these constraint tags take precedence over other tags.\n\nIf constraint tags on the project conflict with constraint tags on the cloud template, the project tags take precedence, thus allowing the cloud administrator to enforce governance rules. For example, if the cloud administrators creates a location:london tag on the project, but a developer places a location:boston tag on the cloud template, the former will take precedence and the resource is deployed to infrastructure containing the location:london tag."}],"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1608757560.0","poster":"juannfernandez","content":"C - \"If a conflict occurs between the constraint tag in a project and a constraint tag in a blueprint, the constraint tag in the project takes precedence.\"\nFrom VRA: Install, Configure, Manage STUDENT Lecture Manual","comment_id":"251261"},{"timestamp":"1650831780.0","poster":"safodz","upvote_count":"1","content":"C confirmed in a lab and student boock","comment_id":"591226"},{"comment_id":"458598","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1633594560.0","content":"C : If constraint tags on the project conflict with constraint tags on the cloud template, the project tags take precedence\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Assembly/services/Using-and-Managing/GUID-C8C335F4-9623-401C-825E-6F5B2B3C6507.html","poster":"cdesilva"},{"content":"B - If you have a series of hard and soft constraints on a specific resource type, the soft constraints can also serve as tie breakers.
