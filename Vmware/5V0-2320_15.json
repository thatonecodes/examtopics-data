I believe ExamTopics have an error in the translation of answer \"C\", that should read \"kubectl version\", not \"kubectl get version\"\n\nA. kubectl describe tkc dev-cluster - No, this shows us details about the TKC resource, not Kubernetes. Also, this *does not show the versions of the nodes in the TKC!!!*\nB. kubectl explain tkg dev-cluster - No, \"explain\" is not the correct syntax\nC. kubectl get version - Typo? \"kubectl version\", shows the version of Kubernetes. This seems the most obvious answer from all choices, which are all wrong.\nD. kubectl get vm dev-cluster - No, this is not the correct syntax, Kubernetes is not about VMs (heck, you can have your nodes on bare metal if you really want). \n\nIf you sit the exam, watch this question, I'd bet cash money \"kubectl version\" is one of the answers.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"obeythefist","comment_id":"849942","timestamp":"1711357440.0"},{"comment_id":"774913","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"849945","poster":"obeythefist","timestamp":"1711357560.0","content":"I believe this is a typo from ExamTopics.
