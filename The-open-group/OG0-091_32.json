Concerns may pertain to any aspect of the system's functioning, development, or operation, including considerations such as performance, reliability, security, distribution, and evolvability and may determine the acceptability of the system.\n\n- An \"architecture view\" is a representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. It consists of one or more architecture models of the system.\n\n- \"Stakeholders\" are individuals, teams, organizations, or classes thereof, having an interest in a system.","timestamp":"1728638160.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"691944","poster":"rockyslav"}],"choices":{"C":"Requirements","E":"Views","A":"Viewpoints","B":"Concerns","D":"Principles"},"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1665479760,"timestamp":"2022-10-11 11:16:00","question_text":"Which of the following terms is defined as the key interests that are crucially important to the stakeholders in a system?","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"VTpguK27QxPLCA0Mk1fw","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-10-11 11:24:00","unix_timestamp":1665480240,"exam_id":434,"question_text":"What ADM phase includes establishing the Architecture Capability and definition of Architecture Principles?","question_images":[],"answer":"B","question_id":157,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Phase A: Architecture Vision","D":"Phase F: Migration Planning","E":"Phase B: Business Architecture","B":"Preliminary Phase","A":"Phase C: Data Architecture"},"discussion":[{"content":"5.1 The objectives of the Preliminary Phase are to:\n\n1) Determine the \"Architecture Capability\" desired by the organization:\n- Review the organizational context for conducting Enterprise Architecture\n- Identify and scope the elements of the enterprise organizations affected by the Architecture Capability\n- Identify the established frameworks, methods, and processes that intersect with the Architecture Capability\n- Establish Capability Maturity target\n2) Establish the Architecture Capability:\n- Define and establish the \"Organizational Model for Enterprise Architecture\"\n- Define and establish the detailed process and resources for Architecture Governance\n- Select and implement \"tools\" that support the Architecture Capability\n- Define the \"Architecture Principles\".","comment_id":"691949","timestamp":"1728638640.0","poster":"rockyslav","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/85131-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-245-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"UmHPSC5xG8GWnTAqvNZ6","answer_ET":"E","timestamp":"2022-10-11 12:03:00","unix_timestamp":1665482580,"answer_description":"","exam_id":434,"isMC":true,"question_id":158,"answer":"E","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/85132-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-246-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728640980.0","poster":"rockyslav","comment_id":"691976","content":"The objectives of Phase A are to:\n\n1) Develop a high-level aspirational vision of the capabilities and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed Enterprise Architecture.\n2) Obtain approval for a Statement of Architecture Work that defines a program of works to develop and deploy the architecture outlined in the Architecture Vision.\n\n33.3.2 Building Block Specification Process in the ADM\nThe process of building block definition takes place gradually as the ADM is followed, mainly in Phases A, B, C, and D.
