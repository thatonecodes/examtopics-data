It helps identify areas where improvements or changes are needed. In the context of building blocks, a gap analysis allows architects to identify building blocks that have been inadvertently omitted, building blocks that have been intentionally eliminated, building blocks to be carried over from the current architecture, and new building blocks that are needed to achieve the desired target state. However, identifying potential vendors to provide new building blocks is typically not part of a gap analysis. That task would involve market research and vendor evaluation processes rather than the analysis of existing gaps in the architecture.","timestamp":"1701825300.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"rockyslav","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1681067160.0","content":"https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap23.html\n\nThe technique known as gap analysis is widely used in the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) to validate an architecture that is being developed. The basic premise is to highlight a shortfall between the Baseline Architecture and the Target Architecture; that is, items that have been deliberately omitted, accidentally left out, or not yet defined.\n\nA key step in validating an architecture is to consider what may have been forgotten. Usually performed in Phases B, C, D in Step #4 as a matrix where the building blocks marked as new, are to be eliminated or carried over.","comment_id":"690486"}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-10-09 21:06:00","choices":{"E":"identify potential vendors to provide new building blocks","C":"identify building blocks to be carried over","A":"identify building blocks that have been inadvertently omitted","D":"identify new building blocks that are needed","B":"identify building blocks that have been intentionally eliminated"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/84927-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-118-discussion/","answer":"E","answers_community":["E (100%)"],"question_id":22,"question_text":"Complete the sentence.
