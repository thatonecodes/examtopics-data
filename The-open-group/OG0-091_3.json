This content-agnostic approach ensures that the framework is flexible. The processes are typically independent of the content and implement a proven best practice approach to active governance.\n\nThe Architecture Governance Framework is integral to the Enterprise Continuum, and manages all content relevant both to the architecture itself and to Architecture Governance processes.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"689666","poster":"rockyslav"},{"content":"The split of process, content, and context are key to the support of the Architecture Governance initiative, by allowing the introduction of new governance material (legal, regulatory, standards-based, or legislative) without unduly impacting the processes.
