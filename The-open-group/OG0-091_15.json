This should be done by creating a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix, as shown in Part III, 24.2 Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, & Dependencies Matrix , which will enable the identification of Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) that could potentially address one or more gaps and their associated ABBs.\n\nReview the Phase B, C, and D gap analysis results and consolidate them in a single list. The gaps should be consolidated along with potential solutions to the gaps and dependencies. A recommended technique for determining the dependencies is to use sets of views such as the Business Interaction matrix, the Data Entity/Business Function matrix, and the Application/Function matrix to completely relate elements from different architectural domains.","timestamp":"1712743020.0"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer":"C","question_text":"In which part of the ADM cycle do building block gaps become associated with work packages that will address the gaps?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/84984-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-162-discussion/","exam_id":434,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","question_id":71,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1665395820,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-10-10 11:57:00"},{"id":"aBBTuOBO7jGh0m9N94IM","choices":{"C":"Achieving consistency compliance review","A":"Allocating resources for architecture projects","E":"Conducting assessments of the maturity level of architecture discipline within the organization","D":"Determining the scope of an architecture compliance review","B":"Creating the Statement of Architecture Work"},"exam_id":434,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"692793","timestamp":"1728716340.0","poster":"guruaws2021","content":"So answer should be A"}],"timestamp":"1728554520.0","comment_id":"690980","poster":"rockyslav","content":"41.2 The Architecture Board is typically made responsible, and accountable, for achieving some or all of the following goals:\n- Providing the basis for all \"decision-making with regard to the architectures\".\n- Consistency between sub-architectures.\n- \"Establishing targets for re-use of components\".\n- Flexibility of the Enterprise Architecture.\n- Enforcement of Architecture Compliance.\n- Improving the maturity level of architecture discipline within the organization.\n- Ensuring that the discipline of architecture-based development is adopted.\n- Supporting a visible escalation capability for out-of-bounds decisions.\n- All aspects of monitoring and control of the Architecture Contract.\n- Ensuring compliance with the architectures.","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1665396120,"timestamp":"2022-10-10 12:02:00","question_id":72,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/84985-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-163-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following is a responsibility of an Architecture Board?","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"answer":"C"},{"id":"FVtxTYu0bEoby6jGxh7j","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1650026160,"question_text":"According to TOGAF, Which of the following is the reason why Business Architecture is recommended to be first architecture developed?","exam_id":434,"choices":{"A":"It contains a high level description of the business strategy for the organization","D":"It mobilizes operations to support the ongoing business architecture development","C":"It provides prerequisite knowledge for undertaking work in the other architecture domains","B":"It is the key document describing how the new architecture capability will meet the business goals"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/73721-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-164-discussion/","question_id":73,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728995820.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"586348","poster":"ts3497j","content":"Selected Answer: C\n7.5.1 General\nA knowledge of the Business Architecture is a prerequisite for architecture work in any other domain (Data, Application, Technology), and is therefore the first architecture activity that needs to be undertaken, if not catered for already in other organizational processes (enterprise planning, strategic business planning, business process re-engineering, etc.)."},{"comment_id":"586346","timestamp":"1728995760.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ts3497j","content":"7.5.1 General\nA knowledge of the Business Architecture is a prerequisite for architecture work in any other domain (Data, Application, Technology), and is therefore the first architecture activity that needs to be undertaken, if not catered for already in other organizational processes (enterprise planning, strategic business planning, business process re-engineering, etc.)."}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2022-04-15 14:36:00","answer":"C"},{"id":"AaVRvWfWtkZ7fwAhpEOk","timestamp":"2022-04-15 14:41:00","exam_id":434,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1650026460,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"928215","timestamp":"1718866620.0","poster":"MackD","content":"Anser C, \"It is an Application Architecture Reference Model\". \nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/reference-models/iiirm.html\n\nThe resulting III-RM itself is depicted in Figure 4.

Among the options provided, the best description of the III-RM is:\n\nD. It provides a conceptual structure for architecture governance.\n\nThe III-RM helps in organizing and structuring the components and relationships of an organization's IT infrastructure. It defines the key architectural components, such as data, applications, technology, and their interconnections. This conceptual structure serves as a foundation for implementing effective architecture governance, ensuring that the IT infrastructure aligns with the organization's goals and objectives and adheres to architectural standards and policies.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model is:\n\nD.
