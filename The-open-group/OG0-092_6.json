An Enterprise Architecture practice already exists in Eight Twelve. Now the CEO and CIO decide that they want to use TOGAF9 to re-architect their Enterprise Architecture to cater to the changing strategies of Eight Twelve to better respond to the changes in the economic and technology environments.\nSome of the key issues which need to be addressed in this re-architecting work are:\n1. Since Eight Twelve's retail chain operate 24 hours a day and are expanding to South America and Europe, the retail chain business ecosystem should be able to withstand any unforeseen disruptions which might affect the chain's day to day operations. This is highly critical to ensure high levels of customer satisfaction and thus maintaining and enhancing Eight Twelve's revenue chain.\n2. Dependency between the application components, which are the nerve centers to Eight Twelve's sophisticated range of services both external and internal, and the application platform and technology infrastructure should be minimal. This would facilitate scalability and ease of enhancement of the service offerings.\n3. Eight Twelve uses the ARTS Data Model and the quality of data is of utmost importance for its operation.\n4. Users of the Enterprise Information ecosystem should have an environment which is able to cater to their needs without any undue delays.\nWhich one of the following set of Architecture Principles do you feel is the most appropriate for these guidelines stated above for the TOGAF 9 architecting work which Eight Twelve is embarking on?","answer_description":"","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"a) Maximize Benefit to the Enterprise b) Data Trustee c) Service Orientation d) Responsive Change Management","B":"a) Business Continuity b) Data is an Asset c) Data is Shared d) Requirements Based Change","C":"a) Maximize Benefit to the Enterprise b) Data is an Asset c) Data is Shared d) Requirements Based Change","D":"a) Business Continuity b) Data Trustee c) Technology Independence d) Responsive Change Management"},"exam_id":435,"answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1643107020,"answers_community":["D (75%)","B (25%)"],"answer":"D","discussion":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1719571740.0","content":"I meant \"Finally D address all 1,2,3,4 key issues mentioned\"","poster":"Afz","comment_id":"936508","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719571680.0","comment_id":"936506","content":"Selected Answer: D\nEliminate A & C since it does not have Business Continuity.\nB does not address the requirement that \"Dependency between the application components should be minimal\"\nFinally it address all 1,2,3,4 key issues mentioned:","poster":"Afz"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\na) Business Continuity => 24 hours a day\nb) Data Trustee => quality of data through a clear responsible\nc) Technology Independence => Dependency between the application components and the application platform and technology infrastructure should be minimal\nd) Responsive Change Management => environment which is able to cater to their needs without any undue delays","poster":"fabtri","timestamp":"1717760520.0","comment_id":"917176","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Reivals","timestamp":"1717004820.0","comment_id":"909599","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\na) Business Continuity: This principle aligns with the first issue stated, which is the need for the retail chain business ecosystem to withstand any unforeseen disruptions.
