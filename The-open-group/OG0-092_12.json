Florian also wants to define new business models that are profitable while reducing their impact on the environment. Florian management is deeply committed to ensuring that the company is a world leader in socially responsible seed development with a business strategy that focuses on profitability through environmentally friendly operating processes.\nFlorians international operations are subject to various legal and regulatory requirements. In areas such as genetically modified seeds, governmental controls are strictly enforced and compliance is critical. Recently a competitor was heavily fined for violating the regulations in a country where it was developing pest-resistant seeds.\nThe Governing Board is concerned, and as a result has approved the expenditure of resources to establish an Enterprise Architecture program. They have requested to be informed about the status of projects that could impact regulatory compliance. They also want to enable the corporate legal staff and auditors to analyze proposed architectures to ensure that they are within the legal guidelines for a given location. In addition, the research organization should be able to see that the architecture is appropriate for its needs.\nTOGAF 9 has been mandated as the guiding framework for the development and evolution of the Enterprise Architecture practice.\nFlorian management has engaged you as the Lead Consultant to assess the current situation.\nYou have been asked to recommend an approach that would enable the development of an architecture that addresses the needs of all these parties.\nBased on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/26068-exam-og0-092-topic-1-question-6-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","question_id":56,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"D is answer.\nKeypoint : Need of ALL parties.

This approach is common where organizational units have had a high degree of autonomy.\n\nTarget First: in this style, the target solution is elaborated in detail and then mapped back to the baseline, in order to identify change activity\nThis process is suitable when a target state is agreed at a high level and where the enterprise wishes to effectively transition to the target model.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"mericov"},{"timestamp":"1656407100.0","content":"Answer is C!","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"392755","poster":"mrg998"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/33863-exam-og0-092-topic-1-question-62-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"A":"You propose that this engagement define the baseline architecture first in order to assess the current infrastructure capacity and capability. The initial priority is to understand the problem. Then the focus should be on transition planning and architecture deployment. This will identify requirements to ensure that the projects are sequenced in an optimal fashion so as to realize the vision.","C":"You propose that the target architecture is defined first, followed by transition planning. This is because the vision is well understood and the strategic architecture agreed. The target first approach will ensure that the current problems and inefficiencies of the baseline architecture are not carried forward, and that the proposed solution addresses the requirements identified in the initial study.","D":"You propose that the team focus on architecture definition, with a specific emphasis on understanding the strategic change parameters of the business strategy. Once understood, the team will be in the best position to identify the requirements, drivers, issues, and constraints for this engagement. You would ensure that the target architecture addresses non-functional requirements so as to ensure the target architecture is robust and secure.","B":"You propose that the team focus on defining the target architecture by going through the architecture definition phases (B-D).

The stores operate\n24 hours a day and 7 days a week and use the latest cloud-based point-of-sale (POS) technology to manage their sales and inventory. Cloud-based POS systems store all user data, including sales and inventory in a remote server.\nThe cloud-based systems collect real-time data to support ordering and product selection decisions including the tailoring of product assortment based on sales history, customer demographics as well as the next day's weather forecast. In many cases, several stores are located in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible. The stores also act as self-service delivery locations for a large online retailer which further increases the number of potential customers entering the stores.\nAn Enterprise Architecture practice exists within the company, with the CEO and CIO as joint sponsors. They have decided to adopt TOGAF 9 within the practice and the first project is to restructure the Enterprise Architecture so that it can better support the existing environment and accommodate future changes of strategy within the company.\nThe CIO has stated that the following issues also need to be addressed in the restructuring:\n- They need to address problems with data quality and inconsistent data in order to support better decision making and analysis.\n- The architecture should focus on the needs of the business, not technology.\n- To remain competitive, new products and promotions must undergo market trials before deployment across the retail chain. Information systems must be able to manage changes and updates without undue delays.\n[Note: You should assume that the company has adopted the example set of principles that are listed and defined in TOGAF, Section 23.6. You may need to refer to Chapter 23 of the reference text in order to answer this question.]\nYou have been asked to identify the most relevant architecture principles for the current situation.\nBased on TOGAF, which of the following is the best answer?
