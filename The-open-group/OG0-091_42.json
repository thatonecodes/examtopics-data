Most focus on structure and organization. Two definitions are given below: \nEnterprise Architecture is: \n1. The organizing logic for business processes and IT infrastructure reflecting the integration and standardization requirements of the firm’s operating model. \n [Source: MIT Center for Information Systems Research] \n2.
