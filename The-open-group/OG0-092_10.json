The production of prescription pharmaceutical products has governmental controls that are strictly enforced and compliance is critical. Recently a competitor was heavily fined for violating the regulations in a country where it was conducting a clinical trial for a new regulated drug.\nThe Governing Board is concerned about the risks posed in this complex global environment. As a result the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer (CCO) to be responsible for overseeing and managing compliance issues for the corporation. The CCO reports directly to the CEO.\nThe CCO has approved the expenditure of resources to establish an Enterprise Architecture program. He has requested to be informed about the status of projects that could impact regulatory compliance. He also wants the corporate legal staff and auditors to analyze all proposed architectures to ensure that they are within the legal guidelines for each country. In addition, the research organization should be able to see that the architecture is appropriate for its needs.\nTOGAF 9 has been mandated as the framework for the development and evolution of the Enterprise Architecture practice.

The solar panels and photovoltaic arrays are custom engineered to meet each manufacturer's design specifications.\nA challenge that the solar power industry has faced is the efficiency of energy conversion. When a conventional solar panel overheats, it becomes inefficient and generates less energy. In response to this, the research arm of the company has pioneered the development of a new solar panel design that will produce up to\n50% more energy than standard solar panels when operating at elevated temperatures. This will allow the production of significantly more useable energy per square meter than from standard solar technology.
