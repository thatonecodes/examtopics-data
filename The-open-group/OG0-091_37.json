Strategic Architectures (see Part I, 3.74 Strategic Architecture) show a long-term summary view of the entire enterprise. Strategic Architectures provide an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allow for direction setting at an executive level.\n2. Segment Architectures (see Part I, 3.64 Segment Architecture) provide more detailed operating models for areas within an enterprise. Segment Architectures can be used at the program or portfolio level to organize and operationally align more detailed change activity.\n3. Capability Architectures (see Part I, 3.31 Capability Architecture) show in a more detailed fashion how the enterprise can support a particular unit of capability. Capability Architectures are used to provide an overview of current capability, target capability, and capability increments and allow for individual work packages and projects to be grouped within managed portfolios and programs."}],"exam_id":434,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf91-doc/arch/chap41.html"},{"id":"w79znPcJQKPPcSEIksy2","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"416420","content":"6.4.3 Readiness Factor Risks & Actions\nOnce the factors have been rated and assessed, derive a series of actions that will enable the factors to change to a favorable state.\n\nEach factor should be assessed with respect to risk using the process highlighted in Part III, 27.
