Armstrong Defense is moving aggressively to consolidate and reduce redundant procurement processes and systems. The CEO has announced that the company will seek to leverage higher volume discounts and lower related IT support costs by instituting a preferred supplier program.\nTo achieve this goal, Armstrong Defense needs to define Baseline and Target Architectures. These architectures must address key stakeholders concerns such as:\n1. What groups of people should be involved in procurement-related business processes?\n2. What current applications do those groups use?\n3. Which procurement-related business processes are supported by zero, one, or many existing applications?\n4. What are the overall lifetimes of the Request for Proposal and Purchase Order business objects?\n5. What non-procurement applications will need to be integrated with any new procurement applications?\n6. What data will need to be shared?\nAt present, there are no particularly useful architectural assets related to this initiative. All assets need to be acquired and customized or created from scratch. The company prefers to implement existing package applications from systems vendors with little customization.\nThe architecture development project has just completed its Architecture Context iteration cycle and is about to begin the Architecture Definition iteration cycle.\nArmstrong Defense is using TOGAF for its internal Enterprise Architecture activities. It uses an iterative approach for executing Architecture Development Method\n(ADM) projects.\nYou are serving as the Lead Architect.\nYou have been asked to identify the most appropriate architecture viewpoints for this situation.\nBased on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1627358400,"question_id":66,"discussion":[{"poster":"LunchTime","content":"CONTINUED FROM ABOVE:\nA: Incorrect: No such thing as a “business process catalog”.

These provide real-time, highly secure communication of voice, video, and message data to remove locations around the world. The agency has recently received information from intelligence sources that the current encryption protocols may no longer be secure. In response, a program is underway to upgrade the systems.\nThe agency has an established Enterprise Architecture (EA) capability based on the TOGAF standard. The Executive Director of the agency is the sponsor of the\nEA capability.\nSince reliable, high-preformcane, and secure communications are essential to be preserving national security, the Executive Director has placed stringent requirements for the architecture of the upgraded systems. It must be able to provide assurance of the upgraded systems. It must be able to provide assurance and verification of specific performance measures on the key services that are most crucial for system operation. Focusing on these service-level details and specific measurements will allow stricter requirements to be enforced in service contracts. It will also provide a high degree of assurance that necessary performance is being delivered and that notifications will occur if any critical service fails to perform as required.\nA portion of the program budget has been allocated to conduct a review of the EA. The scope of the review is to evaluate the processes, content, and governance of the EA capability to ensure that the higher target performance and service levels required by the upgraded system can be achieved.\nThe Chief Architect has noted that the core EA artifacts that have been in use are not able to describe these new capabilities. The artifacts do not have explicit provisions for defining the in-depth measurement requirements regarding specific services required for the system. She has learned that certain services within the current system have service measurement implemenations that match some of the new requirements, but they are only used in a few areas.\nRecent EA efforts at another national agency have produced generalized high-performance communication system models to realize similar requirements in a critical defense system involving secure communications.

It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aviation products worldwide and manufactures in multiple countries both inside and outside of the European Union. The company has grown rapidly by acquisition and has inherited numerous different procurement processes and related IT systems.\nRecently, several procurement processes, within the civil aviation business, have had problems related to the timing of purchases, which has led to excess inventory. The Vice President in change of Supply Chain Management has made the decision to consolidate and reduce redundant procurement processes and systems. He has committed to the CEO that the business will move to a \"Just-in-time\" procurement system so as to keep inventory costs low.\nThe TOGAF standard is used for internal Enterprise Architecture activities. At presents, there are no architectural assets in the Architecture Repository related to this initiative. All assets will need to be acquired, customized, or created from scratch. The company prefers to implement commercial off the shelf package applications with little customization. The CIO, who is the project sponsor, has stated that she is not concerned about preserving the existing procurement processes or systems.\nThis project is using an iterative approach for executing the Architecture Development Method (ADM). The architecture development project has completed the\nArchitecure Vision Phase and has started a number of iteration cycles to develop the Architecture. As a packeged application is being considered, the next iteration will include both the Business and Application Architectures.\nStakeholder concerns that should be addressed by these architectures include:\n1. What groups of people should be involved in procurement-related business processes?\n2. What applications will these groups use once the architecture development is complete?\n3. What non-procurement applications will need to be integrated with the new procurement applications?\n4. What are the dependencies between the non-procurement and the new procurement applications?\n[Note: You may need to refer to the Architectural Artifacts chapter, section 31.6 (located in Part IV) within the reference text in order to answer this question.]\nYou have been asked to identify the most appropriate catalogs, matrices, and diagrams to support the next iteration of Architecture development.\nBased on the TOGAF Standard, Version 9.2, which of the following is the best answer?","exam_id":435,"unix_timestamp":1601032620,"answer":"C"}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"OG0-092","id":435,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":74,"isBeta":false,"provider":"The-open-group"},"currentPage":14},"__N_SSP":true}
