The architecture must support all of the essential information processing needs of the organization. The most critical source of gaps that should be considered is stakeholder concerns that have not been addressed in prior architectural work.\n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf91-doc/arch/chap27.html"},{"content":"Correct Answer \n\nThe technique known as gap analysis is widely used in the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) to validate an architecture that is being developed. The basic premise is to highlight a shortfall between the Baseline Architecture and the Target Architecture; that is, items that have been deliberately omitted, accidentally left out, or not yet defined.","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster","timestamp":"1713018060.0","comment_id":"585250","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_id":6},{"id":"BwVHOn4UhT6GChBjd61J","unix_timestamp":1649859780,"answer":"C","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731222060.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"714990","poster":"noureldin","content":"Selected Answer: C\n39.1 Overview\nThe Enterprise Continuum provides methods for classifying architecture and solution artifacts, both internal and external to the Architecture Repository, as they evolve from generic Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures.\n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf91-doc/arch/chap39.html"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
