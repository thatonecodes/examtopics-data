At each level, the Solutions Continuum is a population of the architecture with reference building blocks - either purchased products or built components - that represent a solution to the enterprise's business need expressed at that level. A populated repository based on the Solutions Continuum can be regarded as a solutions inventory or re-use library, which can add significant value to the task of managing and implementing improvements to the enterprise.","timestamp":"1719293340.0"},{"timestamp":"1699005300.0","comment_id":"710400","poster":"noureldin","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIntroduction\nThe Solutions Continuum represents the implementations of the architectures at the corresponding levels of the Architecture Continuum\n\nhttp://www.opengroup.org/public/arch/p3/ec/ec_sc.htm","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"589389","timestamp":"1682081640.0","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster","upvote_count":"2","content":"Correct Answer \n\n\nThe Solutions Continuum (see 35.4.2 Solutions Continuum) provides a consistent way to describe and understand the implementation of the assets defined in the Architecture Continuum"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"RVR","content":"Reference: \" Solutions Continuum represents the implementations of the architectures at the corresponding levels of the Architecture Continuum\"\nLink: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap18.html","comment_id":"254104","timestamp":"1640701920.0"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/40909-exam-og0-093-topic-1-question-64-discussion/","question_text":"Complete the sentence.
