An \"architecture view\" is a representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. It consists of one or more architecture models of the system.\n\n2. \"Concerns\" are interests in a system relevant to one or more of its stakeholders. Concerns may pertain to any aspect of the system's functioning, development, or operation, including considerations such as performance, reliability, security, distribution, and evolvability and may determine the acceptability of the system.\n\n3.
