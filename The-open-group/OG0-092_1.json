However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.\nAs a result, AGEX has begun implementing a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The Corporate Board is concerned that the new ERP system must be able to manage and safeguard customer information in a manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services offered to clients and trading partners.\nThe CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the ERP implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Review Board to oversee and govern the architecture.\nAfter reviewing the available alternatives, and based on recommendations from the ERP vendor, AGEX has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise\nArchitecture program.\nThe CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.\nYou are serving as the Chief Architect.\nAs part of the process for establishing the Enterprise Architecture department, you have decided to create a set of principles to guide the activities.\nYou have been asked to recommend the best approach for this work.\nBased on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":74,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"provider":"The-open-group","isImplemented":true,"name":"OG0-092","id":435,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":1},"__N_SSP":true}
