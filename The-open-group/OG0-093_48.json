The stores operate 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and use cloud-based point-of-sale\n(POS) technology to manage their sales and inventory. Cloud-based POS systems store all user data, including sales and inventory in a remote server.\nThe cloud-based systems collect real-time data to support ordering and product selection decisions including the tailoring of product assortment based on sales history, customer demographics as well as the next day's weather forecast. In many cases, several stores are located in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible. The stores also act as self-service delivery locations for a large online retailer which further increases the number of potential customers entering the stores.\nAn Enterprise Architecture practice exists within the company, with the CEO and CIO as joint sponsors. They have decided to adopt TOGAF standard within the practice and the first project is to restructure the Enterprise Architecture so that it can better support the existing environment and accommodate future changes of strategy within the company.\nThe CIO has stated that the following issues need to be addressed in the restructuring:\n✑ They need to address problems with data quality and inconsistent data in order to support better decision making and analysis.\n✑ The architecture should focus on the needs of the business, not technology\n✑ To remain competitive, new products and promotions must undergo market trials and if these are successful, deployed across the retail chain.
