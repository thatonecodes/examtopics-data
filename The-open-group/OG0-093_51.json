The way in which assets and capabilities are assembled into building blocks will vary widely between individual architectures. Every organization must decide for itself what arrangement of building blocks works best for it. A good choice of building blocks can lead to improvements in legacy system integration, interoperability, and flexibility in the creation of new systems and applications.","timestamp":"1681994520.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"588667","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster"},{"comment_id":"252604","timestamp":"1640521440.0","poster":"RVR","content":"Reference: \"A building block's boundary and specification should be loosely coupled to its implementation\"\nLink: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/m/chap33.html","upvote_count":"3"}],"unix_timestamp":1608985440}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":364,"name":"OG0-093","id":436,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"The-open-group","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":51},"__N_SSP":true}
