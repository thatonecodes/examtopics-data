It is important to identify, classify, and mitigate these risks before starting so that they can be tracked throughout the transformation effort.\n\nMitigation is an ongoing effort and often the risk triggers may be outside the scope of the transformation planners (e.g., merger, acquisition) so planners must monitor the transformation context constantly.\n\nIt is also important to note that the Enterprise Architect may identify the risks and mitigate certain ones, but it is within the governance framework that risks have to be first accepted and then managed.\n\nThere are two levels of risk that should be considered, namely:\n\n1.
