The company now consists of three divisions with the same names and division headquarters as their predecessors.\nThe lack of integration between the three divisions has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information has resulted in lost opportunities to leverage the synergies that should have been possible as a result of the merger. At present, each division maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, and claims information, each division has different ways of defining these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.\nAs a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a common web portal, contact center software suite, and document management system. Also the company has selected a single enterprise-wide customer relationship management (CRM) application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the divisions. The application will be used by each of the divisions and accessed by third party partners through well defined interfaces.\nThe Corporate Board is concerned that the new application must be able to manage and safeguard confidential customer information in a secure manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services in cooperation with its partners.\nThe CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the implementation team and the migration teams in each division.

They have manufacturing operations in several cities in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\nThe firm has traditionally allowed each manufacturing plant to drive its own production planning systems. Each plant has its own custom Materials Requirements\nPlanning, Master Production Scheduling, Bill of Materials, and Shop Floor Control systems.\n\"Just In Time\" manufacturing techniques are used to minimize wastes caused by excessive inventory and work in process. The increasingly competitive business environment has compelled the firm to improve its business capability to be more responsive to the needs of industrial customers. To support this capability, the firm has decided to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will enable it to better coordinate its manufacturing capacity to match the demands for its products across all plants. In addition, there are also new European regulations coming into force to which their manufacturing processes must conform in the next six months.\nAs part of the implementation process, the Enterprise Architecture (EA) department has begun to implement an architecture process based on TOGAF 9. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity. The Chief Architect has directed that the program should include formal modeling using the Architecture Content Framework and the\nTOGAF Content Metamodel. This will enable support for the architecture tooling that the firm uses for its EA program.\nThe Chief Architect has stated that in order to model the complex manufacturing process it will be necessary to model processes that are event-driven. Also, in order to consolidate applications across several data centers it will be necessary to model the location of IT assets. In particular, the end goal is to have the single\nERP application running in a single data center.\nCurrently the project is in the Preliminary Phase, and the architects are tailoring the Architecture Development Method (ADM) and Architecture Content\nFramework to fit into the corporate environment.\n\nRefer to the Scenario -\nYou have been asked to recommend a response to the Chief Architect's request to tailor the TOGAF Content Metamodel.\nBased on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?","question_id":137,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"OCHT","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhile B, C, and D also propose the use of certain extensions, they do not fully address the requirements as outlined by the Chief Architect.

During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.\nThe Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9.\nAt a recent meeting, the Architecture Board approved a Request for Architecture Work sponsored by the Chief Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations.
