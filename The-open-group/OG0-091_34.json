In these circumstances, it is necessary for implementation projects to either deviate from the suggested architectural approach or to request scope extensions. Additionally, external factors - such as market factors, changes in business strategy, and new technology opportunities - may open up opportunities to extend and refine the architecture.\n\nIn these circumstances, a Change Request \"may be submitted in order to kick-start a further cycle of architecture work.\"","timestamp":"1728642660.0","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"JFS3mjsvNPHhZoFPJ6KI","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"building block","E":"catalog","B":"matrix","D":"diagram","A":"deliverable"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/148828-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-255-discussion/","topic":"1","exam_id":434,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Complete the sentence.

Due to the sheer volume and the diverse stakeholder needs throughout an entire enterprise, the Architecture Landscape is divided into three levels of granularity:\n\n1. *Strategic Architectures* show a long-term summary view of the entire enterprise. Strategic Architectures provide an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allow for direction setting at an executive level.\n2. *Segment Architectures* provide more detailed operating models for areas within an enterprise. Segment Architectures can be used at the program or portfolio level to organize and operationally align more detailed change activity.\n3. *Capability Architectures* show in a more detailed fashion how the enterprise can support a particular unit of capability. Capability Architectures are used to provide an overview of current capability, target capability, and capability increments and allow for individual work packages and projects to be grouped within managed portfolios and programs.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728649860.0","comment_id":"692101"}],"question_text":"What are the levels of the Architecture Landscape?","isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"WvORiBn9KZH5ILVUo03h","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728650100.0","content":"15.3.7 Activate the Process to Implement Change\nActivate the architecture process to implement change:\n■ Produce a new Request for Architecture Work and request for investment\n■ Ensure any changes implemented in this phase are captured and documented in the\nArchitecture Repository\n\n15.4 Outputs\nThe outputs of Phase H may include, but are not restricted to:\n■ Architecture updates (for maintenance changes)\n■ Changes to architecture framework and principles (for maintenance changes).\n\nIn Phase H it is critical that the governance body establish criteria to judge whether a Change Request warrants *just an architecture update* or whether it *warrants starting a new cycle of the Architecture Development Method* (ADM).","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rockyslav","comment_id":"692103"}],"question_text":"In which ADM phase does the value and change management process determine the circumstances under which the Architecture Development Cycle will be initiated to develop a new architecture?","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_id":170,"exam_id":434,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Phase H","B":"Phase F","E":"Phase G","D":"Preliminary Phase","C":"Phase E"},"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1665491700,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/85153-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-258-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-10-11 14:35:00","answer":"A"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":284,"provider":"The-open-group","isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"OG0-091","isImplemented":true,"id":434},"currentPage":34},"__N_SSP":true}
