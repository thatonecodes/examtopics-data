Architecture Views, Architecture Viewpoints is the more appropriate answer:\n\nArchitecture Views and Viewpoints are formal tools used within architectural frameworks like TOGAF to communicate architecture in ways that are relevant to different stakeholder groups. They allow architects to address specific stakeholder concerns by presenting different aspects of the architecture. By doing so, architects can extract deeper insights into stakeholders' needs, priorities, and any hidden agendas that might affect the architecture.\nAlternatives and Trade-offs, on the other hand, focus more on evaluating different architectural options and making decisions about compromises. While important, they don’t provide the structured method for presenting information to stakeholders in the same way views and viewpoints do. They are more about decision-making rather than uncovering hidden stakeholder requirements.\nThus, Views and Viewpoints are designed specifically for engaging stakeholders and extracting hidden insights, making A the better choice.","comment_id":"1296753","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MMo001","timestamp":"1728802080.0"},{"comment_id":"1278540","timestamp":"1725491640.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nit's a technique to identify alternative target architectures and perform trade-offs between the alternatives","poster":"Chiquitabandita","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"YUWKGH08nqhBlzZVSQ9S","exam_id":437,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Consider the following statements related to the TOGAF ADM.\n1.
