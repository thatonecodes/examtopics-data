Foundation Solutions.\n\nBuilding Blocks that are viewed as being at the left-hand side of the Solutions Continuum are known as Foundation Solutions. These solutions provide the basic building blocks for higher-level solutions and typically include infrastructure, platforms, and tools necessary for creating more complex solutions. These building blocks are often generic and reusable across different types of organizations and industries.

This content-agnostic approach ensures that the framework is flexible. The processes are typically independent of the content and implement a proven best practice approach to active governance.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"693281","timestamp":"1728753960.0"},{"timestamp":"1728588420.0","comment_id":"691466","content":"- Phase G of the TOGAF ADM is dedicated to Implementation Governance,\nwhich concerns itself with the realization of the architecture through change\nprojects.
