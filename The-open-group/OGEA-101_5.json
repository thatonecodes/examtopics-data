The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) is designed to be iterative and flexible rather than strictly sequential.\n\nWhile the ADM does have a sequence of phases, it's not mandatory to run them in a strict order. Phases can overlap, and activities from different phases can be carried out simultaneously to refine and gather the necessary information. This iterative and flexible approach allows for more adaptive and responsive architecture development.\n\nHence, C.

Let's clarify this point:\n\nThe answer B suggests that an Enterprise Architecture must be developed in phases with a limited fixed duration, which is somewhat misleading in the context of TOGAF. The correct concept illustrated by the Architecture Roadmap is that ADM phases must be run in a sequenced approach to produce the Architecture (Answer A).\n\nThe Gantt chart mentioned in the reference highlights the interdependent nature of the phases, indicating that while some activities might overlap or run concurrently, the phases themselves have a sequential flow. This does not necessarily imply a limited fixed duration but rather emphasizes the structured progression and dependency among phases.\n\nSo, while the phases can have some degree of overlap to address specific requirements (as stated in the reference), the overall process is still sequenced to ensure that each phase builds upon the outcomes of the previous one, aligning with the Architecture Roadmap's purpose.","timestamp":"1732731480.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"sorry typo, answer is C, not B."}],"timestamp":"1727963040.0"},{"comment_id":"1278668","poster":"Chiquitabandita","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1725513540.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nYes, the phases of the Architecture Development Method (ADM) must be run in a sequenced approach to produce an enterprise architecture"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (50%)","A (33%)","B (17%)"],"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"ADM phases must be run simultaneously until the relevant information has been produced.","B":"An Enterprise Architecture must be developed in phases with a limited fixed duration.","D":"Enterprise Architects must use Gantt charts to communicate with Stakeholders.","A":"ADM phases must be run in a sequenced approach to produce the Architecture."},"exam_id":437,"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2024-09-05 07:19:00","answer_description":"","question_id":22,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/ogea-101/image3.png"],"unix_timestamp":1725513540,"isMC":true,"question_text":"Consider the following chart:\n//IMG//\n\nWhich important concept for Enterprise Architecture Practitioners does it illustrate?"},{"id":"wydpyaemhZbdPDCDNVwK","answer_description":"","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/147763-exam-ogea-101-topic-1-question-3-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"To describe how an architecture addresses stakeholder concerns","C":"To identify and understand business requirements","B":"To classify architecture and solution assets","D":"To coordinate with the other management frameworks in use"},"unix_timestamp":1726498740,"question_text":"Which of the following describes how the Enterprise Continuum is used when developing an enterprise architecture?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1736017800.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/introduction/chap03.html#tag_03_10\n\n\"The Enterprise Continuum is a categorization for assets held in the Enterprise Repositories that provides methods for classifying assets...\"","poster":"044f354","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1336493"},{"poster":"ByeWorld","comment_id":"1292430","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/architecture-content/chap06.html\nThe Enterprise Continuum provides methods for classifying architecture and solution artifacts, both internal and external to the Architecture Repository, as they evolve from generic Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727876160.0"},{"content":"B.
