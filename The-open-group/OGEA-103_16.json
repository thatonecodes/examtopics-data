It is important to identify alternative Target Architectures and build understanding of different possibilities and identify trade-offs between the alternatives. Creating an architecture normally requires trade-offs among competing forces. Presenting different alternatives and trade-offs to stakeholders helps architects to extract hidden agendas, principles, and requirements that could impact the final Target Architecture.","poster":"klezlil"},{"comment_id":"1145247","timestamp":"1707454860.0","content":"yes C is correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kashifqa"},{"poster":"zvukovic123","timestamp":"1705861440.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1128046","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt's C, \"Presenting different alternatives and trade-offs to stakeholders helps architects to extract hidden agendas, principles, and requirements that could impact the final Target Architecture.\""}],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Alternatives and Trade-offs","B":"Architecture Views and Architecture Viewpoints","D":"Business Scenarios and Business Models","A":"Solutions and Applications"},"topic":"1","question_id":77},{"id":"hzIW73HSJVcKQkDt0GZX","question_id":78,"choices":{"A":"Transitional, Complete, and Incremental Architectures","C":"Baseline, Transition, and To Be Architectures","B":"Segment, Strategic, and Capability Architectures","D":"Gaps, Plateaus, and Target Architectures"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/134026-exam-ogea-103-topic-1-question-77-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1723810560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/applying-the-adm/chap03.html#tag_03\n\n3.2 Architecture Landscape\nLevels provide a framework for dividing the Architecture Landscape into three levels of granularity:\n\nStrategic Architecture provides an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allows for direction setting at an executive level.\nSegment Architecture provides an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allows for direction setting and the development of effective architecture roadmaps at a program or portfolio level.\nCapability Architecture provides an organizing framework for change activity and the development of effective architecture roadmaps realizing capability increments.","comment_id":"1152059","upvote_count":"3","poster":"klezlil"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1708092960,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2024-02-16 15:16:00","question_text":"Complete the sentence.
