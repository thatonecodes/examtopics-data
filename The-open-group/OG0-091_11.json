Business Value Assessment Technique.\n\nThe Business Value Assessment Technique is a method used in TOGAF to assess the potential value and benefits that an architecture initiative can deliver to the business. It goes beyond technical considerations and emphasizes the alignment of the architecture with the organization's strategic goals and objectives. The technique involves evaluating the expected business outcomes, financial impacts, risk mitigation, and other factors to determine the value proposition of the architecture. By assessing the business value, organizations can prioritize investments, make informed decisions, and ensure that the architecture initiatives are closely aligned with business priorities and objectives.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Rikim","timestamp":"1701829920.0","comment_id":"915807"},{"poster":"rockyslav","timestamp":"1681115400.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"690879","content":"https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap28.html\n\nA business planning technique that \"focuses on business outcomes\".
