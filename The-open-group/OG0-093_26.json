As part of a corporate-wide Lean\nManufacturing initiative, the company has defined a strategic architecture to improve its ability to meet consumer demand and improve its ability to manage its supply chain. The strategic architecture called for the consolidation of multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications that have been operating independently in several of the divisions' production facilities. The goal is to replace the functionality of the existing applications with a new ERP product running as a single instance in the company's primary data center.\nThe company has a mature enterprise architecture practice and uses TOGAF 9 for the basis of its architecture framework. In addition to the EA program, the company has a number of management frameworks in use, including business planning, portfolio/project management, and operations management. The EA program is sponsored by the CIO.\nEach division has completed the Architecture Definition documentation required to tailor and configure the environment to meet its own specific manufacturing requirements.\nThe enterprise architects have analyzed the key corporate change attributes and implementation constraints. A consolidated gap analysis has been completed which has identified the gaps across the Business, Data, Application, and Technology domains. Based on the results of the gap analysis, the architects have reviewed the requirements, dependencies and interoperability requirements needed to integrate the new ERP environment into the existing environment. The architects have completed the Business Transformation Readiness Assessment started in Phase A. Based on all of these factors they have produced a risk assessment.\nBecause of the risks posed by the complexity of the current environment, it has been determined that a phased approach is needed to implement the target architectures. The overall implementation process is estimated to take several years.\n\nRefer to the Scenario -\nThe Implementation and Migration Plan v0.l, the draft Architecture Roadmap, and the Capability Assessment deliverables are now complete.

However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.\nAs a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a single enterprise-wide application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The application will be used by all business units and accessed by suppliers through well defined interfaces.\nThe Corporate Board is concerned that the new application must be able to manage and safeguard confidential customer information in a secure manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services in cooperation with its trading partners.\nThe CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Board to oversee and govern the architecture. The company has an existing team of security architects.\nTOGAF 9 has been selected for use for the Enterprise Architecture program. The CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.\n\nRefer to the Scenario -\nIn the Preliminary Phase you need to define suitable policies and ensure that the company has the appropriate capability to address the concerns of the Corporate\nBoard.\nBased on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?","answers_community":["B (75%)","A (25%)"],"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"You evaluate the implications of the concerns raised by the Corporate Board in terms of regulatory requirements and their impact on business goals and objectives.

You ensure that written policies are put in place to address the requirements, and that they are communicated across the organization, together with appropriate training for key employees. You identify constraints on the architecture and communicate those to the architecture team. You establish an agreement with the security architects defining their role within the ongoing architecture project.","A":"You start by clarifying the intent that the Board has for raising these concerns. This enables you to understand the implications of the concern in terms of regulatory requirements and the potential impact on current business goals and objectives. You propose that a security architect or security architecture team be allocated to develop a comprehensive security architecture and that this be considered an additional domain architecture.","B":"You evaluate the implications of the Board's concerns by examining the security and regulatory impacts on business goals, business drivers and objectives. Based on your understanding, you then update the current security policy to include an emphasis on the concerns.
