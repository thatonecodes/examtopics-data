Note that, in parallel with Phase G, there is the execution of an organizational-specific development process, where the actual development happens.\n\nPhase G establishes the connection between architecture and implementation organization, through the Architecture Contract.\nArchitecture Contracts are the joint agreements between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture. Successful implementation of these agreements will be delivered through effective Architecture Governance.","poster":"rockyslav","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"690779"},{"content":"Phase G establishes the connection between architecture and implementation organization, through the Architecture Contract.
