There are many dimensions to change, but by far the most important is the human element. For example, if the enterprise envisages a consolidation of information holdings and a move to a new paradigm such as service orientation for integrated service delivery, then the human resource implications are major. Potentially coupled with a change-averse culture and a narrowly skilled workforce, the most sound and innovative architecture could go nowhere.\n\nUnderstanding the readiness of the organization to accept change, identifying the issues, and then dealing with them in the Implementation and Migration Plans is key to successful architecture transformation in Phases E and F. This will be a joint effort between corporate (especially human resources) staff, lines of business, and IT planners.","poster":"rockyslav","comment_id":"691275","timestamp":"1728572400.0"},{"comment_id":"691272","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1728572280.0","content":"https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap06.html\n\n6.3.5 Assess Readiness for Business Transformation\nA Business Transformation Readiness Assessment can be used to evaluate and quantify the organization's readiness to undergo a change. This assessment is based upon the determination and analysis/rating of a series of readiness factors, as described in 26.
