The stores operate 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and rely on point-of-sale technology to manage their inventory.\nStores place all orders on-line. The back-office systems collect real-time data to support ordering and product selection decisions including the tailoring of product assortment based on sales history, customer demographics as well as the next day's weather forecast. In many cases, several stores are located in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible.\nAn Enterprise Architecture practice exists within the company, with the CEO and CIO as joint sponsors. They have decided to adopt TOGAF 9 within the practice and the first project is to restructure the Enterprise Architecture so that it can better accommodate the changing strategies within the company and also better respond to changes in economic and technical environments.\nThe CIO has stated that the following issues need to be addressed in the restructuring:\n✑ The systems should be able to withstand any unforeseen disruptions which might affect day to day operations. This is highly critical for ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction and maintaining and growing revenue.\n✑ Dependencies between the application components, the application platform, and technology infrastructure should be minimal and well defined. This will facilitate scalability and ease of enhancement of the service offerings.\n✑ The company is adopting the ARTS Operational Data Model and Data Warehouse Model from the National Retail Federation. This will address past problems with data quality and inconsistent data.\n✑ To remain competitive, new products and promotions must undergo market trials and if these are successful, deployed across the retail chain. Information systems must be able to manage changes and updates without undue delays.\n[Note: You should assume that the company has adopted the example set of principles that are listed and defined in TOGAF, Section 23.6. You may need to refer to Chapter 23 of the reference text in order to answer this question.]\nYou have been asked to identify the most relevant architecture principles for the current situation.\nBased on TOGAF, which of the following is the best answer?

The company now consists of three divisions with the same names and division headquarters as their predecessors.\nThe lack of integration between the three divisions has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the company was formed. At present, each division maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, and claims information, each division has different ways of defining these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.\nAs a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a common web portal, contact center software suite, and document management system. Also the company has selected a single enterprise-wide customer relationship management (CRM) application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the divisions. The application will be used by each of the divisions and accessed by third party partners through well defined interfaces.\nThe Corporate Board is concerned that the new application must be able to manage and safeguard confidential customer information in a secure manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services in cooperation with its partners.\nThe CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the implementation team and the migration teams in each division. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Board to oversee and govern the architecture.

The company now consists of three divisions with the same names and division headquarters as their predecessors.\nThe lack of integration between the three divisions has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information has resulted in lost opportunities to leverage the synergies that should have been possible as a result of the merger. At present, each division maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, and claims information, each division has different ways of defining these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.\nAs a result, the company has made the decision to introduce a common web portal, contact center software suite, and document management system. Also the company has selected a single enterprise-wide customer relationship management (CRM) application to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the divisions. The application will be used by each of the divisions and accessed by third party partners through well defined interfaces.\nThe Corporate Board is concerned that the new application must be able to manage and safeguard confidential customer information in a secure manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services in cooperation with its partners.\nThe CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the implementation team and the migration teams in each division. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Board to oversee and govern the architecture. The company has an existing team of security architects.\n\n\nTOGAF Standard Version 9.2 -\nhas been selected as the core framework for use for the Enterprise Architecture program. The CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.\nAs part of the process for establishing the Enterprise Architecture department, you are developing a set of architecture principles to guide the activities.\nYou need to recommend the best approach for this work.\nBased on TOGAF Standard Version 9.2, which of the following is the best answer?"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"provider":"The-open-group","isMCOnly":true,"name":"OG0-092","numberOfQuestions":74,"id":435,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":11},"__N_SSP":true}
