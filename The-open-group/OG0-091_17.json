However, it will often be necessary to modify or extend the ADM to suit specific needs. One of the tasks before applying the ADM is to review its components for applicability, and then tailor them as appropriate to the circumstances of the individual enterprise. This activity may well produce an \"enterprise-specific\" ADM.\n\nOne reason for wanting to adapt the ADM, which it is important to stress, is that the order of the phases in the ADM is to some extent dependent on the maturity of the architecture discipline within the enterprise.","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":83,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/85003-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-173-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-10-10 14:12:00"},{"id":"lsGna0cHnwMtvLXsRBAy","question_text":"Which of the following best describes the need for the ADM process to be governed?","answers_community":["D (67%)","C (33%)"],"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"B":"To enable development of reference architectures","C":"To enable the architecture domains to be integrated","A":"To build a top-down, all inclusive architecture description","D":"To ensure that the method is being applied correctly"},"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-04-15 22:29:00","exam_id":434,"isMC":true,"question_id":84,"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/73728-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-174-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1650054540,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"xlr8au","timestamp":"1731224220.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n14.1 Objectives\nThe objectives of Phase G are to:\n Ensure conformance with the Target Architecture by implementation projects","comment_id":"893641"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn order to mitigate against this risk, standards for content integration should be defined and\nArchitecture Governance should address content integration as a condition of architectural\ncompliance.
