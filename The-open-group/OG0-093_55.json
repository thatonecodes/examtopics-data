It has its own distribution network, its own showrooms, and sells directly to customers via the internet. The company has four manufacturing facilities, two in the North America, one in Europe, and one in Asia.\nA challenge that the company is facing to scale up the number of vehicles coming off the production line to meed customer demand, while maintaining quality. At the moment there are supply chain storages for key electronic components related to the autonomous drive system. In response the this, the research arm of the company has pioneered the development of a new self-driving platform. This new design uses common off-the-shelf components that will allow for a significant increase in overall vehicle production. This new design is ready to go into production.\nThe company has a mature Enterprise Architecture practice that is supported by a cross-functional Architecture Board. The TOGAF standard is used for developing the automated manufacturing process and systems used to design, manufacture and test the new design. The Chief Information Officer and the Chief\nOperating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.\nAs part of putting the new self-driving platform into production, adjustments to the automated assembly processes need to be made. A pilot architecture project at a single location has defined an updated approach for controlling the automated test systems used to perform final quality assurance. The Chief Engineer, sponsor of the activity, and the Architecture Board have approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.\nArchitecture Contracts have been developed that detail the work needed to implement and deploy the new automated test system controller for each location. The\nChief Engineer has expressed concern that a uniform process be employed at each location to ensure consistency and quality.\n\nRefer to the Scenario -\nThe Lead Enterprise Architect has asked you to recommend the best approach to address the Chief Engineer's concern.\nBased on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?","question_id":271,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"D seems the correct one to me","poster":"ppoulop","timestamp":"1639155120.0","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"240335"},{"timestamp":"1735547760.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOnly D imposed Compliance review, so it is correct","poster":"evangelist","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1333989"},{"timestamp":"1723508760.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGiven the Chief Engineer's concern for a uniform process to ensure consistency and quality, Option D seems the best fit.

Cloud-based POS systems store all user data, including sales and inventory in a remote server.\nThe cloud-based systems collect real-time data to support ordering and product selection decisions including the tailoring of product assortment based on sales history, customer demographics as well as the next day's weather forecast. In many cases, several stores are located in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible. The stores also act as self-service delivery locations for a large online retailer which further increases the number of potential customers entering the stores.\nAn Enterprise Architecture practice exists within the company, with the CEO and CIO as joint sponsors.
