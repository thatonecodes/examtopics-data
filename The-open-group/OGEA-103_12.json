Consider two stakeholders in a new small computing system: the users and the developers.\n\nThe users of the system have an architecture viewpoint that reflects their concerns when interacting with the system, and the developers of the system have a different architecture viewpoint. Architecture views that are developed to address either of the two architecture viewpoints are unlikely to exhaustively describe the whole system, because each perspective reduces how each sees the system.","comment_id":"1150808"}]},{"id":"hpR6gpDhwATFlHBZoTVl","choices":{"B":"To enable a fast response to market changes","D":"To permit the architecture domains to be integrated","C":"To verify that the method is being applied correctly","A":"To enable development of reference architectures"},"unix_timestamp":1707985800,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-02-15 09:30:00","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1723703400.0","comment_id":"1150816","poster":"klezlil","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/adm/chap01.html#tag_01_04\n\n1.4 Architecture Governance\nThe ADM, whether adapted by the organization or used as documented here, is a key process to be managed in the same manner as other architecture artifacts classified through the Enterprise Continuum and held in the Architecture Repository.
