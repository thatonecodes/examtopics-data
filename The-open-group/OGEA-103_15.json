However, as noted earlier in Section 1.2, this Guide uses the ISO 31000:2009 [6] definition of “risk”, an “uncertainty of outcomes”, and risk management is presented as striking a balance between positive and negative outcomes resulting from the realization of either opportunities or threats.","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"What is presented as “striking a balance between positive and negative outcomes resulting from the realization of either opportunities or threats”?","timestamp":"2024-02-16 14:53:00","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":438},{"id":"b1n9zqZU15ErN1ASDUNt","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723809300.0","comment_id":"1152038","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/pocket-guides/togaf-pocket-guide/main/chap07.html\n\nImplications:\n\nShould highlight the requirements, both for the business and IT, for carrying out the principle – in terms of resources, costs, and activities/tasks. It will often be apparent that current systems, standards, or practices would be incongruent with the principle upon adoption. The impact on the business and the consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: “How does this affect me?”. It is important not to oversimplify, trivialize, or judge the merit of the impact. Some of the implications will be identified as potential impacts only, and may be speculative rather than fully analyzed.","poster":"klezlil"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/134022-exam-ogea-103-topic-1-question-72-discussion/","question_text":"In which section of the TOGAF template for Architecture Principles would a reader find the answer to the question of “How does this affect me”?","question_id":73,"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"D":"Statement","B":"Name","C":"Rationale","A":"Implications"},"exam_id":438,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1708091700,"timestamp":"2024-02-16 14:55:00"},{"id":"ot79o2v0R9BL49RCsflB","timestamp":"2024-02-16 15:00:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/134023-exam-ogea-103-topic-1-question-73-discussion/","question_text":"Which ADM phase focuses on defining the problem to be solved, identifying the stakeholders, their concerns, and requirements?","unix_timestamp":1708092000,"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1152044","upvote_count":"3","poster":"klezlil","timestamp":"1723809600.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/adm/chap03.html\n3.3 Steps\nThe steps in Phase A are as follows:\n\nEstablish the architecture project (see 3.3.1 Establish the Architecture Project)\nIdentify stakeholders, concerns, and business requirements (see 3.3.2 Identify Stakeholders, Concerns, and Business Requirements)"}],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"exam_id":438,"question_id":74,"topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Phase C","C":"Phase B","A":"Phase A","D":"Preliminary Phase"},"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"1hA4TtRsK80GLsNecFyL","timestamp":"2024-02-16 15:05:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/134024-exam-ogea-103-topic-1-question-74-discussion/","question_text":"Which statement best describes iteration and the ADM?","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1723809900.0","poster":"klezlil","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap18.html\n18.2 Iteration Cycles","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1152046"}],"question_id":75,"exam_id":438,"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1708092300,"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"The ADM is iterative, over the whole process, between phases, and within phases.","A":"The ADM is sequential.
