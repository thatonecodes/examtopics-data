It is organized into two major business groupings:\n-Upstream operations which include exploration for crude oil and natural gas and operating the infrastructure necessary to deliver oil and gas to the market.\n-Downstream operations which include the manufacturing, distribution and marketing activities for oil products and chemicals\nSafety is a priority for the company, with the aim to ensure it causes zero harm to people and the environment. The company has to satisfy the regulatory requirements of each of the countries it operates in.\nThe downstream business generates a third of the company's profits worldwide and includes more than 30,000 petrol stations and various oil refineries. In some countries it also includes oil refining, a retail petrol station network, lubricants manufacture and marketing, industrial fuel and lubricants sales. The practice for the downstream business has been to operate locally, managed by local \"operating companies\".\nThe Governing Board is concerned about the risk posed by operating in this complex global environment with a large part of the downstream business represented by local operating companies. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) to be responsible for overseeing and managing compliance issues for the corporation. The CCO reports directly to the CEO.\nThe CCO has approved the expenditure of resources to establish an Enterprise Architecture program, and has mandated the use of the TOGAF standard as the framework. He has requested to be informed about the status of downstream operations that could impact regulatory compliance. He also wants the corporate legal staff and auditors to analyze all proposed new downstream operations to ensure that they are within the legal guidelines for each country. In addition, the local operating companies should be able to see that the architecture is appropriate for their needs.\nThe architecture project team has worked with the sponsor to complete a detailed Request for Architecture Work providing the high level project description. As the project commences the next phase, the necessary approvals from corporate and line management have been received.\nRefer to the Scenario -\nYou have been asked to recommend an approach that would enable the development of an architecture that addresses the needs of the Chief Compliance\nOfficer, legal staff, auditors and the local operating companies.\nBased on the TOGAF standard, Version 9.2, which of the following is the best answer?","discussion":[{"content":"why there are two different answers?","poster":"SonyJ","timestamp":"1732783200.0","comment_id":"728889","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B because of the Stakeholder Map, an essential item to deal with all the relevant stakeholders","comment_id":"694941","timestamp":"1728927960.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"noureldin"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"636205","content":"Selected Answer: B\nof a Stakeholder Map","poster":"Banzaaai","timestamp":"1721847900.0"},{"comment_id":"632806","content":"Selected Answer: B\nMultiple stakeholder concerns is 'stakeholder map'","timestamp":"1721274000.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"supratip"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1658115600,"choices":{"B":"You recommend that an analysis of the stakeholders is undertaken, including development of a Stakeholder Map.

It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aviation products worldwide and manufactures in multiple countries both inside and outside of the European Union. The company has grown rapidly by acquisition and has inherited numerous different procurement processes and related IT systems.\nRecently, several procurement processes, within the civil aviation business, have had problems related to the timing of purchases, which has led to excess inventory. The Vice President in charge of Supply Chain Management has made the decision to consolidate and reduce redundant procurement processes and systems. He has committed to the CEO that the business will move to a \"Just-in-time\" procurement system so as to keep inventory costs low.\nThe TOGAF standard is used for internal Enterprise Architecture activities. At present, there are no architectural assets in the Architecture Repository related to this initiative. All assets will need to be acquired, customized, or created from scratch. The company prefers to implement commercial off the shelf package applications with little customization. The CIO, who is the project sponsor, has stated that she is not concerned about preserving the existing procurement processes or systems.\nThis project is using an iterative approach for executing the Architecture Development Method (ADM). The architecture development project has completed the\nArchitecture Vision Phase and has started a number of iteration cycles to develop the Architecture. As a packaged application is being considered, the next iteration will include both the Business and Application Architectures.\nStakeholder concerns that should be addressed by these architectures include:\n1. What groups of people should be involved in procurement-related business processes?\n2. What applications will these groups use once the architecture development is complete?\n3.

These provide real-time, highly secure communication of voice, video, and message data to remote locations around the world. The agency has recently received information from intelligence sources that the current encryption protocols may no longer be secure. In response, a program is underway to upgrade the systems.\nThe agency has an established Enterprise Architecture (EA) capability based on the TOGAF standard. The Executive Director of the agency is the sponsor of the\nEA capability.\nSince reliable, high-performance, and secure communications are essential to preserving national security, the Executive Director has placed more stringent requirements for the architecture of the upgraded systems. It must be able to provide assurance and verification of specific performance measures on the key services that are most crucial for system operation. Focusing on these service-level details and specific measurements, will allow stricter requirements to be enforced in service contracts. It will also provide a high degree of assurance that necessary performance is being delivered and that notifications will occur if any critical service fails to perform as required.\nA portion of the program budget has been allocated to context a review of the EA. The scope of the review is to evaluate the processes, content and governance of the EA capability to ensure that the higher target performance and service levels required by the upgraded system can be achieved.\nThe Chief Architect has noted that the core EA artifacts that have been in use are not able to describe these new capabilities. The artifacts do not have explicit provisions for defining the in-depth measurement requirements regarding specific services required for the system. She has learned that certain services within the current system have service measurement implementations that match some of the new requirements, but they are only used in a few areas.\nRecent EA efforts at another national agency have produced generalized high-performance communication system models to realize similar requirements in a critical defense system involving secure communications.
