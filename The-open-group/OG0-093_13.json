Artifacts are generally classified as catalogs (lists of things), matrices (showing relationships between things), and diagrams (pictures of things). Examples include a requirements catalog, business interaction matrix, and a use-case diagram. An architectural deliverable may contain many artifacts and artifacts will form the content of the Architecture Repository.\n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf91-doc/arch/chap33.html","timestamp":"1700116200.0","poster":"noureldin","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"719381"},{"timestamp":"1681304280.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"584728","content":"Correct Answer","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster"},{"content":"Reference: \"An artifact is an architectural work product that describes an aspect of the architecture\"\nLink: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf91-doc/arch/chap33.html","poster":"RVR","timestamp":"1640870880.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"255622"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1609334880,"question_text":"Which of the following does the TOGAF document define as architectural work product that describes an aspect of the architecture?","question_id":62,"timestamp":"2020-12-30 14:28:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/41046-exam-og0-093-topic-1-question-154-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"B","exam_id":436},{"id":"M6UP8k1II9zruO7wlUAB","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1649768520,"question_text":"Which part of the TOGAF document describes taxonomies for categorizing the outputs of architecture activity?","choices":{"B":"Architecture Capability Framework","D":"Enterprise Continuum & Tools","A":"ADM Guidelines and Techniques","C":"Architecture Development Method"},"timestamp":"2022-04-12 15:02:00","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1720584420.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n1.
