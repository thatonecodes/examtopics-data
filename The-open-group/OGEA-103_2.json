This governance model provides the necessary checks and balances to manage risk, monitor progress, and enforce architecture compliance as the project moves from design to actual implementation.\n• A. Implementation Strategy: Refers to the high-level plan of how the implementation will occur but does not focus on governance.\n• B. Transition Plan: Focuses on moving from one phase to another, such as from the current architecture to a transition architecture, but does not focus on governance.\n• C. Migration Plan: Deals with the specific details and logistics of moving from the current state to a future state, but governance is not its primary concern.","timestamp":"1734387540.0","poster":"Pupina"},{"comment_id":"1254162","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is C","poster":"jsabhi","timestamp":"1721801820.0"},{"content":"Option D [VERIFIED]\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf90-doc/epf/TOGAF9/workproducts/Implementation%20Governance%20Model_4E2B30CF.html#:~:text=The%20Implementation%20Governance%20Model%20ensures,transitions%20into%20appropriate%20architecture%20governance.&text=Input%20To%3A,Implementation%20Governance","comment_id":"1096063","poster":"bmdibrahim","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1702532280.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1701681300.0","poster":"CyanideX","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe Implementation Governance Model ensures that a project transitioning into implementation also smoothly transitions into appropriate architecture governance.

Breadth: Refers to how wide the scope of the architecture is across the organization, such as whether it applies to the whole enterprise or just a specific part (like a business unit).\n2. Depth: Refers to how detailed the architecture needs to be, ranging from high-level conceptual models to detailed technical specifications.\n3.
