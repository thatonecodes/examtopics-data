An architecture view will comprise selected parts of one or more models, chosen so as to demonstrate to a particular stakeholder or group of stakeholders that their concerns are being adequately addressed in the design of the system architecture.\n\nAn \"architecture viewpoint\" is a specification of the conventions for a particular kind of architecture view. It can also be called the definition or schema for that kind of architecture view. It establishes the conventions for constructing, interpreting, and using an architecture view to address a specific concern (or set of concerns) about a system-of-interest.","timestamp":"1696678680.0","comment_id":"688570","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":257,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-10-07 13:38:00"},{"id":"cnUTmwswA0fykrE4zFYo","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/59198-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-75-discussion/","question_id":258,"exam_id":434,"unix_timestamp":1628053500,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap33.html\n\nA building block is a package of functionality defined to meet the business needs across an organization.\nA building block has a type that corresponds to the enterprise's content metamodel (such as actor, business service, application, or data entity).\nA building block has a defined boundary and is generally recognizable as \"a thing\" by domain experts.\nA building block may interoperate with other, inter-dependent building blocks.\n\nA good building block has the following characteristics:\nIt considers implementation and usage, and evolves to exploit technology and standards.\nIt may be assembled from other building blocks.\nIt may be a subassembly of other building blocks.\nIdeally a building block is re-usable and replaceable, and well specified.\n\nA building block's boundary and specification should be loosely coupled to its implementation; i.e., it should be possible to realize a building block in several different ways without impacting the boundary or specification of the building block","comment_id":"688571","timestamp":"1728301320.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rockyslav"},{"comment_id":"419521","content":"not always a software could be an infrastructure etc.","poster":"ihaamm","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1691125500.0"}],"timestamp":"2021-08-04 07:05:00","question_text":"Which one of the following statements about TOGAF Building Blocks is NOT true?","answer_description":"","choices":{"E":"They may be assembled from other Building Blocks","A":"They are a package of functionality intended to meet the business needs across the organization","D":"They may have multiple implementations but with different, interdependent Building Blocks","C":"They are equivalent to software component objects or web services","B":"They should have stable, published interfaces that allow other building blocks to interoperate with them"},"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","topic":"1","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":[]},{"id":"ypaYD69tNbnabnd3ucPo","choices":{"B":"Components","E":"Solution Building Blocks","A":"Architecture Building Blocks","D":"Re-usable Building Blocks","C":"Patterns"},"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1615110600,"question_id":259,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/46034-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-76-discussion/","answer":"D","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Complete the sentence.
