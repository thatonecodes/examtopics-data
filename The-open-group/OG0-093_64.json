It will often be apparent that current systems, standards, or practices would be incongruent with the principle upon adoption. The impact to the business and consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: \"How does this affect me?\". It is important not to oversimplify, trivialize, or judge the merit of the impact. Some of the implications will be identified as potential impacts only, and may be speculative rather than fully analyzed.\n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap20.html","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1714196640.0"},{"timestamp":"1697810400.0","comment_id":"588784","upvote_count":"2","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster","content":"Correct Answer"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"RVR","timestamp":"1656416700.0","comment_id":"254077","content":"Reference: \"Implications - Should highlight the requirements, both for the business and IT, for carrying out the principle - in terms of resources, costs, and activities/tasks. \" \nlink: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap29.html"}],"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Name","D":"Statement","C":"Rationale","A":"Implications"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/40907-exam-og0-093-topic-1-question-57-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":318,"question_text":"Which section of the TOGAF template for defining principles should highlight the requirements for carrying out the principle?","timestamp":"2020-12-28 14:45:00","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1609163100},{"id":"xkBfRuxuOVFWFPuBeIrX","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/40908-exam-og0-093-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","topic":"1","question_text":"Which one of the following best describes the next step in an Architecture Compliance Review once the scope of the review has been determined?","question_id":319,"choices":{"B":"Prepare the Architecture Compliance Review report","C":"Schedule the Architecture Review meeting","E":"Tailor the checklists to address business requirements","A":"Interview the project principals to obtain background information","D":"Send the assessment report to the Architecture Review co-ordinator"},"answer":"E","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"E","unix_timestamp":1609163340,"discussion":[{"poster":"1learner","comment_id":"1202625","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer - E\n\nRefer to the Architecture Compliance review process is illustrated in Figure 42-2 .","timestamp":"1729949460.0"},{"poster":"noureldin","comment_id":"705266","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: E\nArchitecture Compliance Review Process\n\nFigure: Architecture Compliance Review Process\n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap24.html","timestamp":"1682574660.0"},{"timestamp":"1679212980.0","content":"Selected Answer: E\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/Figures/revuproc.gif\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap24.html","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"672975","poster":"noureldin"},{"comment_id":"588785","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct Answer \n\n\n42.4 Architecture Compliance Review Process\n42.4.1 Overview\nThe Architecture Compliance review process is illustrated in Figure 42-2 .","timestamp":"1666274640.0","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster"},{"timestamp":"1624880940.0","poster":"RVR","comment_id":"254078","content":"reference: Figure: Architecture Compliance Review Process\nlink: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap24.html","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-12-28 14:49:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["E (100%)"],"exam_id":436,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"5xL7epCvURt3oJJi9Vos","answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","question_id":320,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Statement of Architecture Work","B":"Change Request","C":"Requirements Impact Analysis","A":"Capability Assessment"},"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1650463500,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"poster":"noureldin","comment_id":"710330","timestamp":"1730619000.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\n32.2.11 Change Request\nPurpose\nDuring implementation of an architecture, as more facts become known, it is possible that the original Architecture Definition and requirements are not suitable or are not sufficient to complete the implementation of a solution.
