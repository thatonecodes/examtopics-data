It will often be apparent that current systems, standards, or practices would be incongruent with the principle upon adoption. The impact to the business and consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: \"How does this affect me?\". It is important not to oversimplify, trivialize, or judge the merit of the impact. Some of the implications will be identified as potential impacts only, and may be speculative rather than fully analyzed.\n\nhttps://www.examtopics.com/exams/the-open-group/og0-093/view/","comment_id":"720358","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"639264","content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe impact to the business","timestamp":"1722262920.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Banzaaai"},{"content":"Correct Answer \n\nhint - check English of question","timestamp":"1712930100.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster","comment_id":"584771"}],"question_text":"Which section of the TOGAF template for Architecture Principles should clearly state the impact to the business and consequences of adopting the principle?","question_images":[]},{"id":"16AFNGBaq5UR6M6CWErq","topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Identifying the business transformation risks for an architecture project","D":"Identifying criteria for procurement activities","B":"Identifying stakeholders and their concerns","E":"Identifying work packages for inclusion in the Architecture Roadmap","A":"Identifying relationships between management frameworks"},"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (86%)","14%"],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-12-30 15:25:00","exam_id":436,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1609338300,"answer_images":[],"question_id":83,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/41054-exam-og0-093-topic-1-question-173-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"evangelist","content":"Selected Answer: C\nwhy C is not correct?\nFirst and foremost, catch errors in the project architecture early, and thereby reduce the cost and risk of changes required later in the lifecycle.\"","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1334554","timestamp":"1735611240.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\n42.
