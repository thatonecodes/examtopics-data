It will often be apparent that current systems, standards, or practices would be incongruent with the principle upon adoption. The impact to the business and consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: \"How does this affect me?\" It is important not to oversimplify, trivialize, or judge the merit of the impact. Some of the implications will be identified as potential impacts only, and may be speculative rather than fully analyzed.","poster":"dima_o","comment_id":"1158031","timestamp":"1708791660.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1152020","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/pocket-guides/togaf-pocket-guide/main/chap07.html\nRationale:\nShould highlight the business benefits of adhering to the principle, using business terminology.
