It will often be apparent that current systems, standards, or practices would be incongruent with the principle upon adoption. The impact to the business and consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: \"How does this affect me?\". It is important not to oversimplify, trivialize, or judge the merit of the impact.
