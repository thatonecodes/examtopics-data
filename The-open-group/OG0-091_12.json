It is not intended to serve as an implementation guide for practitioners.\n\nWithin the model, the content of the TOGAF document is categorized according to the following four categories:\n\nTOGAF Core consists of the fundamental concepts that form the essence of TOGAF.\nTOGAF Mandated consists of the normative parts of the TOGAF specification. These elements of TOGAF are central to its usage and without them the framework would not be recognizably TOGAF. Strong consideration must be given to these elements when applying TOGAF.\nTOGAF Recommended consists of a pool of resources that are specifically referenced in TOGAF as ways in which the TOGAF Core and Mandated processes can be accomplished (e.g., the SEI Architecture Trade-Off Analysis Method or business scenarios).\nTOGAF Supporting consists of additional resources that are not referenced in the other three TOGAF categories itself but provide valuable assistance.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"989113","timestamp":"1724497440.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"551696","content":"Not valid for TOGAF 9.2","poster":"Arvind_Kumar_Avinash","timestamp":"1676888400.0"},{"content":"Ignore this question as this is not part of TOGAF 9.2","poster":"sroyc","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"534508","timestamp":"1674890400.0"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"354560","content":"it does exist, check the spec properly before commenting.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1652261640.0","poster":"mrg998"},{"content":"The Document Categorization Model has been removed.\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf91-doc/arch/chap04.html","poster":"coolala","comment_id":"479044","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1668551880.0"}],"poster":"rMonteiro","content":"I think this does not exists in 9.2","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1645471560.0","comment_id":"296061"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":434,"answer_ET":"E","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1613935560,"timestamp":"2021-02-21 20:26:00","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"E"},{"id":"AZ2mzT8w3xCwxRYLyWVJ","topic":"1","choices":{"C":"To priorities work packages and projects","D":"To validate the business principles, goals, drivers and key performance indicators","B":"To establish an architecture change management process","A":"To create an implementation and migration strategy"},"question_text":"Which one of the following does TOGAF state is an objective for Phase A: Architecture Vision?","unix_timestamp":1645375800,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/71780-exam-og0-091-topic-1-question-150-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":58,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-02-20 17:50:00","answer":"D","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1215788","poster":"Njaff","content":"In togaf 10 it's refined in Phase A and validated in Phase B\n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/adm/chap03.html#:~:text=Refined%20statements%20of%20business%20principles%2C%20business%20goals%2C%20and%20business%20drivers%20(see%20the%20TOGAF%20Standard%20%E2%80%94%20Architecture%20Content)\n\n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/adm/chap04.html#:~:text=Validated%20business%20principles%2C%20business%20goals%2C%20and%20business%20drivers%20(see%20the%20TOGAF%20Standard%20%E2%80%94%20Architecture%20Content)%2C%20updated%20if%20necessary","timestamp":"1732291440.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1726766640.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1177662","poster":"Teringzooi","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAdmin: remove question. \nThis is not a good question anymore in Togaf 9.2 \nAnswer D: moved to Phase B."},{"timestamp":"1681116240.0","content":"Phase A - \"Architecture Vision\"\nNormally, the business principles, business goals, and strategic drivers of the organization are already defined elsewhere in the enterprise.
