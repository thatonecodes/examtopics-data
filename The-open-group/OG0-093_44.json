It will often be apparent that current systems, standards, or practices would be incongruent with the principle upon adoption. The impact to the business and consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: \"How does this affect me?\". It is important not to oversimplify, trivialize, or judge the merit of the impact. Some of the implications will be identified as potential impacts only, and may be speculative rather than fully analyzed.\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap20.html","poster":"noureldin","comment_id":"685998","timestamp":"1728027900.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Banzaaai","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

It should describe a method for designing a target state of the enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks, and for showing how the building blocks fit together. It should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary. It should also include a list of recommended standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks.\n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf91-doc/arch/chap01.html","poster":"noureldin","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"686034","timestamp":"1728030780.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715311620.0","comment_id":"599386","content":"Correct Answer","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster"}],"question_text":"Which one of the following is NOT an element of an architecture framework?","answers_community":["E (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/75385-exam-og0-093-topic-1-question-298-discussion/","choices":{"E":"A system development lifecycle method for software engineering","D":"A set of structures which can be used to develop a broad range of architectures","C":"A method for designing an information system in terms of building blocks","A":"A common vocabulary","B":"A list of recommended standards"},"answer_images":[],"exam_id":436,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-05-10 05:27:00","answer":"E"}],"exam":{"name":"OG0-093","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":364,"isMCOnly":true,"id":436,"provider":"The-open-group","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":44},"__N_SSP":true}
