He has defined a new strategic vision that will enhance the business by standardizing its operations across the network to provide consolidated financial, human resources, logistics, sales and marketing, and yield management. He has also stated that he expects results by the end of the current fiscal year.\nThese changes will provide the company with improved utilization of its capacity and more efficient operations.
