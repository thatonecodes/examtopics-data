The company has manufacturing facilities located in Palm Springs, California, Omaha, Nebraska, and Winnipeg, Manitoba. Each of these plants supplies a different manufacturer that builds and sells complete systems. The turbine blades are custom engineered to meet each manufacturer's design specifications.\nUntil recently, most turbine blades were fabricated manually using molded fiber-reinforced plastics. However, recent improvements in composite materials, coupled with enhanced automated methods for precision application of materials during the molding process, have led to significant reduction in weight, increase in strength, and greatly improved blade longevity. The company has pioneered the development of a proprietary automated process for continuous extrusion of the turbine blades. Patents have been filed to protect the process, but certain trade secrets must be closely guarded.\nThe company has a mature Enterprise Architecture organization that is supported by a cross-functional Architecture Review Board. The Chief Information Officer and the Chief Operating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.\nThe company has used T0GAF and its Architecture Development Method (ADM) to develop its automated manufacturing processes and systems that are used to design, manufacture, and test the blade assemblies. They have adapted their Enterprise Architecture to closely follow the TOGAF 9 framework. All of the company's enterprise architects have been trained and certified on TOGAF 9. Recently, an architecture project was completed that defined a standard approach for controlling the Automated Test System that is used at each plant to perform final quality assurance tests on each completed blade assembly. The\nManufacturing Architecture Board approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.\nAn Architecture Contract was developed that detailed the work needed to implement and deploy the new Automated Test System controller.

He has defined a new strategic vision that will enhance the LLC property business by standardizing its operations across the network to provide consolidated financial, human resources, logistics, sales and marketing, and yield management. He has also stated that he expects results by the end of the current fiscal year.\nThese changes will provide the company with improved utilization of its capacity and more efficient operations. The addition of a corporate-wide data warehouse will provide analytics that will enable the marketing group to improve its ability to target advertising into key markets to improve yields.\nThe LLC has a mature enterprise architecture (EA) practice and uses TOGAF 9 as the method and guiding framework. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity.\nIn planning this change, the Chief Architect engaged the services of a well-known consulting firm that specializes in business strategy.

However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.\nAs a result, the company has begun implementing a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business.\nThe Corporate Board is concerned that the new ERP system must be able to manage and safeguard customer information in a manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services offered to clients and trading partners.\nThe CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the ERP implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Review Board to oversee and govern the architecture. The company has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture program. The CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.\n\nRefer to the Scenario -\nYou are serving as the Chief Architect.\nYou have been asked to recommend the approach to take in the Preliminary Phase to ensure that the Corporate Board's concern is addressed.\nBased on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?","exam_id":436}],"exam":{"provider":"The-open-group","isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"OG0-093","numberOfQuestions":364,"id":436,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":24},"__N_SSP":true}
