In each case, particularly in largescale environments where architectures are necessarily developed in a federated manner, there is a danger of architects optimizing within their own scope of activity, instead of at the level of the overall enterprise. It is often necessary to sub-optimize in a particular area, in order to optimize at the enterprise level. The aim should always be to seek the highest level of commonality and focus on scalable and re-usable modules in order to maximize re-use at the enterprise level.","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster"}],"comment_id":"586147"}],"unix_timestamp":1649994840,"topic":"1","question_text":"According to TOGAF, the recommended dimensions used to define the scope of an architecture include all the following, except:","exam_id":436,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":227},{"id":"OOkGEUI4y4dJLcS1Wyd7","topic":"1","answer_ET":"E","choices":{"B":"Organization-Specific, Industry, Foundation, Common Systems","E":"Organization-Specific, Industry, Common Systems, Foundation","D":"Industry, Foundation, Common Systems, Organization-Specific","A":"Common Systems, Foundation, Industry, Organization-Specific","C":"Foundation, Common Systems, Industry, Organization-Specific"},"unix_timestamp":1649995080,"exam_id":436,"isMC":true,"question_text":"In the Solutions Continuum, which of the following is the correct order of Solutions from most-specific to most-generic?","answer":"E","timestamp":"2022-04-15 05:58:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/the-open-group/view/73716-exam-og0-093-topic-1-question-304-discussion/","question_id":228,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728107100.0","comment_id":"686616","content":"Selected Answer: E\n39.4.2 Solutions Continuum\n1-Foundation Solutions\nFoundation Solutions are highly generic concepts\n2-Common Systems Solutions\n3-Industry Solutions\n4-Organization-Specific Solutions\nAn Organization-Specific Solution is an implementation of the Organization-Specific Architecture \n\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf91-doc/arch/chap39.html","poster":"noureldin","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Correct Answer","comment_id":"586149","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713153480.0","poster":"PrashanttheCloudMaster"}],"answers_community":["E (100%)"]},{"id":"WehmCITQRfwNi8aJrXde","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: E\n27.2 Suggested Steps\nWhere an ABB from the Baseline Architecture is missing in the Target Architecture, each must be reviewed.
