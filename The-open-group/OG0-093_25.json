Each of these plants has been operating its own planning and production scheduling systems, as well as custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.\nThe company is implementing lean manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve the efficiency of all of its production operations. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.\nThe company Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9. At a recent meeting, the Architecture Review Board approved a Request for Architecture Work from the Chief\nEngineer of Global Manufacturing Operations who is the project sponsor. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.\nThe Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits. Some of the plant managers have expressed concern about the security and reliability of driving their planning and production scheduling from a central system located in Cleveland. The Chief Engineer wants to know how these concerns can be addressed.\n\nRefer to the Scenario -\nYou are serving as the Lead Enterprise Architect of the newly-formed Common ERP Deployment architecture project team.\nAs the Common ERP Deployment architecture project team assembles for its initial meeting, many of the participants have voiced concerns about the sweeping scope of the initiative.

During the meeting, a number of alternative recommendations for how to proceed are put forward by members of the team.\nYou have been asked to select the most appropriate recommendation to ensure that the team evaluates different approaches to the problem and clarifies the requirements for the architecture.\nBased on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?"},{"id":"aVonAnHbmk2JQqWZdDHQ","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-07-12 12:13:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1633683600.0","content":"C is correct.

They are yet to fully integrate the customer service systems for the most recent acquisitions, and as result, customer service has been a major concern for the Chief Technology Officer. Results for the last two quarters have shown that Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and the customer retention (Churn) rate have fallen below the industry average.\nThe Corporate Marketing group has published some new findings about customer satisfaction. The customers appear to be switching to AirLight, a competitor, because of superior customer service. The company actually has better coverage in nearly all markets than AirLight, and good roaming agreements that keep rates low for business travelers. But, customer satisfaction has remained low. The Business Strategy group and the Enterprise Architecture group have conducted a high-level project to develop the enterprise-wide strategic plan.\nThey have developed a business scenario which contains a good conceptual model of what needs to be done, and also identifies the key requirements. This was used in preparing the proposal presented to the Executive Council and the Corporate Board. The planning for the program has been underway for several months.\nThe company has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture. The Corporate Board has approved funding for a multi-million Euro conversion to transition to a packaged Customer Service System. It is anticipated that the overall program will take five years to complete, but there are some tactical projects that can commence immediately to address the situation.\nThe Executive Council has stated that the program should define specific initiatives to enable each regional business unit to create an implementation of the\nCustomer Service System. The implementation must meet the needs of the business unit and still provide the information needed to enable major improvements to the customer.\n\nRefer to the Scenario -\nYou are serving as the Lead Architect for the Performance and Integrity project of the Customer Service System program.\nThe project has been chartered to address the architecture(s) required to support the Customer Service System from an infrastructure perspective. At the present time, the project team is conducting an architecture development project that is focused on the customer self-service capability, which was defined as part of the earlier strategic planning activities. This capability will enable customers to access their accounts, pay bills, request account reviews, and provision services from any web-enabled device.\nThe project team has gathered information about the self-service capability, developed a business scenario, and used the results to define an Architecture Vision for achieving the capability.\nYou have been asked to recommend the course of action to complete the project.\nBased on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?","unix_timestamp":1597241460,"answer_description":"","exam_id":436,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","question_id":125,"timestamp":"2020-08-12 16:11:00","answers_community":["B (63%)","D (38%)"],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"The remaining architecture definition work should be focused on mapping out the technology and infrastructure capability in the Technology domain.
