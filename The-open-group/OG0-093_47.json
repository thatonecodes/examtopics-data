During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in energy usage could be achieved by replacing the current planning and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in one central data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems.
