SONiC provides the gNMI server, while the user provides the client. gNMI uses the gRPC framework to enable telemetry and configuration management of devices. gNMI streams data from the network device and provides the functionality to configure and retrieve operational and configuration states while providing a powerful method for switch management. The use of gNMI for the streaming of data from the network device and the functionality to configure and retrieve operational and configuration states provides a powerful method for switch management.\nhttps://infohub.delltechnologies.com/l/enterprise-sonic-distribution-by-dell-technologies-lifecycle-management/grpc-network-management-interface","poster":"designated","timestamp":"1725574020.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"660576"},{"poster":"ferock","content":"Selected Answer: C\ngNMI\nSupport for config management and telemetry dial-in\nSource: https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/emea/docs/2019/pdf/DEVWKS-1381.pdf","comment_id":"598035","timestamp":"1715070780.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"This is C.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1706357520.0","poster":"udo2020","comment_id":"533714"},{"poster":"tswinn","comments":[{"poster":"tswinn","comment_id":"437696","timestamp":"1693639440.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Never mind, \nThe DELL doc is clear in this.\ngNMI uses the gRPC framework to enable telemetry and configuration management of devhttps://www.examtopics.com/exams/cisco/350-901/view/36/#ices."}],"comment_id":"437690","content":"I would think A.\na unified management protocol for streaming telemetry (to Telegraf) and database logging (Influxdb)","timestamp":"1693638900.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2021-09-02 09:15:00","choices":{"A":"a unified management protocol for streaming telemetry and database logging","B":"a configuration management protocol for monitoring","D":"a logging protocol used across database servers","C":"a protocol for configuration management and streaming telemetry"},"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"Gz8FlWlaIMwV79B7h2B5","exam_id":329,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/67447-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-212-discussion/","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"Which two gRPC modes of model-driven telemetry are supported on Cisco IOS XE Software?
