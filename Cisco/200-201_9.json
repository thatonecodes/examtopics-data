Proxy server\n\nA proxy server can be configured to intercept and inspect HTTP headers, uniform resource identifiers (URIs), and SSL session IDs to make routing decisions. By analyzing these attributes, the proxy server can determine the appropriate destination for incoming requests, such as forwarding them to different backend servers based on predefined rules or policies.
