This means we will have to make configuration specifically to accommodate for these differences in the ACI Fabric.\nTo deal with the untagged MST BPDUs, you’ll need to configure a couple of things differently than what you do when dealing with RPVST or PVST.\n\nCreate a Switch Policy Group for your MST region – Under Fabric Access Policies, you’ll need to create a Switch Policy Group (note – I’m not talking about Interface Policy Groups). For this Policy Group, you’ll create a Spanning-tree policy and add in information about your MST region.\n\nNative Vlan EPG – For ACI, in your Tenant where you Layer-2 connection resides, you will need to create a specific EPG to carry the MST BPDUs. The static path bindings for your Legacy switches will be configured as dot1p (native). Failure to do this could very likely result in a loop.","timestamp":"1684984620.0","comment_id":"906279"},{"comment_id":"872776","content":"Picking B.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1681741140.0","poster":"Narbledeath"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1356229","upvote_count":"1","poster":"samfab","content":"yes, Should be B&D","timestamp":"1739469360.0"}],"upvote_count":"2","content":"This should be B&D.
