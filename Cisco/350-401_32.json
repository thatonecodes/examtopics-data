ISL is a Cisco-proprietary protocol for trunking, while dot1q is an industry-standard protocol widely used for trunking. Since they are different protocols, they cannot negotiate a trunk link using DTP.\n\nIn this scenario, if you want to create a trunk between the two switches, you should configure both ports with the same trunking encapsulation protocol. If one switch is using ISL, the other switch should also use ISL. If one switch is using dot1q, the other switch should use dot1q as well.
