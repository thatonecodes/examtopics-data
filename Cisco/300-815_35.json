The answer is A. The pattern matters not. There is no response to the SIP OPTIONS being sent, meaning the trunk to the D/E is down.

Option A (in-band) should be the correct choice. Configuring the gateway to use in-band DTMF (specifically RFC 2833/4733) ensures that the gateway can detect the in-band tones from the mobile phone and relay them to CUCM as RTP events. This is the most compatible and standard method for DTMF in a VoIP environment, especially for MVA scenarios involving the PSTN.\nOption B (out-of-band) would likely cause the issue to persist. If the gateway is set to out-of-band DTMF, it might expect DTMF to be sent as signaling messages (e.g., KPML, SIP INFO), which isn’t how the mobile phone sends DTMF over the PSTN. This mismatch would prevent the gateway from correctly detecting the tones.","comment_id":"1558254"}],"choices":{"B":"out-of-band","A":"in-band","C":"gateway","D":"channel"},"unix_timestamp":1743946560,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"A new deployment is using MVA for a specific user on the sales team, but the user is having issues when dialing DTMF.
