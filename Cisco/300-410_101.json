BGP route dampening is used to reduce the impact of such instability by suppressing routes that are frequently flapping. Neighbor route-map Dampening in: The key here is applying the dampening \"in\", which applies it to the incoming routes from the neighbor. This helps prevent the local router from flapping routes and constantly withdrawing them from the peers.","poster":"leipeG","comment_id":"1295351"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1257096","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is corerct","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1722202380.0"},{"comment_id":"1247726","content":"Selected Answer: A\nJust because my other comment i will go for A (reasoning see other comment)","timestamp":"1720951080.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Pietjeplukgeluk"},{"comment_id":"1217862","timestamp":"1716592380.0","poster":"dapardo","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI agree with D, configuration seems to be right.
