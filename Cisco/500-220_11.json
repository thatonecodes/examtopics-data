Since repeaters also support wired clients plugged into their wired interface, a repeater can be used to bridge a remote LAN segment back to the main network.\nWireless Mesh repeaters can back-haul to access points acting as wireless gateways and:\nUtilize the same radio as used for mesh to serve wireless clients\nUtilize non-meshing radios to serve wireless clients\nUtilize wired uplink for use cases described below","timestamp":"1733559840.0","comment_id":"1323048","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1732705020.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"rnunes1110","comment_id":"1081439","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nCorrect: A and C\n\nI´m pretty sure. You´ll find these information at Meraki´s documentation, in two separate articles:\n\nAnswer A:\nOverview\nThe Meraki Dashboard allows Administrators to configure a combination of Network and Device specific tags to create Summary Reports filtered for specific devices across multiple networks. This allows for the easy creation of much more specific Summary Reports than creating reports based on entire Networks\nRef.: https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Organizations_and_Networks/Organization_Menu/Manage_Tags\n\nAnswer C:\nPermissions by Network Tag\nTo simplify the assignment of network-level permissions in an organization with many networks, permissions can be granted to users for a given network tag. Those permissions will then be applied to all networks in an organization with that tag. These changes can only be made by users with full organization access.\nRef.: https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Managing_Dashboard_Access/Managing_Dashboard_Administrators_and_Permissions"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nAC is correct by given explanations!","poster":"18HandsOfLohan","comment_id":"815600","timestamp":"1708449900.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"784727","poster":"tliz","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSee Permissions by Network Tag section\nTo simplify the assignment of network-level permissions in an organization with many networks, permissions can be granted to users for a given network tag.\nhttps://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Managing_Dashboard_Access/Managing_Dashboard_Administrators_and_Permissions","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705960920.0"},{"comment_id":"784724","timestamp":"1705960500.0","poster":"tliz","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe Organization > Configure > Manage Tags page allows Administrators to configure a combination of Network and Device specific tags to create Summary Reports filtered for specific devices across multiple networks.\nhttps://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Organizations_and_Networks/Organization_Menu/Manage_Tags","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":51,"unix_timestamp":1674424500,"question_images":[]},{"id":"G3Fm1mkNWHIiw9zmIukh","unix_timestamp":1670259300,"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"796286","upvote_count":"8","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think A is correct: we are logging outbound traffic to Syslog server.","poster":"txami","timestamp":"1675359780.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe exhibit shows the syslog server is accessible via AutoVPN (enable means-allowed, disable-deny).
