If you're using a Class A network (10.x.x.x/8), you blow the whole network on a few connections (if you used VLSM, you could use a better mask, limit the addresses used). if you used 10.0.0.0/8, you would not be assigning the entire /8 to a single network. You would select a subnet mask for the network and then, you would have to use that mask with all subnets of the network. So if you chose a /24 mask, that would mean that you would have to use a /24 mask for even point-to-point links.","timestamp":"2019-07-06 16:56:00","unix_timestamp":1562424960,"question_text":"What is the advantage of using a multipoint interface instead of point-to-point subinterfaces when configuring a Frame Relay hub in a hub-and-spoke topology?","question_id":121,"answer":"B","choices":{"D":"The multiple IP network addresses required for a multipoint interface provide greater addressing flexibility over point-to-point configurations.","B":"IP addresses can be conserved if VLSM is not being used for subnetting.","A":"It avoids split-horizon issues with distance vector routing protocols.","C":"A multipoint interface offers greater security compared to point-to-point subinterface configurations."},"answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"topic":"1"},{"id":"Hm6MiZofShlpHkFscYsa","unix_timestamp":1573821600,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1573821600.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Erge","comment_id":"21802","content":"Possibly correct answer may be and D to.\nCause with APIC-EM you can apply access lists to.","comments":[{"comment_id":"23520","poster":"max80","upvote_count":"2","content":"APIC-EM Path Trace ACL --->>>>>> Analysis tool <<<-------------","timestamp":"1574405280.0"}]}],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-4-x/path_trace/ user-guide/b_Cisco_Path_Trace_User_Guide_1_4_0_x/b_Cisco_Path_Trace_Solution_Guide_1_4_0_x_chapter_01.html","topic":"2","answer":"AB","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"AB","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-11-15 13:40:00","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/8277-exam-200-105-topic-2-question-100-discussion/","exam_id":284,"isMC":true,"question_id":122,"choices":{"B":"It can determine whether traffic along a specific path will be filtered","A":"It can identify the path between two specified IP addresses","E":"It applies the ACLs from a specified path to permit and deny incoming traffic","D":"It can create and modify access lists in a private cloud infrastructure","C":"It can manage access lists in an SDN environment"},"question_text":"Which two functions of the APIC-EM Path Trace ACL Analysis tool are true?
