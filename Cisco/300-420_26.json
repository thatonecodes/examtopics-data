The dual-stack routers automatically encapsulate IPv6 packets inside IPv4 packets for transmission over the IPv4 network and then decapsulate them when they reach the destination IPv6 network.","comment_id":"883929","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1682720400.0","poster":"SpicyMochi"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIPv6 6RD (Rapid Deployment) is an IPv6 tunneling technique, similar to 6to4 tunneling.

The key is the \"routing process\" on R2 needing maintenance, which means the control plane will be down, but NOT the data plane. We can still move traffic through the data plane on R2 by way of NSF running on R1 and R3. The data plane on R1 and R3 needs to continue to forward packets even if they aren't receiving routing updates from R2.
