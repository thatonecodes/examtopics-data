You have been asked to review the configuration prior to cabling and implementation.\nThis task requires the use of various IOS commands to access and inspect the running configuration of RouterA and SwitchA. No configuration changes are necessary.\nYou will connect to RouterA and SwilchA via the console devices that are attached to each.\nThere are 4 multiple-choice questions with this task. Be sure to answer all of them before leaving this item. In order to score the maximum points you will need to have accessed both SwitchA and RouterA.\nNOTE: The configuration command has been disabled for both the router and switch in this simulation.\n//IMG//\n\nWhich two are security issues which need to be modified before RouterA is used?
