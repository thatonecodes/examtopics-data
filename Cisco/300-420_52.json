In a Data Center environment, where there are typically many SVIs, this can result in unnecessary EIGRP neighborships and potentially impact performance. To prevent this, it is recommended to configure EIGRP to only form neighborships on physical interfaces where necessary, rather than on all SVIs.\n\nOption A, performing manual summarization on all Layer 3 interfaces to minimize the size of the routing table, may be useful in some cases, but it is not a specific design consideration for EIGRP on Data Center switches.","timestamp":"1682637000.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"SpicyMochi","comment_id":"883098"},{"timestamp":"1663960560.0","comment_id":"677397","content":"A is correct. \nreference : ENSLD 300-420 Cert Guide\nChapter 3 \"Routing Protocol Characteristics, EIGRP, and IS-IS\" \nEIGRP in the Data Center page 114\n\"Because DCs will have many different services, networks, and applications, you should design for summarizing data center subnets...\"","poster":"iLikeHamburgers","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1663252440.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nreference : EIGRP in the Data Center Chapter 3\nBecause DCs will have many different services, networks, and applications, you should design for summarizing data center subnets, just as you would do in wide-area networking.","poster":"SergeBesse","comment_id":"670016","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"cwoolie","comment_id":"584877","upvote_count":"3","content":"I researched this question I am strongly think answer is A.

Implement BFD asynchronous mode between peers with low CPU resources.\n\nBidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) has two modes of operation: echo mode and asynchronous mode. In echo mode, BFD packets are sent back and forth between peers, and the forwarding plane handles the processing, which can lead to high CPU utilization.\n\nIn asynchronous mode, BFD control packets are sent periodically between peers, and the control plane handles the processing. Asynchronous mode is less CPU-intensive compared to echo mode.
