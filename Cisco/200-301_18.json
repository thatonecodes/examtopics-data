Enterprise firewalls, such as Cisco Secure Firewall, can serve as endpoints for remote access VPNs using SSL and IPsec-IKEv2 protocols. They can provide secure gateway capabilities and support remote access SSL and IPsec-IKEv2 VPNs. The full tunnel client, Secure Client, allows remote users to establish secure SSL and IPsec-IKEv2 connections to the security gateway. The Secure Client is the only client supported on endpoint devices for remote VPN connectivity to threat defense devices. This client gives remote users the benefits of an SSL or IPsec-IKEv2 VPN client without the need for network administrators to install and configure clients on remote computers.","timestamp":"1727994240.0"}],"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1188932","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nAI answers:\nThe statement that enterprise firewalls serve as an endpoint for a site-to-site VPN in standalone mode is **false**. Enterprise firewalls, especially Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW), are typically integrated into a broader network security architecture and are not standalone endpoints for site-to-site VPNs. Site-to-site VPNs involve connecting two or more networks securely, such as a corporate network and a branch office network, and are established between networking equipment like routers or dedicated VPN appliances. While enterprise firewalls play a crucial role in network security by monitoring and filtering traffic, preventing unauthorized access, and protecting against cyber threats, they are not designed to function as the sole endpoint for site-to-site VPN connections. Site-to-site VPNs require dedicated VPN endpoints to establish secure communication channels between different network locations, which are distinct from the role of enterprise firewalls in network security[1][2][4].","poster":"Starlord2535","timestamp":"1727994120.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nthis is so confusing. i think it is A and C. about the B yeah its partially correct but A and C are more accurate.","poster":"NetworkGeek00","timestamp":"1707013380.0","comment_id":"971559","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"6","comments":[{"comment_id":"985586","timestamp":"1708417740.0","content":"\"Many features are supported in multiple context mode, including routing tables, firewall features, IPS, and management.

This allows independent configurations, such as URI filters, NAT, remote access VPN and even configurations site-to-site VPN separated by context (instance). In addition, the firewall in Standalone mode, which is a normal and independent firewall (not divided into virtual instances), is also capable of offering site-to-site VPN feature -site as an endpoint to another firewall or router. So option B is wrong as it mentions that the firewall offers site-to-site VPN only in Standalone mode, when in fact, in both Multi-Context and Standalone mode, it is possible to configure the firewall as an endpoint for a site-to-site VPN.
