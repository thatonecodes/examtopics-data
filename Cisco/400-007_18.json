The business requirement states that WAN access failure for dual circuits into the same MPLS provider cannot happen due to costly service credits. Although the circuits are diversely routed to different points of presence (PoPs) on the providerâ€™s network, the single-provider dependency remains a risk."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe best approach to ensure WAN access availability and redundancy without adding unnecessary complexity or cost is dual homing the remote branches to the MPLS network (Option D). This ensures that the remote branches always have a backup connection, addressing potential failures at the branch level while maintaining high availability for the data center access.","timestamp":"1733952960.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1325272","poster":"rockin"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nVote for B as well.
