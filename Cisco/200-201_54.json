The main difference between these two methods is how they identify potential threats.\n\nSignature-based detection involves using a predefined set of rules, or signatures, to identify known patterns of malicious activity. These signatures are often based on specific characteristics of a known threat, such as a particular virus or malware strain. When a signature-based system detects a pattern that matches one of these predefined rules, it generates an alert or takes some other action to prevent the attack.\n\nOn the other hand, behavior-based detection focuses on identifying abnormal behavior that may indicate an attack. Instead of using predefined rules or signatures, behavior-based systems analyze patterns of activity to identify anomalies that may be indicative of an attack. For example, a behavior-based system might flag an unusual amount of network traffic from a particular device or identify a user accessing a critical system outside of normal business hours.","poster":"drdecker100","timestamp":"1692298500.0","upvote_count":"8"},{"content":"B is correct. \nin D, it talks about known vulnerabilities, not known threats.","poster":"RoBery","comment_id":"1118225","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720584840.0"},{"poster":"itmonkey1","content":"I agree the answer is B because signature-based detection is only known threats.
