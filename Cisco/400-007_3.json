It is based on TLS, but adapted for use over UDP, which makes it suitable for unreliable networks.\n • DTLS supports NAT traversal and can handle the packet loss, reordering, and fragmentation typical of UDP-based communication over public Internet links.\n • This makes DTLS an excellent choice for securing SD-WAN traffic over broadband Internet links, especially when NAT gateways are involved."},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704383880.0","poster":"XalaGyan","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGuys please help me understand this question.\nKeywords are encryption + overlay protocol + SDWAN (no specific Cisco/Viptella hints) + unreliable underlay + nat.\n\nunreliable underlay = UDP in my head = Datagram \n\nNAT= TLS derivatives or IPSEC NAT-T\n\nOverlay , possible options are DTLS and IPSEC\n\nFor IPSEC i remember to have used encryption accelerator cards, meaning heavy cpu needed\n\nTLS i have never had any specific requirements and it worked, hence i assume that it is easier on the cpu and opt for TLS.\n\nFinal thought taking all above together is DTLS which is a supported Overlay, supports unreliable networks by the virtue of UDP and provides encryption.\n\nMy answer will be A / DTLS\n\nplease share your thoughts where i got wrong along the path. thank you","comment_id":"1113837"},{"poster":"Rim007","comment_id":"1022729","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1696211760.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIPSEC is the answer in my opinion, because viptella use IPSEC between vEdges."},{"poster":"namashivaya","content":"Selected Answer: C\nEdge to Edge communication IPSEC be it behind nat or without NAT \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/SDWAN/cisco-sdwan-design-guide.html#Components","timestamp":"1692317400.0","comment_id":"984068","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Horvoe","comment_id":"914858","timestamp":"1685901960.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis actually makes sense \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/security/ios-xe-17/security-book-xe/security-overview.html"},{"timestamp":"1685020260.0","poster":"bdp123","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI believe they are referring to protocol between any two edge devices - DTLS or TLS is used between edge device and SMART or vBOND devices and IPSEC is used between edge devices.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/security/ios-xe-17/security-book-xe/security-overview.html","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"906679"},{"timestamp":"1680364860.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOne of the primary challenges with IPsec is its compatibility with NAT (Network Address Translation).

Switch clustering: This provides a scalable and flexible approach by allowing multiple physical switches to act as a single logical switch. It simplifies management and redundancy, enhancing scalability and flexibility at the distribution layer, as the system can grow without significant changes to the architecture.\n\nD. Avoid stretching VLANs across switches: Stretched VLANs across multiple switches can lead to scalability issues and complexity in managing broadcast domains.
