The LDAPS protocol is used for secure communication with an LDAP directory using SSL/TLS encryption. When the network administrator has converted a Cisco FTD from using LDAP to LDAPS for VPN authentication, the LDAPS protocol must be allowed through the access control policy. This means that the firewall rule on the Cisco FTD must allow traffic on the LDAPS port (usually 636/tcp) from the VPN clients to the LDAPS server.\nOption D (DNS servers must be defined for name resolution) is not correct because although DNS is important for name resolution, it is not directly related to LDAPS authentication.","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"poster":"gwb","comment_id":"1176552","timestamp":"1726661640.0","content":"Remote VPN is NOT under ACP.
