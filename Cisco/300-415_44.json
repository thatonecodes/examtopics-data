These policies can include various aspects, such as application-aware firewall policies, Quality of Service (QoS) policies, VPN policies, security policies, and more.\n\nRoute Policy: Route policies are used to control the advertisement and acceptance of routes between different routing domains within the SD-WAN network. They help in controlling the flow of traffic and implementing traffic engineering decisions based on network conditions, link performance, and other criteria.\n\nThe other options (B. lists, C.
