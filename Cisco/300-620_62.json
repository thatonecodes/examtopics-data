A single data center might include multiple ACI fabrics; each data center might have its own APIC cluster and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches that are part of the fabric. To ensure that a switch is managed only by a single APIC cluster, each switch must be registered with that specific APIC cluster that manages the fabric.\n\nThe APIC discovers new switches that are directly connected to any switch it currently manages. Each APIC instance in the cluster first discovers only the leaf switch to which it is directly connected. After the leaf switch is registered with the APIC, the APIC discovers all spine switches that are directly connected to the leaf switch. As each spine switch is registered, that APIC discovers all the leaf switches that are connected to that spine switch.
