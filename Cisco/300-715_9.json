Ensure that this option is enabled in each PSN in a deployment.\n\n\nNote\n\nCisco ISE requires a Device Administration license to use the TACACS+ service on top of an existing Base or Mobility license. The Device Administration license is a perpetual license. If you are upgrading from an earlier release to Cisco ISE Release 2.0 and later, and want to enable the TACACS+ service, you must order the Device Administration license as a separate add-on license. The number of Device Administration licenses must be equal to the number of device administration nodes in a deployment.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/2-4/admin_guide/b_ISE_admin_guide_24/m_ise_tacacs_device_admin.html","comment_id":"1271639","timestamp":"1724498280.0","poster":"H3ll0310","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"910739","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nThe correct answers are Device Administration License and Device Admin Service.\n\nThe Device Administration License is required to enable the TACACS+ feature in Cisco ISE.
