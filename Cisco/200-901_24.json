Only first_loop function is called. There are no \"nested loops\".\n1) 'response' is the list of organizations\n2) 'info' calls the function 'first_loop' that filters only ACME organizations and returns all 'networks' of ACME.\n3) the last 'for' prints the IDs of those networks.\nSo, in my opinion, the result is a list of the IDs of networks of organizations ACME, in other words, \"B\".","comment_id":"591196","comments":[{"content":"The second_loop is called on the last line of first_loop in the return statement.

The IDs of the different loops are not collected together in one list and then printed - the code returns on the first match.\nIt might not even run, since the returned item from line 25 is then used in another loop in line 29. If this item is no collection, it will throw an error there. Even if its an collection, I doubt that every item in line 30 will then have a key \"id\".\n\nIf we take a look at the question again:\n\"The script must run over nested loops to collect organization and network information and uses the collected data for final collection. Which process is being automated by using the Python script?\"\n\nBy executing the script, we are gathering:\n- organization information (we need the ID of the ACME org for our next API call in line 12)\n- network information (we need the ID of the BLDG21 network for the API call in line 19)\nEven if we are not returning the IDs of ACME and BLDG21, we are still gathering it.
