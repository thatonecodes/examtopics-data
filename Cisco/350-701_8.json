It's available on all the ASAs (with the exception of the 5585) running FTD and the Firepower 2100 platform.\nFDM is limited in functionality, thats why its only for smaller deployments that only need a subset of features.

SNMP uses a pull model where the management system sends a request to the device to retrieve information. The device responds to the request with the requested data. This can result in a delay between when a change occurs and when the monitoring system is made aware of it.\n\nTelemetry, on the other hand, uses a push model where the device sends data to the management system in near real-time. This makes telemetry faster than SNMP and can reduce the time between when a change occurs and when the monitoring system is made aware of it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Telemetry uses a push method, which makes it faster than SNMP."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nPull model, such as SNMP, does not scale when what you want is near real-time data.","timestamp":"1692163440.0","comment_id":"810352","poster":"Zatingke"}],"timestamp":"2021-12-05 15:14:00","answer_ET":"C","question_text":"What is a benefit of using telemetry over SNMP to configure new routers for monitoring purposes?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/67184-exam-350-701-topic-1-question-134-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":647,"provider":"Cisco","isMCOnly":false,"id":327,"name":"350-701","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":8},"__N_SSP":true}
