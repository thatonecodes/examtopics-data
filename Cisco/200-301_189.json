Dynamic routing: Dynamic routing is a type of routing protocol that allows routers to dynamically exchange information about network topology changes. This capability enables routers to adapt to network changes automatically and select the most efficient path for data transmission. Dynamic routing ensures network scalability, as new routers or network segments can be added without manual intervention, and it also improves network reliability by automatically rerouting traffic in the event of a network outage."},{"comment_id":"848420","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nThe two WAN architecture options that help a business scalability and reliability for the network are:\n\nC. Dual-homed branches: Dual-homing involves connecting each branch office to two or more different WAN links, such as two different service providers, in order to provide redundancy and increase reliability. This architecture option enables the business to maintain network connectivity even if one of the WAN links fails. In addition, it can also provide better performance and scalability by balancing traffic across the multiple links.\n\nE. Dynamic routing: Dynamic routing protocols enable routers to dynamically exchange information about the network topology and find the best path for data to travel. This allows for faster convergence in case of network changes and improves network scalability by automatically adjusting to changes in the network.

For example, in firewalls, state information is built when the packets flow from a higher security domain to a lower security domain. The firewall will be an exit point from one security domain to the other. If the return path passes through another firewall, the packet will not be allowed to traverse the firewall from the lower to higher security domain because the firewall in the return path will not have any state information. The state information exists in the first firewall.\nRef: https://www.cisco.com/web/services/news/ts_newsletter/tech/chalktalk/archives/200903.html","timestamp":"1670639760.0","comment_id":"740641"},{"upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"poster":"TR3Y","comment_id":"893385","content":"Asynchronous routing is not *reliable* according to the keyword of the questions here.
