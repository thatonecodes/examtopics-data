In DMVPN Phase 3 implementation, the two NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol) functions that are specific to it are resolution reply and redirect. 1. Resolution reply: This function is used by the hub router to respond to NHRP resolution requests by providing the mapping information (such as the real IP address of the spoke router). 2. Redirect: This function is used by the hub router to inform the spoke router that a more optimal path to reach a destination is available through a different spoke router. The redirect message allows the spoke router to update its routing table and use the more efficient path.
