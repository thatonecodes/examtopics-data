The other peer is also configured in symmetric active mode in this way.\nNote: If the other peer is not specifically configured in this way, a symmetric passive association is activated upon arrival of a symmetric active message. Since an intruder can impersonate a symmetric active peer and inject false time values, symmetric mode should always be authenticated.\n\nBroadcast and/or Multicast Mode -\nBroadcast mode is intended for configurations involving one or a few servers and a potentially large client population. A broadcast server is configured using the broadcast command and a local subnet address. A broadcast client is configured using the broadcastclient command, allowing the broadcast client to respond to broadcast messages received on any interface.
