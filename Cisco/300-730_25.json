This feature might be useful for VPN traffic that enters an interface, but is then routed out the same interface. The VPN traffic might be unencrypted in this case, or it might be reencrypted for another VPN connection. For example, if you have a hub and spoke VPN network, where the security appliance is the hub, and remote VPN networks are spokes, for one spoke to communicate with another spoke, traffic must go into the security appliance and then out again to the other spoke.","comment_id":"812570"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1676686860,"exam_id":317,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99734-exam-300-730-topic-1-question-39-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":317,"isImplemented":true,"name":"300-730","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":186,"provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":25},"__N_SSP":true}
