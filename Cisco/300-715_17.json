This means that you can create a single policy set that contains all of your posture policies, and then use the authorization policy to specify which AD groups should be assigned to each posture policy.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1714440780.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"XBfoundX","comment_id":"1057323","content":"For me in this case is B, here they are saying that each AD group have to meet different condictions to be compliant.

This is a popular option for businesses that want to make it easy for guests to connect to the internet, and it can also help to improve security by reducing the number of passwords that guests have to remember.\n\nTo enable social media in the external identity sources, the engineer will need to add the social media providers that they want to allow guests to use.

This allows the device to enforce security policies based on the SGT. However, if the device is not acting as a SXP speaker, it can only accept connections from hosts that are assigned the same SGT as the device. This is because the device cannot learn about other SGTs without being a SXP speaker.\n\nThe VLAN trunk link supports a maximum of 8 VLANs because each VLAN requires a unique SGT.

This means that they can be unreliable in networks with a large number of devices or devices that are not connected to the same network segment.\n\nHTTP is not a client profiling method because it is not a standard protocol for collecting client information.
