If they want to reach something in another area, they have to use a default route to a level 1-2 router. If there are multiple level 1-2 routers, then IS-IS picks the closest level 1-2 router to exit the area. This sometimes causes sub-optimal routing.\n\nWe can deal with this by leaking prefixes from level 2 into level 1.\n\nA level 1-2 router has access to the local area and also knows all prefixes because of its level 2 database. We can redistribute one or more prefixes from level 2 into the local area so that level 1 routers can select the most optimal path in the network.","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nyep, A","comment_id":"752646","timestamp":"1703184000.0","poster":"emre076","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"695268","content":"Selected Answer: A\nroute leaking in Area2\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/integrated-intermediate-system-to-intermediate-system-is-is/13796-route-leak.html","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1697357040.0"},{"comment_id":"615691","poster":"zlimvos","timestamp":"1686641100.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI also agree with route leaking in area2","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1686210540.0","poster":"python_tamer","content":"Selected Answer: A\nYep, I think A is correct here.","comment_id":"613138"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"583236","poster":"rjamxy","content":"Yeah it does seems that A can be the correct answer here\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/integrated-intermediate-system-to-intermediate-system-is-is/13796-route-leak.html \n\n\"Packets destined for an address that is outside of the L1 area are routed to the closest L1/L2 router to be forwarded on to the destination area.
