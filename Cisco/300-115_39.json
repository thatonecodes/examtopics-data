You can\nconfigure multiple isolated VLANs in a private VLAN domain; all the traffic remains isolated within each one. Each isolated VLAN can have several isolated ports, and the traffic from each isolated port also remains completely separate.\nCommunity VLAN--A community VLAN is a secondary VLAN that carries upstream traffic from the community ports to the promiscuous port and to other host\nports in the same community. You can configure multiple community VLANs in a private VLAN domain. The ports within one community can communicate, but these ports cannot communicate with ports in any other community or isolated VLAN in the private VLAN.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/configuration/guide/cli/ CLIConfigurationGuide/PrivateVLANs.html","question_text":"Which private VLAN can have only one VLAN and be a secondary VLAN that carries unidirectional traffic upstream from the hosts toward the promiscuous ports and the gateway?","timestamp":"2020-01-06 13:08:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/11521-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-339-discussion/","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1578312480},{"id":"KBhbUPcJZHSqW67qemkl","question_text":"Which database is used to determine the validity of an ARP packet based on a valid IP-to-MAC address binding?","question_id":193,"exam_id":297,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18880400002.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18880400000.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18880400001.png"],"answer":"Explanation","choices":{"A":"DHCP snooping database","D":"static ARP database","C":"dynamic routing database","B":"dynamic ARP database"},"timestamp":"2019-07-20 16:16:00","topic":"5","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"Information About Dynamic ARP Inspection\nDAI is used to validate ARP requests and responses as follows:\nIntercepts all ARP requests and responses on untrusted ports.\n\nVerifies that a packet has a valid IP-to-MAC address binding before updating the ARP cache or forwarding the packet.\n\nDrops invalid ARP packets.\n\nDAI can determine the validity of an ARP packet based on valid IP-to-MAC address bindings stored in a DHCP snooping binding database.
