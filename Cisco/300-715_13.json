It further allows for a Pre-authentication ACL to be used that can be customized to permit or deny any specific traffic--during the pre-authentication status.

Remember that the goal of low-impact mode is to provide very limited network access to devices without authentication and then provide very specific access to those that have been authorized; this is the least\u0002 privilege security principle.\n\n2. Low-impact mode uses authentication open but adds security on top of the framework was built in monitor mode. It uses a PACL on the switch port to permit critical traffic of certain endpoints, such as thin clients, to function prior to an attempted authentication. After the authentication, the authorization should provide specific access, unlike monitor mode, which is the same before and after authentication.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"795145","timestamp":"1675257240.0","poster":"YmerG"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/97546-exam-300-715-topic-1-question-16-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1675257240,"timestamp":"2023-02-01 14:14:00","question_id":61,"answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"XqBrwVqSim5DSxtnvwPh","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1717647480.0","comment_id":"915882","upvote_count":"8","poster":"johndelorien","content":"Selected Answer: AD\njust based on the wording... one web based portal\nfor 802.1x you wouldn´t need a portal for employees\nMAC doesn´t make sense as Guest would have to register first - no mentioning of a self-reg portal\nonly way for one web portal to work for both would be Local Guest users and a Ldap connection for employees"},{"poster":"realmephisto","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1703170260.0","comment_id":"752445","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nWebbased is always MAB, not 802.1x. \nEmployee = ldap.
