If the bandwidth setting is not changed for these interfaces EIGRP assumes the default bandwidth on the link instead of the true bandwidth. If the link is slower, the router may not be able to converge, routing updates might become lost, or suboptimal path selection may result.

Hence, in NBMA network, the neighbors are not discovered automatically; they must be configured manually. There are two ways to simulate a broadcast model on an NBMA network:\n+ Define the network type as broadcast with the ip ospf network broadcast interface sub- command\n+ Configure the neighbor statements under router ospf mode (though configuring the neighbor statement on one end is sufficient to form adjacency, it is a good practice to have it configured on both the ends)\nBesides these two ways, another way for making OSPF work with Frame Relay is configuring the network as a Point-to-Point network (or Point-to-Multipoint, notice that OSPF treats Point-to-Multipoint network as a collective of point-to-point links).\nSome information about Point-to-Multipoint (or Point-to-Point) network:\nNote: Point-to-Multipoint networks do not maintain a DR/BDR relationship.","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"RouterD(config-router)#neighbor 10.255.255.253","answer":"RouterD(config-router)#neighbor 10.255.255.253"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":437,"provider":"Cisco","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"id":296,"name":"300-101","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false},"currentPage":64},"__N_SSP":true}
