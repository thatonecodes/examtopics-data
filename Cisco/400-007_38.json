The feasible successor provides an alternate path to reach the remote network without introducing loops.\n\nThe Reported Distance from a successor is lower than the local Feasible Distance: When a router receives advertisements from its neighbors, it compares the Reported Distance (advertised distance from the neighbor) to the local Feasible Distance (best path metric known so far). If the Reported Distance from a successor is lower than the local Feasible Distance, the router considers it as a feasible successor and maintains it as an alternate path.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"914058","timestamp":"1717468560.0","poster":"J_W"}],"choices":{"B":"A feasible successor must be present.","C":"The Reported Distance from a successor is lower than the local Feasible Distance.","E":"The feasibility condition does not need to be met.","D":"The Feasible Distance from a successor is lower than the local Reported Distance.","A":"The Reported Distance from a successor is higher than the local Feasible Distance."},"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-06-04 04:36:00","unix_timestamp":1685846160,"answer":"BC","question_text":"Which two conditions must be met for EIGRP to maintain an alternate loop-free path to a remote network?

Define a policy-based redirect to the applications.\n\nExplanation:\nPolicy-Based Redirect: This approach allows you to specify which traffic (in this case, traffic destined for specific SaaS applications) should be routed directly to the internet. By defining a policy that identifies these applications, the SD-WAN solution can handle the routing appropriately, ensuring that only the designated traffic bypasses the normal path.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1262237","poster":"crypto700","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think the answer should be B","timestamp":"1723066080.0"}],"answer":"B"},{"id":"A1mj5GC8ZxnYvsyXaYvh","question_id":188,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"AE","discussion":[{"poster":"LordAndy","comment_id":"1413950","timestamp":"1743394620.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nIdentify users and authenticate access to system components\nRestrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Devsin2000","timestamp":"1740700500.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA bad question: To me A D E seem correct answer, so toss the coin pick two.
