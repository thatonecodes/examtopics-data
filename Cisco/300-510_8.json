An engineer is troubleshooting an issue with this network and notices that prefixes from R3 are missing on the R1 rooting table. Due to repeated ASN, when the 10.0.0.0/8 prefix from R3 arrives at R1, BGP automatically rejects it. There is no prefix-list on R1 which blocks the traffic from R3. What should the engineer do to fix the problem so that BGP allows that prefix on R1?","answer_images":[],"exam_id":309,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/300-510/image93.png"],"answer_description":"","question_id":36,"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-12-14 18:57:00"},{"id":"pyqUDtbRMdx19k8DfN6i","exam_id":309,"unix_timestamp":1687435980,"question_id":37,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-06-22 14:13:00","question_text":"An engineer wants to map a multicast IP address to a multicast MAC.
