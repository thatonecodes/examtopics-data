Many TAC cases are opened due to an endpoint failing posture checks. The remedy for such cases is simply to update the ISE and AnyConnect compliance modules because the client is running a newer version of some antivirus software, and a new compliance module is required to detect that new version correctly.\n\nAlso look at ciscopress book page 642:\n■AnyConnect Configuration: These configurations are built per operating system\n(Windows and macOS) and control what AnyConnect modules should be provisioned\nthrough the CPP and what PROFILES should be leveraged per module.\n■ AnyConnect Posture Profile: This is the posture configuration for the SYSTEM SCAN MODULE, where you control all aspects of the posture module, but it is not called a\nconfiguration; rather, it is called a profile for alignment with the AnyConnect naming\nconvention in Cisco’s ASA.","poster":"faridh","timestamp":"1708873440.0","comment_id":"990084"},{"content":"I think the Answer B.\n\nThe HostScan package is a component of Cisco AnyConnect that can be used to check endpoints for compliance with network security policies. The package includes a number of pre-configured checks that can be used to verify that the endpoint is running the correct version of antivirus software, has the latest security patches installed, and meets other security requirements.\n\nTo use HostScan to check the antivirus version on endpoints, the administrator must configure Cisco ISE to push the HostScan package to the endpoints when they connect to the network. Once the HostScan package is installed on the endpoint, it can be used to check for the presence and version of the antivirus software installed on the endpoint.\n\nOption D, The Compliance Module in Cisco AnyConnect is used to enforce network security policies and check for compliance with regulatory requirements.","timestamp":"1693862280.0","comment_id":"829479","poster":"zsrite","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"833983","upvote_count":"2","content":"I think you are not right.

This central management ensures that an organization has a consistent posture policy that applies to all network access control methods: wired, wireless, and remote access VPNs (RA-VPNs).\n\nD is correct (CPP with ISE).","comment_id":"1153580","poster":"NikoTomas","timestamp":"1724008800.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1716513000.0","comment_id":"1078998","content":"Answer is D","poster":"XBfoundX"}],"comment_id":"1078997","content":"As denverfly have explained:\n\nWhen you configure posture you need to configure in the resources tab the anyconnect configuration which means download the right compliance module and the anyconnect version that is going to be deployed, you can also set some parameters of the anyconnect profile that the client will use.\n\nAfter that we create the Client Provisioning Policy, with this policy you decided based on specific conditions what type of agent you are going to deploy for the clients (also anyconnect).","timestamp":"1716513000.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"XBfoundX"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI believe the provided answer is correct.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704474660.0","poster":"CCNP21","comment_id":"943874"},{"poster":"denverfly","comment_id":"915122","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is - Create a Cisco AnyConnect configuration and Client Provisioning policy within Cisco ISE.\n\nTo configure the compliance module to automatically download and install on endpoints, you must create a Cisco AnyConnect configuration and Client Provisioning policy within Cisco ISE.
