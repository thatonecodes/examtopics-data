When a leaf switch needs to forward traffic to an endpoint that is not locally connected, it queries the spine's COOP database to retrieve the necessary information about the remote endpoint.","poster":"prospio971"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nA bounce entry is basically a remote endpoint created by COOP communication instead of data-plane learning.","timestamp":"1739104620.0","comment_id":"1353893","upvote_count":"1","poster":"samfab"}],"exam_id":312,"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"C":"local","A":"remote","B":"on-peer","D":"bounce entry"},"unix_timestamp":1739104620,"timestamp":"2025-02-09 13:37:00","answer":"D"},{"id":"gGAEWNQTlRYE3BMeWPeI","choices":{"C":"unicast routing","D":"subnet scope","A":"L2 unknown unicast: flood","B":"GARP based detection"},"question_id":232,"exam_id":312,"timestamp":"2022-02-07 20:06:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/71154-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-31-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"What must be enabled in the bridge domain to have the endpoint table learn the IP addresses of endpoints?","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1644260760,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://hsvglobalschool.in/dhkycw/cisco-aci-bridge-domain.html","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1312871","poster":"designated","timestamp":"1731719520.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIP = Unicast Routing"},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: C\nUnicast Routing is correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715026320.0","comment_id":"1207562"},{"content":"C.
