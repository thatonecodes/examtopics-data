The reason for this is that connection tracking can not work properly without defragmenting packets, and hence defragmenting has been incorporated into conntrack and is carried out automatically. It can not be turned off, except by turning off connection tracking. Defragmentation is always carried out if connection tracking is turned on.\nReference:\nhttp://www.iptables.info/en/connection-state.html","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1666911060,"timestamp":"2022-10-28 00:51:00","question_text":"Which two statements about stateless firewalls are true?

Because this event action is severe, administrators are advised to use this only when the probability of false alarms or spoofing is minimal.\nDeny attacker service pair inline: This action prevents communication between the attacker IP address and the protected network on the port in which the event was detected. However, the attacker would be able to communicate on another port that has hosts on the protected network. This event action works well for worms that attack many hosts on the same service port. If an attack occurred on the same host but on another port, this communication would be allowed. This event action is appropriate when the likelihood of a false alarm or spoofing is minimal.\nDeny attacker victim pair inline: This action prevents the attacker from communicating with the victim on any port. However, the attacker could communicate with other hosts, making this action better suited for exploits that target a specific host. This event action is appropriate when the likelihood of a false alarm or spoofing is minimal.\nDeny connection inline: This action prevents further communication for the specific TCP flow. This action is appropriate when there is the potential for a false alarm or spoofing and when an administrator wants to prevent the action but not deny further communication.\nDeny packet inline: This action prevents the specific offending packet from reaching its intended destination. Other communication between the attacker and victim or victim network may still exist. This action is appropriate when there is the potential for a false alarm or spoofing. Note that for this action, the default time has no effect.\nModify packet inline: This action enables the IPS device to modify the offending part of the packet. However, it forwards the modified packet to the destination.\nThis action is appropriate for packet normalization and other anomalies, such as TCP segmentation and IP fragmentation re-ordering.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ips-mitigation.html","question_text":"What three actions are limitations when running IPS in promiscuous mode?
