While doing Channel bonding you add noise. Besides, high wireless clients concentration demand needs to have a high SNR and to avoid Co-Channel interference. I quote: \"One of the hallmarks of a high-performing WLAN is channel reuse. This is the practice of deploying channels in such a manner that they limit the amount if CCI introduced into the environment. The best way to achieve this is by having as many channels to deploy as possible. While a 20MHz channel will not achieve the higher data rates that are advertised with 80MHz, clients can still reach acceptable speeds, allowing you to optimally use each bit of available airtime.\" https://www.ekahau.com/blog/channel-planning-best-practices-for-better-wi-fi/","comment_id":"480780","timestamp":"1637245500.0","poster":"Johnconnor2021","upvote_count":"7"},{"timestamp":"1633875420.0","poster":"mafiaz","comment_id":"460098","upvote_count":"7","content":"has to be B"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727164200.0","poster":"Farhad123","comment_id":"1288461","content":"B is the correct answer"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1706852460.0","comment_id":"1138138","poster":"Bandito","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB, obviously"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgreed with all other comments","poster":"RSC357","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1660928280.0","comment_id":"649052"},{"timestamp":"1655484900.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgreed with all other comments, definitely B.","poster":"atryo","comment_id":"617813"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"610853","timestamp":"1654217520.0","poster":"Ram0n_Aya1a","content":"For high wireless client concentration is not good idea to have channel bonding\n\nB is correct"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1633875420,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/63903-exam-300-425-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","choices":{"C":"2.4 GHz frequency band without channel bonding, to support 20 MHz channels","A":"5 GHz frequency band with channel bonding, to support 40 MHz channels","B":"5 GHz frequency band without channel bonding, to support 20 MHz channels","D":"5 GHz frequency band with channel bonding, to support 80 MHz channels"},"isMC":true,"answer":"B","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_id":171,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":306,"question_text":"An engineer is designing a new wireless network.
