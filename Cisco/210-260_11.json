(Choose three.)\nA. Reflexive access lists create a permanent ACE\nB. Reflexive access lists approximate session filtering using the established keyword\nC. Reflexive access lists can be attached to standard named IP ACLs\nD. Reflexive access lists support UDP sessions\nE. Reflexive access lists can be attached to extended named IP ACLs\nF. Reflexive access lists support TCP sessions\nHIDE ANSWERS\nCorrect Answer: DEF\nExplanation/Reference:\nReflexive access lists allow IP packets to be filtered based on upper-layer session information. You can use reflexive access lists to permit IP traffic for sessions originating from within your network but to deny IP traffic for sessions originating from outside your network. This is accomplished by reflexive filtering, a kind of session filtering.\nReflexive access lists can be defined with extended named IP access lists only. You cannot define reflexive access lists with numbered or standard named IP access lists or with other protocol access lists.\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_2/security/configuration/guide/fsecur_c/scfreflx.html","comment_id":"41881"},{"timestamp":"1575107280.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"25366","content":"Answer D, E, F","poster":"piccione17"}],"choices":{"A":"Reflexive access lists create a permanent ACE","B":"Reflexive access lists approximate session filtering using the established keyword","E":"Reflexive access lists can be attached to extended named IP ACLs","C":"Reflexive access lists can be attached to standard named IP ACLs","D":"Reflexive access lists support UDP sessions"},"answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/9380-exam-210-260-topic-2-question-334-discussion/","question_text":"Which statements about reflexive access lists are true?"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"name":"210-260","provider":"Cisco","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":294,"numberOfQuestions":134},"currentPage":11},"__N_SSP":true}
