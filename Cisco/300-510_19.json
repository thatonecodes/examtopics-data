No client-to-client must be disabled:\nThis option seems to suggest that the command in the configuration is correct, as it is disabling the client-to-client reflection. However, this is a double negative and may be misleading. If client-to-client reflection is not desired or causing issues, this command would be correct.\n\nBased on the command shown, it seems that client-to-client reflection has been intentionally disabled. If routers within the cluster are not receiving the desired prefixes, the likely issue might be with the iBGP mesh within the cluster. Therefore, the correct action would likely be:\n\nC. Clients in that cluster must have full mesh connectivity between iBGP peers.\n\nThis is because when client-to-client reflection is disabled, each router in the iBGP cluster needs to have a full mesh topology unless another mechanism (like additional route reflectors) is in place to ensure the exchange of routing information."}],"poster":"Storcaks","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA. Clients in that cluster must have full mesh connectivity between eBGP peers:\nThis option would mean that each eBGP router within an autonomous system should be directly connected to every other eBGP router in that system. This is not directly related to the client-to-client reflection command in the configuration, which pertains to iBGP peering.\n\nB. No client-to-client reflection must be enabled:\nThis would imply that the command in the configuration is incorrect and that client-to-client reflection should be enabled. Client-to-client reflection is a method used within an iBGP setup to allow route reflectors to send updates between their clients.\n\nC. Clients in that cluster must have full mesh connectivity between iBGP peers:\nThis option is typically the requirement for iBGP networks without route reflectors. Each router within the iBGP network must be connected to every other router. However, using route reflectors or confederations can circumvent the need for a full mesh.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1115201"}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"No client-to-client reflection must be enabled","C":"Clients in that cluster must have full mesh connectivity between iBGP peers","A":"Clients in that cluster must have full mesh connectivity between eBGP peers","D":"No client-to-client must be disabled"},"topic":"1","exam_id":309,"timestamp":"2024-01-06 14:41:00","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
