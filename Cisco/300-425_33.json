The Cisco AP1130 Series provides the same type of antenna design concept. For voice, a ceiling-mounted antenna is preferred over a wall-mounted patch because the human head and body attenuate 5 dB of the signal (see Figure 11-1). Most floors attenuate 7 dB of the signal.\nFor phones that have the antenna inside the body of the phone, the way the phone is held in the human hand can influence signal attenuation by 4 dB. In some cases, a phone held against the head with the hand covering the antenna can result in a signal drop of 9 dB. The general rule for indoor deployments is that every 9 dB of signal loss reduces the coverage area in half. Figure 11-1 shows an example of the difference in radiating power from a handset when held to the head.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/Voice.html","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"978103"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCisco ENWLSD Book.
