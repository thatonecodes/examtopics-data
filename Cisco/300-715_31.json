Enable SNMP with read and write access on the Cisco WLC. This is because the Wireless Block List Default rule uses the ANC (Adaptive Network Control) action of QUARANTINE, which requires SNMP communication between the ISE and the WLC to apply the ACL named BLACKHOLE to the wireless device. If SNMP is not enabled or configured correctly on the WLC, the ISE will not be able to send the CoA (Change of Authorization) request to the WLC and the wireless device will not be blocked.\n\nThe other options are not correct. Option A is not relevant because URL redirection is not used for the Wireless Block List Default rule. Option C is not necessary because the ACL named BLACKHOLE is automatically created on the WLC when the ANC service is enabled on the ISE.

All Cisco switches and wireless controllers embedded with Cisco TrustSec technology support the assignment of SGTs. An SGT can be assigned dynamically or statically. Dynamic classification occurs via an authentication sequence, via 802.1x, MAB, or web \nauthentication. When authentication isn’t available, static classification methods are necessary. In static classification the tag maps to some thing (an IP, subnet, VLAN, or interface) rather than relying on an authorization from the Cisco ISE. This process of assigning the SGT is defined as “classification.” These classifications are then transported deeper into the network for policy enforcement.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/borderless networks/trustsec/C07-730151-00_overview_of_trustSec_og.pdf"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ed81044","comment_id":"1268151","timestamp":"1723997220.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nClassification is the mapping of an IP address to a SGT. This IP-to-SGT mapping can be accomplished either dynamically or statically. Dynamic classification is enabled by ISE context-awareness: the “who, what, how, where, and when” particulars of a given user session. Server connections are usually statically classified, based on a server’s expected usage and the security needs. Options for static classification include the mapping of an IP address, VLAN, subnet, or port to a SGT."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"THEODORABLE","timestamp":"1684333980.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nA& B are correct","comment_id":"900252"},{"comment_id":"718483","timestamp":"1668483960.0","content":"The process of assigning the SGT is called Classification.
