The core layer is responsible for forwarding large amounts of packets both reliably and quickly. The distribution layer, on the other hand, manages connectivity between the core and access layers, based on policies and boundaries worked into the network. Therefore, the correct answer is **C.

This dedicated connection is typically established by a service provider and provides a direct link between the two devices, with no intermediary network devices in between. This topology is often used to connect remote sites or branch offices to a central office or data center, and can be used for various WAN technologies such as T1/E1 lines, leased lines, or MPLS circuits.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a point-to-point topology only provides a direct connection between the two devices at each end of the link, not between each router in the topology.\n\nOption C is incorrect because point-to-point topologies typically do not provide redundancy between sites, as there is only one dedicated line or circuit connecting the two devices.\n\nOption D is incorrect because point-to-point topologies require two routers or devices, one at each end of the dedicated line or circuit, to route traffic between the sites.","poster":"Simon_1103","timestamp":"1682453040.0"},{"timestamp":"1711816260.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA & E are correct","comment_id":"1186190"},{"comment_id":"1178321","timestamp":"1710942300.0","content":"B is full mesh, D is hub and spoke","poster":"kalitwol","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"AbdullahMohammad251","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704935040.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nB is full-mesh\nC Dual-homed \nD is hub and spoke\nhttps://ipcisco.com/wan-topology-types/","comment_id":"1119216"},{"poster":"ZK23","comment_id":"1075984","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1702166880.0","comment_id":"1092179","poster":"[Removed]","content":"At this point they should really be paying the people who give detailed explanations and sources for the actual answers.\n\nFortunately I know most of the answers and I'm not concerned about passing, but for things I've forgotten or weren't covered the discussion section is doing 100% of the work."}],"timestamp":"1700534280.0","content":"Seriously, I paid for this.
