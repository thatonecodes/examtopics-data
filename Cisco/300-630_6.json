When a packet is sent from one leaf to another leaf, Cisco ACI encapsulates the original packet with an outer header representing the source and destination leaf Tunnel Endpoint (TEP) and the Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) header, which contains the bridge domain or VRF information of the original packet.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739989.html","timestamp":"1730829060.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_id":26,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739989.html","choices":{"C":"bridge domain","D":"EPG","B":"application profile","A":"VRF"}},{"id":"gGnyEqqrkHM1ebidql0M","topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which action reduces the impact on workload when migrating from the existing Cisco NX-OS VXLAN network infrastructure to the Cisco ACI fabric?","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Disable bridge domain unicast routing while a default gateway is in VXLAN infrastructure","C":"Use ACI spines for the Cisco ACI and VXLAN fabrics","B":"Set the default gateway in the Cisco ACI and VXLAN fabrics","D":"Configure vPC between the standalone Nexus and the Cisco ACI leaf"},"unix_timestamp":1631790600,"isMC":true,"question_id":27,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/62179-exam-300-630-topic-1-question-15-discussion/","exam_id":313,"timestamp":"2021-09-16 13:10:00","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"445871","upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1647436200.0","content":"I think A","poster":"apot"},{"comment_id":"1195568","upvote_count":"2","poster":"kamkol","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
