It uses a data encoding format called XML (eXtensible Markup Language) or JSON, and it allows for the retrieval and manipulation of the configuration of a device in a programmatic way. The NETCONF protocol can be accessed via a secure transport such as SSH or TLS, and it can be used in conjunction with YANG data models to define the structure and content of configuration data.\n\nCisco CSR 1000V supports NETCONF as well as other management protocols like REST API and SNMP.","comment_id":"776671","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721046960.0","poster":"r0m"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2023-01-04 12:02:00","unix_timestamp":1672830120},{"id":"LfkGToVc9lPKwtGvRuVX","choices":{"A":"ensures that developers are limited to using one data schema type","C":"improves security in RESTful web services","B":"prevents multivendor interoperability","D":"enforces standardized data structures","E":"leverages code that is easily managed and reused"},"discussion":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1688461680.0","content":"Implementing common data structures when working with APIs in remote systems has several benefits. One benefit is that it enforces standardized data structures, which helps to ensure that data is consistently organized and easy to parse. This can make it easier for developers to work with the API and understand the data being returned.\n\nAnother benefit of using common data structures is that it leverages code that is easily managed and reused. This can save time and resources, as developers do not have to spend as much time writing and debugging code. It can also improve the overall quality and reliability of the API, as the code is more likely to have been thoroughly tested and debugged.","upvote_count":"10","poster":"mellohello","comment_id":"765525"}],"content":"Selected Answer: DE\nI think it should be D and E","poster":"mellohello","upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"765524","timestamp":"1688461560.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: DE\ni think D and E","poster":"intheshadows00","timestamp":"1718804880.0","comment_id":"1100769"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"812303","content":"Selected Answer: DE\ndoesnt prevent multivendor interoperability.
