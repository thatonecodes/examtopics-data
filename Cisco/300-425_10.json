Applying Wireless Design Requirements\nAs you perform a survey, try to keep the AP power reduced to half that of the maximum transmit power you expect to find in any client. This will provide a margin or buffer that you can leverage if you need to adjust any AP transmit power levels, while staying within the capabilities of most client devices.\n \nthe recommendation is to keep the AP power reduced to half of the maximum transmit power expected for client devices. This approach helps in providing flexibility for power adjustments and avoids interference, while ensuring compatibility with most client devices.\nAssuming typical client device transmit powers (such as 20–30 mW), a power level around 10 mW (option A) would be appropriate, as it represents half of a typical client’s maximum transmit power and provides a suitable margin to manage interference and maintain location accuracy.\nCorrect answer: A. 10 mW"},{"timestamp":"1729887960.0","poster":"Jonycici","content":"No idea why cisco asks this kind of questions.
