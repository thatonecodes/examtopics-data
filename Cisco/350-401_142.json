In an OSPF area which has multiple transit links between hosts and actual communication is between the hosts. There is no need to advertise the transit link LSAs to all the routers. You can only advertise the LSAs related to end hosts. By default, OSPF advertises all the LSAs that include the transit link LSAs.\n\nOSPF prefix-suppression feature helps to overcome this behavior and reduces the number of Type 1(router) and Type 2(network) LSAs advertised.\n\nThis feature can be enabled globally on a router or on per interfaces basis.\n\nOSPF prefix-suppression helps in faster Shortest Path First (SPF) calculation due to less number of prefixes in the database (DB).
