In this case all different networks are in different major networks so EIGRP will perform auto-summarization when it exits an interface. But R1 has been configured with no auto-summary command so EIGRP will not summarize on S0 interface of R1. So the routing table of R2 will have the network 10.10.10.0/24 (not be summarized).\nWhen exiting S1 interface of R2, EIGRP summarizes network 172.16.10.0/24 into the major 172.16.0.0/16 network but it does not summarize network\n10.10.10.0/24 because it is not directly connected with this network. Therefore in the routing table of R3 there will have:\n+ Network 10.10.10.0/24 ( not summarized)\n+ Network 172.16.0.0/16 (summarized)\n-> C and D are correct.\nNote: I simulated this question on GNS3, you can see the final outputs of the show ip route commands on these routers (I connected these routers via\nFastEthernet, not Serial interfaces so the outputs are slightly different but the main points are not changed).","answer":"F. 172.16.10.0/24","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.

EIGRP has been configured on routers R1 and R2. However, R1 does not show R2 as a neighbor and does not accept routing updates from\nR2. What could be the cause of the problem?\n//IMG//","answer_description":"Explanation -\nEIGRP updates always use the primary IP address of the outgoing interface as the source address. In this case R2 will use the 10.1.2.2/24 address, which is not in the same subnet of R1, to send EIGRP update to R1. Therefore R1 does not accept this update and generates the not on common subnet error message.\nAnswer D is a bit unclear. It should state that EIGRP cannot form neighbor relationship and exchange routing updates if the two primary addresses on two routers are not in the same subnet.\nNotice that although R1 does not accept R2 as its EIGRP neighbors but R2 accepts R1 as its EIGRP neighbor accepts R1 hello packets..\nFor more information about this problem, please read\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_configuration_example09186a008009 3f09.shtml.","question_id":394,"answer_ET":"D. EIGRP cannot form neighbor relationship and exchange routing updates with a secondary address."},{"id":"rk0qk6BNKJqwyxXWRJ47","answer_description":"Explanation -\nWhen the link between R1 and R2 is down, R2 loses its successor for the network 10.1.1.0/24. R2 checks its topology table for a feasible successor but it can`t find one. So R2 goes active on the that route to find a new successor by sending queries out to its neighbors (R3 and R5) requesting a path to the lost route. Both\nR3 and R5 also go active for the that route. But R5 doesn`t have any neighbor to ask besides R2 so it will send an unreachable message to indicate it has no alternative path for that route and has no other neighbor to query. R3 also checks its EIRGP topology table for a feasible successor but it has none, too. Unlike R5,\nR3 has a neighbor (R4) so it continues to query this router.\nNow suppose there is a problem on the link between R3 and R4 so R4 never receives the query from R3 and of course, R3 also never receives a reply back from\nR4. Therefore, R3 can`t reply back to R2.
