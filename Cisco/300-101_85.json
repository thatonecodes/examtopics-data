OSPF neighbor statements are not necessary.","answer_description":"In an OSPF Point-to-Multipoint environment, DB/BDR elections do not take place. The neighbor command became somewhat obsolete with the introduction of the capability to configure other network modes for the interface, regardless of the underlying physical topology.\nReference: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Cisco Press) page 130 and 181 Point-to-Multipoint Network:\nPoint-to-multipoint is a single interface that connects to multiple destinations. The underlying network treats the network as a series of point-to-point circuits. It replicates LSA packets for each circuit. OSPF traffic is sent as multicast. There is no DR or BDR election. This technology uses one IP subnet for all endpoints on the network.\nBy default, the network is considered to be a series of point-to-point interfaces. There is no need to specify neighbors, because the neighbors will see each other and simply become adjacent, with no need for the election of a DR or a BDR. Point-to-multipoint does not try to reduce adjacencies using a DR. Instead, it accepts the extra overhead of having a full set of adjacencies for the sake of stability. Point-to-multipoint forms an adjacency automatically along any PVC, which causes more overhead but is more resilient than NBMA.","topic":"2","question_text":"Given the following partial configuration for Router A:\ninterface serial 0\nip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0\nencapsulation frame-relay\nip ospf network point-to-multipoint\nrouter ospf 7\nnetwork 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0\nWhich two statements are correct?
