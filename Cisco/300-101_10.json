The simplest technique to limit queue size is known as tail drop. The queue is allowed to fill to its maximum size, and then any new packets are simply discarded, until there is space in the queue again.\nThis causes problems when used on TCP/IP routers handling multiple TCP streams, especially when bursty traffic is present. While the network is stable, the queue is constantly full, and there are no problems except that the full queue results in high latency. However, the introduction of a sudden burst of traffic may cause large numbers of established, steady streams to lose packets simultaneously.\nReference:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_global_synchronization","question_id":46,"question_text":"A network engineer notices that transmission rates of senders of TCP traffic sharply increase and decrease simultaneously during periods of congestion.

So, we need to find the network address and wildcard mask of 192.168.16.5/30 in order to configure the OSPF.\n\nIP Address: 192.168.16.5 /30 -\n\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.252 -\nHere subtract 252 from 2565, 256-252 = 4, hence the subnets will increment by 4.\nFirst, find the 4thoctet of the Network Address:\n\nThe 4thoctet of IP address (192.168.16.5) belongs to subnet 1 (4 to 7).\n\nNetwork Address: 192.168.16.4 -\n\nBroadcast Address: 192.168.16.7 -\nLet's find the wildcard mask of /30.\nSubnet Mask: (Network Bits \"\" 1's, Host Bits \"\" 0's)\nLet's find the wildcard mask of /30:\n\nNow we configure OSPF using process ID 10 (note the process ID may change to something else in real exam).\n\nSeattle>enable -\nPassword:\n\nSeattle#conf t -\n\nSeattle(config)#router ospf 10 -\nSeattle(config-router)#network 192.168.16.4 0.0.0.3 area 21\nOne of the tasks states that area 21 should not receive any external or inter-area routes (except the default route).\nSeattle(config-router)#area 21 stub\n\nSeattle(config-router)#end -\n\nSeattle#copy run start -\nChicago Configuration:\n\nChicago>enable -\n\nPassword: cisco -\n\nChicago#conf t -\n\nChicago(config)#router ospf10 -\nWe need to add Chicago's S0/1 interface to Area 21\nChicago(config-router)#network 192.168.16.4 0.0.0.3 area 21\nAgain, area 21 should not receive any external or inter-area routes (except the default route).\nIn order to accomplish this, we must stop LSA Type 5 if we don't want to send external routes.
