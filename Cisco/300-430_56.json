It enables you to apply VLAN tagging, Quality of Service (QoS), and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to individual clients based on the returned RADIUS attributes from the AAA server.\n\nAAA Override for IPv6 ACLs\n\nIn order to support centralized access control through a centralized AAA server such as the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) or ACS, the IPv6 ACL can be provisioned on a per-client basis using AAA Override attributes. In order to use this feature, the IPv6 ACL must be configured on the controller and the WLAN must be configured with the AAA Override feature enabled. The actual named AAA attribute for an IPv6 ACL is Airespace-IPv6-ACL-Name, which is similar to the Airespace-ACL-Name attribute that is used for provisioning an IPv4-based ACL. The AAA attribute returned contents should be a string equal to the name of the IPv6 ACL as configured on the controller.","timestamp":"1733183940.0","upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"373072"},{"comment_id":"1357364","timestamp":"1739736060.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nIPv6 ACL:\n\nISE can dynamically assign an IPv6 Access Control List (ACL) to a client based on its identity or role. This allows for granular control over the traffic that the client is allowed to send or receive.\n\nDSCP Value:\n\nISE can assign a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value to the client's traffic. This allows for prioritization or marking of the client's traffic based on its identity or role, which is useful for Quality of Service (QoS) policies.","poster":"rrahim","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","answer":"CD"},{"id":"E9PhX01Fkk7o0q3lApmH","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":307,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.

This ensures that users cannot access any network resources until they have passed the authentication process.\n\nBy configuring a preauthentication ACL, the engineer can enforce the company policy of denying access to all resources until the user is validated by the Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine).\n\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\nA. WPA2 passkey:\n\nA WPA2 passkey is used for securing the wireless network with a pre-shared key (PSK). It does not control access to resources before or after authentication.\n\nB. AAA override:\n\nAAA override is used to dynamically assign VLANs or other attributes based on the user's role or identity after authentication. It does not restrict access before authentication.\n\nC. CPU ACL:\n\nA CPU ACL is used to control traffic destined for the CPU of the wireless LAN controller (WLC). It is not used to restrict user access to network resources before authentication.","comment_id":"1357365","poster":"rrahim","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1739736180.0"},{"content":"I think only web auth supports preauth acls.

The IP address response is incorrect and can be ruled out because DHCP occurs after a 802.1x authentication when the client is in the run state (assuming no WebAuth). That leaves an invalid authentication policy on the authenticator which it could be if they didn't define the AAA settings properly. It could be an account lockout as the user will not be notified if it's locked. The final option is an invalid authentication policy on the authentication server. All three of these could be right but I would choose the user account is locked because it says you are troubleshooting a user specific issue. The misconfigured authenticator or authentication server would have widespread problems affecting multiple users wheras the individual user account being locked would explain a user specific problem."},{"timestamp":"1634574120.0","comment_id":"202172","upvote_count":"9","poster":"Sorvahr","content":"Wrong, correct answer is A"},{"poster":"claudio392","timestamp":"1742914260.0","comment_id":"1410079","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI suppose this answer"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe issue is likely caused by the user's Active Directory (AD) account being locked out after multiple failed authentication attempts. When a user enters incorrect credentials multiple times, many organizations have policies in place to lock the account temporarily or until an administrator unlocks it. This prevents unauthorized access but can also cause legitimate users to be locked out if they mistype their credentials.","poster":"rrahim","comment_id":"1360287","timestamp":"1740261720.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"kthekillerc","comment_id":"474401","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1667928000.0","content":"Provided answer is correct","comments":[{"content":"No, there indicate that \"the authenticator\", that mean the WLC, but the policy are configured in ISE or authentication server.
