As such, it doesn’t establish a “handshake” connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. Still, when combined with IP, the UDP/IP suite enables communication between two devices over a network.\n...\nFrom a technical standpoint, UDP is “unreliable” for several reasons, but mostly because it doesn’t guarantee packet delivery. Instead, it sends data without confirming if it arrived at the destination. This makes it fast, but imperfect.\n\nIn practice, UDP is suitable for applications that require low latency and can tolerate some degree of packet loss. It’s most commonly used for VoIP calls, live audio or video streaming, and online gaming.
