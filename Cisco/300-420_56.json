Instead, the ingress router forwards multicast streams to a vEdge router that is designated to be a replicator, and it is this router that forwards streams to multicast receivers. This design saves bandwidth and computational resources on the ingress router.","timestamp":"1700511420.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. multicast-replicator\n\nThe multicast-replicator feature is used to optimize WAN bandwidth of IGMP network traffic among WAN Edge routers in the same VPN.
