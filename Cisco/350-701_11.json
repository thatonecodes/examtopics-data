The source interface is important because it determines the IP address that is used as the NAS-IP-Address attribute in the RADIUS packet.\n\nIf the RADIUS server is configured to only accept requests that originate from a specific NAS IP address, then the switch must use that address as the source for its requests, or the authentication will fail. This is often the case in enterprise networks where strict access controls are in place.\n\nTherefore, the ip radius source-interface command is needed to ensure that the switch sends RADIUS requests from the correct IP address and that the RADIUS server will accept them. Without this command, the authentication may fail or be rejected by the RADIUS server.","poster":"loser4fun","comment_id":"842942","timestamp":"1710779280.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe RADIUS NAS-IP-Address Attribute Configurability feature allows you to configure an arbitrary IP address to be used as RADIUS attribute 4, NAS-IP-Address, without changing the source IP address in the IP header of the RADIUS packets. This feature may be used for situations in which service providers are using a cluster of small network access servers (NASs) to simulate a large NAS to improve scalability. This feature allows the NASs to behave as a single RADIUS client from the perspective of the RADIUS server. \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_2sb/12_2sba/feature/guide/sbsiara.html","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1730784360.0","poster":"Ko13","comment_id":"1062647"},{"timestamp":"1687591440.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"621491","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen the Radius policy is configured on the radius server, to prevent unauthorised devices from matching the policy, NAS IP can be specified within the policy.
