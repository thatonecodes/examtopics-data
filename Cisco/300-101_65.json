Therefore when using default reference bandwidth (100M) to calculate ospf, Gi and Fa interfaces could have the same cost (1). This problem can be fixed by configuring reference bandwidth to 1000M.\n\nThis is how to configure reference bandwidth to 1000Mbps:\n\nRouter(config)#router ospf 1 -\nRouter(config-router)#auto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000","timestamp":"2020-02-13 19:53:00"},{"id":"jvJhMrpLNtXuNYoRLEyM","answer":"E.
