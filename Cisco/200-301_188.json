Most ISPs will configure policing to drop all traffic above 10 Mbit so that you can’t get more bandwidth than what you are paying for. It’s also possible that they shape it down to 10 Mbit but shaping means they have to buffer data while policing means they can just throw it away. The 10 Mbit that we pay for is called the CIR (Commited Information Rate).\n\nPolicing would be the most logical answer, as ISP's usually don't take care of your traffic as you would within your own network.
