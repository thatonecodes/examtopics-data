A spine switch and a leaf switch can be added with redundant connections between them.\n\nIn a spine-and-leaf architecture, the network is organized into two layers: the spine layer and the leaf layer. The spine layer consists of one or more core switches, which are connected to each other and form the backbone of the network. The leaf layer consists of access switches, which are connected to the spine switches and provide connectivity to end devices.\n\nWhen additional access ports are required in a spine-and-leaf architecture, the network can be easily scaled by adding a new spine switch and a new leaf switch. The new spine switch is connected to the existing spine switches with redundant links, and the new leaf switch is connected to the new spine switch. This allows the network to accommodate more devices without disrupting the existing network.","comment_id":"744359","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1670956080.0"},{"timestamp":"1655896620.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"620376","poster":"SamuelSami","content":"A spine switch and a leaf switch can be added with redundant connections between them"},{"poster":"Jbcrggddfhh","content":"\"The leaf layer consists of access switches that connect to devices such as servers.\"\n\nMore leaf switches = more access switches = more access ports\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-7000-series-switches/white-paper-c11-737022.html","timestamp":"1651783920.0","comment_id":"597458","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"537293","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIs correct","timestamp":"1643652960.0","poster":"SollyMalwane"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1602901500.0","comment_id":"201292","poster":"chosenone","content":"When a new leaf switch is added it will have connection to every spine switch \nSo the option (C) is the correct answer"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Answer should be option A i think, if i make any mistakes pls correct me i'm a newbie :)","poster":"AgustD","timestamp":"1598433120.0","comment_id":"166575","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"I think you dont use lacp between spine and leaf but Im a newbie myself","poster":"Enycon","comment_id":"179105","comments":[{"poster":"pokemonmoon","timestamp":"1600268220.0","comment_id":"180404","upvote_count":"2","content":"OCG doesnt say anything about it"}],"timestamp":"1600064940.0"},{"comment_id":"597396","content":"The answer is C because you can only connect leaf switches to more spine switches.
