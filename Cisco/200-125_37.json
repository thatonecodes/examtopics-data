What is needed to allow communication between the VLANs?","timestamp":"2020-01-17 09:43:00","answer":"Explanation","answer_description":"Different VLANs can't communicate with each other, they can communicate with the help of Layer3 router. Hence, it is needed to connect a router to a switch, then make the sub-interface on the router to connect to the switch, establishing Trunking links to achieve communications of devices which belong to different VLANs.\nWhen using VLANs in networks that have multiple interconnected switches, you need to use VLAN trunking between the switches. With VLAN trunking, the switches tag each frame sent between switches so that the receiving switch knows to what VLAN the frame belongs. End user devices connect to switch ports that provide simple connectivity to a single VLAN each. The attached devices are unaware of any VLAN structure.\nBy default, only hosts that are members of the same VLAN can communicate. To change this and allow inter-VLAN communication, you need a router or a layer 3 switch. Here is the example of configuring the router for inter-vlan communication RouterA(config)#int f0/0.1\nRouterA(config-subif)#encapsulation ?\ndot1Q IEEE 802.1Q Virtual LAN\nRouterA(config-subif)#encapsulation dot1Q or isl VLAN ID RouterA(config-subif)# ip address x.x.x.x y.y.y.y","answer_ET":"Explanation","isMC":true,"exam_id":285,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Anjik","content":"Answer: A","comment_id":"40050","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1579250580.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/12217-exam-200-125-topic-2-question-42-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1579250580,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"a router with an IP address on the physical interface connected to the switch","C":"a switch with an access link that is configured between the switches","A":"a router with subinterfaces configured on the physical interface that is connected to the switch","D":"a switch with a trunk link that is configured between the switches A"},"topic":"2","question_id":185}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":209,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"id":285,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"200-125","provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":37},"__N_SSP":true}
