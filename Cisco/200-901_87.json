Node Distribution ( Correct - D)\n\n Edge computing distributes processing across multiple nodes rather than relying on a central server.\n This reduces latency, enhances fault tolerance, and improves resilience in case of network failures.\n Example: IoT devices processing sensor data locally instead of sending everything to the cloud.\n\n2. Complex Event Processing ( Correct - E)\n\n Edge computing enables real-time decision-making by processing multiple event streams locally.\n This helps in detecting patterns, analyzing large volumes of data, and reacting immediately.\n Example: A smart factory using edge AI to detect equipment failures before they cause downtime.","timestamp":"1738780380.0","comment_id":"1352028","poster":"daniii89","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"NN99","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nComplex event processing can be part of edge computing, but it’s not a primary benefit.

The payload contains the data for the module left-interfaces:interfaces, which defines two interfaces: GigabitEthernet1 and GigabitEthernet2. The two results of running the RESTCONF query are:\n\n• C. GigabitEthernet2 becomes shut down. The payload specifies the enabled state of the two interfaces as true and false respectively. This means that GigabitEthernet1 will be enabled and GigabitEthernet2 will be disabled on the server. Therefore, GigabitEthernet2 becomes shut down as a result of running the RESTCONF query.\n\n• D.
