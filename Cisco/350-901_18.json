It is based on Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), which is an open source binary serialization protocol. gRPC provides a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data, like XML, but is smaller and simpler to use. You define the structure using protocol buffer message types in .proto files. Each protocol buffer message is a small logical record of information, containing a series of name-value pairs.\nCisco gRPC IDL uses the protocol buffers interface definition language (IDL) to define service methods, and define parameters and return types as protocol buffer message types. The gRPC requests are encoded and sent to the router using JSON. Clients can invoke the RPC calls defined in the IDL to program the router.","comment_id":"172676","timestamp":"1646320080.0","poster":"blezzzo","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1645091160.0","content":"Agree with answers B.
