The user’s experience at the home office is exactly the same as it would be at the corporate office. Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) encryption between the access point and the controller ensures that all communications have the highest level of security.Cisco OEAPs are designed to work behind a router or other gateway device that is using network address translation (NAT). NAT allows a device, such as a router, to act as an agent between the Internet (public) and a personal network (private), enabling an entire group of computers to be represented by a single IP address. There is no limit to the number of Cisco OEAPs that you can deploy behind a NAT device.","comment_id":"438614","poster":"NightmareCreature"}],"exam_id":307,"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-09-03 18:08:00","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1630685280,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer":"D","question_id":261,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"FlexConnect mode with local authentication","A":"FlexConnect mode with central switching enabled","B":"FlexConnect mode with central authentication","C":"FlexConnect mode with OfficeExtend enabled"}},{"id":"XXqngH9KZs0SILDYHrw9","topic":"1","exam_id":307,"answer_description":"","answer":"","timestamp":"2021-06-05 14:46:00","answers_community":[],"isMC":false,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04306/0004400001.png"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1675386360.0","content":"correct answer should be:\nType = External\nState = Friendly\nCondition = set substring-ssid\n\nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/wireless/wildcard-or-regex-in-rogue-ap-rules/td-p/2620976","poster":"c9800","comments":[{"timestamp":"1690537500.0","poster":"Liselot","upvote_count":"11","content":"Thanks for the reference, c9800, but this reference shows:\n\nType: Friendly\nState: External\nCondition: set substring-ssid","comment_id":"638615"}],"upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"539281"},{"poster":"bombero","content":"https://mrncciew.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/rogue-ap-03.png","upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"409536","timestamp":"1658231520.0"},{"content":"Answer A. - SSID Wildcard—Requires that the rogue access point have a substring of the specific user-configured SSID.
