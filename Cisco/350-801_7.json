It may be used to provide further processing on that stream or as a method to ensure that the stream follows a specific path. If the signaling and media take different paths, a UDP pinhole is not opened. The solution might be a TRP. Subscribers in each data center can invoke TRPs that provide anchoring of the media and ensure that the media streams flow through the appropriate firewall. The TRP provides an IP address that enables a specific host route for media that can ensure the same routing path as the call signaling.\nImplementing Cisco IP Telephony and Video, Part 1 (CIPTV1) Foundation Learning Guide","comment_id":"1364734","poster":"G0y0","timestamp":"1741065000.0"},{"timestamp":"1729734240.0","comment_id":"1052412","content":"Answer is A\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/admin/12_0_1/systemConfig/cucm_b_system-configuration-guide-1201/cucm_b_system-configuration-guide-1201_chapter_0111011.html","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Riktov"}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"It enables Cisco UCM to insert an MTP or transcoder designated as a TRP.","C":"If TRP is allocated and MTP is also required for the endpoint, calls fail.","B":"It enables the Use Trusted Relay Point setting from the associated common device configuration.","D":"It creates a trust relationship with the called party."},"question_id":31,"question_text":"What is a characteristic of a SIP endpoint configured in Cisco UCM with \"Use Trusted Relay Point\" set to \"On\"?","unix_timestamp":1652372100,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/75528-exam-350-801-topic-1-question-127-discussion/","answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":328,"timestamp":"2022-05-12 18:15:00"},{"id":"15cJQuJrfcBLAdZWAknr","question_text":"A customer is deploying a SIP IOS gateway for a customer who requires that in-band DTMF relay is first priority and out-of-band DTMF relay is second priority.\nWhich IOS entry sets the required priority?","answer_ET":"A","choices":{"D":"dtmf-relay sip-kpml cisco-rtp","B":"dtmf-relay cisco-rtp","A":"dtmf-relay rtp-nte sip-notify","C":"sip-notify dtmf-relay rtp-nte"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":328,"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","poster":"MKZ","comment_id":"384833","comments":[{"content":"SIP GW doesn't support - cisco-rtp (H323 GW only)","poster":"MKZ","timestamp":"1718715420.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"384838"}],"timestamp":"1718715240.0","content":"In bound - rtp-nte\nOOB - sip-notify, sip-kpml, sip-info\n\nshould be A"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1624020840,"answer_description":"","question_id":32,"timestamp":"2021-06-18 14:54:00","topic":"1","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/55568-exam-350-801-topic-1-question-129-discussion/"},{"id":"vlIf12S1fObFYY4AeQw7","discussion":[{"poster":"Griswald","comment_id":"105312","timestamp":"1591628700.0","content":"DHCP Option 150 is Cisco proprietary.

MGCP is a master/slave protocol, where the Endpoint (Slave) is controlled by a Call Agent (Master) of some type. The entire control intelligence is controlled by a Master who instructs the endpoint what action to take once an event is detected. MGCP uses TCP port 2428 and UDP port 2427.\nTCP port 2428 in MGCP is used to open a new socket with the Call Agent to determine if the connection can be established. Without this new socket, subsequent MGCP Messages cannot be exchanged. It is also used to Send/Receive Backhaul Messages between PRI Endpoints and the Call Agent it is registered to. Finally, TCP port 2428 is used to failover to backup Call Agents in the event a Primary Call Agent is unresponsive.UDP Port 2427 in MGCP is used for MGCP Messages exchanged between the Endpoints and the Call Agents.\nBasic Flow","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1595956560.0"},{"comment_id":"1291696","content":"Prerequisites: For the configuration to work, the following prerequisites must be met.\n\nMGCP Gateway and the CUCM TFTP server must have IP connectivity between each other.
