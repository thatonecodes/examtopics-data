The decision is based on ensuring the best media quality and minimizing latency during a meeting.\n\nRound-trip delay is a key factor for the Webex App to determine the most optimal media path. If the delay to the local Video Mesh cluster is lower (more optimal) than the delay to the Webex cloud media services, the Webex App will route the media through the Video Mesh cluster to improve the call quality and reduce latency.","comment_id":"1330914"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-12-23 20:09:00","answer_description":"","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1734980940,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":78,"exam_id":321,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/153376-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-170-discussion/","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"StvUwVA39rSr3wLhxfuB","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect Answer:\nA.
