It reads a token from a local JSON file and posts the token to the DNAC URL.\n\nThe Python function in the exhibit appears to read a token from a local JSON file by calling the json.load() function and passing in the file name as an argument. Then it makes a POST request to a specific URL using the requests.post() function and passing in the URL, the token and headers as arguments. The script also sets verify=False in the post method which could indicate that it is skipping SSL/TLS verification.\n\nGiven the context of the question (DNAC) and the parameters passed to the post method, it can be inferred that the script is likely interacting with the Cisco DNA Center (DNAC) API and the token read from the local JSON file is an authentication token that the script is using to authenticate to the DNAC API."},{"timestamp":"1687613700.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"mellohello","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption A, \"It returns HTTP Basic Authentication,\" is incorrect.
