Once a system is compromised by malware such as a botnet, the C2 server acts as a central point of control for the attacker to send commands to the compromised systems. These commands could include downloading additional malware or executing specific commands on the compromised system, such as launching a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack or stealing sensitive information.\n\nEnumerating open ports on a network device is a network scanning technique that is not directly related to the function of a C2 server. Dropping secondary payloads into malware may be a function of a specific type of malware, but it is not a primary function of a C2 server. Regaining control of a network after a compromise is typically done through incident response procedures and is not a function of a C2 server.","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"812137","timestamp":"1708188840.0","poster":"drdecker100"},{"content":"B could be considered correct but in the attack kill chain the mallware is used to get access to the system.

It examines and potentially takes action on the traffic at wire speed.\nIn tap mode, a network tap is used to passively capture a copy of the traffic as it traverses the network. The tap is typically placed on a network link, and the monitoring device receives a duplicate copy of the traffic.\nSo, the key difference is that inline mode actively participates in the traffic path, while tap mode is a passive monitoring method that captures a copy of the traffic.","poster":"RoBery","comment_id":"1122216","timestamp":"1720918020.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"815762","timestamp":"1692554100.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"drdecker100","content":"Selected Answer: C\nInline mode and tap mode are two different methods of network traffic monitoring.\n\nInline mode involves inserting a monitoring device, such as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), directly into the network traffic path. The monitoring device actively inspects all traffic passing through it, typically at wire speed, and can take action to block or allow specific traffic based on security policies.\n\nIn contrast, tap mode involves using a network tap, which is a device that is inserted into the network without disrupting the normal flow of traffic. The tap makes a copy of the traffic and sends it to a monitoring device for analysis. This means that tap mode can capture traffic as it crosses the network, but at a potentially lower speed than inline mode.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as inline mode monitors traffic path, examining any traffic at a wire speed, while a tap mode monitors traffic as it crosses the network."},{"comment_id":"635213","timestamp":"1674399240.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ItsBananass","content":"I think the answer should be \"D\""}],"answer":"C","timestamp":"2022-07-22 14:54:00","unix_timestamp":1658494440,"question_text":"What is a difference between an inline and a tap mode traffic monitoring?","question_id":68,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Inline mode monitors traffic path, examining any traffic at a wire speed, while a tap mode monitors traffic as it crosses the network.","A":"Tap mode monitors packets and their content with the highest speed, while the inline mode draws a packet path for analysis.","B":"Inline monitors traffic without examining other devices, while a tap mode tags traffic and examines the data from monitoring devices.","D":"Tap mode monitors traffic direction, while inline mode keeps packet data as it passes through the monitoring devices."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/77670-exam-200-201-topic-1-question-160-discussion/"},{"id":"R6RjsUsEE7sr0xN2tErY","timestamp":"2022-10-07 12:45:00","answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/84585-exam-200-201-topic-1-question-161-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/three-way-handshake#:~:text=The%20TCP%20handshake,as%20shown%20in%20Figure%\n203.8","unix_timestamp":1665139500,"question_text":"An engineer is addressing a connectivity issue between two servers where the remote server is unable to establish a successful session.
