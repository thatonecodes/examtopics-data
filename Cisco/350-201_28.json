Default accounts are accounts that have pre-configured usernames and passwords that are often used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to systems. Since the application server for IP phones has access to both on-premises and cloud services, it is essential to ensure that default accounts are disabled or have their passwords changed. This is a common security practice to prevent unauthorized access and protect systems from attacks. Once this threat is mitigated, the organization can focus on aligning access control policies, protecting data from exfiltration during data transfer, and ensuring that data exposure from backups is minimized. - ChatGPT"}],"question_text":"An organization installed a new application server for IP phones.
