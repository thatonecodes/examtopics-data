RFC 1994 describes the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol ( CHAP ) which is the preferred way to perform PPP authentication, although the Password Authentication Protocol ( PAP ) is sometimes still used. Another option for authentication is the Extensible Authentication Protocol ( EAP ).\nCompression . Effectively increases the throughput of a PPP connection by compressing data in a frame. The best known PPP frame compression algorithms are Stacker and Predictor.\nError detection . Includes Quality-Protocol and helps identify feedback loops through Magic Numbers RFC 1661 .\nMultichannel . Multilink PPP (MLPPP, MPPP, MLP) provides methods for propagating traffic over multiple physical links with a single logical connection. This option allows you to expand bandwidth and provides load balancing.","comment_id":"902666"},{"comment_id":"596673","content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe PPP Session phase","poster":"M11156_","timestamp":"1651656780.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"5zT9pXp9ThraY78hwzzG","question_text":"How can you disable DTP on a switch port?","timestamp":"2020-02-04 20:22:00","answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Change the operational mode to static access","D":"Change the administrative mode to access","A":"Configure the switch port as a trunk.","B":"Add an interface on the switch to a channel group."},"question_images":[],"exam_id":285,"question_id":77,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1580844120,"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/13421-exam-200-125-topic-1-question-384-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1583328900.0","content":"No D is correct i think, Dynamic trunking protocol can't be used on a switchport in access mode","comment_id":"58741","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Searys"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1580844120.0","poster":"betocastroc","comment_id":"46638","content":"I think it´s A"}],"answer":"D"},{"id":"trkrlI8n3T0ZNdXrd0QF","discussion":[{"content":"The global unicast address","comment_id":"16423","poster":"RedByte","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1571663640.0"}],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":285,"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1571663640,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/6888-exam-200-125-topic-1-question-389-discussion/","question_id":78,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which Type of ipv6 unicast ip address is reachable across the Internet?","choices":{"C":"Link local","A":"Unique Local","B":"Compatible","D":"Globa"},"question_images":[],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2019-10-21 15:14:00"},{"id":"O0Y5A2kOWLMTCaJirXbX","answer":"BCD","topic":"1","choices":{"C":"A valid route to the destination address is missing from the routing table.","B":"The tunnel source interface is down.","F":"An ACL is blocking the outbound traffic.","A":"The tunnel interface IP address is misconfigured.","D":"The tunnel address is routed through the tunnel itself.","E":"The ISP is blocking the traffic."},"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1588843260,"exam_id":285,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"BCD","question_text":"Which three circumstances can cause a GRE tunnel to be in an up/down state?
