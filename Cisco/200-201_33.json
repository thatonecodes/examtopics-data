Overloading a predefined amount of memory\n\nA buffer overflow attack occurs when an attacker inputs more data into a software application's buffer (temporary storage) than it can handle, causing it to overflow and overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to the execution of malicious code or the manipulation of program behavior, potentially compromising the security and stability of the system. The other options do not accurately describe the nature of a buffer overflow attack.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728144000.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"SecurityGuy","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBuffer Overflow Attack\nA Buffer Overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer.\n\nhttps://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/buffer-overflow/","comment_id":"985968","timestamp":"1724177520.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/118550-exam-200-201-topic-1-question-245-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1692555120,"timestamp":"2023-08-20 20:12:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"exam_id":287,"answer":"C"},{"id":"On14Nus1Dm6cY9OsdzKM","answer":"D","question_id":162,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1125553","timestamp":"1721271720.0","content":"B\nTrusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) play a crucial role in establishing trust for digital certificates in a public-key infrastructure (PKI).

Trusted CAs are typically involved in broader scenarios where a third-party entity vouches for the authenticity of an entity's public key through the issuance of digital certificates.\nFor individual users exchanging public keys directly, a Web of Trust model is more applicable.
