This is similar to 802.1q standard for trunk ports on switches.\nCisco: Link aggregation (LAG) is a partial implementation of the 802.3ad port aggregation standard. It bundles all of the controller’s distribution system ports into a single 802.3ad port channel. This reduces the number of IP addresses required to configure the ports on your controller. When LAG is enabled, the system dynamically manages port redundancy and load balances access points transparently to the user.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config-guide/b_cg85/ports_and_interfaces.html","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1192522","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct\n\nAll WLCs support the aggregation of multiple distribution ports into a single port using the 802.3ad port standard.

It allows multiple VLANs to share a single physical connection and helps in separating broadcast domains in a network.\n\nWhen using multiple distribution system ports on a Cisco WLC with a single IP address, VLAN tagging (802.1Q) is typically employed to differentiate between different VLANs and maintain logical separation. Each VLAN can be associated with a specific distribution system port on the WLC.\n\nMake sure that the switches and other network devices in your infrastructure also support and are configured to handle 802.1Q VLAN tagging to ensure proper communication between the WLC and the rest of the network.","timestamp":"1708701540.0","comment_id":"1157261","poster":"squagmire"},{"content":"Guys, this is B: 802.1Q\n\nThe quesiton isn't very clear, but the point is that we can only use one IP address, so if we have several SSIDs, we have to tag the rest of the VLANs. \n\nFeel free to correct me.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"jeremykebir","comment_id":"1149558","timestamp":"1707856320.0"},{"comment_id":"1144465","poster":"ricky1802","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think A is the answer. \nB is incorrect because 802.1q is a standard for VLAN tagging.\n802.1d is for Spanning Tree Protocol.\n802.1af - I never heard fo this.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1707397620.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"a67c04a","comment_id":"1137866","timestamp":"1706816280.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt´s A for LAG"},{"poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1704543360.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTo get the most use out of each distribution system port, you can configure all of them to operate as a single logical group, much like an EtherChannel or port-channel on a switch. Controller distribution system ports can be configured as a link aggregation group (LAG) such that they are bundled together to act as one larger link. With a LAG configuration, traffic can be load-balanced across the individual ports that make up the LAG. In addition, LAG offers resiliency; if one individual port fails, traffic will be redirected to the remaining working ports instead.","comment_id":"1115163"},{"comment_id":"1108244","content":"A. 802.3ad\n\nWhen more than one distribution system port and only one IP address are configured for a Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), the 802.3ad standard, also known as Link Aggregation or EtherChannel, is typically used.\n\nEtherChannel allows multiple physical links to be bundled together into a single logical link, providing increased bandwidth and redundancy. In the context of a Cisco WLC, this can be used to aggregate multiple ports for increased capacity and reliability. The use of EtherChannel ensures that a single IP address can be assigned to the logical link, simplifying the management of the WLC.\n\nTherefore, option A (802.3ad) is the correct choice for this scenario.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"16BitRun","timestamp":"1703815200.0"},{"comment_id":"1106258","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is B. 802.1q.\n\n The 802.3ad (Link Aggregation Control Protocol or LACP) standard is used to group multiple physical interfaces into a single logical interface, known as an aggregation port. However, this standard is not used when there is more than one port of a distribution system and only one IP address configured on a Cisco WLC (Cisco Wireless LAN Controller).\n\n Instead, the standard needed in this scenario is 802.1q. This standard is used to support VLAN tags on an Ethernet switch. It allows a single physical port to support multiple VLANs and can therefore accommodate multiple distribution systems using only one IP address on the WLC.","poster":"AA4534","timestamp":"1703611800.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_text":"Which standard is required when more than one distribution system port and only one IP address are configured for a Cisco WLC?","choices":{"C":"802.1d","B":"802.1q","A":"802.3ad","D":"802.1af"},"question_id":276,"unix_timestamp":1703611800,"answers_community":["A (76%)","B (24%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/129414-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1246-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-12-26 18:30:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":288,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"iRtLYvnnBEaBS5V3b0pD","timestamp":"2023-12-29 02:58:00","choices":{"B":"provides authentication for data communications over a private data network","D":"provides secure file access within the LAN","A":"loads configuration files on systems without data storage devices","C":"provides encryption mechanisms for file transfer across a WAN"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1108241","upvote_count":"6","content":"A. loads configuration files on systems without data storage devices\n\nTFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a simple file transfer protocol that is often used to transfer configuration files or firmware to network devices, such as routers or switches, during the boot process.
