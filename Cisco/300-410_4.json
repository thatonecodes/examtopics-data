After the PE device learns the IP prefix, the PE converts it into a VPN-IPv4 prefix by combining it with an 8-byte route distinguisher (RD). The generated prefix is a member of the VPN-IPv4 address family. It uniquely identifies the customer address, even if the customer site is using globally nonunique (unregistered private) IP addresses.","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"640165","timestamp":"1659283140.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe given answer (D) is correct.","timestamp":"1722711180.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1260419","poster":"bf10690"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1249974","timestamp":"1721248500.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"content":"D is correct","timestamp":"1669111380.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Noproblem22","comment_id":"724236"},{"comment_id":"448650","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1632199680.0","poster":"error_909","content":"The given answer is correct D"},{"comment_id":"419142","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1627980900.0","content":"The given answer is correct","poster":"[Removed]"}],"exam_id":303,"answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"question_text":"What does the PE router convert the IPv4 prefix to within an MPLS VPN?","choices":{"D":"VPN-IPv4 prefix combined with the 64-bit route distinguisher","A":"eBGP path association between the PE and CE sessions","B":"prefix that combines the ASN, PE router-id, and IP prefix","C":"48-bit route combining the IP and PE router-id"},"timestamp":"2021-08-03 10:55:00","answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"Fd876LSIrTA3r0nDspuH","question_id":17,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04302/0014900001.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/48666-exam-300-410-topic-1-question-113-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"A":"interface Tunnel0 description mGRE - DMVPN Tunnel ip address 10.1.0.1 255.255.255.0 ip nhrp map multicast dynamic ip nhrp network-id 1 tunnel source 172.17.0.1 ip nhrp map 10.0.0.11 172.17.0.2 ip nhrp map 10.0.0.12 172.17.0.3 tunnel mode gre","D":"interface Tunnel0 description mGRE - DMVPN Tunnel ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 ip nhrp map multicast dynamic ip nhrp network-id 1 tunnel source 10.0.0.1 tunnel destination 172.17.0.2 tunnel mode gre multipoint","B":"interface Tunnel0 description mGRE - DMVPN Tunnel ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 ip nhrp map multicast dynamic ip nhrp network-id 1 tunnel source 10.0.0.1 tunnel mode gre multipoint","C":"interface Tunnel0 description mGRE - DMVPN Tunnel ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 ip nhrp network-id 1 tunnel source 172.17.0.1 tunnel mode gre multipoint"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-04-01 17:39:00","unix_timestamp":1617291540,"isMC":true,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
