Use VTP to propagate VLAN information and to prune unused VLANs.\n\nTo achieve the stated goals of reducing the impact of topology changes, reducing the time spent on network administration, and reducing manual configuration errors, the architect should implement the following solutions:\n\nA. Implement Rapid PVST+ (Per VLAN Spanning Tree Plus) instead of STP (Spanning Tree Protocol). Rapid PVST+ is based on the IEEE 802.1w standard (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol) and converges faster than the traditional 802.1d STP. This will help to reduce the impact of topology changes.\n\nC. Use VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) to propagate VLAN information and to prune unused VLANs. VTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that simplifies VLAN administration across multiple switches by automatically distributing VLAN configuration information. This reduces the time spent on network administration and the potential for manual configuration errors.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1698511380.0","comment_id":"883744","poster":"SpicyMochi"},{"comment_id":"846859","timestamp":"1695366960.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"DOSKIM","content":"environement may include non cisco switch so in this case i will go wtih MST and VTP as PVST+ is cisco proprietary.\nMST is standard."},{"poster":"Noproblem22","content":"AC is the best answer.
