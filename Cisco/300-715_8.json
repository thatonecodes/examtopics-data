This URL will specify the location of the agent that will be downloaded and installed on the client machine.\n\nOnce the URL is added to the authorization policy, the network administrator must assign it to the appropriate endpoints. This can be done manually or through a dynamic assignment rule.\n\nWhen an endpoint connects to the network, Cisco ISE will check the endpoint's authorization status. If the endpoint is not authorized, Cisco ISE will redirect the endpoint to the client provisioning URL. The endpoint will then download and install the agent, which will present the user with a pop-up window.","poster":"denverfly"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt is mandatory to include the client provisioning URL in authorization policy to enable the agent to popup in the client machines.
