(Choose all that apply.)","answer_description":"Support for automatic load balancing and support for multiple gateways are two features that are provided by Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) but not by\nHot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).\nGLBP, HSRP, and VRRP provide a redundant and fault-tolerant solution in case of first-hop router failure in a network. The basic operation of these three protocols is the same. In all three protocols, a group of routers on the same LAN is formed. One of the routers is selected as the active router and another as the standby router. The router with the highest priority is automatically selected as the active router. If the active router fails, the standby router assumes the responsibilities of the active router. The role of the active router is to forward the packets from the hosts to the virtual router (default gateway).\nGLBP provides automatic load balancing between multiple routers by configuring multiple MAC addresses but a single virtual IP address. Every active virtual forwarder (AVF) in the group is configured with the virtual IP address but with different MAC addresses. All such AVFs can then participate in the packet- forwarding process. Multiple gateways then can share the load. On the contrary, HSRP and VRRP do not support automatic load balancing. Both these protocols require additional configuration on all the routers that need to load balance. The additional configuration involves using multiple groups on the routers or assignment of different default gateways for the hosts.\nNote that GLBP and VRRP are supported by both Cisco and non-Cisco routers, whereas, HSRP is supported only by Cisco routers.\nSingle active router and interface tracking both are supported by GLBP, HSRP, and VRRP.\nObjective:\n\nInfrastructure Services -\nSub-Objective:\nConfigure and verify first-hop redundancy protocols\nReferences:\nHome > End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Products > Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.2.T > Product Literature > White Papers > GLBP Gateway Load Balancing\nProtocol > Information About Gateway Load Balancing Protocol\nHome > Support > Technology Support > IP > IP Application Services > Design > Design Technotes > Hot Standby Router Protocol Features and Functionality >\nHSRP Background and Operations > HSRP Operation","answer":"BC","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Support for single active router","B":"Support for automatic load balancing","D":"Support for interface tracking","C":"Support for multiple gateways"},"exam_id":297,"topic":"5","question_id":151,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2020-01-03 10:33:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"BC","isMC":true},{"id":"aWFhzaROptJYY4wJFVxy","answer_images":[],"answer":"BE","answer_ET":"BE","isMC":true,"exam_id":297,"question_id":152,"question_text":"Which two commands prune VLAN 10 from a switch interface?

A PVLAN isolated port type can only send frames to promiscuous ports.\nConsider the following graphic:\n\nHost B is attached to a promiscuous mode port. In this mode, Host B can send and receive frames with other promiscuous, isolated, or community ports assigned to the same privateVLAN. Therefore, frames can be exchanged with Hosts A or C. Hosts A and C are attached to isolated ports. Isolated ports are able to send frames to promiscuous ports but not to each other.\nIsolated and promiscuous ports can be combined to achieve a desired level of separation between particular machines while still allowing required access to services. As another example, suppose that security policy dictated that Host A and Host C cannot communicate with one another, but both computers needed to access a database on Host B. The isolated ports keep them from communicating with one another, while the use of a promiscuous port to Host B allows them to access the database. Any other resources in the network that either machine needs access to should be therefore connected with a promiscuous port.\nThe third type of port is a community port. A community port can communicate with other community ports of the same private VLAN or promiscuous ports.\nObjective:\n\nInfrastructure Security -\nSub-Objective:\nConfigure and verify switch security features\nReferences:\nCisco > Home > Support > Product Support > End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Products > Cisco Catalyst 6000 Series Switches > Configure > Configuration Examples and Technotes > Securing Networks with Private VLANs and VLAN Access Control Lists","topic":"5","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/12128-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-157-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1579169760,"exam_id":297,"timestamp":"2020-01-16 11:16:00","answer_ET":"Explanation","discussion":[{"comment_id":"39686","poster":"Alice2020","content":"ISOLATED IS THE ANSWER","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1579169760.0"}],"question_id":153},{"id":"JqXUDRnDNa8H1QnH2B4c","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/2398-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-17-discussion/","question_text":"Which two VLAN ranges can you add, modify, or delete on a switch?
