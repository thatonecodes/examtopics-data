The given criteria don't apply to both devices; a switch receives on pins 1 & 2, and transmits on 3 & 6. A router does the opposite, transmitting on pins 1 & 2 and receiving on 3 & 6.\n\nConventionally, a router to switch is always a straight-through. Crossover is only for similar devices, such as connecting multiple switches together, or connecting two routers together.\n\nIf we assume the question is just asking us what cable type we need to connect a switch and router together, the answer is invariably a straight-through cable. However, if we are supposed to assume the given criteria apply to *both* devices, then the answer is of course a crossover.\n\nI'll assume Cisco isn't asking us to envision such a bizarre parallel reality. D it is.","timestamp":"1718556060.0"},{"timestamp":"1718362440.0","content":"Option D\nYou are describing a scenario where a straight-through Ethernet cable (also known as a \"patch cable\") should be used. In a straight-through cable, each wire on one end of the cable is connected to the same pin on the other end. This type of cable is commonly used to connect different types of devices, such as a router to a switch, where the transmit pins on one end are connected to the receive pins on the other end.\n\nEnsure that both the router and the switch are configured for the same Ethernet standard (e.g., both support Gigabit Ethernet) and use a straight-through cable to connect them. If auto MDI-X is unavailable, it means you should not use a crossover cable, as a straight-through cable is required for proper communication between the router and switch in this case.","poster":"Coton","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1096471"}],"unix_timestamp":1702558440,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/128581-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1224-discussion/","isMC":true,"exam_id":288,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which cable type must be used when connecting a router and switch together using these criteria?\n\n• Pins 1 and 2 are receivers and pins 3 and 6 are transmitters.\n• Auto detection MDI-X is unavailable.","answer":"D","question_id":252,"question_images":[]},{"id":"wlg3rQLZxkBzFAkbF837","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-04-09 05:47:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1712634420,"question_id":253,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"Which protocol does a REST API use to communicate?","answer":"D","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721685360.0","content":"\"A REST API uses existing HTTP methodologies that the RFC 2616 protocol defined, such as GET , PUT , POST and DELETE \"","comment_id":"1253305","poster":"Joseluis1967","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1191934","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1712634420.0"}],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":288,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/138183-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1225-discussion/","choices":{"C":"SNMP","B":"STP","D":"HTTP","A":"SSH"}},{"id":"mLh9NTzWSsHEGkKriky4","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2024-03-05 13:06:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1709640360,"question_id":254,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"Which interface on the WLC is limited to one when LAG is in use?","answer":"D","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728446880.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","comment_id":"1191940","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"D is correct. \nWhen you enable LAG, you can configure only one AP-manager interface because only one logical port is needed.
