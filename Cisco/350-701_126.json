They ask what is the flaw that caused the attacker to exploit this vulnerability? \nI agree that the attacker uses the web application or the user input to exploit the vulnerability, and give commands to connect to the database and get everything needed about the database. But what where is the actual flaw? Was it A. the web application and the user input? No, it’s not, or it would be XSS vulnerability.

In addition, the ASA and ASASM implementation of NSEL generates periodic NSEL events, flow-update events, to provide periodic byte counters over the duration of the flow.
