You can use traffic storm control policies to prevent disruptions on Layer 2 ports by broadcast, unknown multicast, or unknown unicast traffic storms on physical interfaces. By default, storm control is not enabled in the ACI fabric. ACI bridge domain (BD) Layer 2 unknown unicast flooding is enabled by default within the BD but can be disabled by an administrator. In that case, a storm control policy only applies to broadcast and unknown multicast traffic.
