It achieves this through the use of Security Group Tags (SGTs). By applying SGTs, TrustSec enables identity-based segmentation, where policies and access controls are defined based on the identity or role of users, devices, or services. This approach streamlines policy management and firewall rules, making them more adaptable and easier to enforce across the network.","poster":"AbdullahMohammad251","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1225805","timestamp":"1717713240.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is better than C","comments":[{"content":"...........................","timestamp":"1718987700.0","comment_id":"1234635","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"[Removed]"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716576540.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"D is better than C","comment_id":"1217733"},{"poster":"Shri_Fcb10","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe main reason C is more appropriate is that it directly addresses the core benefit of TrustSec related to network segmentation.

One of the benefits of using TrustSec is that it relies on security group tags (SGTs) to enable network segmentation. SGTs are used to classify and label network traffic based on various attributes, such as user identity, device type, or location. These labels are then used to enforce access control policies and segment the network, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access specific resources or segments of the network. This helps improve network security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement by attackers.","timestamp":"1693875000.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Key word is \"benefit\".
