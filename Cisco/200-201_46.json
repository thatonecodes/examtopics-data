This behavior aligns with the scenario described, where a single SYN packet is sent to each port.\n\nWhy not D. SYN flood\nA SYN flood attack involves sending numerous SYN packets to a specific port to overwhelm the target, which is different from the described behavior of targeting multiple ports with single packets."},{"poster":"ImGonnaPassIt","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA single SYN packet sent to each port, is indicative of port scanning.
