Real- time traffic is delay sensitive. For Voice data, packet loss is manageable to some extent, but frequent losses impair communication between endpoints.\nThe UDP jitter operation is the most popular operation because the user can obtain packet loss, jitter and latency from one operation. This also includes unidirectional measurements as well. The Jitter operation is designed to measure the delay, delay variance and packet loss in IP networks by generating active\nUDP traffic. It sends N packets, each of size S, from source router to a target router (which requires Cisco IOS IP SLAs responder enabled) each T milliseconds apart. All these parameters are user configurable.\nReference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipsla/configuration/15-mt/sla-15-mt-book/sla_udp_jitter.pdf","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1567142760,"choices":{"D":"UDP Jitter","A":"UDP Jitter for VoIP","C":"ICMP Echo","B":"ICMP Path Echo"},"timestamp":"2019-08-30 07:26:00","exam_id":296,"discussion":[{"poster":"Bastex","comment_id":"8944","upvote_count":"2","content":"Yes, A\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/technologies/tk648/tk362/tk920/technologies_qas0900aecd8017bd5a.html","timestamp":"1567142760.0"}]},{"id":"DkHDy7wEM7jarH3gJWd9","answers_community":[],"answer":"Explanation","discussion":[{"comment_id":"844541","poster":"Nouraaa","timestamp":"1679287560.0","content":"Correct answer : A","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/103332-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-45-discussion/","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"Frame Relay","A":"802.1Q","C":"PPP","F":"HDLC A","B":"ISL","E":"MPLS"},"answer_description":"Restrictions for EVN -\n✑ An EVN trunk is allowed on any interface that supports 802.1q encapsulation, such as Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and port channels.\n✑ A single IP infrastructure can be virtualized to provide up to 32 virtual networks end-to-end.\n✑ If an EVN trunk is configured on an interface, you cannot configure VRF-Lite on the same interface.\n✑ OSPFv3 is not supported; OSPFv2 is supported.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/evn/configuration/xe-3s/evn-xe-3s-book/evn-overview.pdf","timestamp":"2023-03-20 05:46:00","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"Explanation","exam_id":296,"unix_timestamp":1679287560,"question_id":103,"question_text":"Which encapsulation supports an interface that is configured for an EVN trunk?"},{"id":"XdApjqTP0baRBkKqtqGY","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nA network engineer receives a command output from a customer that indicates an issue with.
