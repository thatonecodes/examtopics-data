OSPF neighbor adjacency problems between some of the routers.","question_text":"You have completed an OSPF implementation, and you are verifying OSPF operation. During this verification, you notice that the OSPF route of 172.16.10.0 is repeatedly appearing and disappearing from the routing table. Further investigation finds that the OSPF CPU utilization is very high and the routers are constantly performing SPF calculations. You determine that 172.16.20.2 is the source of the 172.16.10.0 route. Using the show ip ospf database router 172.16.20.1 command, you notice that when this show command is performed repeatedly, the contents of the LSA change every few seconds.\nWhat could be the cause of this problem?","choices":{"D":"OSPF LSA pacing issues between some of the routers.","C":"Issues with mistuned OSPF timers.","B":"Two routers have the same OSPF router ID.","A":"OSPF authentication errors between some of the routers."},"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"E.

A backbone area with 40 routers and a default route to the outside world would have less memory issues compared with a backbone area with 4 routers and 33,000 external routes being injected into OSPF. Router memory could also be conserved by using a good OSPF design. Summarization at the area border routers and use of stub areas could further minimize the number of routes exchanged.\nThe total memory used by OSPF is the sum of the memory used in the routing table ( show ip route summary ) and the memory used in the LSDB. The following numbers are a \"rule of thumb\" estimate. Each entry in the routing table will consume between approximately 200 and 280 bytes plus 44 bytes per extra path. Each\nLSA will consume a 100 byte overhead plus the size of the actual LSA, possibly another 60 to 100 bytes (For router links, this depends on the number of interfaces on the router). These amounts should be added to memory already used by other processes and by the IOS itself.\nIf you really want to know the exact number, you can do a show memory with and without OSPF being turned on. The difference in the processor memory used would be the answer.","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D. Have multiple OSPF processes on each OSPF router.
