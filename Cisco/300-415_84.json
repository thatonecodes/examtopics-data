All traffic exiting from the Cisco vEdge device, going either to other overlay network sites or to a public network, passes through this interface.\n\n To direct data traffic from other VPNs to exit from the Cisco vEdge device directly to a public network, enable NAT in those VPNs or ensure that those VPNs have a route to VPN 0.\n\n On the vCisco vSmart Controller, create a centralized data policy the redirects the desired data traffic from the non-transport VPN to VPN 0, and then apply that data policy to the non-transport VPN.
