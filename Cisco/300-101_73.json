If the neighbor does not receive this packet (means that it doesn`t see itself in this packet), it will be stuck in INIT state. INIT state can be understood as a one-way Hello. An example of a router stuck in INIT state is shown below:","exam_id":296,"timestamp":"2020-02-14 19:33:00","topic":"2","discussion":[{"poster":"Nemanja","content":"B.

The states are Down, Attempt,\nInit, 2-Way, Exstart, Exchange, Loading, and Full.\nAn OSPF neighbor reaches the 2-way state when bidirectional communication is established (each router has seen the other`s hello packet). This is the beginning of an OSPF adjacency. On broadcast media and non-broadcast multiaccess networks, the DR and BDR are elected in this state. But the priority on both routers are 0 so no DR and BDR are elected -> These routers stay in the 2-way state.\n(Reference and a good resource of OSPF Neighbor states:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093f0e.shtml)","choices":{"B":"You are attempting to run in the broadcast mode over an NBMA interface.","D":"Someone has changed the OSPF router ID; therefore you must clear the OSPF process.","A":"All OSPF implementations must have at least one interface in area 0.","C":"Both routers are configured to function as a BDR; therefore, there is no DR router."},"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/n18855500000.png"],"timestamp":"2020-02-14 19:37:00","unix_timestamp":1581705420,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"exam_id":296,"answer_ET":"E.
