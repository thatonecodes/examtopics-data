Its not that R2 with NO-ADVERTISE will not send its network to R1, it will but R1 will not redistribute them anywhere else (e/iBGP), as we sends this community from R2. Based on the drawing, and having limited konwledge of rest of the config, it can rule out that R1 is still able to reach Internet via R2, and inform about this R3 which will preffer it as its eBGP and still act as gateway.

So for A, it is telling R1 not to advertise anything from R2 and R2 is telling R1 the same. The diagram is showing that the primary path should go through R3 to R1, but R2 still can advertise R1's ISP to R4 and then R4 can go through R2-R1-ISP1. \n\nWith answer B, R1 is telling R2 not to pass on any advertisements it gives it to anyone outside of the AS. So, now R3 and R4 will only know the path to ISP1 through R1 and will also still get the ISP2 path through R2."},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1736970960.0","comment_id":"1341238","upvote_count":"1","content":"R1:\n - Routes advertised to ISP-1: 0x AS-path prepend\n - Routes received from ISP-1: HIGH local-preference\n - Routes advertised to R2: community NO-EXPORT\n - Routes received from R2: no action \nR2:\n - Routes advertised to ISP-2: 5x AS-path prepend\n - Routes received from ISP-2: LOW local-preference\n - Routes advertised to R1: no action\n - Routes received from R1: no action\n\nAnswers should look like this.
