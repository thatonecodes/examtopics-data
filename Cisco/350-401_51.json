VXLAN encapsulation is UDP based, meaning that it can be forwarded by any IP-based network (legacy or third party) and creates the overlay network for the SD-Access fabric. Although LISP is the control plane for the SD-Access fabric, it does not use LISP data encapsulation for the data plane; instead, it uses VXLAN encapsulation because it is capable of encapsulating the original Ethernet header to perform MAC-in-IP encapsulation, while LISP does not. Using VXLAN allows the SD-Access fabric to support Layer 2 and Layer 3 virtual topologies (overlays) and the ability to operate over any IP-based network with built-in network segmentation (VRF instance/VN) and built-in group-based policy.","timestamp":"1621402500.0","upvote_count":"12"},{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1215453","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. policy plane forwarding (SDA Fabric Policy Plane) -> Cisco TrusSec SGT tags\nB. control plane forwarding (SDA Fabric Control Plane) -> LISP\nC. data plane forwarding (SDA Fabric Data Plane) -> VXLAN","timestamp":"1732262040.0"},{"comment_id":"963414","content":"data plane of sd access is vxlan","poster":"flash007","timestamp":"1706255460.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"The given answer is correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1636623360.0","comment_id":"354445"},{"comment_id":"269510","poster":"hku68","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is A","timestamp":"1626522540.0"}],"answer":"A","timestamp":"2020-11-19 08:35:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":324,"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"cEfxRCDL8t3sUyPCexnN","choices":{"B":"The enable password cannot be decrypted.","D":"There is no difference and both passwords are encrypted identically.","C":"The enable password is encrypted with a stronger encryption method.","A":"The enable secret password is protected via stronger cryptography mechanisms."},"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1605771360,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/37275-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-265-discussion/","answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-11-19 08:36:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":324,"question_text":"What is the difference between the enable password and the enable secret password when service password encryption is enabled on an IOS device?","discussion":[{"content":"Interesting: \neven the exam confuses encryption vs hashing(authentication): \nenable secret: uses hashing ( you can not retrieve the original message if you are using hashing unlike encryption which you can regardless of how strong the encryption is)\n\nservice password: uses encryption(very weak encryption indeed)\n\njust for people who do not know what hashing and encryption are)","poster":"YTAKE","upvote_count":"9","timestamp":"1649210400.0","comment_id":"457999"},{"upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1621402560.0","comment_id":"222534","poster":"skh","content":"The “enable secret” password is always encrypted (independent of the “service passwordencryption” command) using MD5 hash algorithm.
