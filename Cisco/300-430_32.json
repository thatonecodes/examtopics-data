Apply port security to the switch.\n\nExplanation:\nRogue Access Points (APs) are unauthorized devices that can be connected to a network, potentially compromising its security. To prevent rogue APs from being plugged into the network, port security is an effective measure. Port security can restrict which devices (based on MAC addresses) are allowed to connect to a specific switch port. This ensures that only authorized devices can access the network, preventing unauthorized APs from being connected.\n\nOption B (Add a MAC filter to the switch): While MAC filtering can help, it is not as robust as port security, as MAC addresses can be spoofed.","timestamp":"1739624220.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"robi1020","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724056320.0","comment_id":"1153836","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn the context of preventing rogue APs, port security can be configured to allow only authorized devices (such as known and registered APs) to connect to the switch ports.
