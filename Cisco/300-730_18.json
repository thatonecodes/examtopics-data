Explanation:\n\nIn the context of VPN configurations, especially when using ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman), the specific Diffie-Hellman (DH) group numbers may vary depending on the implementation or device. However, in common VPN standards like IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange version 2), the Diffie-Hellman group numbers for ECDH are standardized.\n\nFor ECDH, the Diffie-Hellman group number is typically represented as \"Group 19\" or \"Group 256.\" The number 19 corresponds to the elliptic curve group called ECP-256, which uses a 256-bit key.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice for ECDH in a VPN configuration is often referred to as Group 19 or Group 256. Both representations can be used interchangeably. Always refer to your specific VPN device documentation or configuration settings to ensure compatibility and accurate representation of the Diffie-Hellman group when implementing ECDH in your VPN setup.","poster":"kylesam2017","comment_id":"1105707","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1701563760.0","content":"\"B\" is the correct answer here.","poster":"kylesam2017","comment_id":"1086504"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\ngroup 24 is for ECDH","poster":"mlv_2023","timestamp":"1698967560.0","comments":[{"content":"I disagree with you.\nPlease note that to implement the NSA Suite B cryptography specification, you use IKEv2 and select one of the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) options: 19, 20, or 21.
