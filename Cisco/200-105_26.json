If the port connected to the workstation is blocked by STP, it would prevent the transmission of DHCP discovery packets, resulting in the workstation not receiving a DHCP address.\n\nThe other options, 802.1Q, VTP, and DTP, are unrelated to DHCP address assignment and do not have a direct impact on a workstation's ability to receive a DHCP address. 802.1Q is a standard for VLAN tagging, VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) is used for managing VLAN configurations, and DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) is used to negotiate trunking between switches.","poster":"yousfs1212"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"AriGarcia","timestamp":"1677017160.0","comment_id":"817224","content":"STP can prevent DHCP clients from getting an address because the port doesn't start forwarding traffic until STP goes into the forwarding state.

Other responses may be right depending on topology. But 802.1Q seems the most appropriate.","timestamp":"1581608220.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"Which feature would prevent a workstation from receiving a DHCP address?","answer":"A"},{"id":"OtIy9RNK1iZxlGzHm50z","exam_id":284,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Minwoo81","comment_id":"52486","timestamp":"1582090020.0","content":"The answer is CEF","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2020-02-19 06:27:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14432-exam-200-105-topic-2-question-117-discussion/","answer":"Explanation","question_text":"Which three components must you configure to establish a GRE tunnel?
