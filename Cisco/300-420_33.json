When the external route is redistributed into autonomous system 100 at router A or B, it can be tagged. This tag can then be used to filter the redistribution of the route back into autonomous system 200. This filtering blocks the formation of the loop, because router A will no longer receive the redistributed routes from router B through autonomous system 200.\n\nIn the configuration snippets, when routers A and B redistribute autonomous system 200 routes into autonomous system 100, they tag the routes with tag 100. Any routes tagged with tag 100 can then be prevented from being redistributed back into autonomous system 200.
