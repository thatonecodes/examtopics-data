But after looking a bit closer I think its D as well. Reason being is that the backup controller has 10 licenses. There are only 7 Critical priority APs. In theory when fail-over occurs the WLC should disassociate the AP's that are a lower priority if it detects that higher priority APs are trying to associate. With 10 licenses that would give enough room for the 7 Critical and 3 High AP count. In order for the WLC to adhere to the AP priority functionality, you need to enter the \"network ap-priority enable\" command. Otherwise, it does not care what priorities are assigned.
