The relation between an Virtual-Template or Dialer interface and a Virtual-Access is quite similar to a difference between a class and the object in the object programming paradigm. The Dialer or Virtual-Template interfaces represent a template for creation of individual virtual interfaces. However, these are only templates. Whenever the template should start working as a real interface, it is instantiated into a Virtual-Access interface that is the actual live virtual interface through which packets are processed and routed.\n\nYou cannot configure the Virtual-Access interfaces directly."}],"unix_timestamp":1668771060,"timestamp":"2022-11-18 12:31:00","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"Which option describes the purpose of the command show derived-config interface virtual-access 1?","answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answers_community":[],"choices":{"D":"It verifies that the virtual access interface is used to create the tunnel interface.","B":"It verifies that the virtual template created the tunnel interface.","C":"It verifies that the virtual access interface is of type Ethernet.","A":"It verifies that the virtual access interface is cloned correctly with per-user attributes."},"exam_id":301,"question_id":12,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"ugOEWINw9GvyAWpvVpQY","choices":{"A":"ip:interface-config=ip unnumbered loobackn","C":"ip:interface-config=ip src route","E":"ip:interface-config=ip neighbor 0.0.0.0","D":"ip:interface-config=ip next hop","B":"ip:interface-config=ip vrf forwarding ivrf"},"exam_id":301,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"AB","answer":"AB","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/87894-exam-300-209-topic-1-question-150-discussion/","question_text":"Which two RADIUS attributes are needed for a VRF-aware FlexVPN hub?

SDP involves the following three entities (see the figure below):\n\nIntroducer--A mutually trusted device that introduces the petitioner to the registrar. The introducer can be a device user, such as a system administrator.\nAn introducer can be configured as an administrative introducer, which allows an administrator performing the introduction to supply the name for the device being introduced. The supplied device name is used as if it were the name of an introducer in the normal SDP mechanisms, preserving the existing functionality of the SDP configuration. For more information on function of the administrative introducer, see the section Authentication and Authorization Lists for an Administrative Introducer.\nPetitioner--A client, or new device, to be introduced to the secure network.\n\nRegistrar--A server that authorizes the petitioner.
