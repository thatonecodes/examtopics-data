Since the video is intended only for new employees joining the wireless network, multicast is the most efficient way to deliver the content to multiple clients simultaneously without overloading the network.\n\nExplanation of the options:\nA. WMF: This is correct. WMF enables multicast traffic to be forwarded to wireless clients, ensuring that the video is delivered efficiently to new employees.\n\nB. WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia): WMM is a QoS feature that prioritizes voice, video, and other time-sensitive traffic but does not specifically handle multicast forwarding.\n\nC.

Here’s why:\n\nAVC Profiles:\nAVC allows the network to identify and classify specific applications, such as WebEx, and apply appropriate QoS policies to them. By creating an AVC profile for WebEx, the engineer can remark the QoS value (e.g., DSCP or UP) for WebEx traffic, ensuring it receives the necessary priority and bandwidth for high-quality performance.\n\nHow it works:\nAVC uses deep packet inspection (DPI) to recognize application traffic.
