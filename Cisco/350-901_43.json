Where the reset command moves the branch pointer back in the chain (typically) to \"undo\" changes, the revert command adds a new commit at the end of the chain to \"cancel\" changes. The effect is most easily seen by looking at Figure 1 again. If we add a line to a file in each commit in the chain, one way to get back to the version with only two lines is to reset to that commit, i.e., git reset HEAD~1."}],"upvote_count":"8"},{"timestamp":"1719996660.0","comment_id":"941638","content":"git reset -m -> mixed reset and preserves changes.
