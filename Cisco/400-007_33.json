This ensures that both systems have identical data at all times.\n* Disaster recovery: In case of a failure at the primary site, the secondary site can quickly take over operations with minimal data loss.\n* Low latency: Since the systems are physically close, the replication process can be performed with minimal delay.\n\nOther Options Explained:\n* Snapshot replication: Creates periodic copies of data, but doesn't guarantee real-time consistency.\n* Transactional replication: Replicates data based on transactions, which can lead to inconsistencies if failures occur.\n* Direct replication: Typically refers to hardware-based replication, which might not be the most flexible option for network-based replication.\n\nBy choosing synchronous replication in this scenario, you prioritize data consistency and disaster recovery without sacrificing performance due to the close proximity of the systems."}],"answer_ET":"A","question_id":161},{"id":"pyDEZZEWPK0Bp9Yb0NrY","unix_timestamp":1724087100,"answer":"CD","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/146032-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-254-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"Doobiedoo","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724087100.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC.
