Route leaking involves selectively sharing or injecting routes from one VN to another, thereby enabling traffic to flow between the isolated VNs.\n\nKey points about route leaking in an SD-WAN architecture:\n\nFabric Border Nodes: Route leaking typically occurs at the border nodes of the SD-WAN fabric. These nodes are responsible for connecting the overlay VNs to external networks.\n\nALSO: FABRIC ROUTERS ARE USED ON SD-ACCESS NOT SD-WAN !!

By configuring GRE tunnels between the fabric edge devices, traffic from one VN can be sent through the tunnel to another VN, enabling inter-VN communication.\n\nHowever, option A, which involves using external fusion routers to map VNs to VRFs and selectively route traffic between VRFs, is a more common approach in SD-WAN architectures. It offers greater flexibility and control for policy-based routing, whereas GRE tunneling may require manual configuration and maintenance of tunnels, which can be more complex and less scalable in large deployments.\n\nSo, while both options A and B can be used to enable communication between overlay VNs, option A is more common and generally more suitable for SD-WAN architectures."},{"comment_id":"709079","timestamp":"1682934480.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\naccording to ENSLD cert guide Page 335\nany communication between endpoints in different VNs must go through a fusion router or firewall\n\nand VNs belong to SD-Access. not SD-WAN","poster":"andrewChan"},{"content":"Hmm the question is wrong, that should mean SD-Access - VN virtual network, that is used within SD-Access not in SD-WAN","comment_id":"637230","poster":"sonicwarrior","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674722340.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAll the answers relate to SDA rather than SD-WAN so I think the wording of the question is not right here.
