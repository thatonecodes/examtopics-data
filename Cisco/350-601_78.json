CLI-based scripting: This approach involves writing scripts to extract data from network devices through their command-line interfaces (CLIs). While it can be used for data retrieval, it's not as scalable or real-time as streaming telemetry.\n\nB. Logging: Logging typically involves storing log data generated by network devices. While it can provide valuable information, it is not inherently a real-time push model and may not meet the requirement for close to real-time access to operational data.\n\nC. SNMPv3: SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a widely used protocol for monitoring and managing network devices.
