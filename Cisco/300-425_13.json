Enable Mobility Encryption on the network.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nMobility Encryption: Enabling mobility encryption ensures that the data and control traffic exchanged between controllers in a mobility group is encrypted. This is critical for maintaining high security, especially in environments where sensitive information is transmitted.\n\nMIC Authentication: While MIC (Message Integrity Check) authentication is important for ensuring the integrity of messages exchanged between mobility group members, it does not provide encryption. MIC alone might not be sufficient for the high-security requirements of a government agency.\n\nMobility Group Names: Using a different group name for each mobility member or a complex group name can help with organizational clarity and might add a layer of security through obscurity. However, these measures are not substitutes for proper encryption mechanisms.","comment_id":"1236728"}]},{"id":"6U41GwsP2RCowXGbajux","answer_ET":"CE","isMC":true,"answers_community":["CE (78%)","BC (22%)"],"question_id":63,"answer":"CE","answer_images":[],"question_text":"An architect configures a set of AirOS controllers to be in the same mobility group as the existing controllers.
