If a packet with an IPv4 MTU larger than the maximum arrives at the router interface, it will be either discarded, if the DF bit in the packet header is set, or it will be fragmented. OSPF for IPv4 packets completely relies on IPv4 for the possible fragmentation. Although RFC 2328 does not recommend OSPF packet fragmentation, in some situations the size of the OSPF packet has greater value than the interface IPv4 MTU. If MTUs are mismatched between two neighbors, this could introduce issues with exchange of link-state packets, resulting in continuous retransmissions.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe interface command for setting the IPv6 MTU parameter is ipv6 mtu. An IPv6 router does not fragment an IPv6 packet unless it is the source of the packet.\n\nTo prevent such issues, OSPF requires that the same IPv4 MTU be configured on both sides of the link.
