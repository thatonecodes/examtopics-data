Configuring the dynamic NHRP multicast map on the hub tunnel interface is a solution that can potentially resolve the issue of a DMVPN spoke router being unable to establish an EIGRP neighbor relationship with the hub router.\n\nIn DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN) environments, when using protocols like EIGRP over the tunnel, it's essential to ensure proper handling of multicast traffic, which is used for routing protocol neighbor discovery. The dynamic NHRP multicast map helps in this context by dynamically mapping multicast groups to the NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multiple Access) addresses of the spokes.\n\nTo configure the dynamic NHRP multicast map on the hub tunnel interface, you can use a command like:\n\ninterface Tunnel0\n ip nhrp map multicast dynamic\n\nThis command tells the hub router to dynamically map multicast groups for NHRP, enabling proper handling of EIGRP multicast traffic between spokes and the hub.\n\nTherefore, configuring the dynamic NHRP multicast map on the hub tunnel interface is a valid solution to address the issue of EIGRP neighbor relationship establishment in a DMVPN setup.","timestamp":"1719540420.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1107383","poster":"kylesam2017"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1104819","timestamp":"1719253200.0","poster":"Rosh8787","content":"D is the correct answer"},{"poster":"JKPippers","comment_id":"1073804","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716002760.0","content":"Answer is D\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/dynamic-multipoint-vpn-dmvpn/111976-dmvpn-troubleshoot-00.html"},{"timestamp":"1715605500.0","comment_id":"1069410","poster":"gondohwe","content":"DDDDDDDDDDDDD all the way baby","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1056776","upvote_count":"1","content":"poor question by cisco","timestamp":"1714382940.0","poster":"gondohwe"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nDMVPN is an NBMA network, which doesnâ€™t support multicast at all.

To achieve the goal of allowing Cisco AnyConnect users to access the outside interface using UDP 500/4500 and establish an SSL connection for software updates, the correct actions to be taken are: 1. IPsec (IKEv2) Allow Access must be checked on the outside interface: Enabling the \"IPsec (IKEv2) Allow Access\" option allows incoming IPsec traffic on UDP ports 500 and 4500 to reach the outside interface of the Cisco device. This is necessary to allow AnyConnect users to establish IPsec-based VPN connections. 2. SSL Allow Access must be checked on the outside interface: Enabling the \"SSL Allow Access\" option allows incoming SSL traffic to reach the outside interface. This enables AnyConnect users to establish an SSL connection for software updates, which ensures the ability to update the Cisco AnyConnect software over the same connection. By checking these two options on the outside interface, you allow AnyConnect users to connect using IPsec (UDP 500/4500) and establish an SSL connection for software updates, satisfying the requirements mentioned.
