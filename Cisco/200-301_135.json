Take a look at the address 192.168.12.16\nif we choose C as the answer which is a /28, the increment for that CIDR is 16, meaning from the 4th octet it will be 0 ~ 16 , where 0 and 16 are network address respectively (192.168.12.0 ans 192.168.12.16). Now with this information Answer C violates the following:\n1. You can use a network address as an ip address\n1.1 Since you can use the network address as an ip address, the usable host range from 192.168.12.0 is only .1 ~ 14, since .15 is its broadcast address and .16 is well the next network address. so The answer is D, though the EIGRP route has way more space to accommodate the .16 since it is a CIDR /24, (255 host spaces) the RIP option (C.) is correct since it is way higher / longer than that of the /24 (/27 vs /24) and the fact that a /27 CIDR has 32 increments meaning 30 usable host from .1 ~ 30, where .0 is the network address and .31 is its broadcast followed by .32 which is the next network.","poster":"xsp","comment_id":"284809"},{"comment_id":"284266","timestamp":"1628173560.0","poster":"hokieman91","upvote_count":"2","content":"D is correct - RIP V1 does not support VLSM, however, RIP V2 does"},{"comment_id":"284249","upvote_count":"2","content":"The Correct Answer is D.
