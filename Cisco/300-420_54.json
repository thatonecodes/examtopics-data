The architect should utilize loop guard on SW2.\n\nLoop guard is a Layer 2 protocol that is designed to prevent forwarding loops caused by unidirectional links or other issues that can result in a break in the Layer 2 topology. When a port is designated as a root or alternate port, it is expected to receive BPDUs from the designated bridge, and it sends its own BPDUs out that port. If the port stops receiving BPDUs, it is considered a possible loop condition. Loop guard places the root port into a loop-inconsistent state to avoid forwarding loops, which prevents the forwarding of data frames until the issue is resolved.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698513360.0"}],"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/107813-exam-300-420-topic-1-question-72-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":270,"answer_description":"","exam_id":305}],"exam":{"id":305,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":299,"name":"300-420","provider":"Cisco","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":54},"__N_SSP":true}
