This design reduces the overhead associated with file locks, enhances consistency, and improves overall performance in distributed file systems. Therefore, NFSv4 is the protocol that reduces file locks by using leasing."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nWith the NFS version 4 protocol, the support for file locking is part of the NFS protocol. The file locking support is structured so that an RPC callback mechanism is not required. This is a departure from the previous versions of the NFS file locking protocol, Network Lock Manager (NLM). The state associated with file locks is maintained at the server under a lease-based model. \nhttps://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=control-locking-in-nfs-version-4","comment_id":"1013145","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Ron_Berserker","timestamp":"1726927020.0"},{"content":"CIFS (Common Internet File System) and SMB (Server Message Block) are both Windows file-sharing protocols used in storage systems, such as network-attached systems (NAS).

Directory Leasing is an enhancement to the existing SMB protocol that reduces the number of round-trips between client and server.\n\nWith Directory Leasing, client computers request a lease lock on directory information (which contains the file metadata), enabling Windows to cache the information for longer periods. Because many end-user applications access file metadata frequently, caching it for longer periods reduces the round-trips that a client has to wait for, improving the application response time.","timestamp":"1705394520.0","comment_id":"777469","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nI agree with skjs and others, the correct answer is C.","timestamp":"1702065300.0","comment_id":"739411","upvote_count":"2","poster":"C4rlos"},{"poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the one!","timestamp":"1695676560.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"679232"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is A:\n\nThe question is about reducing file locks, not which protocol uses file locks, SMB has directory leasing for it.
