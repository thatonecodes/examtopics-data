This includes using network monitoring tools to track traffic patterns, detect anomalies, and perform predictive analysis to prevent potential problems. Proactive management ensures that the network runs efficiently and can adapt to changing demands, thereby optimizing overall network performance.\n\nNetwork Health Maintenance:\nNetwork health maintenance focuses on regularly assessing and maintaining the network to ensure it operates optimally. This includes routine checks, updates, and maintenance tasks that keep the network infrastructure in good condition. It involves monitoring the network's health, identifying potential issues, and performing necessary adjustments or repairs to maintain optimal performance and reliability.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Seawanderer","timestamp":"1716447600.0"},{"content":"D, E.
