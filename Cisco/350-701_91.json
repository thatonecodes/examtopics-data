The explicit forward deployment method allows the Cisco WSA to intercept and inspect the DNS (Domain Name System) requests made by the clients. It can then compare the requested domain names with a list of known malicious or spoofed domains to detect and prevent DNS spoofing attacks.\n\nBy examining the DNS requests and responses, the Cisco WSA can ensure that the resolved IP addresses match the expected legitimate IP addresses associated with the requested domain names. If a spoofed or malicious DNS response is detected, the Cisco WSA can prevent the client from accessing the fraudulent site, thereby protecting against DNS spoofing attacks.","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1684990860.0","comment_id":"906383","poster":"sull3y"},{"comment_id":"1253211","poster":"Bubu3k","timestamp":"1721670840.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nQuote from the OCG: \n\"Because the client knows there is a proxy and sends all traffic to the proxy in explicit forward mode, the client does not perform a DNS lookup of the domain before requesting the URL.

The appliance would protect you by looking and dropping malicious content or the domain would be on a blocked list regardless of the mode.","comment_id":"1062111","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ch1be2les3"},{"timestamp":"1681654440.0","poster":"Orez108","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C","comment_id":"871818","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"bmayer","timestamp":"1676997840.0","comment_id":"816861","content":"Selected Answer: C\nShould be C","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"A & B are the same so discarded.
