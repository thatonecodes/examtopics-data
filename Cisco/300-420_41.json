Macro segmentation is the process of dividing the network into larger segments based on factors such as geography, department, or function. This is usually achieved through traditional methods such as VRF, VLANs, or firewall zoning.\n\nMicro segmentation, in contrast, involves dividing the network into smaller, more granular segments based on individual workloads or applications. This is typically accomplished using software-defined methods such as Security Group Tags (SGTs). Micro segmentation provides more granular control over traffic flows, enabling organizations to reduce the attack surface of the network by limiting the lateral movement of threats. By implementing micro segmentation, organizations can improve their security posture and better protect their critical assets.\n\nhttps://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/software-defined-segmentation-a-primer#:~:text=Macro%20vs%20Micro%20Segmentation,better%20protect%20their%20critical%20assets."}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/150457-exam-300-420-topic-1-question-312-discussion/","question_text":"In Cisco SD-Access, virtual networks create segmentation that allows for separation of users and resources.
