This means you can add compute-only nodes (without additional storage) or storage-only nodes (without additional compute) as required to meet the specific demands of your environment. This flexibility is a key feature of hyper-converged infrastructure, allowing for more granular resource management compared to traditional converged infrastructure solutions.","comment_id":"1233142"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1678152420.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe ability of Cisco HyperFlex that allows adding compute or storage-only nodes as required is option B: independent resource scaling.","poster":"Rocky_Truth","comment_id":"831463"},{"poster":"7korn7","comment_id":"812016","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is B","timestamp":"1676645880.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/de_de/products/hyperconverged-infrastructure/le-wp-hxt-op.pdf","timestamp":"1675089720.0","comment_id":"792932","upvote_count":"3","poster":"moise7082"}],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","topic":"1","question_text":"Which Cisco HyperFlex ability adds compute or storage-only nodes as required?","answer_images":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"bvFCSnsjTWBhxYaeL9bg","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1233144","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718827920.0","poster":"0ed2da0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD All-NVMe\n\n\nFor data-intensive applications and databases that require the highest performance with high consistency and low latency, an All-NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) Cisco HyperFlex configuration would be the most suitable. NVMe storage provides the fastest read/write capabilities and lowest latency compared to other storage types due to its ability to leverage the full potential of solid-state technology over high-speed PCIe interfaces.\n\n\nWhile All-Flash configurations also offer high performance and are suitable for performance-intensive applications, NVMe drives outperform traditional SSDs (Solid State Drives) used in All-Flash configurations. HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) are not suitable for high-performance scenarios due to their slower speeds and higher latency. Hybrid configurations, which combine HDDs and SSDs, offer a balance between cost and performance but do not provide the same level of performance as All-Flash or All-NVMe solutions."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\ntheoretically D but in many case consider budget all-flash is enough :D","poster":"Ben1009","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1700204580.0","comment_id":"1073073"},{"timestamp":"1698708120.0","poster":"shesho07cr","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1058343","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"timestamp":"1688290560.0","poster":"Huberttheman","comment_id":"940712","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAll-NVMe storage configuration provides the highest performance and lowest latency compared to other storage configurations, making it the ideal choice for data-intensive applications and databases that require high consistency and low latency.","poster":"Rocky_Truth","comment_id":"831464","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1678152540.0"},{"timestamp":"1676646060.0","comment_id":"812019","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think the D is correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"7korn7"},{"timestamp":"1676173140.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"niulf","content":"Selected Answer: D\nShould it be All-NVMe?","comment_id":"805937"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/98887-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-353-discussion/","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-02-12 04:39:00","question_id":283,"unix_timestamp":1676173140,"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"All-NVMe","A":"All-Flash","B":"All-HDD","C":"Hybrid"},"exam_id":326,"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"A company plans to deploy a Cisco HyperFlex solution for data-intensive applications and databases.
