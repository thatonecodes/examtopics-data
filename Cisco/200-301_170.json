When a group is configured for HSRP, the routers within the group communicate with each other to determine which router should be the active (forwarding) router and which router should be the standby (backup) router.\n\nEach HSRP group is assigned a virtual MAC address that is shared by the active and standby routers in the group. The virtual MAC address is used as the source MAC address for all HSRP-related packets, and it is used by the hosts on the LAN to address packets to the HSRP virtual router.\n\nThe default virtual MAC address for HSRP group 14 is 00:05:5e:19:0c:14. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B is the default virtual MAC address for HSRP group 7, option C is not a valid MAC address format, and option D is the default MAC address for VMware virtual NICs.","timestamp":"1699031160.0","comment_id":"888656"}],"choices":{"B":"00:05:0c:07:ac:14","D":"00:00:0c:07:ac:0e","C":"04:15:26:73:3c:0e","A":"00:05:5e:19:0c:14"},"exam_id":288,"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_text":"By default, which virtual MAC address does HSRP group 14 use?","question_id":848},{"id":"72HRf3hsFcjFymYvEGqI","choices":{"D":"ip route 10.0.15.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.20.3","C":"ip route 10.0.15.0 255.255.255.192 10.0.20.1","B":"ip route 10.0.15.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.20.1","A":"ip route 10.0.0.64 255.255.255.192 10.0.20.3"},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1180149","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1727013480.0"},{"poster":"jayjihaekim","comment_id":"907932","upvote_count":"2","content":"Static Routing: ip route <Destination IP> <Subnet-mask> {interface address } \n 10.0.15.0 24 = 255.255.255.0 10.0.20.3","timestamp":"1701091500.0"},{"content":"Why is A not the correct answer? - Can anyone help","timestamp":"1683805860.0","comment_id":"716096","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"722371","timestamp":"1684546800.0","content":"Because the destination network is 10.0.15.0/24 and not 10.0.0.64","poster":"Surves"}],"poster":"Swiz005"}],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
