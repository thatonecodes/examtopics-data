However, MED is only considered when comparing routes from the same AS. In this scenario, since BR2 is choosing between paths through different ASes (AS200 and AS300), the MED attribute won’t have the desired impact on BR2’s path selection.\n\nThe weight attribute, on the other hand, is a Cisco-specific attribute that is considered first in the BGP path selection process and is local to the router on which it is set.
