ISE is an integral and mandatory component of SD-Access for implementing network access control policy. ISE performs policy implementation, enabling dynamic mapping of users and devices to scalable groups, and simplifying end-to-end security policy enforcement. Within ISE, users and devices are shown in a simple and flexible interface. ISE integrates with Cisco DNA Center by using Cisco Platform Exchange Grid (pxGrid) and REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) for endpoint event notifications and automation of policy configurations on ISE."},{"timestamp":"1733424600.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Amirabbas","comment_id":"1224858"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732746180.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1219831","content":"Selected Answer: A\nit´s A"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis screen is in the official Cert Guide. \"Because Cisco DNA Center is integrated with AD, all names populate as the search term is being typed.
