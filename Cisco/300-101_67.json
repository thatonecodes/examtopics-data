In other words, Dead R is the Dead Timer Received from the neighbor and the Dead C is the Dead Timer of the local router.\nTherefore in this case Dead R 120 C 10 means the Death Timer of the neighbor is 120 seconds while the local Dead Timer is 10 seconds, which causes a mismatch. Also we can learn that the local OSPF dead timer is set to 10 seconds.\nFor your information, by default, OSPF uses a 10-second hello timer and 40-second hold timer on broadcast and point-to-point links, and a 30-second hello timer and 120-second hold timer for all other network types.","unix_timestamp":1581621540,"answer_images":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/n18851400000.png"],"topic":"2","timestamp":"2020-02-13 20:19:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"50186","content":"B.
