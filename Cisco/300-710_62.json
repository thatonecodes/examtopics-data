Use the system support firewall-engine-debug command to determine which rules the traffic matching and modify the rule accordingly.\n\nIf traffic is not matching the desired policy, the engineer should use the system support firewall-engine-debug command to determine which rules the traffic is matching and modify the rule accordingly. This command provides detailed information about traffic processing, including the rule that the traffic is matching or not matching, and can help the engineer identify issues with the policy configuration.\n\nOption B, using the system support application-identification-debug command, is not relevant to this scenario, as it is used for troubleshooting issues related to application identification.\n\nOption C, using the system support firewall-engine-dump-user-fdensity-data command, is not relevant to this scenario, as it is used for dumping firewall user data and not related to troubleshooting policy matching issues.\nOption D, using the system support network-options command, is not relevant to this scenario, as it is used for fine-tuning network settings and not related to troubleshooting policy matching issues."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe system support application-identification-debug command (Option C) is used for debugging issues related to application identification, which can be useful in certain scenarios. However, it is not specifically designed for determining which rules traffic is matching.\n\nThe system support firewall-engine-debug command (Option A) is the correct choice because it directly helps identify the specific rules that the traffic is hitting. This allows you to modify the rules accordingly to ensure the traffic matches the desired policy.","comment_id":"1340128","timestamp":"1736821440.0","poster":"14a1949"},{"poster":"achille5","timestamp":"1728397860.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect answer A","comment_id":"1191625","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"1052850","poster":"Joninjimbo","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713963360.0","content":"A confirmed under Scenario 3: Traffic Blocked by Application Tag. \"The Connection Events, in conjunction with firewall-engine-debug output, shows the reason for the block.\"\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/firepower-ngfw/214577-firepower-data-path-troubleshooting-phas.html#anc9"},{"content":"I go with C as well...\nIn a TECSEC doc I found the following:\nAn incorrect AppID disposition can cause traffic to match\nthe wrong access control rule","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1698056640.0","poster":"NoUserName1234","comment_id":"878196"},{"poster":"Baumb","timestamp":"1691861760.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIm leaning to C, since were troubleshooting application issues, and application-identification-debug shows the matched application in the FMC","comment_id":"806740","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-12 20:36:00","answer_description":"","answer":"A","exam_id":314}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":306,"name":"300-710","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Cisco","id":314,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":62},"__N_SSP":true}
