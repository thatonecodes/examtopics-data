Provision the email appliance\n\nProvisioning the email appliance, also known as an Email Security Gateway or Email Security Appliance, is a solution for protecting data in transit and adding headers to email messages. The email appliance acts as a security layer between the email servers and the Internet, and provides a range of security features such as encryption, anti-virus, anti-spam, and content filtering. These features help to ensure that emails are transmitted securely, and help to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. By provisioning the email appliance, the engineer can add protection for data in transit and have headers in the email message.","comments":[{"comment_id":"799628","content":"A.
