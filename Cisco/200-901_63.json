These resources are identified by a URL and are defined within the API. For example, an API may define a resource called \"customers\", which can be accessed using the URL \"http://api.example.com/customers\". To retrieve a list of customers, the client could make a GET request to this URL. To create a new customer, the client could make a POST request to the same URL with the necessary data in the request body.\n\nIn contrast, in an RPC API, operations are performed by making function calls. The client makes a request to the server, specifying the function to be called and any necessary parameters. The server then executes the function and returns the result to the client. RPC APIs are operation-oriented, meaning that the focus is on the function being called rather than the resource being accessed.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"790032","comments":[{"comment_id":"808915","content":"Based on that info, this looks correct >>>\n\nRPC: Invokes Function Calls, Implements Communication Between Server and Client\n\nREST: Invokes Transactions Against Resources, Uses a Protocol such as HTTP","comments":[{"content":"I agree with you guys","timestamp":"1694160000.0","poster":"rtg2123","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"832794"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1153966","poster":"Muste","content":"i agree with you","timestamp":"1724068740.0"}],"timestamp":"1692045120.0","upvote_count":"11","poster":"Woonesuf"}]}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-901/image88.png"],"timestamp":"2023-01-27 22:53:00","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nDrag and drop the API characteristics from the left onto the corresponding categories on the right.\n\n//IMG//","unix_timestamp":1674856380,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-901/image88-1.png"]},{"id":"yTyua5s2RyoO1G7QFbSk","exam_id":291,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"Woonesuf","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer 'D' is correct.

Move port Gi0/0/2 to VLAN 20. This is the best solution.

Add a host route on the client to the server. This is also a valid solution. You would add a static route on the client PC that specifically directs traffic destined for the app server's IP address (192.168.42.1) to the router's interface on VLAN 10 (192.168.42.254).","comment_id":"1329154","timestamp":"1734640200.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: DE\nto fix the issue D is enough well that being said the router is configured on a sub interfaces and i wouldn't want to change all of that so may be adding route from the client to the server wouldn't be an issue (may be that route is a default route to the default-gateway)","timestamp":"1724333940.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1174443","timestamp":"1726416060.0","content":"B & D are correct","poster":"Muste","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1156487","poster":"Muste"},{"timestamp":"1722270900.0","poster":"louisvuitton12","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D period.","comment_id":"1135218","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"A and D are correct.
