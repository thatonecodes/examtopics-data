A. Disable Adobe Flash Player\n • Disabling Adobe Flash Player is irrelevant since modern WLAN controllers do not rely on Flash for their web interface.\n • Incorrect.\n 2. B.

It might help clear cached data, but it’s unlikely to resolve the root cause.\n • Incorrect.\n 3. C. Use a browser that supports 128-bit or larger ciphers\n • Modern WLAN controllers often require browsers that support strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with 128-bit or larger ciphers).
