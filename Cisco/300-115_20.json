The VP pruning command would be rejected on switches in client mode. If the other switches are configured the same as switch 4, then none of the could have enabled pruning. There's nothing to suggest pruning has been enabled on SW6, the VTP server, so no pruning will take place on the trunks between any switches. Due to the fact VLANs 1 to 101 are available on the SW6-SW5 links, VLANs 1 to 101 must be configured on SW6, the VTP server. These VLANs will be present on all client switches, so VLANs 1 to 101 must be forwarding on every trunk.","comment_id":"18177","timestamp":"1572359220.0","poster":"networkchimp"},{"content":"but they are VTP3, when pruning is configured on SW6 then the client inherit the setting, am i right? however, i think C is the correct answer.","comment_id":"13083","upvote_count":"1","poster":"cyberknock","timestamp":"1569686160.0"},{"timestamp":"1553258880.0","poster":"Network_Monkey","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"810","content":"Answer is C"},{"poster":"robergalvan","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1552313760.0","comment_id":"701","content":"You can only enable VTP pruning on a switch in VTP server mode.
