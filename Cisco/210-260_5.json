Without this agent, the bindings established by DHCP snooping are lost upon reload, and connectivity is lost as well.\nThe database agent stores the bindings in a file at a configured location. Upon reload, the switch reads the file to build the database for the bindings. The switch keeps the file current by writing to the file as the database changes.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html#wp1090624","discussion":[{"comment_id":"49822","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1581566820.0","content":"Saw this one on the test.","poster":"Kyle1776"},{"comment_id":"40148","poster":"max80","timestamp":"1579273740.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"overall status is shown by \"show ip dhcp snooping database\".

Root guard does not allow the port to become an STP root port, so the port is always STP-designated. If a better BPDU arrives on this port, root guard does not take the BPDU into account and elect a new STP root. Instead, root guard puts the port into the root- inconsistent STP state. You must enable root guard on all ports where the root bridge should not appear. In a way, you can configure a perimeter around the part of the network where the STP root is able to be located.\nIn the following figure, enable root guard on the Switch C port that connects to Switch D.\nSwitch C in figure below blocks the port that connects to Switch D, after the switch receives a superior BPDU. Root guard puts the port in the root-inconsistent\nSTP state. No traffic passes through the port in this state. After device D ceases to send superior BPDUs, the port is unblocked again. Via STP, the port goes from the listening state to the learning state, and eventually transitions to the forwarding state. Recovery is automatic; no human intervention is necessary.\nThis message appears after root guard blocks a port:\n%SPANTREE-2-ROOTGUARDBLOCK: Port 1/1 tried to become non-designated in VLAN 77.\nMoved to root-inconsistent state\n\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/10588-74.html","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2020-01-17 16:21:00"},{"id":"uR6L9AKIVf6qBnDL64R2","question_text":"Which two next-generation encryption algorithms does Cisco recommend?
