From the perspective of CUCM, phones in a device pool will be both the called and calling-party device at any given time. However, this doesn't count the probability that this question is geared toward the device in the device pool utilizing the route pattern associated with the standard local route group. If a device is using SLRG, it is likely calling out to an external location. It is safe to presume, based on the logic of the question, that the given device in this equation would be the calling-party device. If another device, external or internal, is calling said device, then it becomes the called-party device.

The user portion of the Contact Header in the 302 message might need to be translated to reflect a DID that the SP proxy can route to. The host portion of the Contact Header in the 302 message should be modified to reflect the Address of Record (AOR) using the host-registrar CLI under sip-ua and the b2bua CLI under the VoIP dial peer going to the CUE.\n\nSome SIP proxies might not support this.
