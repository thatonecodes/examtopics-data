Internet connectivity from vManage\n\nThe requirement for deployment of on-premises vBond controllers through the Cisco Plug and Play Connect process is Internet connectivity from vManage (Option C).\n\nThe Cisco Plug and Play Connect process is used to establish secure connectivity between the vManage Network Management system and the vBond orchestrators, which are responsible for authenticating and orchestrating the control plane connections between vSmart controllers and vEdge routers. For this process to work, the vManage system must have Internet connectivity to reach and communicate with the vBond orchestrators during the initial deployment and configuration phase.","timestamp":"1711349400.0","comment_id":"1182265","poster":"iking","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"B correct answer","timestamp":"1710848700.0","poster":"Stanleymahamadi","comment_id":"1177266"}],"timestamp":"2024-03-19 12:45:00","unix_timestamp":1710848700,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":304,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_id":312,"answers_community":["C (50%)","B (33%)","A (17%)"],"question_images":[]},{"id":"rM2Ris9ESaDFzAkYlZdE","answer":"C","discussion":[{"poster":"nbvolz","content":"I thought this site was updated when there was new questions?
