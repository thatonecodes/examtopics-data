However, it may not be the best choice if you want to separate the storage of backups and reports for security and disaster recovery reasons.\n\nThe scenario in the question specifies different objectives for configuration backups and reports:\n\nConfiguration Backups: These need to be available from a secure location on the network for disaster recovery. Using SMB for backups can provide this secure storage.\n\nReports: Auditors need to access reports with their Active Directory logins. This requirement is well-suited for using NFS, as it allows for easy access control and integrates with Active Directory for authentication.\n\nWhile using SMB for both purposes is possible, it may not provide the same level of granularity and access control for reports as NFS integrated with Active Directory.\n\nSo option C is a more flexible choice that aligns with the specific requirements of the scenario.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"6","content":"I take it back, answer would be D:\n\n\"You cannot send backups to one remote system and reports to another, but you can choose to send either to a remote system and store the other on the Firepower Management Center.\"\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/640/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v64/system_configuration.html","timestamp":"1697982780.0","poster":"Joninjimbo","comment_id":"1050686"}]}],"timestamp":"2023-10-19 00:31:00","choices":{"C":"Use SMB for backups and NFS for reports.","D":"Use SMB for both backups and reports.","A":"Use NFS for both backups and reports.","B":"Use SSH for backups and NFS for reports."},"unix_timestamp":1697668260,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/124000-exam-300-710-topic-1-question-244-discussion/","answer":"D","question_id":141,"exam_id":314,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (75%)","C (25%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"An engineer needs to configure remote storage on Cisco FMC.
