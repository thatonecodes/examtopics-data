Here’s why:\n\nAvoid Persistent Non-WiFi Interference:\nThis feature allows RRM to ignore non-802.11 interference (e.g., from microwaves, cordless phones, or Bluetooth devices) when making channel decisions. It ensures that RRM does not unnecessarily change channels in response to transient or persistent non-WiFi interference.\n\nWhy it’s the solution:\nIf RRM keeps changing channels due to non-802.11 interference, it can disrupt network performance.
