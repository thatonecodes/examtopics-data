These credentials ensure that only authenticated devices are allowed access to the SD-WAN fab-ric. After successful authentication, each vSmart controller establishes a permanent DTLS tunnel to each SD-WAN router in the SD-WAN fabric and uses these tunnels to establish Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) neighborships with each SD-WAN router. OMP is a proprietary routing protocol similar to BGP that can advertise routes, next hops, keys, and policy information needed to establish and maintain the SD-WAN fabric.","comment_id":"147586","upvote_count":"4"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/27008-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-32-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_id":313,"question_text":"Which action is the vSmart controller responsible for in an SD-WAN deployment?","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (97%)","3%"],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-07-30 19:55:00","topic":"1","exam_id":324,"unix_timestamp":1596131700},{"id":"NvebHFb7hwxzXi9ojatX","answer":"C","exam_id":324,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"SSH","B":"HTTPS","C":"JWT","D":"TLS"},"question_id":314,"unix_timestamp":1620743100,"question_text":"What is used to validate the authenticity of client and is sent in HTTP requests as a JSON object?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","poster":"RhJ72","comment_id":"424056","content":"JSON Web Token","timestamp":"1644731460.0"},{"comment_id":"1215605","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732274580.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe given answer is correct","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"937087","timestamp":"1703799900.0"},{"timestamp":"1656931620.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"encoding JSON code written in POSTMAN","comment_id":"516609","poster":"youtri"},{"timestamp":"1636647900.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"354773","content":"The given answer is correct","upvote_count":"4"}],"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/52435-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-320-discussion/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-05-11 16:25:00"},{"id":"dL9jZ5RIVOe0B9C04mjg","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1620743100,"isMC":true,"question_text":"What is YANG used for?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"354774","poster":"[Removed]","content":"The given answer is correct","upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1636647900.0"},{"comment_id":"1221283","timestamp":"1732925400.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","poster":"[Removed]"},{"comment_id":"963995","poster":"flash007","content":"Yang is data modling","timestamp":"1706295300.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":324,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/52436-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-321-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_id":315,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-05-11 16:25:00","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"C":"describing data models","A":"scraping data via CLI","D":"providing a transport for network configuration data between client and server","B":"processing SNMP read-only polls"}}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"name":"350-401","numberOfQuestions":1066,"id":324,"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":63},"__N_SSP":true}
