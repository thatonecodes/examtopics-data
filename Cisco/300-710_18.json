With VPNs, you have split-tunnels and full tunnels, so you have to have one or the other with a remote access VPN and neither would fix the problem without a hairpin NAT statement. Split-tunnels is essentially where the network specifies which subnets and hosts are to go across the VPN and which terminate locally out of your modem like normal internet traffic, hence the splitting of the tunnel. \nAnother term for a hairpin is U-Turn, because it essentially leaves your home, goes into the outside interface of the firewall, makes a U-Turn and goes right back out the outside interface of the firewall to the Anyconnect users computer, wherever they may be in the world.
