It is transport-agnostic with respect to transports that do not checksum the IP header, such as SCTP, and to transports that use the TCP/UDP/DCCP (Datagram\nCongestion Control Protocol) pseudo-header and checksum\nNPTv6 provides a simple and compelling solution to meet the address-independence requirement in Ipv6. The address-independence benefit stems directly from the translation function of the network prefix translator. To avoid as many of the issues associated with NAPT44 as possible, NPTv6 is defined to include a two- way, checksum-neutral, algorithmic translation function, and nothing else.\nReference:\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6296","answer":"Explanation","discussion":[{"poster":"Nouraaa","content":"Correct answer : C","comment_id":"844594","timestamp":"1679294760.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"choices":{"A":"It interferes with encryption of the full IP payload.","D":"It rewrites transport layer headers.
