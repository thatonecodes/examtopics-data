When designing a wireless network, it is important to ensure that cells (coverage areas) do not overlap one another.

Channel 1,6,11 is a no brainer. I think E is correct because dynamic channel assignment can change channels in real time without \"turning off the radio\", allowing for the throughput of all the AP's to be optimized in real time with no administrative input. DCA can also deal with / adapt to interference cause by other networks (ex. strip mall wall neighbor). While 5Ghz does have non-overlapping channels, the management of the bands would require that the radio be turned off, and you would have to manually decide on a channel. Once the channel was set, external interference would not be taken into account, the performance would just be worse. The DCA option seems like it would work better and require less involvement."},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"A. 5GHz provides increased network capacity with up to 23 non-overlapping channels.\n\nThis is a 5GHz very useful feature.\nCorrect answer.\n\nB. 5GHz channel selection requires an autonomous access point.\n\nDynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) is a 5GHz feature, but it’s not a design best practice.\nWrong answer.\n\nC.
