In addition, an interface can be assigned to only one security zone. All traffic to and from a given interface in a device with ZBFW configured is implicitly blocked when the interface is assigned to a zone, except traffic to and from other interfaces in the same zone as well as traffic to any interface on the router (that is, the self-zone). IP traffic is implicitly allowed to flow by default among interfaces that are members of the same zone.

This solution treats a router as if it were multiple virtual routers, each of which requires its own rules and policies. In a Zone-Based Firewall setup, interfaces are assigned to zones, and then policies are applied to traffic moving between the zones.","comment_id":"898435"}],"answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"exam_id":327,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1684163940,"question_id":470}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":647,"name":"350-701","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Cisco","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"id":327,"isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":94},"__N_SSP":true}
