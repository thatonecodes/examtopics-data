Essentially, it’s a unique value that can be added to the end of the password to create a different hash value. This adds a layer of security to the hashing process, specifically against brute force attacks. A brute force attack is where a computer or botnet attempt every possible combination of letters and numbers until the password is found.\n\nAnyway, when salting, the additional value is referred to as a “salt.”\n\nThe idea is that by adding a salt to the end of a password and then hashing it, you’ve essentially complicated the password cracking process.\nhttps://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-encryption-hashing-salting/","comment_id":"595158","poster":"ferock"},{"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1704358380.0","comment_id":"516375","poster":"duracell","content":"B is correct."},{"poster":"Teringzooi","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect answer: B\nAlways salting.\nhttps://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-encryption-hashing-salting/","timestamp":"1727544360.0","comment_id":"681975","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"B is correct","timestamp":"1705128480.0","poster":"dsizov","comment_id":"522675","upvote_count":"6"}],"question_text":"A web application is being developed to provide online sales to a retailer.
