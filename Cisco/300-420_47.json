Fast reroute means we switch to another next hop, Loop-free alternate is an alternative path in the network that is loop free.\n\nNow you might be thinking that this sounds familiar. After all, EIGRP has feasible successors. Those are loop-free alternate paths that EIGRP has calculated. If the successor fails, EIGRP can use a feasible successor right away.\n\nThis is true, but there’s one big “gotcha”. EIGRP feasible successors are not installed in the routing table right away. Only the successor route is installed. When the successor fails, EIGRP installs the feasible successor, and this takes time. Fast reroute installs both the successor route and the feasible successor route in the routing table which makes convergence even faster.","comment_id":"1200451","poster":"Kacein"}],"content":"It is A. \nC?!... it is EIGRP.

Enable FRR for the connected networks of routers A and C is the solution that the engineer should select.\n\nFRR (Fast Reroute) is a mechanism that provides fast convergence times during any link or node failure. It works by precomputing alternate backup paths that can be used in case of a failure, eliminating the need for the router to go through a time-consuming SPF calculation.
