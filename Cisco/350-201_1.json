The reverse server acts as an intermediary between the internal web server and external users, reducing the risk of attacks reaching sensitive internal resources.\n\nMoving the web server to the external network (Option E): By placing the web server on the external network (like a demilitarized zone, DMZ), it is isolated from the internal network and better protected from attacks aimed at internal systems."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723911780.0","content":"The two steps that mitigate attacks on the webserver from the Internet are:\n\nA. Create an ACL on the firewall to allow only TLS 1.3: Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides secure communication between web servers and clients over the internet. By creating an Access Control List (ACL) on the firewall to allow only TLS 1.3, the web server can be configured to only accept secure connections from clients. This helps to protect against attacks that try to intercept or eavesdrop on communications.\n\nB. Implement a reverse server in the DMZ network: A reverse proxy server acts as an intermediary between the internet and the web server. It receives all incoming traffic and then forwards it to the web server. By implementing a reverse server in the DMZ network, the web server can be protected from direct exposure to the internet. The reverse proxy server can perform functions such as filtering traffic, caching data, and providing an additional layer of security by masking the web server's IP address.","poster":"DrVoIP","comment_id":"812208"},{"poster":"TOLU1985","timestamp":"1711395840.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nCreate an ACL on the firewall to allow only TLS 1.3\nImplement a proxy server in the DMZ network not sure why they mentioned reverse server... \n\nAB is correct","comment_id":"679046","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"677191","comments":[{"content":"how it related to question? are you bot?","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"679044","poster":"TOLU1985","timestamp":"1711395720.0"}],"content":"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/what-is-enumeration/\nEnumeration is defined as a process which establishes an active connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system.","timestamp":"1711207800.0","poster":"kyle942","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"654332","upvote_count":"1","poster":"jaciro11","timestamp":"1709239440.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nA and B"},{"timestamp":"1704266940.0","content":"You cant use an ACL on a firewall to force TLS 1.3.

This type of activity is often indicative of an attacker gaining sufficient access to create accounts with elevated privileges, which can be used for further malicious activities within the network. The cross-correlation of events from other sources that align with the timing of these account creations strengthens the case for a compromised network. This scenario is consistent with tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence and establish control over network resources for ongoing exploitation1.","timestamp":"1729498800.0","comment_id":"1300830","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1676731980.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"DrVoIP","content":"Compromised insider - ChatGPT","comment_id":"813134"}]},{"id":"dWPjXmj0QHZOp0o8fPwH","topic":"1","answer":"D","choices":{"A":"high risk level, anomalous periodic communication, quarantine with antivirus","D":"high risk level, malicious host, investigate further","B":"critical risk level, malicious server IP, run in a sandboxed environment","C":"critical risk level, data exfiltration, isolate the device"},"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.
