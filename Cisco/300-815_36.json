The EMEA cluster needs a SIP route pattern to route *.apac.collab.corp to the intercluster trunk. If this is misconfigured, missing, or inaccessible, the call will fail.\nIntercluster Trunk (A): The ICT is the connection between the clusters. If it’s down or misconfigured, the call can’t be routed, even with a correct SIP route pattern.\nD. Calling Search Space and Partition: This is a secondary issue. The SIP route pattern itself is the more direct element to check.\nB. Directory URI Partition: This is relevant in the destination cluster, but intra-cluster URI dialing is working, so the Directory URI partitions are likely correct. Remember, the question explicitly states \"URI dialing is implemented and working in each cluster\".\nE. SIP Trunk: This is a distractor, as the intercluster trunk (option A) is the relevant SIP trunk for this scenario. There is no mention of ILS in the question.

In order for Cisco Unified Communications Manager to route calls to a route string, you must configure SIP route patterns that route the destination route strings to the next-hop clusters in your ILS network.","comment_id":"1125110"},{"comment_id":"1110121","poster":"john_doe_9999","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nGoing with C and D on this one.
