In the context of OSPF, this can be influenced by how external prefixes are redistributed into the OSPF network and how their metrics are calculated.\n\nThe most appropriate way to achieve this is:\n\nD.

Typically those prefixes have some \"external\" metric associated with them - for example, E2 external metric or the BGP MED attribute value.

This means that the exit point is selected based on the external metric preference, e.g. distances to the prefix in the bordering routing system.
