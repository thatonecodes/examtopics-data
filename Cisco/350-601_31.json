Their payloads contain a simple XML or JSON payload containing the MO representation of an aaaUser object with the attribute name and pwd defining the username and password: for example, <aaaUser name='admin' pwd='password'/>. The response to the POST operation will contain an authentication token as both a Set-Cookie header and an attribute to the aaaLogin object in the response named token, for which the XPath is /imdata/aaaLogin/@token if the encoding is XML.
