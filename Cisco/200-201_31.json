Indirect evidence is evidence that requires an inference to connect it to a conclusion, while direct evidence provides clear proof of a fact without requiring an inference.","timestamp":"1677031080.0"},{"upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: C\nthis question is very tricky . here is my thought - it depends on what have to approve. if we need to prove that one guy accessed a system he has no access, then the exhibit is 'indirect evidence'. if we need to prove that someone is doing unusual activity (trying login continues), then this is direct evidence.","comment_id":"707044","timestamp":"1667029320.0","poster":"MaliDong"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhile the IP address is unknown, the log entry directly shows suspicious activity (repeated failed login attempts) from a specific IP address. The key here is that direct evidence refers to evidence that, on its own, directly supports a fact or claim without the need for inference.
