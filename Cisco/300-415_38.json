During this process, they also learn whether they are behind a NAT device. When the WAN Edge initially connects to the vBond, it inserts its real IP address into the exchange. When this packet passes through the NAT device, the source IP and possibly the source port are translated. Because the message still contains the WAN Edge real IP and port, the vBond can send a message back to the WAN Edge.
