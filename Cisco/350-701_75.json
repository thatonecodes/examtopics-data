As a cloud-delivered service, Umbrella provides the first line of defense against threats on the internet, wherever users go. It provides organizations the visibility needed to protect internet access across all network devices, office locations, and roaming users. With Umbrella, customers can stop malware infections earlier, identify already-infected devices faster and prevent data exfiltration.\n\nCisco Cloudlock is a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) that helps organizations to secure their identities, data, and applications in the cloud. It provides visibility and control over global cloud activities, enabling organizations to know who is doing what in their cloud applications, protecting against compromised accounts, insider threats, and malware. Cloudlock helps organizations identify and respond to data exposures and leakages as well as privacy and compliance violations."}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
