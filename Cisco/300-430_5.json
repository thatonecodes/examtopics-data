Go to the location where the rogue device is indicated to be and disable the power:\n\nWhile physically disabling the rogue AP is effective, it is not the fastest method. It requires locating the device and manually powering it off, which can be time-consuming.\n\nB. Create an SSID similar to the rogue to disable clients from connecting to it:\n\nCreating a similar SSID is not a reliable or efficient method to disable a rogue AP. It does not stop the rogue AP from broadcasting and may cause confusion for legitimate clients.\n\nD. Classify the rogue as malicious in Cisco Prime Infrastructure:\n\nClassifying the rogue as malicious helps identify it as a threat, but it does not automatically stop the rogue AP from broadcasting.

When a rogue AP is marked as \"contained,\" the system uses nearby authorized access points (APs) to send deauthentication frames to clients connected to the rogue AP, effectively preventing it from operating within the enterprise wireless network.\n\nThis method is automated and does not require physical intervention or manual configuration of SSIDs.","timestamp":"1739745660.0"},{"content":"Guys i strugglet there too you can jamm a AP over Contained on the Prime. \n(Info will get pushed to the WLC) \nAfter this he isnt working anymore and you can search him and power off\n\nSearch for Jamming cool feature but be careful","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1257623","timestamp":"1722275220.0","poster":"MaxMusti"},{"comment_id":"1161493","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA - seems the only way to DISABLE the rogue AP.
