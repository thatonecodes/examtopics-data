Supposedly after that it peers with BGP VPNv4 (redistributing VRF routes from RIP and eBGP from CE1 and CE2) with RR is SP cloud or PE2, whatever. PE2 next hop to HSRP network is PE1. PE2 redistributes HSRP routes fro Site to RIP.

Weight needs to be configured explicitly there is no weight config on the bgp configuration AND only one link has BGP, so only one route to the LAN. CE 1 not running BGP, Weight is a BGP metric.\nC- BW is not taken into account on either RIP or BGP\nD- Here is when it gets \"wordy\" if the question is CE3 to Site1_LAN or Site1_LAN to CE3.
