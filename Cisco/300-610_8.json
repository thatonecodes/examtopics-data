Regarding transport, SNMP is a UDP-only implementation, but Telemetry uses gRPC in addition to UDP/TCP and uses a flow-controlled transport layer. SNMP uses ASN.\nHowever, The NX-API CLI is a web interface through which commands traditionally entered via the CLI, can be encoded using either XML or JSON, and transmitted via HTTP or a secure transport (HTTPS) to the device.

End Host Mode: End Host Mode is essential because it allows the Cisco UCS fabric interconnects to behave as end-host devices, conserving domain IDs and facilitating the control of traffic flow from UCS blades to the SAN. This ensures efficient utilization of domain IDs and simplifies management.\n\nD. N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV): NPIV is crucial for allowing multiple N-Port WWNs to share a single physical port on the Fibre Channel switch. It enables each UCS blade to have its unique WWN and independently log in to the SAN fabric without the need for a separate physical port for each blade. This addresses the requirement to map SAN traffic from UCS blades to specific fabric interconnect ports while conserving domain IDs.\n\nThese two options (B and D) are the correct answers because they directly align with the requirements mentioned in the question, ensuring efficient use of SAN resources and control over UCS blade traffic.\n[High quality and reasonable used Cisco = https://altatechnologies.com/collections/used-cisco ]","poster":"yazmeh"},{"poster":"husam_shabeeb","comment_id":"871693","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1681644240.0","content":"A network engineer is using a Cisco UCS environment connected to a Fibre Channel storage array.\n09/12/2022 â€“ by Mod_GuideK0 \nA network engineer is using a Cisco UCS environment connected to a Fibre Channel storage array.\nThe Cisco UCS environment must be connected to an existing SAN network, and several Cisco MDS 9000 Series Switches must be added to increase storage density.
