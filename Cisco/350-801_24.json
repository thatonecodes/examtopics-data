In addition to traffic classification, queuing and bandwidth provisioning also ensure voice and video quality. \n\nTherefore, QoS trust boundaries should be set up so that the switch will trust the QoS markings that phones place on their own packets. Layer 2 QoS uses a mechanism called class of service (CoS), which operates on the 802.1Q VLAN.\n\nBy default, QoS on a Cisco access switch is disabled. Once enabled, the switch does not trust QoS settings from a phone. Two simple commands can be entered under the global menu on a switch to enable QoS and change the trust boundary. Once it is enabled, you can use a show command to verify these settings. Example 13-1 illustrates the QoS enable and trust boundary commands and the show verification command.","comments":[{"poster":"juanmacipag","content":"Sorry my Answers is - Packets or Ethernet frames are remarked at the access layer switch.\nNot sure if that given answer A has a typo or what.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/QoS_SRND/QoS-SRND-Book/QoSDesign.html\nExample 2-30 Catalyst 2970/3560/3750—Conditionally-Trusted IP Phone + PC + Scavenger (Basic) Model Configuration\n\nCAT2970(config)#mls qos map cos-dscp 0 8 16 24 32 46 48 56\n!
