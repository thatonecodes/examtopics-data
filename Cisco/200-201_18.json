As such, SMB requires network ports on a computer or server to enable communication to other systems. SMB uses either IP port 139 or 445.\n\nPort 139 - SMB originally ran on top of NetBIOS using port 139. NetBIOS is an older transport layer that allows Windows computers to talk to each other on the same network.\nPort 445 - Later versions of SMB (after Windows 2000) began to use port 445 on top of a TCP stack. Using TCP allows SMB to work over the internet.\n\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/smb-port\n\nSMB Ports 139 and 445 are open\nEmail Ports 25 and 110 are closed\nTherefore \"D.

For example, extended sleep calls are used in a variety of malicious software to slow down the execution of the malware, resource exhaustion is used to overload systems and cause them to crash, and encoding is used to obfuscate payloads.
