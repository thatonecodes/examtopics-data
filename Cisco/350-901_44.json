One of the API calls takes roughly three times as long to complete:\n\nThe trace visualization clearly shows that the dnac-list-devices API call takes 13.25 seconds, which is significantly longer than the dnac-auth call, which takes 5 seconds. This difference in duration indicates that the dnac-list-devices call is contributing significantly to the overall delay.\n\nD. Listing devices takes longer than usual due to high network latency:\n\nThe long duration of the dnac-list-devices span (13.25 seconds) suggests that there could be high network latency or other performance issues related to the API call. This is further supported by the fact that listing devices generally involves retrieving a large amount of data, which can be affected by network latency.","timestamp":"1717605360.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1224847","poster":"cryptotafkar"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CE\nD is out because there are other factors for the long response time than just the network latency","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1094658","poster":"razvan999","timestamp":"1702394760.0"},{"poster":"doble_h","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nThe dnac-list-devices API call is taking significantly longer to complete, which is the direct cause of the delay, and this could be due to a variety of reasons, including network latency or the processing time of the API call itself.","timestamp":"1700774880.0","comment_id":"1078832","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nAnswer is C & D no doubt.

It can support the provisioning of up to 500 new virtual machines, ensuring that their configuration is kept in sync and can be updated on-demand. Puppet also supports specifying a list of instructions or steps that must be performed in a precise order to configure a virtual machine, making it a suitable choice for this scenario.\n\nWhile Ansible, Docker, and Terraform are also popular configuration management tools, they are better suited for other use cases.
