You do that under interface/interface range configuration, before you even create the channel group. So there are two more steps beforehand (first selecting the range of interfaces, then creating the channel group). And btw, this IP thing is only for L3 EtherChannel/LAG. L2 LAG does not require an IP.\n\nNow regarding answer E (w/ a caveat); in PT version 8.2.2 0400, you can't immediately issue the \"switchport mode trunk\" (answer E) either. Not sure if this is the case w/ live equipment but, you would first have to issue the command \"encapsulation dot1q\".
