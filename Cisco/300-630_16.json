The designated forwarder makes copies of the BUM frame and sends it to the remote sites. The destination IP address used when VXLAN encapsulating the packet is the special IP address (O-MTEP) identifying each remote site and is used specifically for the transmission of BUM traffic across sites. The O-MTEP is another anycast IP address defined on all the remote spine nodes that are connected to the intersite network (each site uses a unique O-MTEP address).
