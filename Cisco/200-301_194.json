Authentication and authorization are two distinct processes in computer security:\n\nAuthentication: This process verifies the identity of a user or entity attempting to access a system or resource. It typically involves presenting credentials such as a username and password, digital certificates, or biometric information. The goal is to ensure that the user is who they claim to be.\n\nAuthorization: Once authentication is successful, authorization determines what actions or tasks the authenticated user is allowed to perform. It involves checking the user's privileges and permissions to access specific resources, perform certain operations, or execute particular commands. The goal is to control and limit the actions that a user can take within the system based on their authenticated identity.\n\nSo, authentication is about verifying the user's identity, while authorization is about controlling the user's access and actions within the system.","comment_id":"901257","timestamp":"1684417680.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"A","timestamp":"2020-05-07 12:27:00"},{"id":"w1SexeYSIJNdYSOvjj1A","timestamp":"2020-05-07 12:27:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"123855","content":"The reference link in the answer doesn't go anywhere.

Configuring the port type as access and placing the unused ports in a specific VLAN (such as VLAN 99) ensures that any connected devices will not have access to the default VLAN, thereby protecting it.\n\nD. Administratively shutting down the unused ports completely disables them, preventing any traffic from passing through and enhancing security.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to protecting unused ports in the default VLAN:\nA. Configuring the ports as trunk ports is used for carrying multiple VLANs across a single link.\nB.
