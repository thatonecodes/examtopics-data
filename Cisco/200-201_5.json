MAC is the strictest of all levels of control and DAC is object-based access.\n\nMandatory Access Control (MAC) is a security mechanism in which the access to objects is restricted based on predefined rules established by an administrator or the system. These rules take precedence over the user's wishes or personal preferences.\n\nDiscretionary Access Control (DAC) is a security mechanism in which the owner of an object, such as a file or a process, decides who can access it and what they can do with it. The access is based on the discretion of the object's owner.\n\nSo, in summary, MAC is more restrictive and controlled by rules, while DAC is based on the discretion of the object owner.","poster":"drdecker100"},{"poster":"WISDOM2080","comment_id":"994525","timestamp":"1693436460.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"B.

It provides a controlled environment where the application can run with restricted access to system resources and sensitive data. This isolation helps prevent the application from causing harm to the host system or other applications and serves as a security mechanism to contain potential threats. The other options, such as application allow lists, application block lists, and host-based firewalls, can be part of a broader security strategy but do not inherently provide the same level of isolation as a sandbox.","poster":"AhmedAbdalla"},{"comment_id":"687247","content":"Selected Answer: D\nsandbox","poster":"Eng_ahmedyoussef","timestamp":"1696542120.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2022-10-05 23:42:00","topic":"1","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/sandbox#:~:text=Sandboxes%20can%20be%20used%20to,be%20run%20inside%20a%20sandbox","answer":"D"}],"exam":{"name":"200-201","provider":"Cisco","id":287,"isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":322,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":5},"__N_SSP":true}
