However, with the publication of RFC 3768 (which was obsoleted by RFC 5798), authentication mechanisms, including MD5, were removed from the protocol standards for VRRP. The rationale was based on the recognition that such authentication methods provided limited security benefits and could be better addressed through other means, such as securing the management plane of the network.\n\nRFC 5798, which defines VRRPv3 for IPv4 and IPv6, does not include authentication in the VRRP protocol, focusing instead on the operational aspects of router redundancy.\n\nSo, the accurate information reflecting the current standard is that VRRP, as defined in the latest RFCs, does not support MD5 authentication or any form of authentication within the protocol itself."}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"supershysherlock","comment_id":"1178242"},{"poster":"Jasper","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"3938278","content":"chatgpt...you must be kidding.","comment_id":"1189386","timestamp":"1712240280.0"}],"timestamp":"1700243520.0","content":"AD is correct: according GPT Chat:\nRegarding the use of Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) authentication with VRRP, it's important to note that VRRP itself does not have built-in support for MD5 authentication.
