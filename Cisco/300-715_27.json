That's why Cisco recommends using radius server list on the NAD also with LB - to have 2 PSN groups each behind different LB (preferably in different DC).\n\nSISE ebook:\n“NADs have some built-in capabilities to detect when the configured RADIUS server is dead and to automatically fail over to the next RADIUS server configured. When using a load balancer, the RADIUS server IP address is actually the VIP address. So, if the entire VIP address is unreachable (for example, if the load balancer has died), the NAD should quickly fail over to the next RADIUS server in the list.
