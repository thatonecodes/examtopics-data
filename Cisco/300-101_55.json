Sometimes that doesnt happen, though, and the route becomes SIA - Stuck In Active.\nA route becomes SIA when a query goes unanswered for so long that the neighbor relationship is reset. From experience, I can tell you that troubleshooting SIA routes is more of an art form than a science, but there are four main reasons a route becomes SIA:\nThe link is unidirectional, so the query cant possibly be answered. The queried routers resources are unavailable, generally due to high CPU utilization. The queried routers memory is corrupt or otherwise unable to allow the router to answer the query.\nThe link between the two routers is of low quality, allowing just enough packets through to keep the neighbor relationship intact, but not good enough to allow the replies through.\nTo sum it up, routes generally become SIA when a neighbor either doesnt answer a query, or either the query or reply took a wrong turn somewhere.

Four optional keywords can be used with the eigrp stub command to modify this behavior:\n\nreceive-only\n\n\nconnected\n\n\nstatic\n\n\nsummary\n\nThis section provides configuration examples for all forms of the eigrp stub command. The eigrp stub command can be modified with several options, and these options can be used in any combination except for the receive-only keyword. The receive-only keyword will restrict the router from sharing any of its routes with any other router in that EIGRP autonomous system, and the receive-only keyword will not permit any other option to be specified because it prevents any type of route from being sent. The three other optional keywords (connected, static, and summary) can be used in any combination but cannot be used with the receive- only keyword. If any of these three keywords is used individually with the eigrp stub command, connected and summary routes will not be sent automatically.\nThe connected keyword will permit the EIGRP Stub Routing feature to send connected routes. If the connected routes are not covered by a network statement, it may be necessary to redistribute connected routes with the redistribute connected command under the EIGRP process. This option is enabled by default.\nThe static keyword will permit the EIGRP Stub Routing feature to send static routes. Without the configuration of this option, EIGRP will not send any static routes, including internal static routes that normally would be automatically redistributed. It will still be necessary to redistribute static routes with the redistribute static command.\nThe summary keyword will permit the EIGRP Stub Routing feature to send summary routes. Summary routes can be created manually with the summary address command or automatically at a major network border router with the auto-summary command enabled.\nThis option is enabled by default.\nIn the following example, the eigrp stub command is used to configure the router as a stub that advertises connected and summary routes: router eigrp 1 network 10.0.0.0 eigrp stub\nIn the following example, the eigrp stub command is issued with the connected and static keywords to configure the router as a stub that advertises connected and static routes (sending summary routes will not be permitted): router eigrp 1 network 10.0.0.0 eigrp stub connected static\nIn the following example, the eigrp stub command is issued with the receive-only keyword to configure the router as a receive-only neighbor (Connected, summary, and static routes will not be sent): router eigrp 1 network 10.0.0.0 eigrp eigrp stub receive-only\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1829/products_feature_guide09186a00 80087026.html","question_id":275,"answer_ET":"E.
