However, D is the best answer because the question states that the building is historic and adding APs is difficult. Therefore you would not want to switch existing client serving local access points to monitor mode as this would create coverage holes not easily filled by adding coverage.

When a radio is on its serving channel it is considered “on-channel”, when the radio is scanning other channels, it is considered “off-channel”.\n\nAn AP in local mode is mostly “on-channel”, making it difficult to detect attackers “off-channel”. A monitor mode AP is always “off-channel”, but cannot server clients, the WSM module provides a great combination of both.","timestamp":"1714664280.0","comment_id":"887629","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Vlad_Is_Love_ua"},{"comment_id":"858844","poster":"Bergin_a","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712062380.0","content":"B is coreect"},{"poster":"Citizenx","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"596500","content":"correct, the on-channel says no need to scan other channels.","timestamp":"1683174240.0"},{"poster":"kthekillerc","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1664883000.0","comment_id":"457077","content":"provided answer is correct"}],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (88%)","13%"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/63563-exam-300-430-topic-1-question-2-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"An engineer must implement intrusion protection on the WLAN.

Here’s why:\n\nVoice VLAN:\nThis feature allows the switch to separate voice traffic (from devices like IP phones) from data traffic (from connected wireless clients). By assigning the IP phone to a dedicated Voice VLAN, the switch can prioritize voice traffic using QoS policies, ensuring high-quality voice communication.\n\nHow it works:\nThe IP phone is connected to the switch, and wireless clients may connect through the phone. The switch tags voice traffic with the Voice VLAN ID and applies QoS policies to prioritize it, while data traffic is handled separately.","poster":"rrahim","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1359882","timestamp":"1740166500.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA Voice VLAN is specifically designed to separate voice traffic from data traffic on the network.
