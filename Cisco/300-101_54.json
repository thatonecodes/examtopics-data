Therefore, only when a topology change occurs does routing information get sent. Regarding processor utilization, the feasible successor technology greatly reduces the total processor utilization of an AS by requiring only the routers that were affected by a topology change to perform the route recomputation. Furthermore, the route recomputation only occurs for routes that were affected. Only those data structures are accessed and used. This greatly reduces search time in complex data structures.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093f07.shtml (See frequently asked questions)","unix_timestamp":1581546060,"answer_ET":"E.

This is not the default metric of OSPF Type\n2 External route (the default value is 20) so the metrics of redistributed routes have been modified.
