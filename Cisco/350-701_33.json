First of all the question asks \"What are the two most COMMONLY used factors in multifactor authentication?\" Knowlege for sure, and time is referring to a one-time verification code, and these are the two most common. Biometric is not common. From the Official Study Guide \"Wtih multifactor authentication, accounts are protected by something you know (password) and something you have (one-time verification code provided to you).\""},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1620862620.0","content":"time factor might be referring to TOTP as mentioned below by JC1418. That is where you login with your username and password, then your receive a One Time Password by SMS or email, that is Time based in that it expires in a few minutes. In my experience, the most common are knowledge (passwords and pins), then token/possesion(atm cards, credit cards, rsa token fobs, token-apps), then time-based (described above), biometrics isnt that common outside of smartphones.","comment_id":"355842","poster":"trickbot"},{"content":"time factor? who uses that?\nCisco/DUO consider biometric under inheritance, but it's still the best answer for me","timestamp":"1615318620.0","comment_id":"306639","poster":"Kris92","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1612754040.0","poster":"JC1418","content":"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-multi-factor-authentication.html#~how-mfa-works\n\nWhat are examples of multi-factor authentication?\nThe most common example of MFA is the process for using an ATM at a bank. To gain access to their accounts, users must insert a bank card (a physical factor) and enter a PIN (a knowledge factor).\n\nAnother familiar example is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) method, used by financial institutions and other large enterprises to secure workflows, applications, and accounts. Upon requesting login, users are asked to provide a temporary passcode that has been sent via a text message, phone call, or email.","comment_id":"285945","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"The answers are A,D","poster":"Richview","comments":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1601406240.0","content":"You are absolutely correct.
