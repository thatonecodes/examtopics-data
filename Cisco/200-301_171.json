NTP (Network Time Protocol)\n\nIP SLA (Internet Protocol Service Level Agreement) is a feature in Cisco IOS that allows administrators to measure and monitor network performance. One of the types of performance measurements that can be performed using IP SLA is UDP jitter, which is a measure of the variability in the delay of UDP packets.\n\nTo measure UDP jitter using IP SLA, the NTP (Network Time Protocol) feature must be enabled on the device. NTP is used to synchronize the device's clock with a reference time source, which is necessary to accurately measure the delay of UDP packets. Without NTP, the device's clock may drift over time, leading to inaccurate jitter measurements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. NTP.","upvote_count":"15"},{"upvote_count":"15","content":"Correct Answer.
