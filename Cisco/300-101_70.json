The following table provides a high-level overview of the most relevant differences.\nTable 2. Differences Between Stateless NAT64 and Stateful NAT64\n\nStateless NAT64 Stateful NAT64 -\n1:1 translation 1:N translation\nNo conservation of IPv4 address Conserves IPv4 address\nAssures end-to-end address Uses address overloading, hence lacks transparency and scalability in end-to-end address transparency\nNo state or bindings created on the State or bindings are created on every translation unique translation\nRequires IPv4-translatable IPv6 No requirement on the nature of IPv6 addresses assignment (mandatory address assignment requirement)\nRequires either manual or DHCPv6 Free to choose any mode of IPv6 based address assignment for IPv6 address assignment viz. Manual, hosts DHCPv6,\n\nSLAAC -\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/ios-nx-os-software/enterprise-ipv6- solution/white_paper_c11-676277.html","exam_id":296,"topic":"2","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14086-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-529-discussion/"},{"id":"3BAPBv8JhG6fv0GuvhcL","question_id":347,"answer_ET":"D.
