GETVPN (Group Encrypted Transport VPN) is a type of VPN that uses a combination of public key and group key infrastructure (GKI) to provide encryption and secure communications for a group of network devices. One of the key features of GETVPN is that the configuration that defines which traffic to encrypt originates from the key server. This allows the key server to control which traffic is encrypted and which is not, providing a high degree of flexibility and security.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Net4dd","comment_id":"781811"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720276080.0","poster":"jbwo47","comment_id":"767888","content":"Selected Answer: A\nKS (key server) is ‘caretaker’ of the GM group.

On the other hand, Cisco AnyConnect is a remote access VPN solution, primarily used for secure remote connectivity to a network.

The NHRP Network ID is used to identify and group routers together within the DMVPN network. It ensures that routers can communicate with each other and exchange routing information correctly. On the other hand, the GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel Key is used to differentiate multiple tunnels between the same source and destination IP addresses. Each tunnel will have a unique GRE Tunnel Key, which helps in identifying and forwarding traffic correctly within the DMVPN network. So, to summarize, the parameter that needs to match on all routers in a DMVPN Phase 3 cloud is the NHRP Network ID.
