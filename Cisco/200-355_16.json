Required EIRP is 200 mw which is 1*10*10*2 or 0 dbm + 10 db + 10 db + 3 db. So 200 mW = 23 dbm\n\n \n\n 2. Antenna gain is 21 dbi\n\n \n\n 3. Since total EIRP is the product of conducted power plus antena gain and the latter is a given, then power fed to the antenna = 23 dbm minus 21 db = 2 dbm\n\n \n\n 4. So in order to achieve a 23 dbm EIRP, we need to feed 2 dbm to the antenna.\n\n \n\n 5. Now we need to compensate for the loss introduced by the cable which is 2 mW or 0 dbm + 3 db. so\n\n \n\n configured Tx power = 2 dbm + 3 db = 5 dbm\n\n \n\n 6. From all of the above we arrive at the conclusion that in order to achieve a 23 dbm (200 mW) EIRP in the given scenario, we would need to configure the radio with a 5 dbm (3.16 mW) Tx power setting."}],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-08-13 00:44:00","choices":{"C":"3.16mW","B":"3dBm","D":"5mW","A":"8mW"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An installation uses a 21dBi parabolic dish.
