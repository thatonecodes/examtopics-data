This means you’re freed from the hassle of installing and maintaining agent software on the nodes you manage. Simply put, all you need is SSH access, and you’re good to go. This simplicity is one of the cornerstones of Ansible’s broad appeal. \n\nYet Ansible’s human-readable declarative language, YAML, truly sets it apart. Users can quickly outline and execute complex tasks using playbooks—YAML scripts defining configurations and tasks.
