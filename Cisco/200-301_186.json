By changing the value of the DSCP field, the packet is marked with a specific priority or class, allowing routers and switches along the network path to apply appropriate QoS policies and forwarding behaviors.\n\nMarking is crucial in QoS implementation as it enables network devices to identify and treat packets differently based on their class of service, ensuring that higher-priority traffic, such as voice or real-time applications, receives preferential treatment and appropriate QoS handling.","timestamp":"1703425620.0","comment_id":"932513"}],"question_id":929},{"id":"HVWnvzRfmQIRdg2HEPV9","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"14","timestamp":"1634553300.0","poster":"ZUMY","comment_id":"338116","content":"A is correct!"},{"upvote_count":"9","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis question was in my exam","timestamp":"1731868500.0","comment_id":"1212964"},{"poster":"kyut99","timestamp":"1725539520.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1166540","content":"really obscure question. can't find anything about SoHo WAN tech on official sites."},{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"759604","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1687935300.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nRef: Connecting Networks v6 Companion Guide\n\n“Chapter 4\nWAN Concepts\n…\nSelecting a WAN Technology\n…\nWAN Link Connection Options\n…\nPublic WAN infrastructure:… Broadband connections are typically used to connect small offices and telecommuting employees to a corporate site over the Internet.\n…”\n\nA. broadband cable access\n\nCorrect answer\n\nB. frame-relay packet switching\n\nWrong answer.\n\nC. dedicated point-to-point leased line\n\nWrong answer.\n\nD.
