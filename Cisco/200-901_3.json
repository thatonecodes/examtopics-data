These resources are identified by a URL and are defined within the API. For example, an API may define a resource called \"customers\", which can be accessed using the URL \"http://api.example.com/customers\". To retrieve a list of customers, the client could make a GET request to this URL. To create a new customer, the client could make a POST request to the same URL with the necessary data in the request body.\n\nIn contrast, in an RPC API, operations are performed by making function calls. The client makes a request to the server, specifying the function to be called and any necessary parameters. The server then executes the function and returns the result to the client. RPC APIs are operation-oriented, meaning that the focus is on the function being called rather than the resource being accessed.","poster":"mellohello","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"2022-06-11 23:47:00","unix_timestamp":1654984020,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/76730-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-109-discussion/","exam_id":291,"choices":{"D":"In a REST API, operations are performed on an internal resource that is defined on the API, but RPC APIs are resource-oriented.","B":"In a REST API, operations are performed on an external resource that is defined on the API, but the RCP APIs are resource-oriented.","A":"In a REST API, operations are performed on an object (node) that is identified by a URL, but RPC APIs are operation-oriented.","C":"In a REST API, operations are performed on a platform that is identified by the URL, but RPC APIs are platform-oriented."},"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","answers_community":["A (82%)","D (18%)"],"answer_description":"","topic":"1"},{"id":"0iuuf9oAhqG8CI7ZHbCS","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04301/0000600001.png"],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1591494300,"question_id":13,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1592671980.0","poster":"FireTv","comment_id":"114892","content":"D\njson is Data format, which is kept in python dictionary (my_json) data structure here in the example"},{"poster":"thanh3d","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"104232","content":"D is right","timestamp":"1591494300.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. dict\n\nThe json.loads(json_string) function in Python converts a JSON-formatted string into a Python dictionary (dict).","poster":"daniii89","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1349176","timestamp":"1738261080.0"},{"poster":"designated","comment_id":"548107","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727422740.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe right answer is D.\nDictionaries are analogous to \"hashes\" in some other languages. A dictionary is a data structure that stores simple key-value pairs. They make it very easy and fast to store and retrieve a value by supplying a key to be used as an index for that value. Values: The values in a Python dictionary can be anything, and like lists the types don't have to be consistent. Keys: A dictionary's keys have an important restriction: Whatever you want to use as a key has to be immutable and hash-able. This means that you could use a tuple as a key (immutable), but not a list (mutable). Also note that all of the basic data types that you learned about previously (int, float, bool, str, bytes ) are immutable and can be used as dictionary keys. You create a dictionary by using curly braces {] , separating a key from its value with a colon : , and separating the key-value pairs with commas. You can access and update elements using indexing; however, instead of using numerical sequential index numbers, you use the key as the index. You can add new elements simply by assigning a value to a new key."},{"poster":"netlol","upvote_count":"1","content":"In this exercise they only wanted to know if you know what does the \"loads\" function returns.. and it returns a dictionary in python","comment_id":"689416","timestamp":"1665239040.0"},{"poster":"Niki_nik","content":"Selected Answer: D\ndict.\nthe picture shows the key and the object","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1663901280.0","comment_id":"676709"},{"timestamp":"1653842820.0","poster":"macxsz","comment_id":"608848","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nType is dict.\nD"},{"poster":"obiwan_kenobi","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"371627","timestamp":"1622529240.0","content":"It should be \"Ford Prefect\""},{"comment_id":"330469","comments":[{"comment_id":"362337","poster":"aprettyparrot","content":"A dict can have lists inside of it, the keys can point to any type","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1621527540.0"},{"comment_id":"725168","content":"The question is what does my_json contain.\nyes, json_string is a json containing also a list,\nbut after loading json_string into my_json the json becomes a python dictionary\n\nso D is correct","timestamp":"1669210680.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"nospampls"}],"poster":"richard2865","upvote_count":"1","content":"I will take your work for it, but I see a dictionary and a list here... {} and [].","timestamp":"1617807540.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"D is right answer.","comment_id":"180748","poster":"NitinPathak","timestamp":"1600327920.0"}],"answer":"D","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"json","B":"list","D":"dict","A":"map"},"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nWhich Python data structure does my_json contain?","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/22396-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-11-discussion/","exam_id":291,"timestamp":"2020-06-07 03:45:00","answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"sQTgb0WV51qsj7X3KeS0","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://moz.com/learn/seo/http-status-codes","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-06-11 23:51:00","answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/76731-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-110-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1654984260,"answer_images":[],"question_id":14,"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"exam_id":291,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725587460.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","comment_id":"660693","upvote_count":"1","poster":"aplicacion101"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\n1xx - Informational: The server has received the request and is continuing the process \n2xx - Successful: The request was successful and the browser has received the expected information \n3xx (Redirection): You have been redirected and the completion of the request requires further action\n4xx (Client Error): The website or the page could not be reached, either the page is unavailable or the request contains bad syntax \n5xx (Server Error): While the request appears to be valid, the server could not complete the request","comment_id":"615088","timestamp":"1718142660.0","poster":"macxsz"}],"choices":{"C":"200","B":"500","D":"300","A":"400"},"question_text":"Which HTTP error code series relates to redirection?","topic":"1"},{"id":"Dx0Kv50EtXzfv8nxt8fZ","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-06-22 18:40:00","answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/23748-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-111-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1592844000,"answer_images":[],"question_id":15,"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"exam_id":291,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1655916000.0","comment_id":"116609","upvote_count":"28","poster":"Anyone123","content":"It’s D."},{"comment_id":"118329","content":"AMP for Endpoints identifies vulnerable software across your environment to help reduce the attack surface.
