Network Policy Server (NPS):\nNPS is a Microsoft implementation of RADIUS and is primarily used for network access control, not device administration.\nB. RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service):\nRADIUS is more suited for network access authentication (e.g., wireless or VPN) and lacks the granular authorization capabilities of TACACS+.\nD.
