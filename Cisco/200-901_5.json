JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write and is commonly used in RESTful APIs.\n\nIn addition to JSON, RESTCONF also supports the Extensible Markup Language (XML) as a data-encoding method. You can specify which data-encoding method to use by including the appropriate media type in the \"Content-Type\" header of the RESTCONF request. For example, to use JSON encoding, you would include the media type \"application/yang-data+json\" in the \"Content-Type\" header.
