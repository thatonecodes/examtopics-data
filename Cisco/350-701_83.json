In XSS, an attacker will try to inject his malicious code (usually malicious links) into a database.

In a SQL Injection, an attacker will try to inject SQL code (via his browser) into forms, cookies, or HTTP headers that do not use data sanitizing or validation methods of GET/POST parameters.\nNote: The main difference between a SQL and XSS injection attack is that SQL injection attacks are used to steal information from databases whereas XSS attacks are used to redirect users to websites where attackers can steal data from them.","timestamp":"1668332220.0","poster":"Metgatz","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"601010"},{"timestamp":"1661173860.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAn attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user.
