Here's why:\n\nmDNS Protocol:\nmDNS allows devices to discover services (e.g., AppleTV, printers) on the local network using multicast traffic. By default, mDNS traffic is broadcast across the entire network, including all AP groups and buildings.\n\nLack of Filtering:\nIf no Access Control List (ACL) or filtering mechanism is in place to restrict mDNS traffic between AP groups or buildings, services like AppleTV will be discovered across the entire network, even in locations where they are not physically present.","comments":[{"poster":"rrahim","timestamp":"1739641080.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Option A: AppleTV service is discovered as a wired service provider.\n\nThis is unrelated to the issue. The problem is not about whether AppleTV is wired or wireless but about the mDNS traffic being broadcast across the network.\n\nOption B: mDNS service is configured as a wireless service provider for user access.\n\nWhile mDNS is indeed a service used for discovery, the issue is not about its configuration but about the lack of filtering to restrict its advertisement.\n\nOption C: Lightweight APs incorrectly filter mDNS service for each location.\n\nLightweight APs do not inherently filter mDNS traffic.

Here's why:\n\nCoS (802.1p):\nCoS is a Layer 2 QoS marking found in the 802.1Q VLAN tag of Ethernet frames. It is used to prioritize traffic on trunk ports, which carry multiple VLANs. Since trunk ports handle VLAN-tagged traffic, trusting the CoS value ensures that voice traffic is prioritized consistently across the network.\n\nWhy CoS is Critical for Trunk Ports:\n\nTrunk ports carry traffic for multiple VLANs, and the CoS value in the 802.1Q header is used to prioritize this traffic.\n\nBy trusting the CoS value, the wireless controller ensures that voice traffic (which is typically marked with a high CoS value, such as 5 or 6) receives the appropriate priority as it traverses the network.","timestamp":"1739641200.0","poster":"rrahim","comments":[{"content":"Option A: DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point):\nDSCP is a Layer 3 QoS marking used in the IP header. While DSCP is important for end-to-end QoS, it is not directly relevant to trunk ports, which operate at Layer 2.\nOption C: IP Precedence:\nIP Precedence is an older Layer 3 QoS marking that has largely been replaced by DSCP. It is not used for prioritizing traffic on trunk ports.\nOption D: 802.1p:\n802.1p is actually the same as CoS.

Here’s why:\n\nMark:\nThe mark action in an AVC rule allows you to apply a QoS marking (e.g., DSCP or UP) to the traffic that matches the rule. For Cisco IP cameras, you can create an AVC rule to identify the traffic and mark it with a high-priority QoS value (e.g., Platinum for video traffic). This ensures that the IP camera traffic is prioritized on the wireless network.\n\nHow it works:\nAVC uses deep packet inspection (DPI) to identify specific applications or traffic types.

An invalid user account or password was used:\n\nThe RADIUS server may have rejected the authentication request because the username or password provided by the client is incorrect. This is a common cause of Access-Reject messages.\n\nB.
