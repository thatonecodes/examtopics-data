If you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as key/value pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g. httpbin.org/get?key=val. Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary of strings, using the params keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass key1=value1 and key2=value2 to httpbin.org/get, you would use the following code:\n\npayload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\nr = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)\nYou can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL:\n\nprint(r.url)\nhttps://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1"}],"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/300-910/image25.png"],"question_id":101,"isMC":false,"answer_ET":"","unix_timestamp":1673438520,"exam_id":322,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/94804-exam-300-910-topic-1-question-88-discussion/","answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/300-910/image23.png","https://img.examtopics.com/300-910/image24.png"],"answer":"","answer_description":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nRefer to the exhibit.
