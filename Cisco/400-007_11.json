It provides robust features for container orchestration, automated scaling, service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. Kubernetes can handle complex deployments and manage the state of containers, ensuring that the desired state is maintained even in dynamic environments.\n\nPuppet, Ansible, and Terraform are all configuration management and infrastructure provisioning tools, but they are not primarily designed for container orchestration or managing the state of containerized applications like Kubernetes.

A centralized controller can support all southbound APIs, which allows for easy integration with legacy equipment. The controller acts as a central point of control and can communicate with network devices using southbound APIs. This allows for seamless integration with existing legacy equipment, enabling centralized management and control.\n\nE. Scaling of the centralized controller cluster is challenging for services like DHCP and load-balancing. As the network grows and the number of devices and services increases, scaling the centralized controller cluster can become challenging, especially for services that require stateful handling such as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and load-balancing. The stateful nature of these services adds complexity to the scaling process.\n\nThe other statements (A, B, D) are not accurate descriptions of a centralized SDN control path.","poster":"J_W","timestamp":"1733136840.0"},{"timestamp":"1725732420.0","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nCE is good","poster":"gcpengineer","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"832256"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"I believe it's CE.
