This ensures that the authentication process can be completed without compatibility issues.\n\nKey Points:\nAuthenticator: In a wireless network, the authenticator is typically the WLC or the access point (AP) that handles the 802.1X authentication process.\n\nAuthentication Protocol: Common protocols include EAP-TLS, PEAP, EAP-FAST, and others. The client and the authenticator must agree on a supported protocol for authentication to succeed.\n\nLegacy Clients: Older devices may only support specific authentication protocols (e.g., PEAP or EAP-MD5), so the authenticator must also support these protocols to accommodate them.","comment_id":"1359077","poster":"rrahim","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1728797280.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1042325","poster":"[Removed]","content":"The client and the authentication server must support the same authentication protocol.
