LISP eliminates router processing for every IP destination address and route by moving the remote destination information to the LISP Map Server (MS), a centralized mapping database, and a control plane node in SD-Access. The LISP MS allows the routers to manage their local routes and query the map system to locate destination Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs).\n\nIt provides SD-Access benefits such as smaller routing tables, dynamic host mobility for wireless and wired network endpoints, and built-in network segmentation via VRF instances.

Stateful Switchover (SSO).\n\nStateful Switchover (SSO) is a feature that allows graceful restart to recover from a processor failure in a network device. SSO enables a device to maintain its forwarding capability while recovering from a processor failure, minimizing the impact on network traffic. This is accomplished by synchronizing the control plane information between the active and standby processors in the device. In the event of a processor failure, the standby processor takes over the control plane functions without causing any disruption to the forwarding plane.","timestamp":"1714320900.0"},{"comment_id":"845846","upvote_count":"1","content":"Cc is correct","timestamp":"1711019880.0","poster":"DOSKIM"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"761486","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727461200.0","content":"You need to learn how to read.
