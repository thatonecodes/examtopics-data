Say the sender device is sending segments and the receiver device can accommodate only a fixed number of segments before it can accept more, the two devices negotiate the window size during the connection setup.\nThis is done so that the sending device doesn't overflow the receiving device's buffer. Also the receiving device can send a single acknowledgement for the segments it has received instead of sending an acknowledgement after every segment received. Also, this window size is dynamic meaning, the devices can negotiate and change the window size in the middle of a session. So if initially the window size is three and the receiving device thinks that it can accept more number of segments in its buffer it can negotiate with the sending device and it increase it to say 5 for example. Windowing is used only by TCP since UDP doesn't use or allow flow control.","choices":{"E":"load balancing ACD","B":"cut-through","D":"congestion avoidance","C":"windowing","A":"buffering"},"unix_timestamp":1568785740,"isMC":true}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":87,"id":283,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"name":"100-105","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":1},"__N_SSP":true}
