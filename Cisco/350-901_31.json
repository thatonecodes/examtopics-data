Set the minimum_master_nodes to 2 in the configuration.\n\nSetting the minimum_master_nodes to 2 ensures that in the event of a network partition, the cluster will not form a split brain scenario, which can lead to data inconsistencies and potential data loss. This setting ensures that there is a majority of nodes required to form a cluster. In case of a network issue or failure, if one set of nodes can't communicate with the other set, it won't form a separate cluster, ensuring data consistency and cluster survivability.\n\nOther options do not directly address the requirements stated, and some could even lead to potential data inconsistencies or failure in meeting the specified design goals.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1717045260.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nTo meet the requirements of the design approach, you need to add a third cluster node to provide majority votes. There should normally be an odd number of master-eligible nodes in a cluster.
