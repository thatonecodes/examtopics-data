When split horizon is enabled on an interface, these packets are not sent for destinations for which this interface is the next hop. This reduces the possibility of routing loops.\nBy default, split horizon is enabled on all interfaces. Split horizon blocks route information from being advertised by a router out of any interface from which that information originated. This behavior usually optimizes communications among multiple routing devices, particularly when links are broken. However, with nonbroadcast networks (such as Frame Relay and SMDS), situations can arise for which this behavior is less than ideal. For these situations, you may want to disable split horizon. In this example, routes received by RTB and RTC are not being sent back out the same serial interface on RTA, so they are not receiving each other`s routes. Disabling Split horizons on interface S0/0 on RTA will fix this issue.","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2020-02-12 22:38:00","answer":"F.

In a hub and spoke network, one or more end (stub) networks are connected to a remote router (the spoke) that is connected to one or more distribution routers (the hub). The remote router is adjacent only to one or more distribution routers.\nThe only route for IP traffic to follow into the remote router is through a distribution router. This type of configuration is commonly used in WAN topologies where the distribution router is directly connected to a WAN. The distribution router can be connected to many more remote routers. Often, the distribution router will be connected to 100 or more remote routers. In a hub and spoke topology, the remote router must forward all nonlocal traffic to a distribution router, so it becomes unnecessary for the remote router to hold a complete routing table. Generally, the distribution router need not send anything more than a default route to the remote router.\nWhen using the EIGRP Stub Routing feature, you need to configure the distribution and remote routers to use EIGRP, and to configure only the remote router as a stub. Only specified routes are propagated from the remote (stub) router. The router responds to queries for summaries, connected routes, redistributed static routes, external routes, and internal routes with the message \"inaccessible.\" A router that is configured as a stub will send a special peer information packet to all neighboring routers to report its status as a stub router.\nAny neighbor that receives a packet informing it of the stub status will not query the stub router for any routes, and a router that has a stub peer will not query that peer. The stub router will depend on the distribution router to send the proper updates to all peers.\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_0s/feature/guide/eigrpstb.html","topic":"2","isMC":true,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/n18841100000.jpg"],"exam_id":296,"unix_timestamp":1581543720,"answer_ET":"E.
