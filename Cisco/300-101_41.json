Each route that is redistributed into OSPF from other protocols is advertised individually with an external LSA. To reduce the size of the OSPF LSDB, you can configure a summary for external routes. Summarization of external routes can be done on the ASBR for type 5 LSAs (redistributed routes) before injecting them into the OSPF domain. Without summarization, all the redistributed external prefixes from external autonomous systems are passed into the OSPF area. A summary route to Null0 is created automatically for each summary range.\n\nThe ASBR will summarize external routes before injecting them into the OSPF domain as type 5 external LSAs. Table 3-4 shows the parameters used with the summary-address command.
