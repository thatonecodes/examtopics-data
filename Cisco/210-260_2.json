If a port configured for Root Guard receives a superior BPDU, instead of believing the BPDU, the port goes into a root-inconsistent state. While a port is in the root-inconsistent state, no user data is sent across it. However, after the superior BPDUs stop, the port returns to the forwarding state.\n\nThe BPDU Guard feature is enabled on ports configured with the Cisco PortFast feature. The PortFast feature is enabled on ports that connect to end-user devices, such as PCs. It reduces the amount of time required for the port to go into forwarding state after being connected. The logic of PortFast is that a port that connects to an end-user device does not have the potential to create a topology loop. Therefore, the port can go active sooner by skipping STPs listening and learning states, which by default take 15 seconds each. Because these PortFast ports are connected to end-user devices, they should never receive a BPDU.\nTherefore, if a port enabled for BPDU Guard receives a BPDU, the port is disabled.\nReference:\nhttps://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/4575","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1554373680,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"40635","timestamp":"1579448040.0","poster":"max80","content":"stats:\nblock - it's root guard\ndisable - it's bpdu guard"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"\"STP root guard\" is ok","comment_id":"38063","poster":"jocarul","timestamp":"1578834360.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer is root guard (C)","comment_id":"23321","poster":"piccione17","timestamp":"1574341200.0"},{"comment_id":"1107","upvote_count":"2","content":"should be C","poster":"ciscotesting22","timestamp":"1554373680.0"}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"loop guard","D":"EtherChannel guard","A":"STP BPDU guard","C":"STP Root guard"},"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/846-exam-210-260-topic-1-question-178-discussion/","isMC":true}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":134,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"id":294,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco","name":"210-260","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":2},"__N_SSP":true}
