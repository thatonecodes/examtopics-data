This includes specifying the name of the vCenter server and associating it with the VMM domain.\nLogon Credentials (E):\nThe APIC requires administrator-level credentials (username and password) to authenticate and connect to the VMware vCenter. These credentials are used to establish communication between Cisco ACI and vCenter.\nThese two attributes, cluster name and logon credentials, are essential for establishing a connection between Cisco ACI and VMware vCenter, enabling seamless integration and management of virtualized environments."},{"comment_id":"1166979","poster":"zelya19","timestamp":"1725600300.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nData Center name is specified in Create vCenter Controller screen"}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-03-03 01:03:00","question_id":186,"answer":"BE"},{"id":"33VXtEjV4oH5mgwvfeSV","question_text":"Which tunnel endpoint is shown in this output from interface Io0?\n\n//IMG//","timestamp":"2024-02-18 19:10:00","unix_timestamp":1708279800,"answer":"A","isMC":true,"exam_id":312,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":187,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/300-620/image81.png"],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/134152-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-268-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nLoopback 0 is physical tunnel endpoint","poster":"ed27","timestamp":"1708279800.0","comment_id":"1153476","upvote_count":"6"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"designated","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe lo0 interface with its assigned IP address acts as the VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP), enabling VXLAN encapsulation within the ACI fabric.
