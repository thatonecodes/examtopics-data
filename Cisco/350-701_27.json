The attacker needs to know what weaknesses the system has, so they can plan their attack accordingly.\n\nAnswer A is correct because if the VPN links are not encrypted, then any data transmitted over those links, including passwords, can be intercepted and read by an attacker. This allows the attacker to see the passwords being transmitted in clear text and potentially use them to gain access to the system.","poster":"sull3y","timestamp":"1690176000.0"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"tZumoYiHwV3rZFEST2G4","timestamp":"2021-08-24 07:36:00","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"14","timestamp":"1630332600.0","comment_id":"435558","poster":"fabio3wz","content":"It should be anycast IP.

The .PAC file can be hosted on a web server and can be referenced by the client browser to automatically configure the proxy settings.\n\nIn explicit proxy mode, the client desktop browser must be configured to use the proxy for all outbound connections. With a .PAC file, the client desktop browser can be configured to select when to connect directly to a target resource or when to use the proxy based on the destination URL.
