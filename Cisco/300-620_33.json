By default, Cisco Nexus 9000 switches in NX-OS mode perform an MTU check during the OSPF adjacency negotiation process. If the MTU values on the interfaces of BLeaf1 and Core1 do not match, the adjacency will fail to establish.\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that both devices have matching MTU settings. Changing the MTU on Core1 to match BLeaf1 will allow the OSPF adjacency to form successfully. This is a common troubleshooting step when dealing with OSPF adjacency issues caused by MTU mismatches.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"prospio971","comment_id":"1353930"},{"timestamp":"1723922460.0","comment_id":"1152828","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ed27"}],"timestamp":"2024-02-17 22:21:00","answer_description":"","question_id":164,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/134084-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-247-discussion/","answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1708204860,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Configure Area 1 on BLeaf1.","C":"Disable Hello Timer on BLeaf1.","D":"Change the MTU on Core1.","A":"Set and Auth Key on Core1."},"question_text":"An engineer configures an L3Out between BLeaf1 and Core1.
