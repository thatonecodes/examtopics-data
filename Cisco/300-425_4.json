Client SSO does not support seamless transitions for clients that are in the process of associating/joining the controller. The clients in the transition phase will be de-authenticated after switchover and will need to rejoin the controller.\n\nno deatails about the WLC status in public spaces. in that case we assume that there is no issue with the connetivity between WLCs\nRound trip latency on Redundancy Link should be less than or equal to 80 milliseconds.\nPreferred MTU on Redundancy Link is 1500 or above.\nBandwidth on Redundancy Link should be 60 Mbps or more.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Lakshan__97","comment_id":"1224335"},{"comment_id":"1180388","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis is tough - both B and D are valid answers here (typical Cisco SMH).... but I think the key word is \"public\", which tells me a lot of clients might be in the \"WebAuth_Req\" state because it's a public space and clients have to authenticate first and Cisco is likely looking for D as the answer.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1711148100.0","poster":"jzzmth"},{"timestamp":"1707195900.0","comment_id":"1141771","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Bandito","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI'd say the correct answer is D afterall.
