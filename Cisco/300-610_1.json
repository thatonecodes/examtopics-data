This is a significant shift from Layer 2 switching that traditionally leverages data plane learning, and it is justified by the need to limit flooding of Layer 2 traffic across the transport infrastructure. As outlined in this chapter, Layer 2 communication between sites resembles routing more than switching. If the destination MAC address information is unknown, traffic is dropped (not flooded), preventing the waste of precious bandwidth across the WAN\n\nAnswer is C","comment_id":"592785"},{"timestamp":"1648393920.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct answer is C -- see slide 18:\nhttps://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/us/docs/2018/pdf/BRKDCN-2931.pdf","poster":"Manu_75","comment_id":"576280"},{"timestamp":"1641898680.0","content":"Shouldn't this be option - B?\n\nOTV supports head-end replication when multicast is not supported in the core, so no need to broadcast the traffic to all sites.","poster":"gu33mis","comment_id":"521469","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"557562","timestamp":"1645990440.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1316184","poster":"lurker8000","timestamp":"1732258020.0","content":"Loop on p2p?
