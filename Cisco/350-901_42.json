Use fewer API calls to create a more efficient endpoint.\nE. Check for HTTP code 429 and wait until Retry-After time before further calls are made.\n\nTo improve the performance of the application, two possible changes are:\n\n1. Use fewer API calls to create a more efficient endpoint. This would reduce the number of requests sent to the Meraki API and reduce the load on the server.\nCheck for HTTP code 429 and wait until Retry-After time before further calls are made. The 2. HTTP code 429 indicates that the API rate limit has been exceeded, and the Retry-After header indicates the number of seconds to wait before making another request. Implementing this check would help avoid unnecessary errors and prevent the application from overloading the Meraki API."},{"upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"789638","content":"The link provided states \"The Dashboard API is limited to 5 requests per second, per organization.\".

One part of an application routinely uses the Cisco Meraki API to collate data about all clients. Other parts of the application also use the Meraki API, but a single API key is used within the application. The organization has approximately 4,000 clients across 30 networks.

Events are simply occurrences or changes in the system. When an event occurs, it triggers a response or action in one or more components.\n\nKey characteristics of EDA:\n\nAsynchronous Communication: Components communicate by sending and receiving events asynchronously, without requiring real-time synchronization.\nLoose Coupling: Components are loosely coupled, meaning they have minimal dependencies on each other. This makes the system more flexible and scalable, as changes to one component can be made without affecting others.\nEvent-Based Triggers: Components are triggered by events, rather than being constantly polled or synchronized. This reduces overhead and improves performance.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. allows for loose coupling between software components.","comment_id":"1309072"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct.","comment_id":"779771","upvote_count":"4","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1674031980.0"}],"answer_ET":"C","question_id":208,"choices":{"D":"provides a single point of reference for mastering data","A":"separates the models for the reading and writing of data","C":"allows for loose coupling between software components","B":"breaks a solution into parts according to business capability"},"answer_images":[]},{"id":"ptRim1uxYS5bt1iuhtQn","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-901/image115.png"],"answer":"D","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (75%)","B (25%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
