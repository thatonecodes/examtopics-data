Routes will first need to be distributed into another protocol, and then into RIP.","answer_description":"Explanation -\nNotice that RIP metric is based on hop count only, and the maximum valid metric is 15. Anything above 15 is considered infinite. By default, when no metric is assigned when redistributing from EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP into RIP, the default metric will be infinite. Therefore we must define a metric that is understandable to the receiving protocol. Usually, we should use a small value (like 1, 2, 3) so that after redistributing, that route can be advertised through many routers (because the limit is 15).","timestamp":"2020-02-13 17:23:00","exam_id":296,"question_id":288,"answer":"D.
