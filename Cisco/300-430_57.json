Use the user password that is configured on the server.\n\nExplanation:\nPEAP Authentication Failure:\n\nPEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) uses a server certificate to establish a secure TLS tunnel, but the actual user authentication is performed using credentials (username and password) stored in the RADIUS server's internal database.\n\nIf the RADIUS server sends an Access-Reject message, it indicates that the user credentials provided by the client do not match those configured on the server.\n\nRoot Cause:\n\nThe most common reason for an Access-Reject message during PEAP authentication is an incorrect username or password. The client may be providing credentials that do not match those stored in the RADIUS server's internal database.\n\nSolution:\n\nEnsure that the client is using the correct username and password as configured on the RADIUS server. This will resolve the authentication failure.","comment_id":"1357372"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nPEAP is a Tunnel Method that only validates the Server certificate. Since the question mentions \"the server is sending an Access-Reject message\", it is understood the Server certificate has been validated successfully (therefore B is incorrect).\nThe question does not explicitly mention what Inner Method is being used, however it mentions the \"internal database of a RADIUS server\" is being used for Authentication, this means Username and Password are configured locally on the RADIUS server, since certificates are not supported with Internal Database (therefore C and D are incorrect).\nIn this case, some clients are using the wrong user password, and they need to use the password that have been configured on the server to solve the issue.","timestamp":"1730367660.0","comment_id":"1305361","poster":"GOfeni","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1042883","timestamp":"1697221500.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1042884","content":"According to the Cisco documentation, the best solution to the problem is (C) Update the client certificate to match the user account.","timestamp":"1697221560.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Here is a quote from the Cisco documentation:\n\nIf PEAP authentication is failing and the server is sending an Access-Reject message, it is likely that the client certificate is not valid or does not match the user account.
