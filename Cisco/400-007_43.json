Network designers can follow two common\nplanning approaches to develop business-driven network designs and facilitate the design\ndecisions:\n■ Strategic planning approach: Typically targets planning to long-term goals and\nstrategies. For example, a service provider needs to migrate its core from legacy\n(ATM) to be based on MPLS instead. The design decision in this approach has to\ncater to long-term goals and plans.\n■ Tactical planning approach: Typically targets planning to overcome an issue or to\nachieve a short-term goal. For instance, an enterprise might need to provide remote\naccess to some partners temporally (for example, over the Internet) until dedicated\nextranet connectivity is provisioned. Design decisions in this approach generally\nneed to provide what is required within a limited period of time and are not\n necessarily required to consider long-term goals.","comment_id":"796270"},{"timestamp":"1690989360.0","comment_id":"796265","content":"PAGE 9","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720018320.0","comment_id":"1112945","content":"which book or url?","poster":"XalaGyan"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"omoro"}],"answers_community":["AC (100%)"],"isMC":true},{"id":"Xsv7JFIjgp2bFJd5ynOz","answers_community":["B (73%)","E (27%)"],"question_text":"In an OSPF network with routers connected together with Ethernet cabling, which topology typically takes the longest to converge?","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","question_id":213,"answer":"B","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn an OSPF network with routers connected together with Ethernet cabling, the topology that typically takes the longest to converge is the ring topology (option B).

A tunnel interface is a virtual interface that is used to encapsulate IPv6 multicast traffic in an IPv4 or another IPv6 unicast packet for transport across a network. In the context of IPv6 multicast services, the tunnel interface is dynamically created when multicast traffic needs to be transported between multicast domains, or when the network topology requires it.
