These features are:\n\n GetBulkRequest: This feature allows a management station to retrieve a large amount of data in one request, reducing the number of requests needed to retrieve the same information. The GetBulkRequest PDU specifies a starting OID and a maximum number of variables to be returned in a single response.\n\n InformRequest: This feature is used to acknowledge receipt of a trap message from an agent. The InformRequest PDU is similar to the trap PDU, but it includes a request identifier, which allows the management station to match the acknowledgment with the original trap. The InformRequest also requires an acknowledgment from the receiving device, which provides greater reliability in trap delivery.","poster":"mageknight","upvote_count":"11","timestamp":"1692614220.0"},{"comment_id":"1187695","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nD & E are correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727822160.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: DE\nGet, GetNext &Set are request types or operations in SNMPv1\nSNMPv2 introduced two new commands: Getbulk & Inform","upvote_count":"2","poster":"AbdullahMohammad251","timestamp":"1716144480.0","comment_id":"1074918"},{"upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"comments":[{"poster":"dropspablo","upvote_count":"1","content":"D.
