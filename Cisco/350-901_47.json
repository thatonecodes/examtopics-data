Specifically, it is selecting the orders column from the purchases table where the username column matches the username variable. The username variable is passed in as a parameter in a dictionary format using the % operator to substitute the value into the query string. This approach is recommended for preventing SQL injection attacks because it ensures that user input is treated as data rather than as part of the SQL statement itself.","timestamp":"1712214360.0","upvote_count":"7","comments":[{"content":"A clear explanation of all this answers and why B is correct\nhttps://realpython.com/prevent-python-sql-injection/","poster":"i9t6","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1719438660.0","comment_id":"934811"}],"poster":"ldlpi"},{"poster":"samael666","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737328200.0","comment_id":"1343241","content":"Selected Answer: B\nthe use of placeholder and key value will prevent inject SQL injection."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nRegarding to the MySQL Document, it presented following demo code:\n\nselect_stmt = \"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_no = %(emp_no)s\"\ncursor.execute(select_stmt, { 'emp_no': 2 })\n\nTherefore, I choose the answer B as the correct one.","comment_id":"849826","timestamp":"1711346700.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"cj_kuo"},{"timestamp":"1707842640.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"alexgrt","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis is getting discussed a lot so I took the Time to write some code and test this.

This makes it easier to develop clients that can read and understand the data, and it also allows for more efficient data collection.\n\nOne of the benefits of using model-driven telemetry is that it reduces the load on the server by enabling the client to pull data. This is because the client only needs to request the data that it needs, rather than receiving all of the data that is being collected. This can improve performance and scalability, especially for applications that are collecting a lot of data.\n\nSo the answer is (A).","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI asked ChatGPT and it answered C.\nHow confident are you in your answer?\nI am highly confident in my answer, Model-driven telemetry is a feature that allows devices to collect operational data at a high rate and scale. This is achieved by using a standard data model, which defines the data that should be collected, and a standard encoding format, which defines how the data should be encoded and sent to the collector. The standard data model and encoding format allow devices to send data in a consistent format, which makes it easier to process and analyze the data.","timestamp":"1689669720.0","comment_id":"779876","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"779852","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1689667680.0","poster":"lznlxl","content":"correct answer should be C."}],"unix_timestamp":1674036480,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-01-18 11:08:00","answer":"C","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"VmJwpBLgeEFd49mZpeEK","exam_id":329,"question_id":234,"unix_timestamp":1674038700,"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-901/image81.png"],"choices":{"B":"elif resp.status_code == 404 and self._retries < self._MAX_RETRIES:","D":"elif resp.status_code == 429 and self._retries < self._MAX_RETRIES:","C":"elif resp.status_code == 404 or self._retries < self._MAX_RETRIES:","A":"elif resp.status_code == 429 or self._retries < self._MAX_RETRIES:"},"timestamp":"2023-01-18 11:45:00","topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
