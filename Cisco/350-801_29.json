For CBWFQ, you define traffic classes based on match criteria including protocols, access control lists (ACLs), and input interfaces. Packets satisfying the match criteria for a class constitute the traffic for that class. A queue is reserved for each class, and traffic belonging to a class is directed to the queue for that class.","poster":"ALLENNN","timestamp":"1680398220.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer A by wording i found\n\nClass-Based Weighted Fair Queueing (CBWFQ)\nprovides weighted fair queuing based on defined classes with no strict priority queue\navailable for real-time traffic. \nCBWFQ allows <a user> (you) to define traffic classes and then assign characteristics to that class. \n\nhttps://www.ccexpert.us/qos-implementing/lower-priority-classes-use-cbwfq.html","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1669390920.0","comment_id":"726901","poster":"DaKenjee"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
