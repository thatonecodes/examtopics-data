When a user tries to access a webserver and the traffic is captured, an ICMP packet that reports \"time exceeded in-transit\" means that the packets sent by the user are taking too long to reach the server. This can be caused by a number of factors, including the distance between the user and the server, the number of intermediate routers or switches that the packets must pass through, and the overall condition of the network. In this case, the most likely cause of the issue is that the server is simply too far away, and the packets are taking too much time to reach it."},{"poster":"aplicacion101","comment_id":"671873","timestamp":"1710727920.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is best of the options","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1668803340.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"leranay","comment_id":"360765","content":"TLDR: the Answer is B.\n\nElimination:\nD refers to \"require too much time to reach it.\" This implies some sort of latency rather than \"hops\". There is no problem with huge latencies in the TCP/IP protocol. Look for example the \"IP over Avian Carriers\" which has RTT of around 100 minutes. \n\nB referents to sending a packet to a \"wrong direction\" or path. This might generate a routing loop and therefore a \"Time exceeded in-transit\".
