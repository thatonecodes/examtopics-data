The focus is on iterative development, continuous collaboration with stakeholders, and delivering tangible results. Agile embraces flexibility and adaptability, allowing for changes and adjustments throughout the project as requirements evolve. The emphasis is on delivering value quickly and incorporating feedback to refine the design iteratively.","poster":"J_W","comment_id":"913168"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/agile-software-development","timestamp":"1731423000.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"bdp123","comment_id":"895924"}],"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","exam_id":331,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/109071-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-172-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"Agile and Waterfall are two popular methods for organizing projects.
