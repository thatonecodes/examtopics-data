My guess is that they are asking about someone trying to SSH into the router and it fails, in which case B and C are the correct answers. You need to configure a domain name and then generate an RSA key to be able to SSH into the router.\n\nBut the question could also be interpreted as the router being the SSH client into some other device. The problem there is that such a setup would not require any configuration at all on the router. The device you SSH into might need it, but it might also need a bunch of other things. The most logical interpretation is in my opinion that we are trying to SSH into the router and it doesn't work, not that we are trying to SSH from the router.

This is an excerpt from Cisco:\n\nhe CoPP feature on a Cisco device does exactly what it sounds like: It polices the traffic coming to the control plane. For this purpose, the control plane is treated as a logical source and destination, with its own inbound and outbound interfaces. Only traffic that is destined for the control plane is policed as part of this feature. This is in addition to any policing, filtering, or any other processing done at the interface where the packet was received by the device.\n\nSo, you police traffic coming to the Control Plane so that it doesn't have to process it.\n\nhttps://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2928193&seqNum=3","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JOKERR","timestamp":"1653936240.0"},{"comment_id":"588355","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"I also viewed this excerpt as the answer, but the question is talking about protecting the router from malicious traffic, and this (to me) meant inbound traffic is being policed and maybe some of the routing protocol packets are getting caught in the policy map","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1692641640.0","comment_id":"986822"}],"poster":"Kimaf","timestamp":"1650400620.0","content":"I know the answer is either A or B because of the ACL but here is the a paragraph from the OCG Enarsi book page 861\nDirection: CoPP can be applied to packets entering or leaving the control plane interface. Therefore, the correct direction needs to be specified. For incoming packets, you specify input, and for outgoing packets you specify output. Direction can be verified with the output of show policy-map control-plane as well. Note that not all versions support output CoPP, and for the ones that do, you need to ensure that the correct traffic is being classified in the ACLs and the class maps. For example, when it comes to BGP, OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), and EIGRP, you typically use output CoPP for the replies that are being sent because of an already received packet. For ICMP, it would be error and informational reply messages. For Telnet, SSH (Secure Shell), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), or SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), you would be dealing with replies or traps.
