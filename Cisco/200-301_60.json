Makes forwarding decision using MAC address table not mac address."}],"content":"D. makes forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses\n\nExplanation:\n\nA Layer 2 switch operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. One of its primary functions is to make forwarding decisions based on the MAC (Media Access Control) addresses of devices. When a switch receives a frame, it examines the destination MAC address in the frame and forwards the frame only to the port where the destination device is located. This process is known as switching, and it helps in reducing collisions and improving the efficiency of network communication.\n\nThe other options are not accurate descriptions of Layer 2 switch characteristics:\n\nA. Layer 2 switches typically create separate broadcast domains for each connected port, which can help in minimizing unnecessary broadcast traffic.\n\nB. Tracking the number of active TCP connections is typically a function associated with Layer 4 devices such as routers and firewalls, not Layer 2 switches.\n\nC. Layer 2 switches create separate collision domains for each connected device, helping to reduce the likelihood of collisions compared to shared network segments.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"16BitRun","comment_id":"1108067"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":288,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"What is a characteristic of a Layer 2 switch?","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1703792040,"answers_community":["D (87%)","13%"],"timestamp":"2023-12-28 20:34:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/129600-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1265-discussion/","topic":"1","isMC":true},{"id":"VZ5ZFaSkROyN2jAft7xZ","exam_id":288,"timestamp":"2023-12-15 03:49:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/128613-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1266-discussion/","answers_community":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"SIMULATION\n-\n\n\nGuidelines\n-\n\nThis is a lab item in which tasks will be performed on virtual devices.\n\n• Refer to the Tasks tab to view the tasks for this lab item.\n• Refer to the Topology tab to access the device console(s) and perform the tasks.\n• Console access is available for all required devices by clicking the device icon or using the tab(s) above the console window.\n• All necessary preconfigurations have been applied.\n• Do not change the enable password or hostname for any device.\n• Save your configurations to NVRAM before moving to the next item.\n• Click Next at the bottom of the screen to submit this lab and move to the next question.\n• When Next is clicked, the lab doses and cannot be reopened.\n\n\nTopology\n-\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nTasks\n-\n\nVLANS 35 and 45 have been configured in all three switches.
