Today this model is known as “bare metal,” but it is only one of a variety of options available to you. These options include virtual machines, containers, and newer options such as serverless computing.","comment_id":"1023487"},{"comment_id":"1023485","poster":"working_on_hcip","timestamp":"1727909760.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nBare metal\n\nThe most familiar, and the most basic way to deploy software is by installing it directly on the target computer, or the “bare metal.” In addition to this being the simplest method, bare metal deployment has other advantages, such as the fact that software can access the operating system and hardware directly. This is particularly useful for situations in which you need access to specialized hardware, or for High Performance Computing (HPC) applications in which every bit of speed counts.\n\n\nFrom Devnet Netacad Course"},{"timestamp":"1694788680.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"aplicacion101","comment_id":"670019","content":"This question is a freaky and tricky\nNetacad : Devnet/6.1.3\n\"More commonly, bare metal is now used as infrastructure to host virtualization (hypervisors) \" and cloud frameworks (orchestrators for virtual compute, storage, and networking resources).
