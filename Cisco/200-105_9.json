A switchport violation occurs in one of two situations:\nWhen the maximum number of secure MAC addresses has been reached (by default, the maximum number of secure MAC addresses per switchport is limited to\n1)\nAn address learned or configured on one secure interface is seen on another secure interface in the same VLAN\nThe action that the device takes when one of these violations occurs can be configured:\nProtect--This mode permits traffic from known MAC addresses to continue to be forwarded while dropping traffic from unknown MAC addresses when over the allowed MAC address limit. When configured with this mode, no notification action is taken when traffic is dropped.\nRestrict--This mode permits traffic from known MAC addresses to continue to be forwarded while dropping traffic from unknown MAC addresses when over the allowed MAC address limit. When configured with this mode, a syslog message is logged, a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap is sent, and a violation counter is incremented when traffic is dropped.\nShutdown--This mode is the default violation mode; when in this mode, the switch will automatically force the switchport into an error disabled (err-disable) state when a violation occurs. While in this state, the switchport forwards no traffic. The switchport can be brought out of this error disabled state by issuing the errdisable recovery cause CLI command or by disabling and re-enabling the switchport.\nShutdown VLAN--This mode mimics the behavior of the shutdown mode but limits the error disabled state the specific violating VLAN.","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01501/0039200001.jpg"],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/4400-exam-200-105-topic-1-question-353-discussion/","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01501/0039100002.png"],"question_id":44,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1567191720},{"id":"GCp4TIcySfdHnABxRFh5","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.
