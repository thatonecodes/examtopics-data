In IPsec tunnel mode, the original IP header containing the final destination of the packet is encrypted, in addition to the packet payload. To tell intermediary routers where to forward the packets, IPsec adds a new IP header. At each end of the tunnel, the routers decrypt the IP headers to deliver the packets to their destinations.\n\nIn transport mode, the payload of each packet is encrypted, but the original IP header is not.

None of the options present a correct answer, but A looks somewhat closer. Here's why:\nA trunk port does not place the port in the err-disabled state if it learns more than one MAC address, as port security is not supported on trunk ports. Therefore, it is not possible for a trunk port to trigger the err-disabled state due to port security violations. However, it is possible to configure port security on a trunk port to restrict the number of MAC addresses allowed on a specific VLAN.","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"timestamp":"1717952340.0","comment_id":"1091987","poster":"[Removed]","content":"\"Port security supports nonnegotiating trunks.\"\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/Test/dwerblo/broken_guide/port_sec.pdf\n\nBruhhhhhh.","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"887700","poster":"Vikramaditya_J"},{"content":"I think, portsecurity is NOT enabled on trunk intf, you have to change it to access mode first.
