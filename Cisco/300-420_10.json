Think about it, if we configure the spokes as stubs we might reduce the queries, take load off of the router and also increase stability but the convergence time would still be minimum 15 seconds (3xhello, 5sec default). So as resources and stability seems to be no problem here, I would go with reducing the timers.","comment_id":"1361468","poster":"lucky12321","timestamp":"1740492840.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711659300.0","poster":"atiWok","comment_id":"853578","content":"correct, quarries are not forwarded to stubs"},{"timestamp":"1680098880.0","poster":"cwoolie","comment_id":"577655","content":"D is correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"D Is correct...","poster":"cwoolie","comment_id":"576129","timestamp":"1679916480.0"},{"content":"A.
