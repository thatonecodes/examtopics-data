Pre-share (Pre-Shared Key) is not an AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) method. Instead, it is a method for peer authentication in IKE (Internet Key Exchange), where both parties use a shared secret key to establish trust.\n\nAAA-based authentication methods, like EAP and RSA-SIG, involve user-based authentication with an external AAA server (such as RADIUS or TACACS+).
