This feature is a key benefit over IPv4 as it eliminates the need of manual configuration or DHCP as in the world of IPv4. The IPv6 EUI-64 format address is obtained through the 48-bit\nMAC address. The Mac address is first separated into two 24-bits, with one being OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and the other being NIC specific. The\n16-bit 0xFFFE is then inserted between these two 24-bits to for the 64-bit EUI address. IEEE has chosen FFFE as a reserved value which can only appear in EUI-\n64 generated from the an EUI-48 MAC address.\nHere is an example showing how a the Mac Address is used to generate EUI.\n\nNext, the seventh bit from the left, or the universal/local (U/L) bit, needs to be inverted. This bit identifies whether this interface identifier is universally or locally administered. If 0, the address is locally administered and if 1, the address is globally unique. It is worth noticing that in the OUI portion, the globally unique addresses assigned by the IEEE has always been set to 0 whereas the locally created addresses has 1 configured. Therefore, when the bit is inverted, it maintains its original scope (global unique address is still global unique and vice versa). The reason for inverting can be found in RFC4291 section 2.5.1.\n\nOnce the above is done, we have a fully functional EUI-64 format address.

Router solicitation messages, which have a value of 133 in the Type field of the\nICMP packet header, are sent by hosts at system startup so that the host can immediately autoconfigure without needing to wait for the next scheduled RA message. Given that router solicitation messages are usually sent by hosts at system startup (the host does not have a configured unicast address), the source address in router solicitation messages is usually the unspecified IPv6 address (0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0). If the host has a configured unicast address, the unicast address of the interface sending the router solicitation message is used as the source address in the message. The destination address in router solicitation messages is the all-routers multicast address with a scope of the link. When an RA is sent in response to a router solicitation, the destination address in the RA message is the unicast address of the source of the router solicitation message. RA messages typically include the following information:\n\nOne or more onlink IPv6 prefixes that nodes on the local link can use to automatically configure their IPv6 addresses\n\nLifetime information for each prefix included in the advertisement\nSets of flags that indicate the type of autoconfiguration (stateless or stateful) that can be completed\n\nDefault router information (whether the router sending the advertisement should be used as a default router and, if so, the amount of time (in seconds) the router should be used as a default router)\n\nAdditional information for hosts, such as the hop limit and MTU a host should use in packets that it originates\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ipv6/configuration/guide/12_4t/ipv6_12_4t_book/ip6- addrg_bsc_con.html","timestamp":"2020-02-13 18:35:00","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1581615300,"answer_ET":"D.
