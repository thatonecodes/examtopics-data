I am interpreting \"cross-region cloud\" to mean a public cloud provider with multiple regions, and you are deploying your services in multiple regions.\n\nWithin a region, public cloud providers have multiple availability zones. If you don't have a DR or geographic latency requirement dictating multiple regions, you can operate within a single region and use multiple availability zones. And that's great for most scenarios, as long as there isn't a large-scale outage that impacts all zones in a region (weather event that prevents fuel resupply to generators like a Hurricane Katrina event, war/conflict, meteor strike). However, even then, public cloud providers have been known to have services fail across multiple zones in a region. It's rare, and usually due to a design error that wasn't caught prior, but it happens from time to time. So some public cloud customers want to have DR capability to fail over to a different geographic region."},{"comment_id":"940759","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI feel like it could be A or D, but in my opinion A just feels more correct as the question refers to High Availability but D is talking about Disaster Recovery.

A cross-region cloud can account for failure in another zone, but it is not the primary purpose of using a cross-region cloud.\nwhy isn't B correct?
