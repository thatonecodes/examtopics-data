Add a Bridge Group Interface to the FTD before transparent mode is configured.\n\nTo enable transparent mode on a Cisco FTD, you need to configure a bridge group interface. This interface allows the FTD to transparently forward traffic between different interfaces.

Transparent mode, by definition, means that the FTD is transparent to the network and does not modify the source and destination IP addresses of the packets that it receives. Therefore, to enable transparent mode, the FTD must have at least two interfaces connected to the same network segment. These interfaces are then placed in a bridge group, which allows the FTD to forward traffic between them without modifying the packets. Without a bridge group interface, the FTD cannot operate in transparent mode, and any attempt to do so will result in the device not passing traffic.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"826579","timestamp":"1693631580.0","poster":"tanri04"},{"timestamp":"1692069540.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer 100%\n\"steps to change FTD mode: 1- Deregister the FTD device from the FMC.\nYou cannot change the mode until you deregister the device.\n2-Access the FTD device CLI\n3- Change the firewall mode:\n\nconfigure firewall [routed | transparent]'\n\nReference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/601/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v601/fpmc-config-guide-v601_chapter_01101010.html#:~:text=Deregister%20the%20FTD,deregister%20the%20device.","poster":"DID123","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"809127"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nBVIs need to be configured, so Im going with C","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"806400","poster":"Baumb","timestamp":"1691841960.0"},{"poster":"Mevijil","comment_id":"803531","timestamp":"1691595000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI'd go with A - if the FTD is in Routed mode, you have to go into the CLI and de-register it from the FMC before changing it to Transparent mode","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1691587680.0","comment_id":"803389","poster":"Baumb","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhy would you have to do it over CLI?\nIt makes much more sense that a sufficient interface is missing, so C"},{"comment_id":"802486","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI agree with C","timestamp":"1691517120.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Joe_Blue"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v66/transparent_or_routed_firewall_mode_for_firepower_threat_defense.html","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"799923","timestamp":"1691329740.0","poster":"Dolby58"},{"comment_id":"798188","poster":"Baumb","timestamp":"1691161980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhy would you do it over CLI?
