Enable AAA Override.\n\nAAA Override is a feature that allows the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) to use the attributes returned from the RADIUS server via Access-Accept message to override the configuration on the WLC. When AAA Override is enabled and the WLC is integrated with Cisco ISE, it allows for dynamic VLAN assignments, QoS, ACLs, and mDNS (Bonjour) profiles on a per-user basis.\n\nIn this case, enabling AAA Override would allow the WLC to apply the mDNS roles assigned by ISE to the users, which should resolve the issue with mDNS name resolution. The other options (B, C, D) are not directly related to mDNS role assignment or name resolution. Therefore, they would not resolve the issue.","timestamp":"1724914020.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"1112463","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is enable AAA Overide.\nOn the controller, enable the Allow AAA Override configuration parameter using the GUI or CLI.
