Power that comes off an antenna is measured as effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). EIRP is the value that regulatory agencies, such as the FCC or European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), use to determine and measure power limits in applications such as 2.4-GHz or 5-GHz wireless equipment. In order to calculate EIRP, add the transmitter power (in dBm) to the antenna gain (in dBi) and subtract any cable losses (in dB).\n\nreference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/23231-powervalues-23231.html","timestamp":"1684999140.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Darude","comment_id":"726560"}],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-11-25 10:19:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/88657-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-639-discussion/","answers_community":["ACD (100%)"],"isMC":true},{"id":"JNQDFCPPSLGCyQH2qRyg","choices":{"A":"default VRF","D":"management VRF","B":"VRF VPN_A","C":"VRF VPN_B"},"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1603405380,"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nAssuming that R1 is a CE router, which VRF is assigned to Gi0/0 on R1?","timestamp":"2020-10-23 00:23:00","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04308/0003600001.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/35035-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-64-discussion/","answers_community":["A (91%)","9%"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"441079","poster":"XalaGyan","content":"i understand the question as this.\n\nR1 is a CE and therefore R3 must be a CE too. \nThe only one that a CE connects to is a PE Router which is R2.\n\nSince we talk about VPN in sense of just simply two different routing tables without affecting or seeing eachother (VRF) should be configured.\n\nThat being said, neither CE needs to do any routing table partitioning as they are simply talking to their PE router.\n\nthe PE router R2 is the one needing to have separate VRF instances or so called VPNs etc.\n\ntherefore DEFAULT VRF on CE always\nand VRF separation on PE.\n\nthanks for reading this far","comments":[{"comment_id":"828226","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"959596","poster":"danman32","timestamp":"1705939380.0","content":"I agree"}],"content":"Thanks this helped","timestamp":"1693757280.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Clauster"}],"timestamp":"1646688720.0","upvote_count":"37"},{"upvote_count":"21","content":"It makes an assumption that the PE (being a provider) has multiple customers, and VPN_A is one customer, and is likely not using VRFs at their border to the provider, i.e. they are using the Global routing table/GRT or 'default VRF'.
