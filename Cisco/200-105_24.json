The question says 'the tunnel comes up normally, but the workstations [...] cannot communicate'. This implies that tunnels are used more often and a default route should be defined. When the route is undefined, the whole tunnel goes down. And in this case, the question suggests that the tunnel doesn't go down completely but that there is no connectivity. So it should be a MTU issue.
