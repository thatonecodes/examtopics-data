The wireless clients will be profiled based on MAC OUI, DHCP, HTTP user agent (valid Internet is required for successful HTTP profiling). The WLC uses these attributes and predefined classification profiles to identify devices.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/7-5/NativeProfiling75.html"},{"content":"Selected Answer: ABC\nA. HTTP user agent:\n\nThis is correct. The HTTP user agent string provides information about the device's browser and operating system, which is useful for profiling.\n\nB. DHCP:\n\nThis is correct. DHCP options and requests can provide information about the device type, vendor, and other attributes.\n\nC. MAC OUI:\n\nThis is correct. The MAC OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) identifies the manufacturer of the device, which is a key attribute for profiling.\n\nD. hostname:\n\nWhile the hostname can provide some information, it is not as reliable or specific as the other options for profiling.\n\nE. OS version:\n\nThe OS version is useful for profiling but is typically derived from other attributes like the HTTP user agent or DHCP.\n\nF. IP address:\n\nThe IP address is not used for profiling as it does not provide information about the device type or characteristics.","comment_id":"1360212","poster":"rrahim","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740248280.0"}],"question_text":"Which three properties are used for client profiling of wireless clients?
