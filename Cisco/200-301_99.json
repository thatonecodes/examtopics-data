This is a native VLAN mismatch, which can cause issues with VLAN traffic crossing the trunk link.\n\nIn this scenario, PC A is in VLAN 10 and PC B is in VLAN 20. When the switch receives traffic from PC A, it tags the traffic with VLAN 10, but when the traffic crosses the trunk link to Switch 2, the traffic is sent on the native VLAN 20, which Switch 2 is expecting to receive traffic on. As a result, the traffic from PC A is dropped and the ping test fails.\n\nTo correct this error, the native VLAN on the trunk link between Switch 1 and Switch 2 should be the same on both switches. Either the native VLAN should be changed to 10 on both switches or it should be changed to 20 on both switches.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"851464"},{"poster":"dipanjana1990","comments":[{"content":"can't anybody see that Native Vlan Tagging is enabled on both the switches, so native vlan traffic will go tagged on the trunk port.
