The far end connection data (c=) in the SDP was overwritten by deep packet inspection in the call signaling path.\n\nExplanation:\nRTP traffic may fail to reach the far endpoint if the c= line in the SDP (which specifies the media IP address) is modified or overwritten by deep packet inspection (DPI) in the signaling path. This can cause the media to be sent to an incorrect or unreachable IP address, leading to one-way audio issues.
