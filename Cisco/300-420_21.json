The LAN Automation feature is an alternative to manual underlay deployments for new networks and uses an IS-IS routed access design. Although there are many alternative routing protocols, the IS-IS routing protocol offers operational advantages such as neighbor establishment without IP protocol dependencies, peering capability using loopback addresses, and agnostic treatment of IPv4, IPv6, and non-IP traffic. Manual underlays are also supported and allow variations from the automated underlay deployment (for example, a different IGP could be chosen), though the underlay design principles still apply.","comment_id":"909796","timestamp":"1685406600.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nIsn´t it D here?!","poster":"Nickplayany","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"903461","timestamp":"1684693200.0"},{"poster":"Reinier_veen","comment_id":"713279","timestamp":"1667849640.0","content":"provided answer is correct.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/network-automation-and-management/dna-center/tech_notes/b_dnac_sda_lan_automation_deployment.html","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["D (70%)","B (30%)"],"answer_ET":"D","question_id":101,"choices":{"D":"Manual underlay","C":"Automated UNDERLAY","A":"Subnet stretching","B":"LAN automation"},"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1667849640,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-11-07 20:34:00","answer":"D","answer_description":"","topic":"1"},{"id":"u8nnVM6oISkbjdUpOGAy","timestamp":"2023-02-03 21:05:00","answer_ET":"B","choices":{"D":"Multicast VPN","B":"Bidirectional PIM","C":"Source-Specific Multicast","A":"Any Source Multicast"},"question_id":102,"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1675454700,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
