If two connected devices transmit onto the media at the same time, a collision occurs. When a collision occurs, a JAM signal is sent on the network, indicating that a collision has occurred and that devices should ignore any fragmented data associated with the collision. Both sending devices back off sending their data for a random amount and then try again if the medium is free for transmission. Therefore, collisions effectively delay transmission of data, lowering the effective throughput available to a device. The more devices that are attached to a collision domain, the greater the chances of collisions; this results in lower bandwidth and performance for each device attached to the collision\ndomain. Bridges and switches terminate the physical signal path of a collision domain, allowing you to segment separate collision domains, breaking them up into multiple smaller pieces to provide more bandwidth per user within the new collision domains formed.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"12672","timestamp":"1569439020.0"}],"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2019-09-25 21:17:00","question_text":"Which two circumstances can cause collision domain issues on VLAN domain?

BGP is very strict in the routing advertisements. In other words, BGP only advertises the network which exists exactly in the routing table (in this case network x.x.x.32/27 exists in the routing table as the Fa0/0 interface). If you put the command “network x.x.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0” or “network x.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0” or “network x.x.x.33 mask 255.255.255.255” then BGP will not advertise anything.\n\nTherefore the full command in this question is “network 172.16.1.32 mask 255.255.255.224”.\n\nFor more information about BGP configuration, please read our Basic BGP Configuration tutorial","poster":"Specialdork","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1564331400.0"},{"content":"R1\ninterrface Loopback0\n ip address 172.16.1.33 255.255.255.224\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nThe correct answer is D.","timestamp":"1554450780.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1120","poster":"bitsuspect"}],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2019-04-05 09:53:00","question_id":80}],"exam":{"provider":"Cisco","isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"id":284,"name":"200-105","numberOfQuestions":168},"currentPage":16},"__N_SSP":true}
