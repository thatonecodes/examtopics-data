It is typically assigned an IP address from the management network and used for administrative tasks, software upgrades, and communication with other SD-WAN components.\n Data NIC: This NIC is used for the data plane traffic, including the Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) and data plane tunnels (vPaths) between SD-WAN devices. It is assigned an IP address from the transport network (typically a non-routable address) and participates in the SD-WAN fabricâ€™s control and data plane communication.","comment_id":"1307604","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730848140.0"},{"poster":"Raynecore","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/release/notes/compatibility-and-server-recommendations/ch-server-recs-20-1-earlier.html","timestamp":"1716229560.0","comment_id":"1214550"},{"timestamp":"1715777520.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTo start the Cisco SD-WAN Controller, you must create a virtual machine (VM) instance for it on a server that is running hypervisor software. This article describes how to create a VM on a server running the VMware vSphere ESXi Hypervisor software. You can also create the VM on a server running the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) Hypervisor software.\nFor server requirements, see Server Hardware Recommendations.\nTo create a Cisco SD-WAN Controller VM instance on the ESXi hypervisor:\n1. Launch the vSphere Client and create a Cisco SD-WAN Controller VM instance.\n2. Add a vNIC for the management interface.\n3. Start the Cisco SD-WAN Controller VM instance and connect to the console.\n\nReference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/cisco-sd-wan-overlay-network-bringup.html#c_Step_5__Deploy_the_vSmart_Controller_78730.xml","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1211935"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1710847740.0","comment_id":"1177251","content":"B correct","poster":"Stanleymahamadi"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/136596-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-380-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_id":303,"exam_id":304,"answer":"B","timestamp":"2024-03-19 12:29:00","choices":{"B":"2","D":"4","A":"1","C":"3"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (80%)","A (20%)"],"answer_description":""},{"id":"wKUYtwhS0bgPsKkg1KC3","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1710847920,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-03-19 12:32:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_id":304,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/136598-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-381-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"C":"forms an alternate connection to connected transport","A":"gives access to business Internet","D":"synchronizes the configuration with the neighboring WAN Edge router","B":"provides access to the transport of its neighboring WAN Edge router"},"exam_id":304,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Gycu","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726948920.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB for sure","comment_id":"1179690"},{"poster":"Stanleymahamadi","content":"B correct","timestamp":"1726738320.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1177256"}],"question_text":"What is the purpose of a TLOC extension interface?"},{"id":"qUxXLSiz2m24hT58Ud4v","unix_timestamp":1710373320,"choices":{"C":"event","A":"history","D":"alarm","B":"SLA class"},"question_text":"Which REST API call is used for real-time monitoring of application-aware routing?","answer":"B","exam_id":304,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/docs/sdwan/device-realtime-monitoring/#realtime-monitoring-api-endpoints","timestamp":"1729860240.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Networkchamp87","comment_id":"1201984"},{"timestamp":"1726949880.0","comment_id":"1179695","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect B \nAPI calls for real-time monitoring of application-aware routing.\n\n SLA Class\n Display information about the SLA classes operating on the router (on vEdge routers only).\n\n GET https://{vmanage-ip-address}/dataservice/device/app-route/sla-class?deviceId=deviceId\n\n Statistics\n Display statistics about data traffic characteristics for all operational data plane tunnel (on vEdge routers only).\n\n GET https://{vmanage-ip-address}/dataservice/device/app-route/statistics?deviceId=deviceId\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/docs/sdwan/#!device-realtime-monitoring","poster":"Gycu"},{"comment_id":"1172974","timestamp":"1726263720.0","poster":"Stanleymahamadi","content":"Correct answer C","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1726949940.0","comment_id":"1179696","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Gycu","content":"wrong. check devnet"}]}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-03-14 00:42:00","question_id":305,"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/135974-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-382-discussion/","isMC":true}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"id":304,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"300-415","isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Cisco","numberOfQuestions":417},"currentPage":61},"__N_SSP":true}
