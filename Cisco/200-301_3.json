It could be B or C. I believe it only flips the 7th bit if you configure the address with the \"eui-64\" command. In answers B and C they are manually entering the addresses so the bit wouldn't be flipped unless you did it manually. Option C manually enters the FFFE in the middle of the MAC address which gives the illusion that one would need to flip the 7th bit as well.","poster":"ProgSnob","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"762778","timestamp":"1672509000.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"seems to me someone forgot to invert the 7 bit, there is no other explanation"},{"content":"Why can't it be all of them??","timestamp":"1667568480.0","comment_id":"711172","poster":"SemStrond","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"why interface ID comes a link local ? it should be C","comment_id":"701476","timestamp":"1666435260.0","poster":"Garfieldcat"},{"poster":"Sam7007","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1664986260.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct answer","comment_id":"687020"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\ncccccccc","timestamp":"1664371380.0","comment_id":"681740","poster":"[Removed]"},{"comment_id":"675167","comments":[{"content":"But using same logic, also answer A would be correct ?","comment_id":"702921","timestamp":"1666608000.0","poster":"Dontguess","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1663765980.0","poster":"splashy","content":"Selected Answer: B\nD = I want to do eui 64 manually because I'm an Awesome Cisco Engineer, \n but i didn't get my ice-cream so i forgot to flip the 7th bit = wrong or \"more wrong\" then\n\nB = Is it forbidden or wrong to use FE80 + mac address in the Interface ID section?
