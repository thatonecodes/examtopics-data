How is a noncompliant machine blocked?\nA. The Cisco NAC Appliance blocks by either logical or physical means. When deployed inline, the Cisco NAC Appliance is IP-independent and controls admission of noncompliant wireless or wired users by restricting them to a particular subnet and even generating a nonbroadcast, multiaccess topology for virtual segmentation. When deployed out-of-band, the Cisco NAC Appliance \"blocks\" noncompliant users at a port layer, preventing them from accessing the network until they pass inspection.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1562680500.0","poster":"bella","comment_id":"3776","content":"surprisingly correct answer \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/nac-appliance-clean-access/prod_qas0900aecd802da200.html","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[]}],"exam":{"id":302,"numberOfQuestions":112,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"name":"300-320","provider":"Cisco","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":10},"__N_SSP":true}
