A NetFlow-enabled device generates metadata at the interface level and sends flow data information to a flow collector, where the flow records are stored to enable network traffic analytics and management. A network operator can use NetFlow data to determine network throughput, packet loss, and traffic congestion at a specific interface level.

The true value in the DHCP probe is that many other attributes\ncan be gleaned to help identify the type of endpoint.
