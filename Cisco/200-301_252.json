MAC address aging\n\nMAC address aging is a switching feature that removes unused MAC addresses from the MAC address table after a certain period of inactivity. This frees up space in the MAC address table, allowing new MAC addresses to be added when new devices are connected to the network. The aging time determines how long a MAC address can remain in the table without any activity before it is considered unused and eligible for removal. This feature helps optimize the usage of MAC address table resources in a switch.","comment_id":"906753","timestamp":"1700932800.0","poster":"StingVN"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1727722740.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","comment_id":"1186961"},{"comment_id":"1103355","timestamp":"1719051780.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\ntrue\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/optical/cpt/r_975/cpt975_configuration/cpt972_configuration_chapter_01110.html#:~:text=Dynamic%20MAC%20address%20learning%20occurs,in%20the%20same%20bridge%20domain.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nGiven answer is correct\nA.

This will stop the device from sending and receiving CDP packets on all interfaces.\n\nTo enable CDP on a specific interface, you can use the command cdp enable in interface configuration mode3. This will override the global configuration and allow the interface to send and receive CDP packets.\n\nFor example, if you want to disable CDP globally on a switch and enable it only on interface FastEthernet 2/12, you can use the following commands:\n\nSwitch(config)# no cdp run\nSwitch(config)# interface FastEthernet 2/12\nSwitch(config-if)# cdp enable"},{"timestamp":"1692775440.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nit is B \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/network-management/discovery-protocol-cdp/43485-cdponios43485.html","poster":"ds0321","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"988037"},{"poster":"bauga","timestamp":"1692666420.0","comment_id":"986992","content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe answer is A","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Cynthia2023","timestamp":"1691587320.0","comment_id":"976680","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCDP must be globally enabled first.","comments":[{"content":"If CDP is disabled globally on the device, you won't be able to enable it on specific interfaces.
