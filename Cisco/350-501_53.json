Upon link-up, for example, IGP can advertise and use a link before LDP convergence has occurred;\nLDP IGP synchronization synchronizes LDP and IGP so that IGP advertises links with regular metrics only when MPLS LDP is converged on that link. \n\nB: B is also a good answer. LDP Session Protection lets you configure LDP to automatically protect sessions with all or a given set of peers (as specified by the peer ACL). When configured, LDP initiates backup targeted hellos automatically for neighbors for which primary link adjacencies already exist. These backup targeted hellos maintain LDP sessions when primary link adjacencies go down. \nIn brief. LDP targeted hellos maintain the protection path for the non-directly connected neighbor.
