IPsec point-to-point tunnels over the MPLS and point-to-point links provide an isolated and encrypted packet end-to-end.\n\nHere's why:\n* IPsec: This is a well-established standard for providing secure, encrypted communication over IP networks. It offers a variety of modes (transport, tunnel) and algorithms to meet different security needs.\n* Point-to-point tunnels: Creating point-to-point tunnels between production units and marketing departments ensures that traffic remains isolated and encrypted throughout its journey, even over the MPLS network.\n* Quick rollout: IPsec is widely supported by network devices, making it relatively straightforward to implement and deploy.\n\nWhile other options might provide some level of security, they may require more complex configurations or additional hardware (for GETVPN), which could delay the rollout process. IPsec point-to-point tunnels offer a practical and efficient solution for Company XYZ to meet their security and compliance requirements.","comment_id":"1268911","timestamp":"1724095800.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhile other options could technically work, they may involve more complexity or overhead:\n* A firewall does not provide end-to-end encryption.\n* VRF-Lite with IPsec adds more complexity and overhead, which may not be suitable for a quick rollout.\n* IPsec point-to-point tunnels introduce significant overhead and complexity, particularly across a large and dispersed network.\nThus, GETVPN is the optimal choice for a quick and efficient implementation.","comment_id":"1211884","poster":"famov66542","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1715769840.0"}]},{"id":"eK2gKh2Rv5yBHJ3vkiMe","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/146050-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-275-discussion/","question_id":183,"discussion":[{"poster":"Doobiedoo","comment_id":"1268913","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. microloops\n\nHere's why:\n* Microloops: These are small, unintended loops in the network that can cause packets to be forwarded in circles, consuming their TTL (Time to Live) and eventually being dropped.\n* LFA and microloops: LFA, while designed to improve convergence, can inadvertently create microloops if not configured or implemented correctly.\n* Testing and microloops: During testing, it's common to encounter temporary configurations or scenarios that can lead to microloops.\n\nWhile recursion, flooding of packets, and interface dampening can also cause network issues, microloops are the most likely explanation for the specific symptom of \"TTL expired in transit\" messages appearing during testing of LFA.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you'll need to carefully examine the network topology, LFA configuration, and any recent changes to identify and eliminate the microloop.","timestamp":"1724096940.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Your company implemented LFA in the network to help with fast convergence in case a failure occurs on the network.

LEAN project management: Focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing value, often requiring frequent client interaction for feedback and prioritization.   \n* B. Agile project management: Emphasizes iterative development and frequent feedback loops, making client involvement essential for ensuring the product meets their needs.\n* D. Kanban project management: A visual system for managing work, often used in conjunction with Agile. While it can be adapted to various levels of client involvement, it generally benefits from regular feedback.\n\nTraditional project management, on the other hand, follows a more linear approach with detailed upfront planning and less frequent client interaction.
