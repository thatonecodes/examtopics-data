Dynamic analysis.\n\nTo ensure that files are tested for viruses on a sandbox system, the Cisco FMC should be configured to perform dynamic analysis on files. Dynamic analysis is a security technique that involves executing files in a sandbox environment and observing their behavior to determine whether they are malicious.\n\nThe Cisco FMC supports dynamic analysis using its Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) feature, which includes a cloud-based sandbox for analyzing files. The AMP feature analyzes files in real-time to detect malware and other malicious activity.\n\nLocal malware analysis and spere analysis are not appropriate solutions for testing files for viruses on a sandbox system. Local malware analysis involves scanning files using antivirus software installed on the local system, which is not as effective as dynamic analysis. Sphere analysis involves analyzing files in a separate virtual environment, but it is not as comprehensive as dynamic analysis.\n\nCapacity handling is a general term that refers to the ability of a system to handle a large volume of traffic or data, and is not related to testing files for viruses on a sandbox system."},{"timestamp":"1694806020.0","comment_id":"568650","content":"The answer is correct, and this link will explain each option in case you are interested to know the differences:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/60/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v60/Reference_a_wrapper_Chapter_topic_here.html#ID-2199-000005fa","upvote_count":"2","poster":"eazy99"}],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","exam_id":314},{"id":"BkviwcqgSeN3dCpJTyea","timestamp":"2021-09-16 16:29:00","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An engineer configures a network discovery policy on Cisco FMC.
