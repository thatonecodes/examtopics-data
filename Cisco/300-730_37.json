Defining the AAA server: You need to define the AAA server configuration on the FlexVPN server, which includes specifying the server's IP address, shared secret, and other relevant settings. This ensures that the FlexVPN server can communicate with the AAA server for authentication, authorization, and accounting purposes. 2. Assigning the list to an authorization policy: Once the AAA server is defined, you need to assign the AAA attribute list to an authorization policy on the FlexVPN server. This authorization policy determines the access privileges for clients connecting to the VPN. By assigning the list to the policy, you can enforce specific attributes or rules defined in the AAA attribute list. These two tasks, defining the AAA server and assigning the AAA attribute list to an authorization policy, are essential for enabling FlexVPN to utilize the AAA attribute list for authentication and authorization purposes.","comment_id":"1100336","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"mjuarez20","comment_id":"1074029","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1716033240.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nThe question says what have to be done in order to ENABLE Flex VPN to use AAA list...
