Outbreak Filters quarantines messages that may be part of a virus outbreak or non-viral attack. While quarantined, the appliances receives updated outbreak information and rescans the message to confirm whether it’s part of an attack.\nRedirect. Outbreak Filters rewrites the URLs in non-viral attack messages to redirect the recipient through the Cisco web security proxy if they attempt to access any of the linked websites. The proxy displays a splash screen that warns the user that the website may contain malware, if the website is still operational, or displays an error message if the website has been taken offline. See Redirecting URLs for more information on redirecting URLs.\nModify. In addition to rewriting URLs in non-viral threat messages, Outbreak Filters can modify a message’s subject and add a disclaimer above the message body to warn users about the message’s content.
