They provide minimal interruption to services by being hot-swappable.\n\nExplanation:\nSFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable) modules are used to provide flexibility in connecting networking equipment, such as switches and routers, to various types of network media, including both copper and fiber interfaces. One of the key features of SFP modules, whether they are used with copper or fiber connections, is their hot-swappable nature. Hot-swappability means that you can remove or replace the SFP module while the equipment is powered on, minimizing interruption to network services. This is a significant advantage for maintenance and upgrades in a network environment.","comments":[{"poster":"Utshav","comment_id":"989728","content":"The other options are not universally true for both copper and fiber interfaces with SFP modules:\n\nA. Inline optical attenuators are typically used in fiber connections to reduce the signal strength and avoid overloading the receiver. This is not a common practice for copper connections with SFP modules.\n\nB. SFP modules for fiber connections come in both single-mode and multi-mode variants, but the same module doesn't typically accommodate both types. Copper interfaces use different types of SFP modules altogether.\n\nD. The bandwidth capability mentioned here (up to 100 Mbps in half duplex mode) doesn't accurately represent SFP modules. SFP modules can support a wide range of data rates, from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps or even higher, depending on the specific module and the type of interface (copper or fiber).","timestamp":"1692945300.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"poster":"Utshav","timestamp":"1692945180.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725357300.0","content":"i new the answer but i didnt understand in english","comment_id":"1277422","poster":"LazizS"},{"timestamp":"1699337700.0","poster":"last1904","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","comment_id":"1064543"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"dearc","comment_id":"854405","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBased on the search results, the correct answer to the question \"What is the same for both copper and fiber interfaces when using SFP modules?\" is:\n\nC.

CCMP uses the AES block cipher, replacing the RC4 cipher used in wired equivalent privacy (WEP) and temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP). A block cipher processes data in blocks, while a streaming cipher like rivest cipher 4 (RC4) processes data bit by bit, in a serial stream. The encryption method is commonly referred to as CCMP/AES. AES uses a 128-bit key and encrypts data in 128-bit blocks. CCMP/AES uses several enhancements, including temporal keys (TK), packet numbers (PN), nonce [number or bit string used only once], upper layer encryption, and additional authentication data (AAD).\n\nLINK: https://www.controleng.com/articles/wireless-security-ieee-802-11-and-ccmp-aes/","comment_id":"958400","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1705844280.0"},{"comment_id":"940856","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
