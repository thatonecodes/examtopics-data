Additionally, important duties must be separated or divided among several individuals within the organization. \n\n--> The principle of least privilege states that all users should be granted only the level of privilege they need to do their jobs, and no more. \n\nCisco CyberOps Associate CBROPS 200-201 Official Cert Guide\nBy Omar Santos","timestamp":"1727336520.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"anonymous1966"},{"poster":"Proctored_Expert","timestamp":"1727336520.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe security principle that requires more than one person is required to perform a critical task is separation of duties.\n\nSeparation of duties is a security principle that involves dividing the responsibilities for a critical task among multiple individuals, so that no single person has complete control over the task. This helps to reduce the risk of errors, fraud, or abuse, and to ensure that the task is performed accurately and in accordance with established policies and procedures.","comment_id":"750866"},{"timestamp":"1727336520.0","comment_id":"802795","poster":"drdecker100","content":"Selected Answer: C\nere's why the other options are not the correct answer to the question:\n\nA. Least privilege refers to the practice of limiting access to the minimum permissions necessary to perform a specific task. It helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or damage to critical systems and data.\n\nB. Need to know refers to the principle that individuals should only have access to information that is necessary for them to perform their job duties. This helps to prevent the spread of sensitive information to those who don't need to know it.\n\nD. Due diligence refers to the level of care and caution that is expected of individuals and organizations in order to protect themselves and others. It encompasses many different security principles and practices, including separation of duties.\n\nSo, while each of these principles is important for maintaining security, they are not directly related to the specific requirement of having more than one person perform a critical task.","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSeparation of duties is the only one of these is mandatory requirement of more than one","comment_id":"1230586","timestamp":"1718385180.0","poster":"kenprewitt","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSeparation og duties","timestamp":"1700203260.0","poster":"msg01","comment_id":"1073061"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1071698","poster":"PrettyMs","content":"C.
