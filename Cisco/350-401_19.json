Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nThe ISE is a key component of the Cisco SD-Access architecture that provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. When a client connects to an edge switch, the ISE is responsible for determining the client's identity and checking its credentials against a policy database. If the client is authorized to access the network, the ISE instructs the edge switch to assign the appropriate VLAN and apply the appropriate policies. If the client is not authorized, the ISE instructs the edge switch to quarantine the client and provide limited network access.","poster":"networkingXIV","comment_id":"893893","timestamp":"1726972920.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726972920.0","comment_id":"1216741","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct\n\nISE is responsible for identity and access control in a network. \nIt ensures that only authorized clients have access to the network by checking credentials and enforcing access policies.\n\nFor example, if a wired client with incorrect credentials tries to connect to the network, the ISE would deny access.
