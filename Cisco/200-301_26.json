It serves as the name of the wireless network and allows devices to identify and connect to a specific access point within the WLAN. Therefore, option D accurately describes a characteristic of an SSID in wireless networks.\n\nOption A refers to data threat interception, which is not specifically related to the SSID. Option B mentions the encoding of connections, which is more related to encryption rather than the SSID itself. Option C states that the SSID broadcasts a beacon signal to announce its presence by default, which is indeed a characteristic of an SSID in wireless networks. However, the more specific and accurate characteristic is that it identifies an access point on a WLAN. ~~chatgpt"},{"content":"answer is correct","comment_id":"898693","timestamp":"1700086860.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bhrino"}],"exam_id":288,"choices":{"C":"broadcasts a beacon signal to announce its presence by default","D":"identifies an access point on a WLAN","A":"intercepts data threats before they attack a network","B":"encodes connections at the sending and receiving ends"},"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1684182060,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/109353-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1110-discussion/","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":126,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (79%)","D (21%)"],"timestamp":"2023-05-15 22:21:00","topic":"1","question_text":"What is a characteristic of an SSID in wireless networks?"},{"id":"tL0wboCo2oo0jzdtdClL","answer":"A","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-05-15 22:21:00","choices":{"B":"switchport trunk native vlan 10","A":"switchport mode trunk","D":"switchport trunk allowed remove 10","C":"switchport mode access"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
