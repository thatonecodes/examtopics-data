This is because the supply chain and manufacturing processes are time sensitive, and delays can have a direct impact on business efficiency. Low latency infrastructure enables real-time information exchange and is a key component of successful just-in-time manufacturing.","poster":"kalulosu"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing model, the focus is on optimizing supply chain efficiency and ensuring components are available precisely when needed. Given that the car manufacturer does not produce all components in-house, the architect should prioritize a modular network design that can seamlessly integrate with external suppliers, partners, and production systems. Modularity ensures the network can adapt to the dynamic needs of the JIT model, such as connecting new suppliers or handling varying workloads.","comment_id":"1313597","poster":"phi8899","timestamp":"1731856020.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1729448040.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1300643","poster":"i9t6","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSecurity due the interaction with suppliers as a \"distributed\" JIT operation"},{"poster":"bdp123","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://www.joloda.com/news/a-complete-guide-to-just-in-time-jit-production/#:~:text=The%20JIT%20system%20is%20an,costs%20such%20as%20storage%20costs.","timestamp":"1712682900.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1192431"}],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/123667-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-227-discussion/","answer":"C","exam_id":331,"question_id":133,"timestamp":"2023-10-15 15:28:00","answers_community":["C (38%)","A (38%)","13%","13%"],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1697376480},{"id":"He5o3ZHmULSkv9WWEYAX","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-10-15 15:30:00","topic":"1","answer":"B","choices":{"C":"MSTP","B":"STP bridge assurance","D":"TRILL","A":"STP BPDU guard"},"question_text":"Company XYZ wants to prevent switch loops caused by unidirectional point-point-link condition on Rapid PVST + and MST.
