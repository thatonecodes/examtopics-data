With on-change subscriptions, the first push update is the entire set of subscribed to data (the initial sychronization as defined in the IETF documents). This is not controllable. Subsequent updates are sent when the data changes, and consist of only the changed data. However, the minimum data resolution for a change is a row. So, if an on-change subscription is to a leaf within a row, if any item in that row changes, an update notification is sent.
