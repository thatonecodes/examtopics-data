The key in this configuration is that the Server Recovery Manager(SRM) service will wait 30 minutes for a failed service/server to remain active before an automatic fallback is initiated. Once this 30 minute up time is established, user sessions are moved back to their homed nodes. The Jabber client will apply the re-log in upper and lower limits for the fallback. \n\nAutomatic fallback is not the default configuration, but it can be enabled. To enable automatic fallback, change the Enable Automatic Fallback parameter in the Server Recovery Manager Service Parameters to value True.","poster":"khader09","comment_id":"194237","upvote_count":"2"}],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2020-10-06 12:54:00","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/unified-communications/unified-communications-manager-im-presence-service/200958-IM-and-Presence-\nServer-High-Availability.html","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/33772-exam-300-810-topic-1-question-2-discussion/","question_id":101,"answer":"C","exam_id":319,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"10 minutes","B":"20 minutes","C":"30 minutes","D":"1 hour"},"question_text":"When Cisco IM and Presence is configured to use automatic fallback, how long does the Server Recovery Manager service wait for a failed service/server to remain active before an automatic fallback is initiated?","unix_timestamp":1601981640,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"p8XzTm6svSTV0C6W2Kx4","unix_timestamp":1631495640,"timestamp":"2021-09-13 03:14:00","question_id":102,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/im_presence/interdomain_federation/11_5_1/cup0_b_interdomain-federation-guide- imp-115.pdf","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/61935-exam-300-810-topic-1-question-20-discussion/","answers_community":[],"choices":{"D":"SCCP","C":"SIP","E":"SMPP","A":"XMPP","B":"SNMP"},"answer_images":[],"exam_id":319,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"443684","content":"A C\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/im_presence/interdomain_federation/12_5_1/cup0_b_interdomain-federation-1251.html","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726190040.0","poster":"daniel_tang"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"AC","question_text":"Which two protocols does the Cisco IM Presence service use to federate with external domains?

Perform full sync of the LDAP directory.\n\nExplanation:\n\nPerforming a full synchronization of the LDAP directory ensures that the new users are correctly imported and synchronized with Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) and the IM and Presence Service. Without this step, the new users might not appear in the system, and their settings won't be applied to Cisco Jabber.\nD. Select the \"include meeting information in presence\" check box.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo enable calendar presence integration with Microsoft Exchange, the \"include meeting information in presence\" check box needs to be selected in the user's IM and Presence settings. This allows the user's calendar information to be displayed as part of their presence status in Cisco Jabber, reflecting their calendar events (such as whether they are in a meeting or available).","comments":[{"poster":"SasdiB","content":"After further reading A and D are the correct answers","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732717020.0","comment_id":"1318709"}],"poster":"SasdiB"}],"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Select the \"enable user for Cisco UCM IM and Presence\" check box.","E":"Ensure that each user logs in to Jabber and selects \"Microsoft Outlook” in the Calendar Integration section of the Jabber client settings.","C":"Add the feature group template to LDAP sync.","D":"Select the \"include meeting information in presence\" check box.","B":"Perform full sync of the LDAP directory."},"answer_images":[],"question_id":105,"answers_community":["BD (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"AD","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"id":319,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco","numberOfQuestions":177,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"300-810","isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":21},"__N_SSP":true}
