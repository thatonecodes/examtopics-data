The below figure helps you understand it:\n\nBGP_inaccessible_next_hop_self.jpg\n\nAlthough R2 keeps the next-hop 192.168.10.20 when advertising to R1 for network 10.0.0.0/8 but R1 does not know how to reach this next-hop so it is marked as inaccessible.\n\nAlso from the output “192.168.10.20 (inaccessible) from 192.168.20.20”, we learn that the IP address 192.168.10.20 was learned from 192.168.20.20 so this IP address belongs to R2 interface which is facing R1.
