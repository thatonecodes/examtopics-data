To ensure that users in the sales department cannot access the finance department server in a clientless SSL VPN setup, a webtype ACL (Access Control List) must be added to the configuration. A webtype ACL is used to define specific access controls for clientless SSL VPN users. It allows you to control and restrict the resources that users can access through the SSL VPN portal. By creating a webtype ACL and applying it to the appropriate group-policy associated with the sales department, you can explicitly deny access to the finance department server. This ACL will prevent users in the sales department from reaching the finance department server even though they are configured under separate group-policies. On the other hand, \"tunnel group lock\" is not directly related to restricting access to specific resources. It is a feature that allows you to lock a user to a specific tunnel group, ensuring that the user always connects to that particular tunnel group. Therefore, the correct approach to prevent users in the sales department from accessing the finance department server in a clientless SSL VPN setup is to use a webtype ACL."},{"comment_id":"962562","content":"The correct answer is D. webtype ACL !\nUser Anonymous983475 says: But if we use only one ACL and the user can access another tunnel group, he will have the access according to the other tunnel group. \nThat's not quite right, because we can assign a specific group policy to the remote users that prevents access even if he uses a different tunnel group:\nASA(config)# access-list WebACL_SALES_DEPARTMENT webtype permit url http://192.168.10.100 log default\nASA(config)# access-list WebACL_FINANCE_DEPARTMENT webtype permit url http://192.168.20.100 log default\nASA(config)# group-policy sales_department internal\nASA(config)# group-policy sales_department attributes\nASA(config-group-policy)# vpn-tunnel-protocol ssl-clientless \nASA(config-group-policy)# webvpn\nASA(config-group-webvpn)# filtervalue WebACL_SALES_DEPARTMENT\nASA(config)# username RemoteUser1 password xxx\nASA(config)# username RemoteUser1 attribute\nASA(config-username)# vpn-group-policy sales_department","poster":"marges","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706183340.0"},{"comment_id":"961454","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706098320.0","poster":"randomnickname1234","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDatabase access doesn't seem to be controlled by webtype ACL's...
