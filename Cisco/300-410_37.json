This TID is a random port between 0 to 65535. \nWhen a client sends a Write or Read request (WRQ and RRQ respectively), the Client chooses a TID at random, and sends the request to the server with destination port 69, this is allowed by the ACE #2 in the ACL.\nWhen the server receives the Request, it also chooses a TID at random, and uses that to send the ACK for a WRQ or a the first data packet for RRQ, but this communication is now continued between TIDs as the source/destination UDP ports. this is where the ACE#3 in the ACL is breaking the connection.\n\n1.- CLIENT (src.port.TID) ---(WRQ/RRQ)----> (dst.port.69) TFTP\n2.- CLIENT (dst.port.TID) <---(ACK/DATA)--- (src.port.TID) TFTP","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD correct:\n\nhttps://thwack.solarwinds.com/free-tools-trials/f/tftp-server/4613/tftp-communicating-on-high-ports","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1689528420.0","comment_id":"953514","poster":"inteldarvid"},{"content":"This doesn't make sense the ACL is applied 'in' what does it have to do with outbound traffic ?","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1668622260.0","poster":"mrnipsnips","comment_id":"719889","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"XBfoundX","comment_id":"1273104","content":"Yes it is, because in this case the CPE router is the fftp server.\nThe last command is used for sharing a file from the flash of that router.\n\nThe other router will download the file from the CPE, so this will be consider inbound traffic.\n\nThe tftp-server flash command allows the router to act as a TFTP server that serves files from its flash filesystem.
