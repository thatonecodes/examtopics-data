NSSA’s or totally NSSA’s are only needed if routes are being injected into the OSPF domain. So A and B are not correct. \nC and D are both similar in that they both do not inject Type 5 LSA, which would keep router utilization down. However, if we desire to cut down on as many LSA’s as possible, which would then cut down on the router utilization due to the OSPF routers not having to run the SPF calculation, then answer C is MOST correct. A totally stubby area restricts not only type 5, but also type 4 and type 3 LSA’s. Since the requirement states “provide minimal resource utilization” answer C “totally stubby area” is correct."},{"comment_id":"612790","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1670428800.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think C - Totally Stubby Area is correct.
