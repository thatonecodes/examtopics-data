As IPFIX-enabled devices are mainly deployed at significant positions in the network, it enables broad-based monitoring of hosts and network infrastructure devices with the resulting flow record data presenting an extensive set of connection summaries.","timestamp":"1730262600.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"0d1b5b9"},{"timestamp":"1716445800.0","poster":"Seawanderer","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIPFIX flow records typically provide various performance statistics associated with IP traffic, such as RTT (Round Trip Time), Delay, Jitter and others. Probes at critical points in the network deliver performance metrics as a part of IPFIX message export to IPFIX collectors which are able to store and report on these statistics. Response time metrics for critical application and monitoring of round trip time between specific servers and network systems (e.g. server response time over HTTP/HTTPS, latency for server to storage access) can be gained as indicators for network performance. Beyond validating network performance, export of IPFIX flow records to IPFIX collectors also helps in enhancing visibility into network utilization and network capacity planning.","comment_id":"1216303"},{"comment_id":"1160238","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSeems good\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.niagaranetworks.com/blog/ipfix-use-cases-in-network-monitoring-and-analysis%3fhs_amp=true","timestamp":"1709005260.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"awstaro"},{"content":"I believe it is D. \n\nIPFIX has wide-ranging use cases which together can be classified in 3 main categories: flow analysis, threat detection and performance monitoring.
