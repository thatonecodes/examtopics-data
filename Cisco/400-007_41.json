When a specific route fails, EIGRP queries are contained within the area defined by the summary route, preventing the queries from spreading throughout the entire network.

This means that when a link failure occurs, the query messages to recompute routes will have a smaller domain to traverse, leading to faster convergence. In a squared fashion, each router is directly connected to its neighbors, forming a square or grid-like topology.\n\nThis approach helps to minimize the query propagation delay and reduce the time required for reconvergence, allowing the network to converge quickly and maintain optimal routing paths.","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_text":"How can EIGRP topologies be designed to converge as fast as possible in the event of a point-to-point link failure?","choices":{"B":"Limit the query domain by use of default routes.","E":"Build neighbor adjacencies in a triangulated fashion.","A":"Limit the query domain by use of summarization.","D":"Limit the query domain by use of distribute lists.","C":"Build neighbor adjacencies in a squared fashion."},"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-06-04 05:16:00","answers_community":["A (67%)","E (20%)","13%"]},{"id":"lsl5tiDkHyLsj34cvmqa","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04315/0002800001.png"],"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nDrag and drop the multicast protocols from the left onto the correct design situations on the right.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","unix_timestamp":1668973980,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/88122-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-41-discussion/","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"","exam_id":331,"timestamp":"2022-11-20 20:53:00","question_id":203,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1074872","upvote_count":"9","poster":"walkwolf3","timestamp":"1716137820.0","content":"PIM-SM supports IPv4 and v6 while PIM-DM only supports IPv4.\nThe correct order is:\nPIM-SM, SSM BIDIR -> IPv6 Forwarding\nPIM-DM, PIM-SM, SSM, BIDR -> IPv4 Forwarding\nIGMP -> IPv4 Group Management\nMSDP(Multicast Source Discovery Protocol) -> IPv4 Interdomain Source Discovery\nMLD(Multicast Listener Discovery) -> IPv6 Group Management"},{"content":"in the CCDE official cert guide, chapter 13, multicast routing protocols, there is a comparison table:\nPIM-DM: IPv4\nPIM-SM: IPv4/6\nPIM-SSM: IPv4/6\nPIM-BIDIR: IPv4/6","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1133150","timestamp":"1722060300.0","poster":"blurain"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"890207","content":"Just noticed the 1st link was HP not Cisco - therefore PIM-DM only for IPv4","poster":"bdp123","timestamp":"1699212840.0"},{"poster":"bdp123","upvote_count":"1","content":"Bad question as both IPv4 and IPv6 support PIM-DM...\nhttps://techhub.hpe.com/eginfolib/networking/docs/switches/5820x-5800/5998-7383r_ip-multi_cg/content/441757461.htm#:~:text=IPv6%20PIM-DM%20is%20a%20type%20of%20dense%20mode,small-sized%20networks%20with%20densely%20distributed%20IPv6%20multicast%20members.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipmulti_pim/configuration/xe-16/imc-pim-xe-16-book/imc-tech-oview.html","timestamp":"1699212240.0","comment_id":"890202"},{"comment_id":"841845","content":"No IPv6 PIM-DM mentioned\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipmulti_pim/configuration/xe-16/imc-pim-xe-16-book/ip6-mcast-pim-sm.html","timestamp":"1694935740.0","poster":"biddid","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"why would PIM-DM belong to IPv6 and not to IPv4?

It is responsible for aggregating multiple access switches and providing connectivity to the core layer. By terminating the Layer 2 interconnection at the aggregation layer, you can effectively extend VLANs across the access switches in both data centers.\n\nThis approach allows for better control and management of Layer 2 connectivity while keeping the core layer as a Layer 3-only domain. It avoids extending Layer 2 beyond the necessary boundaries and helps isolate the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) domains, minimizing the impact of potential spanning tree issues.","timestamp":"1733289600.0"}],"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":331,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/111048-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-42-discussion/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-06-04 05:20:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"r970FlG7NX9fZpufpCeH","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":331,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1738903080.0","comment_id":"1352820","poster":"Devsin2000","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTo make it non-transitive, we must not advertise the routes that are received from other ASs AS Path filter is an excellent tool to do that."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\noutgoing towards peer AS -> permit ^$ (empty as-path)","timestamp":"1721317680.0","poster":"644143b","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1250527"},{"comment_id":"943267","poster":"BrianWei","comments":[{"timestamp":"1689364380.0","content":"If the route is learnt from other AS, it should have other AS no. in the AS path, i.e. not only AS111.
