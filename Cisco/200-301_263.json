HSRP provides redundancy by allowing multiple routers to work together in a group, ensuring that if one router fails, another can take over its role seamlessly. This enhances network availability and reliability.\n\nC. HSRP allows multiple routers to form a virtual router group, with one router acting as the active router and the others as standby routers. This virtual router group presents a single virtual IP address and MAC address to hosts on the LAN, providing redundancy and ensuring uninterrupted connectivity even if the active router fails.","comment_id":"1187189","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"picho707","comment_id":"1054929","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nThe answer is correct.","timestamp":"1714170300.0"},{"timestamp":"1707576660.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"977670","poster":"Danthemann","content":"Not sure about this one.
