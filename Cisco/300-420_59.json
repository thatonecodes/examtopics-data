In an SD-WAN environment, FEC helps maintain a better application experience by reducing the impact of packet loss and improving the overall quality of the connection.\n\nUtilizing quality of service (QoS): QoS is a set of techniques used to manage and prioritize network traffic to ensure that critical applications receive the required bandwidth and performance levels. In an SD-WAN environment, QoS can be used to prioritize important applications over less critical ones, ensuring that the user experience remains consistent and optimal for essential applications even in situations with limited bandwidth or network congestion."}],"question_id":295,"unix_timestamp":1682707680,"answers_community":["AD (100%)"]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"name":"300-420","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":305,"isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":299,"provider":"Cisco","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":59},"__N_SSP":true}
