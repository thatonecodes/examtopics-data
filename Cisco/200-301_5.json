Let’s dive into what it is:\n\nDefinition:\nAn Ansible inventory is a file or group of files that defines the managed nodes (also known as “hosts”) you want to automate.\nIt provides information about the hosts’ names, IP addresses, ports, and other relevant details.\nPurpose:\nAutomation: Ansible uses the inventory to automate tasks on the managed nodes.\nGrouping: You can organize hosts into groups within the inventory. This allows you to run automation tasks on multiple hosts simultaneously.\nPatterns: Once your inventory is defined, you use patterns to select specific hosts or groups for Ansible to operate on.\nFormats:\nThe simplest inventory is a single file with a list of hosts and groups.\nThe default location for this file is /etc/ansible/hosts.\nCommon formats include INI and YAML.","comment_id":"1154682","poster":"JulesAZ","timestamp":"1724148000.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"JulesAZ","comment_id":"1154681","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI started off as D.... which i am not sure is wrong... however the following from Copilot seems to point more directly at B - see below;","timestamp":"1724148000.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1050616","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nInventory: These files provide device hostnames along with information about each device, like device roles, so Ansible can perform functions for subsets of the inventory.\n\nOCG 439","timestamp":"1713791880.0"},{"timestamp":"1707018000.0","poster":"NetworkGeek00","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B. use to define the target devices (ssh enabled) and it can write in .ini and .yml formats.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"971602"},{"comment_id":"970510","content":"Inventory means devices.

Both cable types support RJ-45 connectors.\n\n1000BASE-LX and 1000BASE-T are both Ethernet standards, but they use different physical media and have different characteristics. 1000BASE-LX typically uses single-mode or multi-mode fiber optic cables and supports longer distances, while 1000BASE-T uses twisted-pair copper cables (usually Cat 5e or Cat 6) and supports shorter distances. However, both standards use the same RJ-45 connectors for network connections, which is a common similarity between them.\n\n1000BASE-LX and 1000BASE-T standards do not use the same data-link header and trailer formats.\n\n1000BASE-LX is a standard for Gigabit Ethernet over fiber optics, and it uses a different encoding and modulation scheme compared to 1000BASE-T, which is designed for Gigabit Ethernet over twisted-pair copper cables. The data-link header and trailer formats may differ between these two standards due to the variations in the physical layer and transmission methods.\n\nSo, the correct similarity between these two standards is B, as they both use RJ-45 connectors for network connections.","timestamp":"1694718000.0","comment_id":"1007869","poster":"saitsu","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"xtraMiles","comment_id":"1251980","timestamp":"1721506560.0","content":"Incorrect.
