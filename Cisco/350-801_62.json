Video is of these devices as desktop endpoints or standard video endpoints such as ip phones and softphones. Inmersive are for High definition endpoints, as Telepresence devices. Also, RSVP-based CAC and Location-based CAC are two different things.\nThen:\nB. is incorrect. The correct stuff would be \"codecs\", no \"transcoders\".\nC. is incorrect. Immersive video does not make for all of the endpoints, rather just to telepresence endpoints, not desktop or softphone endpoints. Also, RSVP does not make to Location-based CAC (Topology-unaware CAC), rather a RSVP-based CAC (Topology-aware CAC); they are two different mechanism.\nD. is incorrect, Resolution does not make to bandwith consumption.

The RSVP locations settings are not considered here for Enhanced Location CAC because they apply only to RSVP implementations.
