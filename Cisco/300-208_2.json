This allows separate authentication solutions that can still use TACACS+ for authorization and accounting. For example, with TACACS+, it is possible to use Kerberos authentication and TACACS+ authorization and accounting. After a NAS authenticates on a Kerberos server, it requests authorization information from a TACACS+ server without having to re-authenticate. The NAS informs the TACACS+ server that it has successfully authenticated on a Kerberos server, and the server then provides authorization information.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/remote-authentication-dial-user-service-radius/13838-10.html#comp_traffic","timestamp":"1581296340.0"},{"comment_id":"3088","content":"Doesn't RADIUS also send authentication & accounting in different requests?\nI know it sends authentication and authorization in the same request.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I though the same actually","timestamp":"1580122680.0","poster":"evdw","comment_id":"43247"}],"poster":"aal","timestamp":"1561337100.0","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"iT7jSvptJ78YzTxyXQ8G","exam_id":300,"question_text":"Which feature of Cisco ASA allows VPN users to be postured against Cisco ISE without requiring an inline posture node?","choices":{"B":"device tracking","D":"VLAN hopping","C":"DHCP snooping","A":"RADIUS Change of Authorization"},"topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/94248-exam-300-208-topic-1-question-121-discussion/","answers_community":[],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1673067240,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"768241","upvote_count":"2","poster":"mm_cisco_2022","content":"The Cisco ASA Version 9.2.1 supports RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA) (RFC 5176). This allows for posturing of VPN users against the Cisco ISE without the need for an IPN. After a VPN user logs in, the ASA redirects web traffic to the ISE, where the user is provisioned with a Network Admission Control (NAC) Agent or Web Agent. The agent performs specific checks on the user machine in order to determine its compliance against a configured set of posture rules, such as Operating System (OS), patches, AntiVirus, Service, Application, or Registry rules.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/adaptive-security-appliance-asa-software/117693-configure-ASA-00.html","timestamp":"1673067240.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-01-07 05:54:00","question_id":7,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"TIC5w6K5Z791ZbQ5gLTF","answer_images":[],"exam_id":300,"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"It provides the My Devices portal, allowing users to add devices to the network.","A":"It provides support for native supplicants, allowing users to connect devices directly to the network.","C":"It provides support for users to install the Cisco NAC agent on enterprise devices.","D":"It provides self-registration functionality to allow guest users to access the network."},"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1579874640,"answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which functionality does the Cisco ISE self-provisioning flow provide?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/12665-exam-300-208-topic-1-question-130-discussion/","question_id":8,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"evdw","timestamp":"1579874640.0","comment_id":"42334","content":"Self-Provisioning Portal\n\nEmployees access the Self-Provisioning portal when registering personal devices using native supplicants.
