These zones determine how traffic is routed between different networks, allowing the system to manage different types of communication traffic and control access to resources.\n\nThe two protocols supported on Expressway Zones are:\n\nSIP (Session Initiation Protocol):\n\nSIP is a signaling protocol widely used for establishing, maintaining, and terminating real-time sessions, such as voice and video calls. Expressway supports SIP for interconnecting different parts of the network, such as connecting users to remote services or external users.\nH.323:\n\nH.323 is a signaling and control protocol used for multimedia communications, especially in video conferencing. Cisco Expressway also supports H.323 for interconnecting with H.323-based endpoints and networks.","comment_id":"1329583","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1734715560.0"}]},{"id":"8qsaLRRNHRbO3q8Xeoyy","answers_community":["BC (50%)","AB (50%)"],"exam_id":321,"answer_ET":"AC","question_id":72,"question_images":[],"answer":"BC","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/144835-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-163-discussion/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"jonycakes","comment_id":"1329586","timestamp":"1734715860.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nProper DNS configuration on Expressway servers is critical for:\nVerifying the common name in server certificates (A)\nRouting calls based on SIP URI (B)"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Cayne_Collins","timestamp":"1722449880.0","comment_id":"1259043","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nThis is a tricky question. The real trick on this is what requires a FQDN.\n\nA. Expressway servers verify the common name attribute in server certificates.\nI am leaning away from this one. The common name doesnt necessarily have to line up with a FQDN. \n\nB. Expressway servers route calls based on SIP URI.\nThis is a definite yes. URI dialing requires a DNS server to be configured.\n\nC. Admins avoid IP address configuration for neighbor zone peers.\nI am leaning towards this one. You can only configure an IP address or FQDN. If you go FQDN, you need a DNS configured\n\nD. Expressway servers use NTP peer authentication for secure time updates.\nYou can configure an IP address or FQDN here. I am discounting this because you can configure an IP address.\n\nE. Admins download software updates from the Cisco website via WebUI.\nSoftware updates are not obtained via WebUI for expressways.
