The script expects a text file called 'devices.txt' that contains device information in a comma-separated format.\n\n2. The script then reads through the file line by line:\nfor line in file:\n device_info_list = line.strip().split(',') # Removes whitespace and splits by commas\n device_info = {} # Creates an empty dictionary for each device\n\n3. For each line, the script creates a dictionary to store the device's information in a more organized way. The strip() method removes any extra whitespace or newline characters, and split(',') breaks the line into a list using commas as separators.\n\n4. The script then assigns each piece of information to specific keys in the dictionary.\n5. After creating the dictionary for a device, it's added to the main list.\n6. Finally, the script prints the entire list of devices and closes the file.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1356191","poster":"abrielirus123","timestamp":"1739462100.0"},{"comment_id":"1287276","timestamp":"1726912020.0","poster":"Rfvaz","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGiven answer is correct.","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer":"D","answer_images":[]},{"id":"HIXF7KHb0OC0aE8k8lFs","timestamp":"2024-09-22 15:30:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/147970-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-1053-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","exam_id":324,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-401/image744.png"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt's B.\n\nRe-created in CML:\n\n*Nov 20 22:11:01.285: OSPF-1 ADJ Gi1/0/1: First DBD and we are not SLAVE\n<snip>\n*Nov 20 22:11:06.066: OSPF-1 ADJ Gi1/0/1: Rcv DBD from 1.1.1.1 seq 0x1172 opt 0x52 flag 0x7 len 32 mtu 1000 state EXSTART\n*Nov 20 22:11:06.066: OSPF-1 ADJ Gi1/0/1: Nbr 1.1.1.1 has smaller interface MTU\n<snip>\n*Nov 20 22:12:33.751: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 1.1.1.1 on GigabitEthernet1/0/1 from EXSTART to DOWN, Neighbor Down: Too many retransmissions\n\nIf you want to see what MTU value the neighbor is sending: debug ip ospf adj\n\nhth","poster":"NetworkJanitor","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732137600.0","comment_id":"1315515"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nEXSTART state is the keyword (MTU or RID mismatch)","timestamp":"1729517220.0","comment_id":"1301021","upvote_count":"2","poster":"NetworkJanitor"},{"poster":"chiacche","comment_id":"1287727","content":"Selected Answer: B\nkeyword: retransmissions \nMaximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is the maximum packet size that each interface or link in the network can transmit.\nIf the MTUs between two OSPF neighbors do not match, the neighbor relationship may not be established.","timestamp":"1727011800.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":62,"choices":{"B":"interface MTU mismatch","D":"area mismatch","A":"authentication mismatch","C":"timers mismatch"},"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.

A mobility group refers to a set of WLCs that share information to facilitate client roaming.\n\nWhen a client device roams between access points controlled by different WLCs within the same mobility group, it’s usually referred to as layer 2 roaming. In this scenario, the client maintains its IP address and session as it moves between access points, and the WLCs coordinate handoffs seamlessly.\n\nHowever, when a client roams between access points controlled by WLCs in different mobility groups, it’s considered layer 3 roaming. In this case, the client may need to obtain a new IP address and establish a new session as it moves between different subnets or networks managed by different WLCs.\"","timestamp":"1738883460.0","poster":"dkonly"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"MrG","comment_id":"1321361","timestamp":"1733229720.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nchatGPT agrees"},{"poster":"NetworkJanitor","content":"It's D.\n\nThe \"client\" key word is missing from A, making it incorrect. A successful L3 client roam is provided by controllers in different groups.\n\nFor Layer 3 roaming to function effectively within Cisco Mobility Groups, several dependencies must be met:\n\n1. Mobility Group Configuration: All participating WLCs must be correctly configured within the same mobility group to share client and access point information.\n\n2. Mobility List Entries: Controllers can communicate across different mobility groups if they include each other in their mobility lists, allowing clients to roam between access points in different groups.\n\n3. Consistent IP Addressing: Clients should maintain the same IP address while roaming across different subnets. This is facilitated by Cisco Centralized Key Management (CCKM) and proactive key caching (PKC), which are specifically designed for inter-mobility-group roaming.\n\n4. Multicast Messaging: Enabling multicast messaging can optimize communication between controllers, especially in large mobility groups, reducing network traffic and improving efficiency.","comment_id":"1315523","timestamp":"1732139460.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"The correct answer is:\n\nA.
