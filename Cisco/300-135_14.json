The question clearly states \"a trouble ticket has been opened indicating that Client 1 cannot ping the 209.65.200.241 address\" - it doesn't mention Client 2 at all. IMO we shouldn't assume Client 2 has to be fixed even though the question's scenario/description suggests it would be affected by the same issue as Client 1. \n\nOf course that's only an opinion.
