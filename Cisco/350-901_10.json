With this model, the server provides a “raw” code that implements some application logic and renders a web page into its final form locally within a browser. It allows the creation of dynamic web pages, where the view changes based on user input and events (for example, hovering a mouse over a thumbnail brings up a full-sized image) without any interaction with a server, resulting in a much better user experience.\n\n> The load balance could be done by using local ADC (Application Delivery Controllers) or geographically by using GSLB (Global Server Load Balancer) with DNS queries or CDN caches.","comment_id":"633652","upvote_count":"3","poster":"designated","timestamp":"1705685880.0"},{"timestamp":"1675954620.0","poster":"dhie","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"422139","content":"Distributed Load Balancing\nIn distributed load balancing, there are no central load balancers, each client that requires some service uses that service via locally installed reverse-proxy.

This is in distinction to vertically scaled systems, where adding capacity and throughput generally involves replacing smaller nodes with larger and more powerful ones. Nevertheless, horizontal scalability brings a new problem, if you have 10 service doing the same job, which one to connect, to put simply how to distribute the traffic? Solution to this, of course, distributing incoming traffic to the pool of resources or servers by load balancing.\n\nIn distributed load balancing, there are no central load balancers, each client that requires some service uses that service via locally installed reverse-proxy. Reverse-proxy is always up-to-date with existing services, meaning when a new service is being provisioned, reverse-proxy is configuration and it is updated. Reverse-proxy, take cares of the load-balancing, so it is a client-side load-balancing. Every time, a client makes a request, based on the load-balancing strategy, reverse-proxy, distributes the request to the attached resources.","comment_id":"172668","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"I go with 'D. client-side/local load balancing'\nhttps://enginyoyen.com/distributed-load-balancing/\nsection 'Distributed Load Balancing'","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"159715","timestamp":"1645089600.0","poster":"FR99"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1642980180.0","content":"Isn't C the correct answer?","poster":"rollercoaster785","comment_id":"142316","comments":[{"content":"Sorry let me withdraw my comment","comment_id":"143065","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1643082600.0","poster":"rollercoaster785"}]}],"unix_timestamp":1594356540,"question_text":"Where should distributed load balancing occur in a horizontally scalable architecture?","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"firewall-side/policy load balancing","B":"network-side/central load balancing","D":"client-side/local load balancing","C":"service-side/remote load balancing"},"exam_id":329,"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/25307-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-14-discussion/","question_id":46,"timestamp":"2020-07-10 06:49:00","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer":"D","answer_images":[]},{"id":"dYkQg6jPi4MOsk9YkNs4","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/63525-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-140-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"456689","content":"d is correct","upvote_count":"9","timestamp":"1696352820.0","poster":"kakonyib"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nwhere is the don't store it option? :D","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1399497","poster":"examtopicstroilevw","timestamp":"1742176200.0"},{"timestamp":"1727543820.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect answer: D\n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/the-complete-guide-to-docker-volumes-1a06051d2cce","poster":"Teringzooi","comment_id":"681962","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"579777","poster":"__al__","timestamp":"1712048580.0","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"comment_id":"584381","content":"to be honest, C is a less terrible option.
