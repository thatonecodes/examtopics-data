For example MS390 and C9300-M series switches currently do not support MS Warm Spare (VRRP) functionality. MS Series switches can only be configured in pairs from the same family when using VRRP/Warm Spare. Integration with other vendors or platforms is currently not supported. MS250 can only be paired with another MS250.","timestamp":"1733272020.0","poster":"sattori"},{"timestamp":"1717101240.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1221814","poster":"Adrian1988","content":"Correct: C\n\nDevice Level Redundancy: Cisco Meraki devices, such as switches, security appliances, and wireless access points, often support high availability features within the same device category. For example:\n\n Switch Stacking: Meraki switches can be stacked to create a single logical switch with redundant links between switches, providing resilience against switch failures.\n Warm Spare (HA): Certain Meraki security appliances support a high availability (HA) configuration where a standby unit takes over in case the primary unit fails. This ensures continuous operation and minimal downtime.\n AP Redundancy: Meraki wireless access points can be configured with redundancy, where nearby access points can provide coverage if one access point fails."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1133214","poster":"Kiprotich","timestamp":"1706348340.0","content":"Meraki MS320 and MS420 switches supports Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for warm spare failover.

This setting permits full network access, with the exception of HTTP (TCP Port 80), prior to authentication. If you do not want clients to access network resources outside of the Walled Garden without being authenticated or whitelisted, the Captive Portal Strength should be set to “Block all access prior to sign-on”.\n2.If Controller disconnection behavior is set to “Open” and the Splash URL/Cloud controller is unreachable, the client will be allowed full access until the Splash URL becomes available.
