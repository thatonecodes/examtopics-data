Note that the System IP address is used instead of the interface IP address as an identifier for a TLOC route. That’s because the interface IP can change at any given moment. Using the fixed System-IP ensures that the TLOC can be uniquely identified at all times irrespective of any interface IP changes. This is very important because an OMP route (vRoute) has a next-hop pointing to a TLOC. This separation of information allows TLOC routes to be updated with new parameters without having to invalidate the dependent vRoutes. If a vEdge router has multiple transport interfaces connected to different WAN providers, as shown in figure 7, a TLOC route is created and advertised for each WAN interface.\n\nDTLS or TLS provides communication privacy between Cisco SD-WAN devices in the network, using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) encryption algorithm to encrypt all control traffic sent over the connections"},{"comment_id":"902034","timestamp":"1716129480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Nickplayany","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI agree with A and below explanation."},{"comment_id":"881552","poster":"SpicyMochi","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is TLOC (Transport Location). In Cisco SD-WAN, TLOC is an identifier that represents a WAN transport link and its associated properties, such as IP address, color (to differentiate between transports), and encapsulation type.
