The advantage of this approach is that the new protocol can work without disturbing the old protocol, thus providing connectivity between users of the new protocol. Tunneling has two disadvantages, as discussed in RFC 6144:\nUsers of the new architecture cannot use the services of the underlying infrastructure. Tunneling does not enable users of the new protocol to communicate with users of the old protocol without dual-stack hosts, which negates interoperability.

A larger window size is recommended to improve TCP performance in network paths with large bandwidth-delay product characteristics that are called Long Fat Networks (LFNs). The\nTCP Window Scaling enhancement provides that support. The window scaling extension in Cisco IOS software expands the definition of the TCP window to 32 bits and then uses a scale factor to carry this 32-bit value in the 16-bit window field of the TCP header. The window size can increase to a scale factor of 14.\nTypical applications use a scale factor of 3 when deployed in LFNs.\nThe TCP Window Scaling feature complies with RFC 1323. The larger scalable window size will allow TCP to perform better over LFNs. Use the iptcp window-size command in global configuration mode to configure the TCP window size. In order for this to work, the remote host must also support this feature and its window size must be increased.

Specifically, TCP transmitters throttle back flows when drops are detected. Although some UDP applications have application-level windowing, flow control, and retransmission capabilities, most UDP transmitters are completely oblivious to drops and, thus, never lower transmission rates because of dropping. When TCP flows are combined with UDP flows within a single service-provider class and the class experiences congestion, TCP flows continually lower their transmission rates, potentially giving up their bandwidth to UDP flows that are oblivious to drops. This effect is called TCP starvation/UDP dominance.\nTCP starvation/UDP dominance likely occurs if (TCP-based) Mission-Critical Data is assigned to the same service-provider class as (UDP-based) Streaming-\nVideo and the class experiences sustained congestion. Even if WRED is enabled on the service-provider class, the same behavior would be observed because\nWRED (for the most part) manages congestion only on TCP-based flows.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/QoS_SRND/QoS- SRND-Book/VPNQoS.html\nTopic 2, Layer 2 Technologies","unix_timestamp":1582272300,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14598-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-421-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_text":"Under which condition does UDP dominance occur?","question_id":245,"answer":"D. when ACLs are in place to block TCP traffic","timestamp":"2020-02-21 09:05:00","choices":{"A":"when TCP traffic is in the same class as UDP","B":"when UDP flows are assigned a lower priority queue","C":"when WRED is enabled"},"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"A. when TCP traffic is in the same class as UDP","poster":"diegonamaste","comment_id":"53333","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1582272300.0"}],"answers_community":[]}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":437,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"provider":"Cisco","id":296,"name":"300-101","isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":49},"__N_SSP":true}
