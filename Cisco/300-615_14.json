You can configure an interface to use HSRP version 2.\n\nHSRP version 2 has the following enhancements to to HSRP version 1:\n\n•Expands the group number range. HSRP version 1 supports group numbers from 0 to 255. HSRP version 2 supports group numbers from 0 to 4095.\n\n•Uses the new IP multicast address 224.0.0.102 to send hello packets instead of the multicast address of 224.0.0.2, which is used by HSRP version 1.\n\n•Uses the MAC address range from 0000.0C9F.F000 to 0000.0C9F.FFFF. HSRP version 1 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C07.AC00 to 0000.0C07.ACFF.\n\n•Adds support for MD5 authentication.\n\nWhen you change the HSRP version, Cisco NX-OS reinitializes the group because it now has a new virtual MAC address.\n\nHSRP version 2 has a different packet format than HSRP version 1. The packet format uses a type-length-value (TLV) format.
