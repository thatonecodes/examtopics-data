SC square connectors are too big to fit in a SFP or SFP+.\n\nGBIC is SC:\nGBIC is commonly used with Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel. But its applications are not limited to these two types. There is also Fast Ethernet (FE) GBIC, BIDI GBIC, CWDM GBIC, DWDM GBIC, etc. Generally, GBIC is with the SC connector.Jan 14, 2015\n\nThe question is really about connector types.
