VLAN.\n\nReason: In the context of Cisco TrustSec, VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a common classification used to segment network traffic based on logical groupings. By configuring VLANs as security group tags, the engineer can enforce policy-based access controls and ensure that traffic within the same VLAN is treated consistently. This is essential for maintaining security across different segments of the network.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729479960.0","comment_id":"1300724","poster":"logitrain"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CE\nThe process of assigning the SGT is called Classification. A SGT can be assigned dynamically as the result of an ISE authorization or it can be assigned via static methods that map the SGT to some thing, like a VLAN, subnet, IP Address, or port-profile (for VMs or interface). Dynamic classification is typically used to assign SGT to users because users are mobile. They could be connected from any location via wireless, wired, or vpn. On the other hand, servers tend not to move, so typically static classification methods are used.","comment_id":"1299962","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729329300.0","poster":"TiberiuszSun"},{"poster":"NullNull88","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709928120.0","content":"vlan and int","comment_id":"1169075"},{"content":"I believe it should be VLAN and interface","comment_id":"1133735","upvote_count":"2","poster":"HercJ","timestamp":"1706401380.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CE\nVLAN & Interface","comment_id":"1133495","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1706373540.0","poster":"qqqqqqqqqqq123"}],"answer_ET":"CE","question_text":"A security engineer has a new TrustSec projct and must create a few static security group tag classifications as proof of concept.

An example use case would be a critical network device such as a process control endpoint in a manufacturing facility, or a networked medical device in a healthcare facility. In these examples, the administrator may want to statically assign the endpoint to a policy.
