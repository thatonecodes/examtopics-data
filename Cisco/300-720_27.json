If it detects a virus, the message is either dropped or repaired, depending on the configuration.\nSophos Engine: If the McAfee engine determines that the message is virus-free, the Sophos engine then scans the message, adding a second layer of protection.\n\nThis sequential scanning ensures that emails are thoroughly checked for viruses, enhancing the overall security of your email system."},{"content":"Sophos: The ESA first uses the Sophos antivirus engine.
