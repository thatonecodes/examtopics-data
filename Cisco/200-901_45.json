The interface of an RPC API is focused on the procedures that can be called, and the input and output parameters of those procedures.\n\nOn the other hand, REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are resource-focused, meaning that they are designed to expose a set of resources that can be manipulated using a fixed set of operations (such as create, read, update, delete). The interface of a REST API is focused on the resources that are available, and the operations that can be performed on those resources.","poster":"mellohello"},{"timestamp":"1688136540.0","comment_id":"762158","content":"can you provide where it talks about this in the book?","poster":"outrageous7","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1672418940,"answers_community":["A (78%)","C (22%)"]},{"id":"l30D1kMKNzR7sd7R899o","topic":"1","choices":{"B":"release versions to specific hardware","C":"maximized configuration drift","D":"easily reproducible systems","A":"nonreplicable snowflake servers","E":"repeatable processes"},"answer_ET":"DE","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1720019340.0","comment_id":"764896","upvote_count":"9","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nD and E are the correct answers","poster":"mellohello"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: DE\ni think it's DE","comment_id":"762162","poster":"outrageous7","timestamp":"1719759060.0"},{"comment_id":"759550","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Pateras_","content":"i think it should be the last two","timestamp":"1719554820.0"}],"answer":"DE","answers_community":["DE (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which two situations align with infrastructure as code principles?
