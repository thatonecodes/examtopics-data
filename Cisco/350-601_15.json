Port-channel only helps with link level redundancy between the NPV and NPIV switches, it won't help when you need to reboot the NPV switch after enabling the NPV mode. A single NPV device can be attached to multiple upstream switches based on the documentation, but this also wouldn't help the downstream hosts, except if they are connected to both fabrics and only one of the NPV switches was restarted at a time.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/storage/san_switches/mds9000/sw/rel_3_x/configuration/guides/fm_3_3_1/npv.html","upvote_count":"4"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/62562-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-163-discussion/","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"An engineer must ensure fabric redundancy when implementing NPV mode on a Cisco MDS 9000 Series Switch.\nWhich action enables fabric redundancy?","choices":{"C":"Configure the NPV devices to use an external FLOGI database.","B":"Add a port channel to upstream switches.","D":"Connect the NPV devices to multiple upstream switches.","A":"Use TE ports to connect to upstream switches."},"exam_id":326,"timestamp":"2021-09-22 18:19:00","unix_timestamp":1632327540,"question_id":72,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (88%)","13%"],"answer_images":[],"answer":"D"},{"id":"kwfOFuUDCA2TaetOWd8Q","timestamp":"2022-09-25 22:22:00","question_id":73,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04312/0015900001.png"],"exam_id":326,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/83622-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-164-discussion/","question_text":"An engineer is converting a Cisco MDS switch to support NPIV mode.\nWhat should be considered when implementing the solution?","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719963660.0","content":"C is correct\nYou must globally enable NPIV for all VSANs on the MDS switch to allow the NPIV-enabled applications to use multiple N port identifiers.\n\nreference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/mds9000/sw/6_2/configuration/guides/interfaces/nx-os/cli_interfaces/npv.html#34496","comment_id":"1241079","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mustafa"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the one!","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"679201","poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","timestamp":"1664137320.0"}],"choices":{"D":"It requires the FLOGI database to be disabled.","A":"It requires mapping of external interface traffic.","C":"It must be enabled globally on all VSANs.","B":"It must be enabled on VSAN 1 only."},"topic":"1","answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1664137320,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"About N Port Identifier Virtualization\nN port identifier virtualization (NPIV) provides a means to assign multiple FC IDs to a single N port.
