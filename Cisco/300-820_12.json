However, the key to the question is that we're talking about signaling that is encrypted. That means TLS over TCP/IP. Since the station is initiating the connection to the outside via TCP/IP (with TLS on top), the signaling traffic will go through, and return traffic come back via the dynamic NAT from the firewall. Has nothing to do with the traffic being \"always trusted\" though. The media is a different story. Media exchange would fail as the device would not be reachable from the outside without additional collaboration ifnrastructure unless you are using some form of static NAT. So, the best answer here is A.","poster":"TestingAAgain","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1701911400.0","comment_id":"612508","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"635917","content":"A NAT ALG is similar to a firewall ALG, but a NAT ALG actually changes (maps) the addresses and ports in the signaling messages.
