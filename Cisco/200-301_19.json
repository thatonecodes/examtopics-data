It serves as the centralized management point of an SDN (Software-Defined Networking) architecture . The controller is responsible for managing network devices and implementing network policies, as well as providing a central point of control and visibility for the entire network. It enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration through the use of software-based controllers or a centralized controller with open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that communicate with network devices and applications . This promotes increased network agility, scalability, and flexibility in response to changing business needs.","poster":"dearc","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1680174900.0","comment_id":"855658"},{"poster":"bymrdas","timestamp":"1718358240.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.","comment_id":"1230401","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1196302","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1713236760.0"},{"poster":"rodrigocalcarao","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn the context of the question, both options B and C are valid functions of an endpoint, but option B describes a broader function—connecting server and client devices to a network—which encompasses the role of endpoints in facilitating communication between various devices on the network.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712826540.0","comment_id":"1193630"},{"timestamp":"1664804760.0","comment_id":"685575","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1666308180.0","poster":"rick0813","content":"but A says that \"centralized management point\" , isn't it management plane and control plane is different in SDN Architecture?","comments":[{"comment_id":"830692","content":"it also confused me, this is a very tricky question if you don't read it at least twice.","poster":"soRwatches","timestamp":"1678095600.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"701106","timestamp":"1666377960.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"RougePotatoe","content":"\"What is the function of a controller in controller-based networking?\" You might wanna read the question again no where does it mention control plane.
