Add Local CD/DVD and SAN Boot: When configuring the boot policy, you should add the SAN Boot option to the list of boot devices.

Additionally, adding the Local CD/DVD option can be useful for the initial installation of the operating system from a physical disc or an ISO image.\n\n\nD. Configure a SAN Boot Target with a WWPN: You need to specify the SAN boot target within the boot policy. This involves configuring the World Wide Port Name (WWPN) of the target port on the storage array and the LUN ID that the server should boot from.

L2Out is used for bridging traffic outside the ACI fabric, while L3Out is used for routing traffic outside the fabric.

The VSAN provides a unique fabric services identifier to the Fibre Channel protocol, allowing for traffic isolation and management. You need to create and assign a VSAN to the FC uplink ports on the Fabric Interconnect that will be used to connect to the storage array.\n\nE. Configure the fabric interconnect in FC switch mode.\n\n\nBy default, Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects operate in end-host mode (also known as NPV mode - N_Port Virtualization), which means they do not perform any Fibre Channel zoning or domain ID allocation. However, to connect directly to an FC storage port without an intervening FC switch, the Fabric Interconnect must be set to FC switch mode.
