The southbound API is the interface through which the SDN controller communicates with these network devices.\n\nWhen using the southbound API, the SDN controller sends instructions and configuration commands to the switches and routers in the network. These instructions can include actions like modifying forwarding tables, setting up flow rules, configuring quality of service (QoS) parameters, and more.\n\nThe switches and routers, acting as the data plane, receive and process the instructions from the controller, implementing the desired network behavior. They forward traffic based on the rules and configurations received from the controller.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. between the SDN controller and switches and routers on the network.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Zepar"},{"content":"PC is a device too so why not A?","comment_id":"904562","comments":[{"poster":"fd17639","content":"Northbound API: Refers to communication between the SDN controller and higher-layer applications or services (e.g., services and applications on the network, as mentioned in option C).\nSouthbound API: Refers to communication between the SDN controller and the lower-layer network infrastructure, such as switches and routers.","timestamp":"1721547000.0","comment_id":"1127727","upvote_count":"2"}],"poster":"kennie0","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1700722920.0"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-05-23 07:02:00","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":1146,"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Which communication interaction takes place when a southbound API is used?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/109966-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-774-discussion/","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"between the SDN controller and switches and routers on the network","C":"between the SDN controller and services and applications on the network","D":"between network applications and switches and routers on the network","A":"between the SDN controller and PCs on the network"},"answer":"B","exam_id":288,"unix_timestamp":1684818120},{"id":"DtPoHkYtrrry9ajmBlOp","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/97442-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-775-discussion/","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-01-31 13:01:00","question_images":[],"answer":"AC","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"What are two characteristics of a public cloud implementation?

A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premises, private cloud and third-party, public cloud services with orchestration between the two platforms.

As a RESTful API HTTP method, PUT is the most common way to update resource information.\n\nIt's possible to create a resource with a PUT method, but this approach carries the risk of creating resources by accident, as noted above. If PUT is applied to a collection of resources, the entire resource collection gets replaced, which usually isn't the intention.\n\nPATCH\nPATCH is another HTTP method used to update resources. As opposed to replacing resources, like the PUT method does, PATCH only modifies resource contents.

When you make a PUT request to a resource endpoint, you send the complete representation of the resource you want to update. If the resource already exists, it will be completely replaced with the new representation provided in the request. If the resource doesn't exist, it will be created.\n\n2. **PATCH**: PATCH, on the other hand, is used to partially update a resource. With PATCH, you send only the changes that need to be applied to the resource, rather than the entire representation.
