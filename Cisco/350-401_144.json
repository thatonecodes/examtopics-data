In mutable infrastructure, configuration management tools are commonly employed to automate and manage the configuration, deployment, and maintenance of the infrastructure components. These tools help ensure consistency, enforce desired configurations, and facilitate updates or changes to the infrastructure over time.\n\nFor immutable infrastructure, while the focus is on building and deploying new instances rather than modifying existing ones, orchestration tools can still play a role. In this context, orchestration tools are often used to automate the creation, deployment, and scaling of immutable infrastructure instances. These tools enable the streamlined provisioning of pre-configured and consistent instances, ensuring the rapid deployment of identical infrastructure components.\nSo, \nConfiguration Management:\n- Mutable\n- Designed to install and manage software on existing servers\n\nOrchestration:\n- Immutable\n- Designed to provision the servers","poster":"Hosein","timestamp":"1687540800.0"},{"comment_id":"1225816","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"...........................","timestamp":"1718988120.0","comment_id":"1234646"}],"timestamp":"1717714440.0","content":"given answers are incorrect\n\n\nConfiguration Management:\n- mutable infrastructure\n- designed to install and manage software on existing servers\n\nOrchestration:\n- immutable infrastructure\n- designed to provision the servers"},{"content":"Configuration Management:\n\nMutable infrastructure\nDesigned to install and manage software on existing servers\nOrchestration:\n\nImmutable infrastructure\nDesigned to provision the servers","comment_id":"1214839","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Shri_Fcb10","timestamp":"1716284280.0"},{"comment_id":"1178446","poster":"supershysherlock","upvote_count":"1","content":"Mutable infrastructure is often associated with Configuration Management tools, as these are designed to manage and apply changes to existing systems, updating their state over time.\n\nImmutable infrastructure typically aligns with Orchestration tools, which are used to provision servers and often to replace entire server instances rather than update them in place.\n\nThe characteristic \"designed to provision the servers\" suggests a focus on creating and managing the lifecycle of servers and thus also aligns with Orchestration tools.\n\nThe characteristic \"designed to install and manage software on existing servers\" indicates a function of Configuration Management tools, as they are used to maintain and manage software states on existing infrastructure.","timestamp":"1710948600.0"},{"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1681254840.0","comment_id":"867732","poster":"JackDRipper","content":"My vote.
