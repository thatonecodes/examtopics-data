Enterprise Data Center Infrastructure Overview\n\n\n\nDefining the DC Access Layer -\nThe data center access layers main purpose is to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 physical port density for various servers in the data center. In addition, data center access layer switches provide high-performance, low-latency switching and can support a mix of oversubscription requirements. Both Layer 2 and Layer 3 access\n(also called routed access) designs are available, but most data center access layers are built using Layer 2 connectivity. The Layer 2 access design uses VLAN trunks upstream, which allows data center aggregation services to be shared across the same VLAN and across multiple switches. Other advantages of Layer 2 access are support for NIC teaming and server clustering that requires network connections to be Layer 2 adjacent or on the same VLAN with one another.\nCCDA 640-864 Official Certification Guide Fourth Edition, Chapter 4","answer":"Explanation","timestamp":"2019-05-01 11:03:00","discussion":[{"content":"C and E","poster":"adamQas","timestamp":"1579438980.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"40608"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Anon0303","timestamp":"1556701380.0","comment_id":"1486","content":"Please fix the question format"}],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01522/0006200001.png"],"question_id":54,"topic":"1","exam_id":289,"question_text":"Which two statements about designing the Data Center Access layer are correct?
