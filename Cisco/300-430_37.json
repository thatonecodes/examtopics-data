Here's why:\n\nAP Authentication:\nThis feature ensures that only authorized APs are allowed to join the network. It prevents rogue APs from connecting to the network and ensures that RRM neighbor packets are only sent by trusted, authenticated APs.\n\nWhy Itâ€™s Necessary:\n\nRogue containment relies on the ability to distinguish between authorized (friendly) APs and unauthorized (rogue) APs.\n\nBy enabling AP Authentication, the network ensures that only legitimate APs participate in RRM and other network operations, preventing interference from rogue APs.","timestamp":"1739647260.0","comment_id":"1357001","poster":"rrahim"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"D"},{"id":"xEwR2Qr1pG9nYsJpETKe","question_id":182,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["AE (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"config flow add monitor Export_to_Prime_Infrastructure exporter AVC_test","B":"config flow create exporter Export_to_Prime_Infrastructure 10.20.30.6 port 9991","E":"config flow add monitor AVC_test exporter Export_to_Prime_Infrastructure","C":"config flow create exporter Export_to_Prime_Infrastructure 10.20.30.6 port 8080","A":"config flow add monitor AVC_test record ipv4_client_app_flow_record"},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: AE\nTo ensure that NetFlow data is exported from the AireOS controllers to Cisco Prime Infrastructure, the following configurations must be applied:\n\nAdd the Flow Record to the Flow Monitor:\n\nThe command config flow add monitor AVC_test record ipv4_client_app_flow_record associates the flow record (ipv4_client_app_flow_record) with the flow monitor (AVC_test).

Here's why:\n\nMulticast and Data Rates:\n\nMulticast traffic is sent at the lowest mandatory data rate configured on the WLAN. If lower data rates (e.g., 1 Mbps, 2 Mbps) are enabled, multicast traffic will be sent at these slower rates, which can lead to poor performance and unreliable reception.\n\nBy disabling lower mandatory data rates, multicast traffic is sent at higher data rates, improving reliability and performance.\n\nImpact on Coverage:\n\nDisabling lower data rates reduces the coverage area of the APs, but this trade-off is necessary to ensure reliable multicast reception. Clients must be closer to the APs to maintain a connection, but the multicast traffic will be more reliable.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1357023","timestamp":"1739649540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rrahim","content":"Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:\nOption A: Increase the coverage cell.\n\nIncreasing the coverage cell size would allow clients to connect from farther away, but it does not address the issue of reliable multicast reception.
