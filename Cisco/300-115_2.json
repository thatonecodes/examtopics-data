To restrict the traffic a trunk carries, use the \"switchport trunk allowed vlan remove vlan-list\" interface configuration command to remove specific VLANs from the allowed list.\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3550/software/release/12.1_13_ea1/configuration/guide/swvlan.html","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1575735480,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"gabtown","comment_id":"27649","content":"It is weird... cause i could say VLAN access-list is an option too due you can strictly configure which one you want to permit.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1575735480.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/9904-exam-300-115-topic-1-question-33-discussion/","answers_community":[],"exam_id":297,"question_id":6,"question_text":"Which technique allows specific VLANs to be strictly permitted by the administrator?","timestamp":"2019-12-07 17:18:00","choices":{"B":"transparent bridging","D":"VLAN access-list","E":"L2P tunneling","A":"VTP pruning","C":"trunk allowed VLANs"}},{"id":"loaaMPJFr8p4puRVxu91","answer_description":"Pruning unnecessary VLANs from the trunk can be performed with one of two methods:\n✑ Manual pruning of the unnecessary VLAN on the trunkThis is the best method, and it avoids the use of the spanning tree. Instead, the method runs the pruned VLAN on trunks.\n✑ VTP pruningAvoid this method if the goal is to reduce the number of STP instances. VTP-pruned VLANs on a trunk are still part of the spanning tree.\nTherefore, VTP-pruned VLANs do not reduce the number of spanning tree port instances.\nSince the question asked for the choice that is an enhancement to the STP design, VTP pruning is the best choice.\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk389/tk689/technologies_tech_note09186a0080890613.shtml","timestamp":"2019-06-15 17:05:00","exam_id":297,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/1803-exam-300-115-topic-1-question-38-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Modify the spanning-tree priorities to dictate the traffic flow.","C":"Use VTP pruning on the trunk interfaces.","B":"Create a Layer 3 transit VLAN to segment the traffic between the sites.","D":"Configure manual trunk pruning between the two locations."},"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1560611100,"question_text":"A network engineer is extending a LAN segment between two geographically separated data centers.
