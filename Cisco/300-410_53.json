The answer seems ok but i usually start with identifying, as then you are actually not configuring anything yet. I think i need to read better that it states \"identify....neighbor\" so you only identify information regarding your neighbor, this information is only needed after step \"create the bgp process\" anyway, this has nothing to do with real it skills.","timestamp":"1706072700.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Given Awser correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1689608820.0","poster":"inteldarvid","comment_id":"954336"},{"content":"Given Answer is correct.\nhttps://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2756480&seqNum=5","comment_id":"774303","timestamp":"1673603220.0","poster":"ellen_AA","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"DUBC89x","content":"Given answer is correct. \nSUMMARY STEPS\nenable\nconfigure terminal\nrouter bgp autonomous-system-number\nneighbor ip-address remote-as autonomous-system-number\naddress-family ipv4 [unicast | multicast | vrf vrf-name ]\nneighbor ip-address activate\nend\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/xe-16/irg-xe-16-book/configuring-a-basic-bgp-network.html","comment_id":"738507","timestamp":"1670462640.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_ET":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/90517-exam-300-410-topic-1-question-334-discussion/","question_id":262},{"id":"Y6iJ1AVMlP1qzn1EoSpa","answer":"B","question_id":263,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-08-24 20:27:00","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1692901620.0","poster":"Muste","content":"Selected Answer: B\nprobided answer is correct : One common cause of black holes in MPLS is the mismatch between the IP routing table and the label forwarding table.
