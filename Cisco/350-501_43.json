That's how multicast stub routing behaves. And now RC has no way to prune it back via normal PIM mechanisms.\n\nC: It is true that PIM-SSM would stop the flooding since multicast stub routing requires dense mode flooding to work. But SSM is not configured on an interface, it's enabled globally (and any modified SSM range ACL would also have to be configured globally, if the multicast group ranges fell outside the default SSM group range)\n\nBy process of elimination, A is all that's left. And it would work, although it's clumsy as hell. Ideally you'd just delete the IGMP helper-address altogether, you don't want to point it to the wrong router IP to stop it from forwarding traffic to RB.","comment_id":"1328687","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"17c8777","comments":[{"content":"Hmm I'm confused ...
