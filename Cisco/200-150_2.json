The original M1 series I/O modules e.g., the N7K-M132XP-12 have 80 Gbit/s of capacity into the switch fabric, and so two Fabric-1 modules providing 92 Gbit/s are required to provide sufficient fabric capacity for the M1 series 10GE I/O modules. Although the configuration with two Fabric modules actually works, it provides no redundancy for 10GE I/O modules and so Cisco mandated that a third fabric module be used such that the chassis was still able to provide sufficient fabric capacity in the event of a fabric module failure.\n\n2) If you have a failure of a Fabric module, then the switch will continue to operate, albeit with reduced capacity. If you only have M1 10GE I/O modules, and the minimum of three Fabric modules, then a failure of one will have no impact as the remaining two will provide 92 Gbit/s, with the M1 10GE I/O modules only requiring 80 Gbit/s. If on the other hand you have F1 10GE I/O modules that have 230 Gbit/s fabric capacity, then you actually need five fabric modules to provide the required capacity, and a failure of one of the fabric modules would mean the F1 10GE I/O modules would not be able to operate at their maximum capacity."},{"poster":"snapper","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"7488","timestamp":"1566224760.0","content":"Can anyone post a URL to confirm this?
