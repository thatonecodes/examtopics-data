For example, if this value is set to 1, each file will contain 1 minute of CDR data (CDRs and CMRs, if enabled). The CDR database will not receive the data in each file until the interval has expired, so consider how quickly you want access to the CDR data when you decide what interval to set in this parameter. For example, setting this parameter to 60 means that each file will contain 60 minutes worth of data, but that data will not be available until the 60-minute period has elapsed and the records are written to the CDR database.\n This is a required field.\n Default: 1\n Minimum: 1\n Maximum: 1440\n Unit: min","comment_id":"19272","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"17019","content":"That's \"D\" not \"A\", correct?","poster":"twill","timestamp":"1571856480.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"4646","poster":"MartinK","content":"Devon is right; In Enterprise parameters you can adjust time of data collection but CDR Management allows you to setup its preservation.","timestamp":"1563867240.0"},{"poster":"Devon","timestamp":"1556682960.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1484","content":"A.
