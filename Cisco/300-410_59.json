IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard:\nCorrect: IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) Guard is designed to prevent rogue or unauthorized Router Advertisements from being processed by hosts on the network. This helps to protect against DoS attacks where malicious devices might send incorrect RA messages, causing network disruption. By filtering and controlling RA messages, IPv6 RA Guard helps prevent such attacks.","poster":"tubirubs","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1268801"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1255225","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1721937360.0"},{"poster":"yeyuno","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"867752","timestamp":"1681257780.0","content":"IPv6 - Destination Guard\nThe Destination Guard feature helps in minimizing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Can be understood in so many ways. CoPP is applied(doesnt say on which interface but says for recieving traffic from WAN.
