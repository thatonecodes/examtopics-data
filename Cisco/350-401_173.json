It adds client tracking and location API.\n\nCisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) in a Cisco Wireless Unified Network architecture provides features related to location-based services. It adds client tracking and offers a location API (Application Programming Interface) that allows applications to access information about the location of wireless clients within the network. This capability enables the development of location-aware applications and services. MSE can provide information about the real-time location of wireless clients, facilitating applications such as asset tracking, location-based services, and more.","comment_id":"1127855","timestamp":"1721562840.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"teems5uk"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1086958","poster":"shefo1","timestamp":"1717427100.0","content":"from OCG p.553\n\nCisco APs and WLCs can integrate with management\nplatforms like Cisco Prime Infrastructure or DNA Center, along with location servers like\nCisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE), Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX), or\nCisco DNA Spaces to gather location information in real time and present that information\nin a relevant way."},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"kaupz","timestamp":"1714564800.0","comment_id":"1059762","content":"Selected Answer: C\nshould be C, but not so sure about API part\n\nThis solution allows a customer to track any Wi-Fi device, including clients, active RFID tags, and rogue clients and access points (APs).\nhttps://mrncciew.com/2013/04/05/mobility-service-engine-mse/"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/125098-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-814-discussion/","choices":{"C":"It adds client tracking and location API.","B":"It enables NetFlow data collection.","D":"It identifies authentication problems.","A":"It adds client packet capturing."},"unix_timestamp":1698847200,"timestamp":"2023-11-01 15:00:00","topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"wRqJgiq0jB8vXX0KOtFe","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Which unit of measure is used to measure wireless RF SNR?","topic":"1","answer":"B","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-10-29 11:08:00","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/124874-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-815-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1698574080,"exam_id":324,"question_id":863,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nA. dBi (decibels isotropic) -
