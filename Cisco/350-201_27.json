Once inside, the malware takes control of the system with the purpose of communicating back to its original sender. The information it communicates may include sensitive data, intellectual property, captured keystrokes or images from a deviceâ€™s camera, among other items.\n\nViruses, on the other hand, are usually dormant until the victim activates the attack, either through opening an infected application, downloading a corrupt file or clicking an infected link. Once activated, the virus may complete any number of tasks that it was designed to do, including deleting files, encrypting data, taking over system functions or disabling security settings.","comment_id":"836891","poster":"jay_c_an","timestamp":"1726128600.0"},{"timestamp":"1724869140.0","comment_id":"825238","upvote_count":"3","poster":"DrVoIP","content":"The question has an error in the IP address, so I resubmitted it: The cause of the issue is more likely a malware outbreak.
