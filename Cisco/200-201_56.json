NetFlow works by capturing traffic at the network layer and generating flow records, which are then exported to a collector for further analysis. NetFlow data is typically used for network traffic analysis, capacity planning, and security monitoring.\n\nTraffic mirroring, on the other hand, involves copying network traffic from a switch port and sending it to another port for analysis. This allows administrators to capture and inspect all of the data contained in the mirrored traffic, including payload content.","comment_id":"812404","timestamp":"1723923420.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. is correct \n NetFlow ==> collects metadata.\ntraffic mirroring ==> clones data.","comment_id":"686902","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712322300.0","poster":"Eng_ahmedyoussef"},{"comment_id":"477576","content":"a is correct","timestamp":"1683984300.0","poster":"halamah","upvote_count":"2"}],"choices":{"D":"NetFlow generates more data than traffic mirroring.","A":"NetFlow collects metadata and traffic mirroring clones data.","B":"Traffic mirroring impacts switch performance and NetFlow does not.","C":"Traffic mirroring costs less to operate than NetFlow."},"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"exam_id":287,"unix_timestamp":1636817100,"answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/65952-exam-200-201-topic-1-question-57-discussion/","topic":"1"},{"id":"M3sk0DfJsQrBo6VfFmwi","exam_id":287,"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2021-11-13 16:25:00","choices":{"D":"encryption","A":"SSL interception","B":"packet header size","C":"signature detection time"},"question_id":277,"unix_timestamp":1636817100,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/65953-exam-200-201-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","question_text":"What makes HTTPS traffic difficult to monitor?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1723923600.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nHTTPS traffic is difficult to monitor because it is encrypted, which makes it more difficult for network administrators and security systems to inspect the contents of the traffic. The encryption used by HTTPS, which is typically based on SSL/TLS, ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is secure and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with by third parties. However, this also means that anyone trying to monitor or inspect the traffic would need to decrypt it first in order to see its contents.","comment_id":"812409","poster":"drdecker100"},{"content":"d is correct","comment_id":"477577","timestamp":"1683984300.0","poster":"halamah","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"BDNq21MvbZGQ7zbzMOR3","unix_timestamp":1636817160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/65954-exam-200-201-topic-1-question-59-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728133680.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is Correct \nman in the middle ==> traffic exchanged between two users?","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Eng_ahmedyoussef","comment_id":"686906"},{"timestamp":"1699889160.0","poster":"halamah","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"477578","content":"b is correct"}],"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"man-in-the-middle","C":"command injection","A":"port scanning","D":"denial of service"},"isMC":true,"answer":"B","exam_id":287,"answer_description":"","question_id":278,"question_text":"How does an attacker observe network traffic exchanged between two users?","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","timestamp":"2021-11-13 16:26:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"8Lo5t4fpTHEReBKWzLIn","discussion":[{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"This is from the CIA Triad model, which stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
