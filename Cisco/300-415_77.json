Therefore, the NAT DIA route overwrites the OMP advertised default to prefer the local Internet exit, instead of taking the remote data centre Internet exit within a VPN.","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1624940520.0","poster":"Mr_Cipher"},{"poster":"Rosh8787","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728945660.0","comment_id":"1297850","content":"Option C is correct because the question asks about YouTube.
