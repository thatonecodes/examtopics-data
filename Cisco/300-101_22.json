The IPv6 header is translated into an IPv4 header.\nii. The IPv6 destination address is translated into an IPv4 address by removing the IPv6 stateful NAT64 prefix.\niii. The IPv6 source address is translated into an IPv4 address by using the configured IPv4 address pool. Depending on the NAT64 configuration, either 1:1 address translation or IPv4 address overloading is performed.\niv. Stateful NAT64 IP address translation states are created for both the source and destination IP addresses. States are created when the translation is performed for the first time; thereafter, a state is maintained until the traffic stops and the state maintenance timer expires. Subsequent IPv6 packets are translated using the NAT64 translation state created at this step.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/ios-nx-os-software/enterprise-ipv6-solution/white_paper_c11-676278.html"}],"question_id":106,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/4348-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-458-discussion/","choices":{"C":"It translates the IPv6 source address to an IPv4 header.","D":"It translates the^ IPv4 destination address into a new NAT64 state.","E":"It performs an IPv6 route lookup.","B":"It checks the IPv6 packet against the NAT64 stateful prefix.","A":"It translates the IPv6 header into an IPv4 header."},"answers_community":[]},{"id":"aSFYG2O7VXPELbrHJozR","question_text":"Which three characteristics are shared by subinterfaces and associated EVNs?

To simplify the configuration process, all the subinterfaces and associated EVNs have the same IP address assigned. In other words, the trunk interface is identified by the same IP address in different EVN contexts. This is accomplished as a result of each EVN having a unique routing and forwarding table, thereby enabling support for overlapping IP addresses across multiple EVNs.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/evn/configuration/xe-3sg/evn-overview.pdf","exam_id":296,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1579030020.0","comment_id":"39099","poster":"vagl","upvote_count":"1","content":"This is a bit strange ...
