And again in real life when you get duplex/speed mismatch you are getting bigger problem than voice/video quality, the phone may got disconnected, and you get dial tone with delay and few more signaling issue. And for such things, the issue only is not affected one user and could be reported with many users.

This is the description of the service parameter taken from a v12.5 CUCM - This parameter specifies whether Cisco Unified Communications Manager reserves bandwidth from desktop video bandwidth pool for immersive video calls. When this service parameter is set to True, Unified CM will use the value from 'Maximum Session Bit Rate for Video Calls' in the Region Configuration window. When this service parameter is set to False, Unified CM will use the value from 'Maximum Session Bit Rate for Immersive Video Calls' in the Region Configuration window for Immersive to Immersive call.\n\nTherefore, by setting it to False you are allowing CUCM to reserve bandwith from the Immersive video call bandwith pool (used for Location CAC) and therefore potentially oversubscibing your network bandwith, ie you are allowing more high bandwidth Telepresence video calls to be allowed on the network.
