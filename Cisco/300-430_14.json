It works with the existing wireless infrastructure to enable indoor navigation and wayfinding.\n\nThe MSE collects data from wireless access points and uses it to calculate the location of devices, which is essential for providing indoor directions.\n\nCisco CMX Visitor Connect:\n\nCisco CMX Visitor Connect is a component of the Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) solution that provides wayfinding and indoor navigation capabilities. It integrates with the MSE to offer turn-by-turn directions to specific locations, such as patient rooms.\n\nVisitor Connect also allows for customization of the navigation experience, making it suitable for a hospital environment.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1739829360.0","comment_id":"1357996"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Cisco MSE (Mobile Services Engine) is required to provide accurate location information for indoor directions.
