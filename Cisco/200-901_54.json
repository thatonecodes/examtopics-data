Using environment variables to store sensitive information like usernames and passwords helps keep these details out of the codebase. This reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information if the code is accessed by unauthorized individuals. Environment variables can be managed securely and are not hard-coded into the application, making it a more secure practice.
