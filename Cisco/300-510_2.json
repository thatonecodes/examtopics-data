Both B and C are equally correct and incorrect.

Segment routing must be configured with EIGRP - This is incorrect because EIGRP is typically not used for segment routing.\nB. Segment routing must be configured with ISIS - This is likely the correct choice, as ISIS is one of the IGPs that supports segment routing.\nC. MPLS must be configured - Segment routing can be implemented with or without MPLS, but traditionally, segment routing has been used with MPLS. However, the configuration of MPLS is not a prerequisite for segment routing itself; it's more about the data plane technology used to forward packets.\nD. Explicit-null must be configured for all neighbors - This is not a requirement for segment routing to function.\n\nThe best step before enabling segment routing with BGP would likely be:\n\nB. Segment routing must be configured with ISIS\n\nThis ensures that the IGP can support segment routing, which is necessary before it can be used in conjunction with BGP.","timestamp":"1720369440.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1720369980.0","content":"Segment Routing (SR) can be applied on both MPLS and IPv6 data planes\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs560/segment-routing/79x/b-segment-routing-cg-79x-ncs560/m-configure-srv6-usid-ncs5xx.html#:~:text=Segment%20Routing%20over%20IPv6%20(SRv6)%20extends%20Segment%20Routing%20support%20with,as%20a%20stack%20of%20labels.","poster":"Storcaks","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1116086"},{"comment_id":"1148923","content":"Hmm, they are not talking about SRv6 (IPV6 data plane).
