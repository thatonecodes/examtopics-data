Here's why:\n\nTunnel Source/Destination: The configuration specifies a source interface (GigabitEthernet0/1) and a destination IP address (128.17.64.8). This aligns with the characteristics of a GRE tunnel, where the source interface is the physical interface, and the destination IP address is the endpoint of the tunnel.\n\nTunnel Protection: The command tunnel protection ipsec profile DMVPN_profile indicates that IPsec is used to protect the GRE tunnel. This combination of GRE and IPsec is commonly used in scenarios where you want to provide secure communication between sites, and it's often associated with technologies like DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network).\n\nWhile GRE over IPsec is a component of DMVPN, the provided configuration doesn't explicitly configure DMVPN features. Therefore, it's accurate to describe the configured tunnel as GRE over IPsec.","comment_id":"1105696","upvote_count":"2","poster":"kylesam2017","timestamp":"1719368880.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719155520.0","comment_id":"1104142","content":"Answer is GRE over IPSEC.","poster":"Rosh8787"},{"comment_id":"912067","poster":"Anonymous983475","comments":[{"comment_id":"942222","timestamp":"1704325620.0","poster":"spambox730","upvote_count":"1","content":"Tunnel interface defaults is GRE.\nVTI needs 'tunnel mode ipsec ipv4' under the tunnel interface config.

In an mGRE configuration, you do not specify tunnel destination—you specify tunnel source and let NHRP handle mapping. Manually configuring tunnel destination is usually done for point‑to‑point GRE tunnels, not DMVPN mGRE.

Specify the tunnel destination in each tunnel:\n\nWhen multiple DMVPN tunnels terminate on the same physical interface, the router may encounter ambiguity in determining which tunnel to use unless the tunnel destinations are explicitly specified.

Assign a unique tunnel key to each tunnel:\n\nThe tunnel key is used to differentiate between multiple GRE tunnels terminating on the same interface. Assigning a unique tunnel key ensures that the router can correctly identify and separate traffic for each DMVPN cloud.
