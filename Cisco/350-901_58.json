Implement local storage at the data collection layer in case of connectivity loss to the cloud. D. Ensure that the database is replicated across multiple different cloud regions.\n\nImplementing local storage at the data collection layer can ensure that data is not lost in case of a sudden loss in connectivity. This ensures high availability and resiliency as data can be stored and then sent once connectivity is restored.\n\nAdditionally, replicating the database across multiple different cloud regions ensures that even if one region experiences an issue, the data is still available in another region. This adds an extra layer of security and ensures minimal data loss.","timestamp":"1703605380.0","comment_id":"1106147"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/129400-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-359-discussion/","answer_images":[]},{"id":"2H6YpTkmvDIyu6SKYvTv","unix_timestamp":1629634200,"timestamp":"2021-08-22 14:10:00","question_text":"Given an application that implements a basic search function as well as a video upload function, which two load-balancing approaches optimize the application's user experience?

Search requests should be routed to the endpoint with lowest round-trip latency.\nC. Video upload requests should be routed to the endpoint with lowest round-trip latency.\n\nOption A is incorrect because introducing an intermediate hop would add unnecessary latency and complexity to the video upload requests. Option D is also incorrect because the data throughput may not necessarily be the best indicator of performance for video upload requests, which may require more processing and storage resources than data transfer. Option E is incorrect because search requests typically involve smaller data transfer and lower resource requirements than video upload requests.\n\nTherefore, for a better user experience, search requests should be directed to the endpoint with the lowest round-trip latency, ensuring the fastest response times. Similarly, video upload requests should also be directed to the endpoint with the lowest round-trip latency to ensure a fast and reliable upload experience.","comment_id":"846265","timestamp":"1711048020.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Teringzooi","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB & D\nB: search is fast\nD: upload is fast","comment_id":"677075","timestamp":"1695469740.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB and D are correct\nThe video upload must be done using the highest data throughput to upload the video faster while the search must be done using the lowest latency to avoid bufferization during the video.","comment_id":"636875","poster":"designated","timestamp":"1690307160.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"QuiShong","timestamp":"1686771900.0","comment_id":"616381","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nDefinitely BD.
