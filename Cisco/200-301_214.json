Install a trusted third-party certificate on the Cisco ISE. \n\nWhen a guest portal is used, the certificate presented to the guest users must be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by the guest's browser. This is typically a public CA. If the certificate is signed by an internal CA (option A and C), the guest's browser will not trust it unless the root certificate of that internal CA is manually installed on their device, which is not practical for guest users. Installing a certificate on the contractor devices (option D) would not be practical or scalable.\n\nTherefore, to avoid certificate errors when contractors attempt to access the portal, a trusted third-party certificate should be installed on the Cisco ISE.

This ensures that when contractors connect to the guest portal, their devices recognize the certificate as valid and trusted.\n\nOption A, installing an internal CA signed certificate on the Cisco ISE, would only address certificate errors for devices within the same organization that have the internal CA's root certificate installed as a trusted root.
