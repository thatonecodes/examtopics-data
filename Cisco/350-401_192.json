The vSmart Controller works with the vBond Orchestrator to authenticate vEdge devices as they join the network and to orchestrate connectivity among the edge routers.\nvBond Orchestrator automatically orchestrates connectivity between edge routers and vSmart Controllers. If any edge router or vSmart Controller is behind a NAT, the vBond Orchestrator also serves as an initial NAT-traversal orchestrator.\nThe edge routers sit at the perimeter of a site and provide connectivity among the sites. They are either hardware devices or software (Cloud router), that runs as a virtual machine.
