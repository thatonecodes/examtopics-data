Intensity Cutoff\nC. Duty Cycle Cutoff\n\nExplanation:\nIntensity Cutoff: This parameter sets a threshold for the signal strength (RSSI) of interferers. Signals below this threshold are ignored, helping to filter out weak or irrelevant interferers.\n\nDuty Cycle Cutoff: This parameter defines the minimum duty cycle an interferer must have to be considered significant. Short-lived interferers with low duty cycles are filtered out, reducing the impact of transient interference.\n\nThese two parameters work together to ensure that only persistent and strong interferers are flagged, protecting the system from short-lived interference bursts.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"From Cisco CMX release 10.6.2, Interferers filtering is strengthened to protect Cisco CMX from burst of short lived interferers. For effective interferer filtering results, we recommend that you set the interferer filtering parameters for Duty Cycle Cutoff (Interferer) and Severity Cutoff (Interferer) correctly. For more information, see Setting Filtering Parameters. With this change, short lived interferers would not be tracked by Cisco CMX and moved under Not Tracked category in the System tab > Settings > Tracking window.","comment_id":"1122232","timestamp":"1720920120.0","poster":"Lambo1700","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/131146-exam-300-430-topic-1-question-221-discussion/","answer_ET":"BC","answers_community":["AC (50%)","AB (50%)"],"exam_id":307,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1705202520,"question_text":"An engineer is configuring location services with a Cisco CMX 10.6.2 solution.
