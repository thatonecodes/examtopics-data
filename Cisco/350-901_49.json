The main question here (and why so many of us are trying to pick between C and D) is whether rate limiting needs to be done on the client side as well.\n\nIn the type of app being described, with various microservices interacting, it would be advantageous for the client microservice to not encounter unexpected behavior/errors from the server microservice it is attempting to access. If the server microservice has implemented rate limiting (or even worse, has NOT implemented it), the client app might have to sleep for a bit, or sit with a spinner, or encounter errors. Or, in the case of a massively-scaled malicious DDoS on a publicly-facing service, even handling all of the incoming API requests and responding with a 429 to every one can consume resources (and run up charges if it's a cloud-based API service). It's easier for everybody if both sides (server and client) have rate limiting built into their interactions with each other.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"kirrim","comment_id":"1045177","timestamp":"1713287760.0"},{"poster":"kati2k22cz","comment_id":"1028271","timestamp":"1712609520.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\ni'll go with C\nRate limit in both sides (client and server)"},{"content":"Seeing this on page 11 of the DEVCOR studyguide:\nThe front end (also called the “client side”) is everything a user sees and interacts with in a browser. The most common front-end languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as various frameworks using these languages (React, Angular, and so on).\nThe back end (also called the “server side”) of a website processes and stores data and ensures everything on the client side works correctly. It is the part of the website that does not come in direct contact with users. Back-end development languages are Java, C++, Python, PHP, and so on.\nSo if client side is the front end, we would want to have some rate limiting there.\nThen the question becomes the following: should we rate limit API calls between the front end and back end?\nIn my search on the question I stumbled apun this url: https://medium.com/@jonathansychan/rate-limiting-and-throttling-for-a-more-efficient-backend-7feb1a76acc8\nSo based on all this information, I would go with answer C.","poster":"Ietsmeteennaam","timestamp":"1702238160.0","comment_id":"920225","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"910772","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI agree that the best answer is **D. Implement rate limiting on the server side**. \nRate limiting is a technique to control the number of requests that a client can make to a server in a given time period. \nIt can help reduce application response latency and protect the application from excessive use by preventing **overload**, **abuse**, or **denial-of-service attacks**. \nRate limiting can be implemented on the client side or the server side, or both. \nHowever, rate limiting on the client side is not very effective or reliable, because it depends on the client's implementation and honesty. \nA malicious or faulty client can bypass or ignore the rate limit and send too many requests to the server. Rate limiting on the server side is more secure and consistent, because it enforces the limit at the source and rejects any requests that exceed the limit.","timestamp":"1701322440.0","poster":"whipmuffin"},{"comment_id":"886744","timestamp":"1698880020.0","content":"i think it is C","poster":"Fedesarucho","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer":"D"},{"id":"PP96zFghdcKZvxMlUyvk","answer":"A","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-901/image85.png","https://img.examtopics.com/350-901/image86.png"],"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"The token that is used during authorization is incorrect.","C":"The URL in the URL variable is formatted incorrectly.","A":"The username that was provided for basic authentication is incorrect.","B":"The assert statement must check for HTTP code 401 instead of HTTP code 200."},"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"mullio99","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A.

It will download the remote content but not update your local repo's working state, leaving your current work intact. git pull is the more aggressive alternative; it will download the remote content for the active local branch and immediately execute git merge to create a merge commit for the new remote content.
