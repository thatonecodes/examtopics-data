Link-local addresses are used for communication within a single network segment or link, such as between devices on a local area network (LAN). They are not intended to be routable over the Internet and are not assigned to devices that need to communicate with devices on other networks.\n\nLink-local addresses are identified by the prefix \"FE80::/10\" and are automatically generated by the device when it is connected to a network. They are usually used in conjunction with other types of IPv6 addresses, such as global unicast addresses, which are used for communication over the Internet.\n\nIt's important to note that link-local addresses are not the same as loopback addresses, which are used for communication between a device and itself and are identified by the prefix \"::1/128\".
