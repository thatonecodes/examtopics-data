It does this by keeping track of the state of each connection, and only allowing packets that match an established connection to pass through. Stateful inspection can provide basic security against network attacks, such as denial-of-service attacks and spoofing attacks.\n\nDeep packet inspection, on the other hand, operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the network stack.
