When FCoE is enabled on the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, COS 3 is automatically configured for no-drop service (PFC setting) as well as a guarantee of 50% of the bandwidth in the case of congestion (ETS setting). It is best practice to leave the default COS value of 3 for FCoE traffic due to the agreement between vendors to support this as a “no-drop” class.The minimum guaranteed bandwidth for FCoE traffic is 50%. The FCoE can use all/free bandwidth if it is available."},{"content":"Answer C:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/operations/n5k_fcoe_ops.html","timestamp":"1565779080.0","comment_id":"6847","poster":"Silacho","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1726","upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct Answer: C\nReference:\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1p","poster":"Soportechnology","timestamp":"1557708480.0"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/1287-exam-300-160-topic-1-question-79-discussion/","question_text":"What is the default CoS value for FCoE packets on a storage VDC?","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1557708480,"choices":{"B":"2","C":"3","E":"7","D":"5","A":"1"},"question_images":[],"topic":"1","exam_id":299,"answer":"A"},{"id":"8J0O5lCrPYgNolEweHvq","question_images":[],"answer":"B","question_id":87,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2019-05-12 21:26:00","exam_id":299,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/1267-exam-300-160-topic-1-question-8-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1557689160,"question_text":"If you are connecting a Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect in its default mode to a SAN, what is the operating mode?","answers_community":[],"choices":{"B":"NPIV mode","A":"trunk","C":"switching","D":"NPV mode"},"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"poster":"Vovasiy","content":"Correct answer: D\nCorresponding to the link: The Fibre Channel switching mode determines how the fabric interconnect behaves as a switching device between the servers and storage devices. The fabric interconnect operates in either of the following Fibre Channel switching modes:\n1) End-host mode is synonymous with N Port Virtualization (NPV) mode. This mode is the default Fibre Channel Switching mode.\n2) Switch mode is the traditional Fibre Channel switching mode.
