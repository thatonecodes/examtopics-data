It is a device that combines the capabilities of MSs (map-servers) & MRs (map-resolvers). Since we can't use one without the other, I will go with 'D.' ITR finds the right RLOC by sending a map request to the MS through MR. MS delivers the map-request message to the appropriate ETR to learn its corresponding RLOC, and then the ETR @ destination sends back RLOC, for the destined host, in a \"map-reply\" response to the ITR @ source location.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AbdullahMohammad251","timestamp":"1727578440.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1226364","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"comment_id":"1234673","upvote_count":"1","content":"...........................","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1718989200.0"}],"timestamp":"1717788000.0"},{"timestamp":"1716620700.0","comment_id":"1218060","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"D is correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_lisp/configuration/15-mt/irl-15-mt-book/irl-overview.pdf","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1716361080.0","poster":"Shri_Fcb10","comment_id":"1215485"},{"comment_id":"994993","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1693476780.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAn ITR is responsible for finding EID-to-RLOC mappings for all traffic destined for LISP-capable sites.","poster":"Asombrosso"},{"timestamp":"1691844720.0","content":"another broken question, one word changes question's whole meaning.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"979373","poster":"ihateciscoreally"},{"comment_id":"961411","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1690191180.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"961415","comments":[{"content":"Publish means ; ETR \nFinding means: ITR","timestamp":"1690191360.0","poster":"Networkfate","comment_id":"961416","upvote_count":"6"},{"content":"I assume you mean the answer is ITR due to \"finding\" and the line above is just a typo.","timestamp":"1691499360.0","poster":"Lungful","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"975679"}],"content":"An ITR is responsible for finding EID-to-RLOC mappings for all traffic destined for LISP-capable sites.\nWhen the ITR receives a packet destined for an EID, it first looks for the EID in its mapping cache\nAnswer is ETR keyword\"publish\"","timestamp":"1690191300.0","poster":"Networkfate"}],"content":"An ETR connects a site to the LISP-capable part of a core network (such as the Internet), publishes\nEID-to-RLOC mappings for the site, responds to Map-Request messages, and decapsulates and delivers\nLISP-encapsulated user data to end systems at the site","poster":"Networkfate"},{"timestamp":"1679233080.0","comment_id":"843779","content":"Selected Answer: D\nResponsible means to search for RLOC and route the traffic in time.
