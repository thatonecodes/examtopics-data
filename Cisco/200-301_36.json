It centralizes the control and management of network resources, allowing for dynamic and programmable network management, traffic optimization, and the implementation of network policies. This separation of the control plane from the data plane (which is responsible for actually forwarding packets) is a key concept in SDN and enables greater flexibility and agility in network management.","timestamp":"1714567200.0","comment_id":"1059809","comments":[{"content":"I have used Chat GPT, Google Geminai, and MS Copilot while trying to figure out the correct answers, but most of the time they are not accurate, Don't completely rely on them, referring to the discussions or Cisco website is the best option.","poster":"Sid_sra","comment_id":"1166192","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725499920.0"}],"poster":"picho707"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"correct answer","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1713802020.0","comment_id":"1050839"}],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which plane is centralized in software-defined networking?","timestamp":"2023-10-22 18:07:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/124354-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1156-discussion/","exam_id":288,"answer":"D","question_id":176,"unix_timestamp":1697990820,"choices":{"D":"control","C":"data","A":"application","B":"services"},"answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"AKdZ6u4qog58VqS8CPqd","question_id":177,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"It provides Layer 3 routing between wired and wireless devices.","B":"It manages interference in a dense network.","A":"It mitigates threats from the internet.","D":"It issues IP addresses to wired devices."},"answers_community":["B (74%)","A (26%)"],"unix_timestamp":1702189080,"answer":"B","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA> Firewall\nB>Correct\nC>Since when WLC does Layer 3 routing?
