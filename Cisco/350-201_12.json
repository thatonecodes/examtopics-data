Implement a new workflow for SOAR to fetch a report of assets that are outside of the PKI zone, sort assets by certification management leads, and automate alerts that updates are needed.\nThis action involves implementing a new workflow within the SOAR platform that fetches a report of assets that are outside of the PKI zone, and then sorts these assets by certification management leads. The workflow then automates alerts that updates are needed, which can help to streamline the certificate management process and improve the efficiency of the workflow.\n\nthe other answers are all possible options to improve the certificate management process, but they do not address the specific challenge of managing problematic certificates outside of the PKI management. - ChatGPT","upvote_count":"1","poster":"DrVoIP"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Medjai89","content":"Its D\n\nhttps://www.studocu.com/row/document/arab-academy-for-science-technology-maritime-transport/marketing/top-security-orchestration-use-cases/35519516","comment_id":"747206","timestamp":"1718536500.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711438680.0","comment_id":"679437","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWell, hard question.
