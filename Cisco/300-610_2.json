There is no such thing as a \"vNIC policy\" per se. Scrub policy is what happens to the local disks upon disassociation, wipes the disks or not. it doesn't enforce the disassociation. Server Pools do, per se, but that isn't an option here. The only thing even RELATED to disassociation is scrub policy, so....idk. this is dumb question, but i would also have to say A and E...i guess. If they are talking about a vNIC \"policy\" (creating a vNIC) there are no options to enforce disassociation of any sorts. DUMB. Just wondering if there is something missing in the wording with this question of this will be the question verbatim.","comment_id":"1338845"},{"timestamp":"1732431660.0","comment_id":"1316947","poster":"lurker8000","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nI will go with B & E on this one","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"I'll go with B and E","comment_id":"1315011","timestamp":"1732068300.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"lurker8000"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1063056","timestamp":"1699198260.0","poster":"Rick099","content":"Selected Answer: AE\n- vNIC Template This policy defines how a vNIC on a server connects to the LAN.
