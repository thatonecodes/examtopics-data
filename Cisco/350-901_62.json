This ensures that the client always receives the most up-to-date data while still benefiting from caching to improve performance.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the term no-cache might be a bit misleading as it does not prevent caching; it only requires revalidation of the cache.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"1a63556","timestamp":"1719410460.0"},{"comment_id":"1203676","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. no-cache.\n\nSetting the Cache-Control header to \"no-cache\" will instruct caches, including the client's cache, to revalidate the cached response with the origin server before serving it to subsequent requests.

Query the Cisco DNA Center using a REST GET API with the returned taskId.\n\nWhen an asynchronous API operation is called in Cisco DNA Center, a taskId is typically returned in the response. This taskId can be used to poll the status of the operation by sending a REST GET request to the Cisco DNA Center. The response of this GET request will contain the status of the task and hence can be used to determine whether the policy activation has succeeded or failed.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1106177"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\n/dna/intent/api/v1/task/{taskId}","poster":"plagueinside","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1090079","timestamp":"1717742460.0"}]},{"id":"0a0SY3vlxNoNbfCrx0wf","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727375580.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nonly B makes sense","poster":"Amycert","comment_id":"1289645"},{"poster":"1a63556","comment_id":"1106183","timestamp":"1703606700.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Implement surrogate key tagging to purge requests.\n\nSurrogate key tagging can significantly improve cache performance. It involves associating each cache item with a surrogate key. When an item is updated, instead of invalidating each cache item individually, you can invalidate all cache items associated with the surrogate key in one action, which is much more efficient. This approach is particularly useful when the same data is cached in multiple ways or when data is nested or complex."}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","exam_id":329,"question_text":"A developer deployed a web application in a local data center that is experiencing high traffic load from users that access data through REST API calls.

Non-persistent cookie\n\nA non-persistent cookie is a more secure method for storing session IDs because these cookies are stored only in temporary memory, and they are deleted when the user closes the browser. They do not record any information on the user's hard drive and therefore cannot be used to gather data about the user or to deliver viruses or other harmful payloads. In addition, they are more resilient to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks because they do not persist across sessions. This makes them a suitable choice for storing sensitive data such as session IDs in a secure manner.","timestamp":"1719410760.0","poster":"1a63556","comment_id":"1106185","upvote_count":"5"}],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-12-26 17:06:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/129405-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-377-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1703606760,"topic":"1","question_text":"An engineer is developing an application to use across organizations.

Run microservices at the edge, on the periphery of the network.\n\nRunning microservices at the edge of the network, also known as edge computing, reduces latency by bringing data processing closer to the source of the data. This shortens the distance that data has to travel, resulting in faster response times. This is particularly beneficial for applications that require real-time or near real-time processing. Edge computing also can reduce traffic in the network core by processing data locally, rather than sending it back and forth across the network.","timestamp":"1719410880.0","poster":"1a63556"}],"unix_timestamp":1703606880,"choices":{"D":"Minimize HTTP header metadata on the request.","C":"Build the microservices to use a stateful design.","B":"Merge microservices that communicate frequently with each other into a single microservice.","A":"Run microservices at the edge, on the periphery of the network."},"answer_description":"","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"name":"350-901","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":383,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Cisco","id":329},"currentPage":62},"__N_SSP":true}
