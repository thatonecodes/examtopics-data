All of these modes internally use the hardware compression engine in the module. Auto mode is enabled by default. Mode2 uses a larger batch size for compression than Auto-mode, which results in higher compression throughput. However, Mode2 incurs a small latency due to the compression throughput. For those deployments where aggressive throughput is most important, Mode2 can be used. Mode1 gives the best compression ratio when compared to all other modes. For those deployments where compression ratio is most important, Mode1 can be used.","upvote_count":"8","poster":"MaxG","comment_id":"446124"},{"poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","timestamp":"1727298000.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the one!","comment_id":"679224"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Compression is performed by using hardware.","A":"The switch attempts to make two TCP connections.","C":"Compression is performed by using software.","D":"Mode2 is enabled by default."}},{"id":"FvAiTdiUmNNQwKbiJfsm","unix_timestamp":1631815080,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"679225","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the one","poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727298300.0"},{"comment_id":"446129","poster":"MaxG","timestamp":"1694887080.0","content":"B.\nThe default priority value is 128.
