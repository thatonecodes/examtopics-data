In IKEv1 (Internet Key Exchange version 1) VPNs, the IPsec proposal defines the combination of encryption, integrity, and authentication algorithms that will be used to protect the data traffic.\n\nIn the context of IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange version 2), the concept of proposals still exists, but it is often more flexible and simplified compared to IKEv1. IKEv2 introduces the concept of a \"transform set\" that includes multiple proposals, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation of cryptographic algorithms during the IKEv2 exchange.\n\nSo, if you are dealing with a VPN technology that specifically requires the use of the IPsec-proposal configuration option, it is more likely associated with IKEv1-based VPNs.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1104982","poster":"kylesam2017","timestamp":"1719278520.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"gondohwe","comment_id":"1069509","timestamp":"1715611260.0","content":"correct answer is C"},{"comment_id":"930629","poster":"Toni_Su91","content":"Selected Answer: C\nConfigure an IKEv2 proposal set that specifies the IPsec IKEv2 protocol, encryption, and integrity algorithms to be used.\n\nesp specifies the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) IPsec protocol (currently the only supported protocol for IPsec).\n\ncrypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal","timestamp":"1703260380.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1692663420.0","comment_id":"817387","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Net4dd","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct. The IPsec-proposal configuration option is used to specify the encryption, integrity, and authentication algorithms that will be used in the IPsec protocol. In the case of IKEv2-based VPN, this option is used to configure the IPsec security associations (SA) that will be established between the VPN client and the VPN gateway during IKEv2 negotiation. IKEv2 uses IPsec as its underlying encryption and authentication protocol, so the IPsec-proposal configuration is essential to establishing a secure VPN tunnel using IKEv2"},{"poster":"Tiptonlad","timestamp":"1690141260.0","comment_id":"785868","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC in the answer","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1689755280.0","poster":"mazinhoo","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa96/configuration/vpn/asa-96-vpn-config/vpn-remote-access.html","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"781014"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/95978-exam-300-730-topic-1-question-136-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"C":"IKEv2-based VPN","D":"IKEv1-based VPN","B":"SSLVPN Full Tunnel","A":"clientless SSLVPN"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","exam_id":317,"question_text":"Which remote access VPN technology requires the use of the IPsec-proposal configuration option?","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_id":41,"timestamp":"2023-01-19 11:28:00","answer":"C"},{"id":"siMINr8950U7zD8cucqi","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1114267","content":"\"A\" is the correct answer here.","timestamp":"1720147500.0","poster":"kylesam2017"},{"timestamp":"1704824820.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"947423","poster":"Khs01","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct"},{"poster":"Toni_Su91","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCheck compatibility matrix.
