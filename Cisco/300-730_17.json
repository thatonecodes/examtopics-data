RADIUS is a widely used authentication protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for remote access. It supports a variety of authentication methods, including the ability to enforce complex password policies and password expiration warnings. Additionally, RADIUS allows users to change their passwords during a remote access session, providing flexibility and convenience. On the other hand, LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS) is a secure version of the LDAP protocol used for directory services. While LDAPS can provide secure authentication, it does not inherently include the ability to enforce complex passwords, password expiration warnings, or support password changes during a remote access session. Therefore, to meet the specified security requirements, the authentication protocol that must be used is RADIUS.","timestamp":"1718853180.0","poster":"kylesam2017","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Acnaris","comment_id":"1013028","timestamp":"1711027920.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa97/configuration/vpn/asa-97-vpn-config/vpn-groups.html"},{"comment_id":"974354","upvote_count":"1","poster":"lyubo01","timestamp":"1707282240.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIMO, this one should be A.

The problem that might prevent IKEv2 users from automatically downloading a new AnyConnect release when they connect to the Cisco ASA is that client software updates are not supported with IKEv2. Client software updates are a feature that allows the Cisco ASA to push new AnyConnect software releases to the connected clients automatically. However, this feature is only supported for SSL VPN connections and not for IKEv2 VPN connections. As per the given scenario, where IKEv2 is being used for one group of users and SSL for another group, the IKEv2 users will not have the capability to automatically download a new AnyConnect release when they connect. This is because client software updates are specifically designed for SSL VPN connections and are not supported with IKEv2. Therefore, the problem lies in the fact that client software updates are not supported with IKEv2, rather than the client services not being enabled.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1112479","timestamp":"1719972300.0"},{"content":"answer is D","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1068239","timestamp":"1715466060.0","poster":"jayzo"},{"comment_id":"1057351","poster":"JKPippers","content":"Answer correct is A\nAnswer A suggests that the XML profile may not be configured correctly for the affected users. The XML profile is a configuration file that can be used to customize the behavior of the AnyConnect client.
