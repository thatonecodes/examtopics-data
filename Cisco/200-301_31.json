This command is configured on the interface that is in the same subnet as the DHCP clients.\n\nIn this case, configuring `ip helper-address 172.16.2.2` under interface Gi0/0 will allow the router to forward DHCP requests from the PC to the DHCP server at the specified IP address (172.16.2.2). This is a common practice when DHCP servers are located on a different subnet than the DHCP clients.","upvote_count":"6","poster":"16BitRun","comment_id":"1110235"},{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728333480.0","comment_id":"1191190","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct"},{"timestamp":"1727567520.0","poster":"lmmujsi","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1185147","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
