By configuring posture assessment on Cisco ISE, it can check if an endpoint meets the required security standards. If a policy change is made and the endpoint no longer complies, Cisco ISE can trigger a re-authentication or session adjustment to enforce the new policy.\n\nCoA (Change of Authorization): CoA is a mechanism that allows Cisco ISE to dynamically adjust the attributes or parameters of a session after authentication. When a policy change is made on Cisco ISE, it can send a CoA request to the Cisco TrustSec devices (such as switches) to force a session to be adjusted based on the new policy. This ensures that the updated policy is immediately enforced on the network.","poster":"ahdanz32","comment_id":"922646","timestamp":"1686704640.0"},{"comment_id":"890549","poster":"Odorka222","content":"Selected Answer: DE\n\"In the next step, create a RADIUS server group and add previously configured RADIUS servers to the group for easier configuration management.
