And if you ready the question carefully, there is a \",\" after \"original,\", which means, from two original NTP servers, only single NTP server needs to be delete. So you can delete a single NTP server from the two listed NTP servers. However, even if there is only one server, you can’t enable authentication for the new NTP server, you need first add it, then enable it with command “utils ntp auth symmetric-key enable” which you get prompt to select for enable the authentication for the listed servers:\n\nadmin:utils ntp auth symmetric-key enable \n\nAt the end, nothing in the question mentioned about NTP authentication, as you can see authentication report with the following command:\n\nadmin:utils ntp auth symmetric-key status","upvote_count":"9","timestamp":"1659269460.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1678932840.0","content":"Agreed with you","comment_id":"840503","poster":"MeowthL"}],"comment_id":"640101","poster":"Piji"},{"poster":"G0y0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1364607","timestamp":"1741038540.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA. is incorrect.
