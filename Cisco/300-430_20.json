Disable the ACL that prevents traffic from being allowed.\n\nExplanation:\nFrom the provided logs, the following key information is observed:\n\nThe client is in the RUN state, which means it has successfully authenticated and associated with the network.\n\nThe AVP[07] Cisco Url-Redirect-ACL is set to BLACKHOLE, which indicates that an ACL is applied to the client, blocking all traffic.\n\nThe BLACKHOLE ACL is likely preventing the client from passing any traffic after authentication. To resolve this issue, the ACL must be disabled or modified to allow traffic.\n\nWhy This Action?\nThe BLACKHOLE ACL is explicitly designed to drop all traffic, which explains why the client cannot pass any traffic despite being in the RUN state.\n\nDisabling or modifying the ACL will allow traffic to flow normally.","timestamp":"1739931720.0","comment_id":"1358551","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"raphim","comment_id":"1046885","comments":[{"poster":"Seba_o_s","content":"No, when user are \"authenticated\" the ACL redirect have impact, in fact the user is authenticated when apply the ACL redirect","comment_id":"1060197","timestamp":"1730513760.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1729252920.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMust be A\n\"url-redirect-acl\" only apply as a preauthentication ACL for clients during authentication process.
