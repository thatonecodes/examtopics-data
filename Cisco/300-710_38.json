The correct answer depends on whether the question is based on the FMC configuration Guide, or the FMC GUI user interface. \n\nIf this question comes from the FMC configuration Guide, the answer could very well be D - IPS-only mode. According to the first sentence of the \"INTERFACE MODES AND TYPES\" section of The FMC configuration manual: \n \"You can deploy FTD interfaces in two modes: Regular firewall mode and IPS-only mode.\" TAP mode would be an Advanced setting on an interface in IPS-only mode.\n\nIf this question is based on the FMC GUI, then there are three modes available. Two mode choices on Firewall mode interfaces. Default is mode:none, but mode can be set to passive mode, or ERSPAN mode. There is one mode on an inline pair interface, \"Tap mode\" found in the advanced options.\n\nAnd to muddy the waters even more, ERSPAN could also be the correct answer because ERSPAN traffic is passive copies of traffic that doesnt go through the device, but the original traffic still has to go out somewhere, and that somewhere is probably through that ftd's firewall mode interfaces. \n\nI'm undecided between IPS-only mode, and TAP mode.","upvote_count":"6","poster":"trickbot","comment_id":"550958","timestamp":"1645279740.0"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1353117","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1738956480.0","content":"IPS is a deployment type and NOT an interface mode","poster":"Silexis"}],"poster":"14a1949","comment_id":"1337435","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736224860.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFor Cisco FTD software, the correct interface mode to passively receive traffic is IPS-only mode (option D).
