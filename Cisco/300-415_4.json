Data traffic travels over the IPsec connections between vEdge routers, shown in purple in the adjacent figure.\nControl policy, which is similar to standard routing policy, operates on routes and routing information in the control plane of the overlay network. Centralized control policy, which is provisioned on the vSmart controller, is the Viptela technique for customizing network-wide routing decisions that determine or influence routing paths through the overlay network. Local control policy, which is provisioned on a vEdge router, allows customization of routing decisions made by BGP and OSPF on site-local branch or enterprise networks.","timestamp":"1692456660.0","poster":"she_ccie","comment_id":"551126","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"535416","upvote_count":"2","content":"A is correct","poster":"juniper","timestamp":"1690622580.0"},{"timestamp":"1685367660.0","poster":"stepstranger","comment_id":"490013","content":"CONFIGURATION | POLICIES\nLocalized Policy> Access Control Lists Policy> Add IPV4 ACL Policy","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1685128680.0","comment_id":"487643","upvote_count":"1","content":"Clearly this answer is A","poster":"mullo"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"CesarVergaraGalindo","content":"A is correct","comment_id":"450513","timestamp":"1679611080.0"},{"content":"Sounds like A to me as well mentioning the single specific device.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"serieus","comment_id":"413035","timestamp":"1674553260.0"},{"timestamp":"1671657480.0","comment_id":"387373","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Maurel","content":"agree with you , correct answer should be A"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1620808920,"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":304,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/52514-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-112-discussion/","question_id":16,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An administrator must configure an ACL for traffic coming in from the service-side VPN on a specific WAN Edge device with circuit ID 123456789.
