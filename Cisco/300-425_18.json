This is text from Cisco certification guide: If location-based services are required, your design goal should be to provide good RF coverage and an effective AP layout. APs should be positioned such that multiple APs can receive a signal from a device to be located. A minimum of three APs should be able to receive a client’s signal, while four or more APs are preferred. You should think of every possible client location having at least one AP in each surrounding quadrant.\n\nTo derive a fairly accurate location, multiple APs must receive the client device or tag at an RSSI above a minimum signal level of –75 dBm.
