The peer routers are aware of a failure and so will give the switching over router a \"grace\" period to re-establish the neighbor relationship, while continuing to forward to the routes from that peer.\nWhen NSR is used, peer networking devices have no knowledge of any event on the switching over router. All information needed to continue the routing protocol peering state is transferred to the standby processor so it can \"pick up\" immediately upon a switchover.
