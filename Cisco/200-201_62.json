Of course that a private key and a digital certificate in the end have a suite of ciphers but you need a digital certificate for this, to have a match and not the cipher suite used for that certificate because if you are going on this logic path, ANY certificate issued with the same cypher will work, which is very wrong...........","poster":"Silexis","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1133677"}],"poster":"Faio","timestamp":"1706303520.0","comment_id":"964131","upvote_count":"5","content":"The answer is B. c\nA cipher suite is a set of cryptographic algorithms that are used to secure network communications.

The process of decrypting traffic involves using a decryption key, which is not related to digital certificates. Therefore, digital certificates are not the appropriate technology to use to accomplish the task of detecting command and control communications by decrypting ingress and egress perimeter traffic.\n\nThe best answer is B, cipher suite.
