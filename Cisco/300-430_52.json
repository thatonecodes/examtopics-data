Disable DHCP proxy on the Cisco WLC and run the ip helper-address command under the VLAN interface to point to DHCP and the two ISE servers.\n\nThe issue arises because the DHCP proxy feature on the Cisco WLC is intercepting DHCP requests, preventing them from reaching the ISE servers for profiling. To resolve this, the DHCP proxy must be disabled on the WLC, and the ip helper-address command must be configured on the VLAN interface to forward DHCP requests to both the DHCP server and the ISE servers.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1304001","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct.","timestamp":"1730125080.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Le91"},{"timestamp":"1727998800.0","comment_id":"1292969","content":"Selected Answer: C\nc","poster":"Ocsicccnp","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1718045100.0","poster":"obifunk","comment_id":"1228050","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct.\nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/security-knowledge-base/ise-profiling-design-guide/ta-p/3739456"},{"timestamp":"1673400480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Hhj1","content":"May be C\nLayer 3 ,not same subnet ,may be use ip helper address is better....\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/4400-series-wireless-lan-controllers/110865-dhcp-wlc.html","comment_id":"771943"},{"timestamp":"1672742460.0","comment_id":"764444","poster":"Aaron_0801","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer should be A\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/4400-series-wireless-lan-controllers/110865-dhcp-wlc.html#anc0"},{"timestamp":"1634913060.0","comment_id":"466203","poster":"kthekillerc","content":"Provided answer is correct","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"id":"vFu2o98Bi46DIoNAJrzC","question_id":258,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1622670420,"choices":{"D":"dual SSID","B":"single SSID","A":"triple SSID","C":"open SSID"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An engineer must implement a BYOD policy with these requirements:\n✑ Onboarding unknown machines\n✑ Easily scalable\n✑ Low overhead on the wireless network\nWhich method satisfies these requirements?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA Single SSID BYOD solution is the best method to meet the given requirements:\n\nOnboarding Unknown Machines:\n\nWith a single SSID, all devices connect to the same SSID, and unknown devices are redirected to a captive portal for onboarding.\nUsers are guided through the onboarding process to install certificates or perform necessary authentication steps.\nEasily Scalable:\n\nSince there's only one SSID, network management is simplified.\nUnlike dual SSID or triple SSID approaches, there's no need to manage multiple SSIDs for different device states.\nLow Overhead on the Wireless Network:\n\nFewer SSIDs = less overhead on the wireless network.\nEach additional SSID increases management traffic, beacons, and channel contention.\nA single SSID approach minimizes unnecessary wireless overhead.","comment_id":"1360167","timestamp":"1740239640.0","poster":"rrahim"},{"timestamp":"1731692580.0","content":"Provided answer is correct","comment_id":"478878","upvote_count":"2","poster":"kthekillerc"},{"timestamp":"1717364820.0","content":"B is correct, see:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Borderless_Networks/Unified_Access/BYOD_Design_Guide/BYOD_Wireless.html","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"373071","poster":"cskshiet"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2021-06-02 23:47:00","answer_description":"","exam_id":307,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/54322-exam-300-430-topic-1-question-77-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","answer":"B"},{"id":"VXYeE4rlKfhu88LxXYpU","timestamp":"2021-10-22 16:44:00","choices":{"C":"Configure the WLAN to broadcast on 5 GHz radios only and allow Jabber users to connect.","A":"Configure QoS on the mobile devices that have Jabber installed.","B":"Enable Cisco Centralized Key Management on the WLAN so that the Jabber-enabled devices will connect.","D":"Configure an AVC profile for the Jabber traffic and apply it to the WLAN."},"question_id":259,"answer":"D","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":307,"unix_timestamp":1634913840,"question_text":"A company has a single WLAN configured for 802.1x authentication with the QoS set to Silver.
