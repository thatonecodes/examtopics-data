They must be completely independent for fault isolation. So VSANs are routed. Since RPO is 3 hours and RTO is 24 hours, 3 hours is enough for async replication to complete (we don't have data volume, but the point here is that it's in hours, not in minutes/seconds). And RTO - time to recover - 24 hours is also large enough to recover using data from another datacenter."},{"poster":"Rim007","comment_id":"1022694","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712014860.0","content":"Changing my answer to CE\nC.
