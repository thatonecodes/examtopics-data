But for me (9+ years UCS admin) I am going to say FC Storage Port and Storage connectivity policy. \n\nThere is a default VSAN 1 that can be utilized, given you don't have other arrays or FC Uplinks using VSAN 1, otherwise you would have to create a new VSAN and correlate to the desired array so the vHBAs can pin to the correct uplink. Not necessarily a 'must' \n\nYou definitely MUST configure a Storage FC interface for Directly attach array and must zone the array for them to communicate with the storage connectivity policy. \n\nYou never know whoever wrote this what they read in a document and what answer they are looking for and how expert they are in EVERY technology on this exam. They may have deep level on some, but surely only going to have surface depth on others. Annoying these questions and answers are, especially when some are very subjective.","poster":"CoAsT_x","comment_id":"1212015","timestamp":"1731693000.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nConfigure Direct Attached Storage\nThe general process to configure DAS in UCS is:\n1. Configure FI in FC switch mode.\n2. Create required virtual SAN (VSAN). <<<< \n3. Set the port role in UCS.\n4. Check if the storage port worldwide port name (WWPN) is logged in to the fabric.\nand then\nConfigure FC Zoning\nThe general process to configure the server is:\n1. Create storage connection policy. <<<\n2. Create a service profile.\n3. Associate the service profile with the server.\n\nFrom my understanding you need to do all 7 steps (4+3) for DAS implementation hence I'm voting for D & E"},{"timestamp":"1736095860.0","poster":"bizzar7774","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nI agree with CoAsT_x ... so I pick B and D","comment_id":"1336816","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1198004","poster":"elper","timestamp":"1729266120.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nAs per already provided documentation.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: DE\ncorrect DE i was wrong","upvote_count":"1","poster":"asd248402","comment_id":"1194331","timestamp":"1728736440.0"},{"poster":"asd248402","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nas per the doc:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/servers-unified-computing/ucs-infrastructure-ucs-manager-software/116082-config-ucs-das-00.html","timestamp":"1727612400.0","comment_id":"1185473"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BE\nAnswer B,E\nC,D are for zoning.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/servers-unified-computing/ucs-infrastructure-ucs-manager-software/116082-config-ucs-das-00.pdf","timestamp":"1719644700.0","poster":"Clem7894","comment_id":"1108512","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1714505340.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1058293","poster":"shesho07cr","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nBE is correct"},{"timestamp":"1697629740.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"warCZert","comment_id":"873550","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nSeems to be correct based on Cisco docs."}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1681818540,"answer_ET":"BE","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-18 13:49:00","question_text":"Which two actions must be taken to directly connect a Fibre Channel storage array to a Cisco UCS domain?
