As CUBE is an active participant of the call, this mode is recommended when connected outside an enterprise (untrusted endpoints). \nMedia Flow-Around \nMedia Flow-Around is a media path mode where signaling packets terminate and originate on CUBE. As media bypasses CUBE and flows directly between endpoints, this mode is recommended when connected within an enterprise (trusted endpoints). Media Flow-Around is supported for both audio and video calls.","poster":"mcbesy","comment_id":"1534690","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Panda_man","timestamp":"1721494560.0","comment_id":"782672","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D are correct"}],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-01-20 19:56:00","exam_id":328,"question_id":391},{"id":"srkMvofNnYZD8pyhoExX","question_text":"A network engineer must convert an inbound number 12345551111 when it reaches Cisco UCM and then converts it to an internal extension 3022, so it can ring to a specific desk.
