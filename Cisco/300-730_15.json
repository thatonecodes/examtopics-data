This command tells the FlexVPN spoke to obtain its IP address dynamically through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) from the hub.

It supports dynamic creation of direct tunnels between sites, fully encrypts packet header and payload using IPsec, and allows for the propagation of routing information over the VPN tunnels.\n\nFlexVPN, while a versatile VPN solution, is not specifically tailored for the dynamic creation of multipoint VPNs like DMVPN. DMVPN is well-suited for scenarios where you have a large number of sites that need to communicate with each other directly.\n\nTherefore, the recommended solution for the specified requirements is DMVPN.","poster":"kylesam2017"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712809440.0","poster":"JKPippers","comment_id":"1040194","content":"In my opinion the best answer is B because the question require a \"direct communications between all site\" and it is possible to use IPSEC as explained in the link below:\nhttps://networklessons.com/cisco/ccie-routing-switching/dmvpn-over-ipsec#IPsec"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA.
