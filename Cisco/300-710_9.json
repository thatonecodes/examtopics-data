Each bridge group includes a Bridge Virtual Interface (BVI) to which you assign an IP address on the network. You can have multiple bridge groups for multiple networks. In transparent mode, these bridge groups cannot communicate with each other.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/650/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v65/transparent_or_routed_firewall_mode_for_firepower_threat_defense.html"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nActually, BVI can run in both routed and transparent. In this situation I think it is transparent. Here is what AI has to say about it:\n\nOn the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) device, you can use a Bridge Virtual Interface (BVI) in both transparent and routed firewall modes. In transparent mode, Layer 2 connectivity is achieved by using a \"bridge group\" where you group together the inside and outside interfaces for a network, and the FTD device uses bridging techniques to pass traffic between the interfaces. Each bridge group includes a BVI to which you assign an IP address on the network¹. In routed mode, the FTD device routes between BVIs and regular routed interfaces. If you do not need clustering or EtherChannel member interfaces, you might consider using routed mode instead of transparent mode².

All interfaces are on the same network. The bridge group is represented by a Bridge Virtual Interface (BVI) that has an IP address on the bridge network.\n\nYou can route between routed interfaces and BVIs, if you name the BVI. In this case, the BVI acts as the gateway between member interfaces and routed interfaces. If you do not name the BVI, traffic on the bridge group member interfaces cannot leave the bridge group. Normally, you would name the interface so that you can route member interfaces to the internet.\n\nOne use for a bridge group in routed mode is to use extra interfaces on the FTD device instead of an external switch. You can attach endpoints directly to bridge group member interfaces. You can also attach switches to add more endpoints to the same network as the BVI.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"979922","poster":"aaInman"},{"poster":"SegaMasterSystemAdmin","comment_id":"918478","content":"Selected Answer: D\nTo me routed is the right answer because each interface is on a different VLAN, if you have a regular bump in the wire configuration like transparent mode you won't be able to route traffic to each other, so you will need to have a bridge group in routed mode.","timestamp":"1686242160.0","comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"yeah. technically possible. but not recommended. what if I change the question like that \"Each interface is connected to a same VLAN on the same switch) - this is definietely transparent. but Q is asking a different vlan (usually different subnets), so my choice is D\n\nLayer 2 Segmentation: VLANs provide layer 2 segmentation, meaning they separate broadcast domains. Each VLAN operates as if it were a separate physical network.
