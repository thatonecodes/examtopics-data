Not all of these devices support 802.1x supplicant and need an alternate mechanism to connect to the internet. One of the security mechanisms, WPA-PSK could be considered as an alternative. With the current configuration, the pre-shared-key is the same for all clients that connect to the same WLAN. In certain deployments such as Educational Institutions, this results in the key being shared to unauthorized users resulting in security breach. Therefore, above mentioned and other requirements lead to the need for provisioning unique pre-shared keys for different clients on a large scale.\n\n Identity PSKs are unique pre-shared keys created for individuals or groups of users on the same SSID.\n\n No complex configuration required for clients. The same simplicity of PSK, making it ideal for IoT, BYOD, and guest deployments.\n\n Supported on most devices, where 802.1X may not, enabling stronger security for IoT.\n\n Easily revoke access, for a single device or individual, without affecting everyone else.\n\n Thousands of keys can easily be managed and distributed via the AAA server.","poster":"SergeBesse","comment_id":"678408","timestamp":"1679725620.0","upvote_count":"17"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1215863","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1732303200.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct"},{"comment_id":"950947","content":"Selected Answer: C\nthe answer is correct.","timestamp":"1705181040.0","poster":"Rcont","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_id":392,"answer":"C","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":324,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"A customer wants to use a single SSID to authenticate IoT devices using different passwords.
