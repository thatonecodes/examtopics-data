This means that profiling always happens after connecting the device (whether we do dot1x or MAB) and if Device Sensor (and then ISE) can't detect enough profiling data from DHCP and RADIUS Accounting, additional network access won't change the profiling situation. \nTo get more profiling data from endpoint communication, another ISE probes would have to be deployed (for ex.
