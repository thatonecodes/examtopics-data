Using NAT to hide the overlapping subnets does not make sense and defeats the purpose. A few are caught up in the idea that the PE side should be configured with 802.1Q, but they must be looking at the configuration guide for the PE only. You are perfectly fine with configuring 802.1Q on the CE side, and it is required to use multiple VLANs.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743505860.0","comment_id":"1417204"},{"timestamp":"1725784140.0","comment_id":"1280274","poster":"Swiz005","comments":[{"comment_id":"1417147","upvote_count":"1","content":"No one said anything about duplicate IPs.

VPLS is a Layer 2 VPN technology that extends the LAN segment across multiple sites, including the headquarters and remote locations. In such a scenario, the service provider plays a crucial role in ensuring that traffic is appropriately routed between the sites.\n\nRoute exchange with the service provider allows the service provider's network to understand the reachability of each site's IP subnets. This enables proper routing of traffic within the VPLS network, despite the overlapping IP subnets at different locations.","comment_id":"1044596","poster":"Abdulmw","timestamp":"1697422140.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1695945960.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1020306","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCisco config guide states 802.1q should be configured on the PE side, not CE..

VPLS (Virtual Private LAN Service) is a Layer 2 VPN technology that allows multiple sites to appear as if they are connected to the same LAN segment, but each site must use a unique IP subnet. Address translation is used to map the overlapping IP subnets to unique subnets, allowing them to be transmitted across the VPLS network without conflicts.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1680922860.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTherefore LAn users would be on a different subnet behind CE and would still ned to NAT to ISP subnet...
