D would be necessary only if the WoL server is handling DHCP services, as this would allow the DHCP server (or WoL server) to reach client subnets. However, for standard WoL implementations where the broadcast needs to be forwarded to clients, A and E are essential.\n • A ensures that IP directed broadcasts can reach client subnets, which is needed for sending WoL packets across networks.\n • E is crucial for directing the traffic correctly if there’s a helper address needed on the interface where the clients are located.\n\nYour understanding aligns well with practical deployment scenarios.","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1201744","poster":"26d13e9","timestamp":"1714019340.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nD would be correct only if the WOL server is the DHCP server.
