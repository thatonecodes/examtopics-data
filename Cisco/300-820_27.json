If Expressway-E meets these criteria, then you will probably encounter this issue:\n\nUses a single NIC.\nAdvanced Networking Option Key is installed.\nThe Use Dual Network Interfaces option is set to Yes.\nIn order to correct this problem, change the Use Dual Network Interfaces option to No.\n\nThe reason this is a problem is because Expressway-E listens for the XCP session on the wrong network interface, which causes the connection to fail/timeout. Expressway-E listens on TCP port 7400 for the XCP session. You can verify this if you use the netstatcommand from the VCS as root.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1700175900.0","poster":"kljw5"},{"timestamp":"1654141380.0","comment_id":"232616","poster":"Abhishek1610","upvote_count":"1","content":"If Expressway-E Network Interface Controller (NIC) is incorrectly configured, this can cause the Extensible Communications Platform (XCP) server to not be updated."},{"content":"B is correct\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/unified-communications/expressway/118798-technote-cucm-00.html#anc9","upvote_count":"2","poster":"khader09","comment_id":"198360","timestamp":"1649763000.0"}],"exam_id":321},{"id":"cjDnk2KCj35DjVpa7Bix","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":321,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which configuration is required when implementing Mobile and Remote Access on Cisco Expressway?","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/45619-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-53-discussion/","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1614290400,"timestamp":"2021-02-25 23:00:00","question_id":132,"answer":"C","choices":{"D":"SSO","B":"SAML authentication","A":"IPS","C":"Cisco Unified CM publisher address"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722176700.0","comment_id":"790801","content":"Selected Answer: C\nStep 1\nOn the Expressway-C primary peer, go to Configuration > Unified Communications > Unified CM servers.\n\nStep 2\nClick New and add the following details for the publisher node:\n• Unified CM publisher address—The server address of the publsiher node.\n• Username—User ID of an account that can access the server.\n• Password—Password of the account that can access the server\n• TLS verify mode (What about for basic MRA without ICE – is this recommended?)\n• AEM GCM media encryption—Set to On to enable AEM GCM support.
