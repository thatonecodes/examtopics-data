When the Ethernet link comes back to operational state, you can configure the AP to set its radio back to operational state. This feature is independent of the AP being in connected or standalone mode. When the radios are shut down, the AP does not broadcast the WLANs, and therefore, the clients cannot connect to the AP, either through first association or through roaming.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/9800/config-guide/b_wl_16_10_cg/flexconnect.html","timestamp":"1732693500.0"}],"question_id":171,"unix_timestamp":1732693500,"timestamp":"2024-11-27 08:45:00","question_text":"On a Cisco Catalyst 9800 WLC, an engineer wants to prevent a FlexConnect AP from allowing wireless clients to connect when its Ethernet connection is nonoperational.

The RADIUS server is responsible for authenticating the AP when it connects to the switch port.\n\nExplanation of the options:\nA. RADIUS server:\n\nThis is correct. The RADIUS server stores the credentials for the AP and performs the authentication when the AP connects to the switch port.\n\nB. Cisco Prime Infrastructure:\n\nCisco Prime Infrastructure is used for network management and monitoring but does not store credentials for 802.1X authentication.\n\nC. wireless LAN controller (WLC):\n\nAutonomous APs do not use a WLC for configuration or authentication. They operate independently and communicate directly with the RADIUS server for 802.1X authentication.\n\nD. TACACS server:\n\nTACACS is used for administrative access control (e.g., logging into network devices) and is not used for 802.1X authentication of APs.","poster":"rrahim"},{"comment_id":"1305325","content":"The credentials for 802.1X authentication on an autonomous access point are typically defined in the access point's configuration. The engineer would need to log into the access point's management interface, either through a web-based interface or a command line interface, and then define the credentials within the 802.1X authentication settings. This usually involves configuring the EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) method to be used (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP), as well as specifying the necessary identity and password information for the authentication process.\n\nAdditionally, the engineer must also configure the corresponding settings on the switch port to which the access point is connected, in order to enable 802.1X authentication and specify the appropriate authentication server (RADIUS server) for the access point to communicate with during the authentication process.","poster":"Le91","timestamp":"1730361360.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1730361360,"answer":"A","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-10-31 08:56:00","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"RADIUS server","B":"Cisco Prime Infrastructure","D":"TACACS server","C":"wireless LAN controller"},"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":172,"exam_id":307},{"id":"EZyGifJXHKi07LnzsRo0","question_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"You are seeing an excessive number of rogue AP alarms in Cisco Prime Infrastructure.

This reduces unnecessary alarms for known or authorized devices, making the alarm system more efficient.\n\nOption C: Create and install a configuration template that modifies the minimum rogue detection RSSI of the controller to a stronger value.\n\nIncreasing the minimum rogue detection RSSI ensures that only rogue APs with a stronger signal (closer proximity) trigger alarms.
