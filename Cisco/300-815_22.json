I would also assume that the original question has the command as \"incoming called-number 22233344..\" or some type of extended matching, which would make B the Answer because the translation rule works as intended but it is obviously configured in the wrong direction and its name is made with the intention to confuse, which is a very Cisco-Like question. \nSo you are left with a conundrum....

However, there is not an answer that corresponds to the translation-rule being incorrect, or that would be the correct answer. The answer is B, because the translation-profile is being applied in the wrong direction. The name of the translation-profile is meant to trip you up in this question because it's \"outgoing incoming\" Outgoing is the name direction of the translation-profile and incoming is the name. It needs to be changed to become an incoming translation-profile. It's an incoming dial-peer as it doesn't have a session-target. So it needs to be translation-profile incoming incoming, where incoming represents the direction and name of the translation-profile"},{"content":"I think \"B\".\n\nThe translation rule is set for outbound but this is an inbound dial peer which only uses inbound translations.

Even if you make it more specific and match 2223334444 the translation rule would not be applied because it is assigned the wrong direction. \n\nThis config uses Dial Peer Groups which ignores the outgoing destination pattern so changing 888 to 444333222 would do nothing.","poster":"DoubleK","comment_id":"362181","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1621516380.0"},{"content":"I think that correct is B","poster":"Marco74","comment_id":"355539","timestamp":"1620826680.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1618319940.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"The answer is A.
