A network administrator came to you for advice while trying to implement load balancing across part of their EIGRP network. If the variance value is configured as 2 on all routers and all other metric and K values are configured to their default values, traffic from the\nInternet to the data center will be load balanced across how many paths?","topic":"2","exam_id":296,"question_id":256,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/13955-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-433-discussion/","choices":{"D":"4","A":"1","C":"3","B":"2"},"unix_timestamp":1581544200,"answer_description":"Explanation -\nFirst we should list all the paths from the Internet to the data center:\n+ A-B-C-H with a metric of 70 (40 + 15 + 15)\n+ A-B-E-H with a metric of 60 (40+10+10)\n+ A-D-E-H with a metric of 30 (10+10+10)\n+ A-D-E-B-C-H with a metric of 60 (10+10+10+15+15)\n+ A-D-E-F-G-H with a metric of 70 (10+10+10+20+20)\n+ A-F-G-H with a metric of 60 (20+20+20)\n+ A-F-E-H with a metric of 40 (20+10+10)\nSo the path A-D-E-H will be chosen because it has the best metric. But EIGRP can support unequal cost path load balancing. By configuring the variance value of\n2, the minimum metric is increased to 60 (30 * 2) and all the routes that have a metric of less than or equal to 60 and satisfy the feasibility condition will be used to send traffic.\nBesides the main path A-D-E-H we have 4 more paths that have the metric of less than or equal to 60 (we also include the Advertised Distances of these routes for later comparison):\n+ A-B-E-H with an AD of 20\n+ A-D-E-B-C-H with an AD of 50\n+ A-F-G-H with an AD of 40\n+ A-F-E-H with an AD of 20\nNow the last thing we need to consider is the feasible condition. The feasible condition states:\n\"To qualify as a feasible successor, a router must have an AD less than the FD of the current successor route\"\nThe FD of the current successor route here is 30 (notice that the variance number is not calculated here). Therefore there are only 2 paths that can satisfy this conditions: the path A- B-E-H & A-F-E-H.\nIn conclusion, traffic from the Internet to the data center will be load balanced across 3 paths, including the main path (successor path)"},{"id":"c9M4fuemK0c4yeZjezqF","timestamp":"2020-02-12 22:59:00","answer_ET":"E.
