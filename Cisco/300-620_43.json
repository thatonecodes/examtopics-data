This is essential for monitoring who made changes, what changes were made, and when.\nRelevance to the Scenario: Audit logs will capture configuration changes in the ACI fabric, such as modifications to policies or settings.\nFault Logs (C):\nPurpose: Fault logs capture issues or failures in the ACI fabric, such as hardware faults (e.g., a fabric node failure) or misconfigurations.\nRelevance to the Scenario: Fault logs will record events like fabric node failures, ensuring these critical issues are logged and sent to the SIEM appliance for monitoring.","timestamp":"1739178300.0","comment_id":"1354364","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1737208020.0","poster":"udo2020","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis is interesting question.
