Especially with the keyword \"Critical services\" ... although says it can sustain several hours of data loss and provide 24hr availability. Cold fits into all of this, but warm is a little more \"critical\" ... idk. Another too ambiguous of question with room to argue. Very annoying. There is nothing concrete that can say this isn't warm or cold. The only real difference is cold equipment is actively powered off and gets powered on when needed. so maybe that is where the 24hour availability is, if no one is around to turn up the equipment at any given moment.
