The formation of a channel is desired and ini- tiated.\nThe Link Aggregate Control Protocol (LACP) trunking supports four modes of operation:\nOn: The link aggregation is forced to be formed without any LACP negotiation .In other words, the switch neither sends the LACP packet nor processes any\ninbound LACP packet. This is similar to the on state for PAgP.\nOff: The link aggregation is not formed. We do not send or understand the LACP packet.\n\nThis is similar to the off state for PAgP.\n\nPassive: The switch does not initiate the channel but does understand inbound LACP packets. The peer (in active state) initiates negotiation (when it sends out\nan LACP packet) which we receive and answer, eventually to form the aggregation channel with the peer. This is similar to the auto mode in PAgP.\nActive: We can form an aggregate link and initiate the negotiation. The link aggregate is formed if the other end runs in LACP active or passive mode. This is\nsimilar to the desir- able mode of PAgP.\nIn this example, we see that fa 0/13, fa0/14, and fa0/15 are all in Port Channel 12, which is operating in desirable mode, which is only a PAgP mode.","answer":"Explanation","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nWhich EtherChannel negotiation protocol is configured on the interface f0/13 f0/15?","exam_id":297},{"id":"7q4ILDVDL0YrvNzjPZDh","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"aadeeb","timestamp":"1564948680.0","comment_id":"5862","content":"Answer is A"}],"exam_id":297,"answer_description":"PAgP aids in the automatic creation of EtherChannel links. PAgP packets are sent between EtherChannel-capable ports in order to negotiate the formation of a channel. Some restrictions are deliberately introduced into PAgP. The restrictions are:\nPAgP does not form a bundle on ports that are configured for dynamic VLANs. PAgP requires that all ports in the channel belong to the same VLAN or are\nconfigured as trunk ports. When a bundle already exists and a VLAN of a port is modified, all ports in the bundle are modified to match that VLAN.\nPAgP does not group ports that operate at different speeds or port duplex. If speed and duplex change when a bundle exists, PAgP changes the port speed\nand duplex for all ports in the bundle.\nPAgP modes are off, auto, desirable, and on. Only the combinations auto-desirable, desirable- desirable, and on-on allow the formation of a channel. The\ndevice on the other side must have PAgP set to on if a device on one side of the channel does not support PAgP, such as a router.

Instance 0 is a special instance for a region, known as the IST. All other MST instances are numbered from 1 to 4094. In the case for this question, there will be the 2 defined MST instances, and the special 0 instance, for a total of 3 instances.\nThe IST is the only spanning tree instance that sends and receives BPDUs. All of the other span- ning tree instance information is contained in MSTP records (M- records), which are encapsu- lated within MST BPDUs. Because the MST BPDU carries information for all instances, the number of BPDUs that need to be processed to support multiple spanning tree instances is signifi- cantly reduced.\nAll MST instances within the same region share the same protocol timers, but each MST in- stance has its own topology parameters, such as root bridge ID, root path cost, and so forth. By default, all VLANs are assigned to the IST.\nAn MST instance is local to the region; for example, MST instance 1 in region A is independent of MST instance 1 in region B, even if regions A and B are interconnected.\nA CIST is a collection of the ISTs in each MST region.\n\nThe CST interconnects the MST regions and single spanning trees.\n\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12- 2SX/configuration/guide/book/spantree.html","question_id":210,"unix_timestamp":1563633060,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Answer is C","timestamp":"1563633060.0","comment_id":"4509","poster":"aadeeb"}]}],"exam":{"id":297,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"name":"300-115","numberOfQuestions":224,"provider":"Cisco","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":42},"__N_SSP":true}
