Is correct.\nThe major components of the Cisco vBond Orchestrator are:\nControl plane connection: Each Cisco vBond Orchestrator has a persistent control plane connection in the form of a DTLS tunnel with each Cisco vSmart Controller in its domain. In addition, the Cisco vBond Orchestrator uses DTLS connections to communicate with edge routers when they come online, to authenticate the router, and to facilitate the router's ability to join the network. Basic authentication of an edge router is done using certificates and RSA cryptography.\n\nNAT traversal: The Cisco vBond Orchestrator facilitates the initial orchestration between edge routers and Cisco vSmart Controllers when one or both of them are behind NAT devices. Standard peer-to-peer techniques are used to facilitate this orchestration.\n\nLoad balancing: In a domain with multiple Cisco vSmart Controllers, the Cisco vBond Orchestrator automatically performs load balancing of edge routers across the Cisco vSmart Controllers when routers come online.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/system-overview.html#c_Components_of_the_Viptela_SEN_9290.xml","comment_id":"664748"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nCisco vBond Orchestratorâ€”The Cisco vBond Orchestrator automatically orchestrates connectivity between edge routers and Cisco vSmart Controllers.
