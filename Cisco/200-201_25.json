It tracks the state of connections and only allows traffic that is part of an established connection. This type of firewall is considered less resource-intensive compared to deep packet inspection because it only examines a limited set of fields in the packets.\n\nDeep packet inspection (DPI) firewall examines the payload of the packets beyond the header information. DPI can analyze the content of the traffic and block traffic based on characteristics like malware, URLs, or content type. DPI operates on layer 7 of the OSI model, whereas stateful inspection operates on layer 3.\n\nTherefore, D is correct because stateful inspection is capable of TCP state tracking, and deep packet filtering checks only TCP source and destination ports.
