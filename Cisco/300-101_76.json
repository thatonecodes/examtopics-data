The 10.1.1.0/24 subnet will appear as 10.0.0.0/8 in the R5 routing table.","timestamp":"1581707640.0"}],"answer_description":"Explanation -\nRIPv1 is a classful routing protocol so the subnet 10.1.1.0/24 will be summarized to 10.0.0.0/8 in the R5 routing table. If we use RIPv2 on R1, R5 and use the no auto-summary command on R1 then the 10.1.1.0 subnet will appear in the routing table of R5. Notice that even if the auto-summary command is configured under router eigrp 1 of R1 but when redistributing into another routing protocol EIGRP still advertises the detailed network."},{"id":"9nvdm7Gg9zspPHB9fusL","question_id":377,"discussion":[{"content":"D.

Besides OSPF doesn`t need to specify seed metric as all external routes get a default metric of 20 (except for BGP, which is 1).\nWe must specify seed metrics when redistributing into EIGRP (and RIP). If not all the redistributed routes will not be seen but the question says only some routes are missing.\nThe default administrative distance for external routes redistributed into EIGRP is 170 so we don`t need to set it .\nThe sunbet keyword is only used when redistributing into OSPF, not to other routing protocols .\nWe should check the routing table of the border router to see the missing OSPF routes are there or not.
