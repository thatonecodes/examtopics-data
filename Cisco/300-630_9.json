Why would you ever enable unicast routing if ACI is not the L3 Gateway? Without Unicast routing enabled, ACI will not learn the IP address for Endpoints. This leads some customers to enable Unicast routing, because (understandably) they want to learn the IP endpoint and not just the mac-address of connected devices. The problem with this, is it can lead to asymmetric routing, which can result in packets being dropped or mis-routed.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1699379700.0","poster":"NSF2","comment_id":"891530"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/63725-exam-300-630-topic-1-question-30-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1633591140,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
