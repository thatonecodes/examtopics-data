There are two options for configuring management of all ACI nodes and Application Policy Infrastructure Controllers (APICs), in-band management and/or out-of-band management. Another consideration in deploying time synchronization is where the time source is located. The reliability of the source must be carefully considered when determining if you will use a private internal clock or an external public clock.\n\nOut-of-band management NTP - When an ACI fabric is deployed with out-of-band management, each node of the fabric, inclusive of spines, leaves, and all members of the APIC cluster, is managed from outside the ACI fabric. This IP reachability will be leveraged so that each node can individually query the same NTP server as a consistent clock source. To configure NTP, a Date and Time policy must be created that references an out-of-band management endpoint group. Date and Time policies are confined to a single pod and must be deployed across all pods provisioned in the ACI fabric.
