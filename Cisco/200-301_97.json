For example, in a redundant network design, there might be multiple switches or routers providing backup paths in case the primary ones fail.\n\nAvailability, on the other hand, is a measure of how accessible and reliable a network or system is to users.

When a switch is \"reloaded\", it does NOT \"immediately\" go into forwarding state; it does a lot more things and it still goes to \"learning\" state before settling down in forwarding state. It's possible that the \"reloading\" part is added on purpose just to make it an incorrect answer.","comment_id":"273085"},{"comment_id":"262547","timestamp":"1610108940.0","poster":"hamed4maf","content":"the correct answer is B\nSpanning tree port fast caused to speed up convergence on a port, not minimize the spanning-tree convergence time","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"painkillers","comment_id":"244425","content":"I think B is the incorrect answer.
