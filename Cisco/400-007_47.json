If the queues are too large or too congested, this delay increases.\n\nSerialization Delay: This is the time it takes to place a packet onto the wire, which depends on the link speed and the size of the packet.","comment_id":"1280652","poster":"Redrum702"}],"exam_id":331,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/147190-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-69-discussion/","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-09-09 02:14:00","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"C":"Each individual device queuing delay in the chain must be less than or equal to the application required delay.","B":"The queuing delay on every device in the chain must be exactly the same to the application required delay.","D":"The sum of the queuing delay of all devices plus serialization delay in the chain must be less than or equal to the application required delay.","A":"The default queue sizes are good for any deployment as it compensates the serialization delay."},"question_text":"How must the queue sizes be designed to ensure that an application functions correctly?","question_id":232,"answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1725840840,"topic":"1"},{"id":"F3tCzjN1IohzQJ29YxS6","answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-11-06 11:34:00","unix_timestamp":1667730840,"question_id":233,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/87054-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-7-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"712243","content":"Selected Answer: D\nNote the requirement, \"be able to run its own varying QoS profiles without service provider interaction based on the migration stages\".\n\nTotals for each solution.\n\ndwdm 380000\ncwdm 325000\nmpls 215000\nmetro-e 350000\n\nAt first glance MPLS is best, however QOS will need SP integration.

Traffic shaping, also known as packet shaping, is a congestion management method that regulates network data transfer to ensure a smooth flow of traffic, prevent bottlenecks, and reduce latency. It can help ensure that available bandwidth is shared fairly and can prioritize traffic to critical services like your DaaS solution.\n\nPlease note that while traffic policing (Option A) can also help manage bandwidth, it does so by dropping packets or reducing the speed of packet transmission when traffic exceeds a certain limit, which might not be ideal for your situation. Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED, Option B) and tail drop (Option C) are mechanisms for managing network congestion, but they do this by dropping packets when certain conditions are met, which could lead to further disconnections.\n\nRemember to consult with a network specialist or your service provider before making significant changes to your network configuration.","poster":"omran80","comment_id":"1027099","upvote_count":"5"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD - A CBWFQ Shaper with WRED applied to the default queue would be ideal, but we do not have that luxury of an answer.
