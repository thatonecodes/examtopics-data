That would be an area border router or a router that is doing redistribution.\n\nA. Configure the summary routes on R5. --> Yes it make sense if we do redistribution of routes to IS-IS. But this is not specified in Q. \nB. Configure R4 as a Level 1-Level 2 router --> this will not help as R4 is in the same area and it's not border router.\nC. Configure R2 as a Level 1 router --> will not help. \nD. Configure R3 in a new area. --> Yes, you can do that, but then you have to do summarization on router R2, but we do not have this option in Q. \n\nSo according to me the best option is option A.","comment_id":"1149080"},{"poster":"jospinales","content":"Selected Answer: B\nRedistribution must be done on L1/L2 routers, so you could summarize the routes on R2 or change router R4 as an L1/L2.","timestamp":"1713370620.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1046192","comments":[{"content":"B is not correct.
