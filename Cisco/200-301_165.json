The idea behind this check is two-fold. The first is to alleviate a problem in the data plane, in which a sending host transmits packets to a receiver that are too large to accept. Typically, Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) should be implemented on the sender to prevent this case, however this process relies on ICMP messages that could possibly be filtered out in the transit path due to a security policy.
