In this case, the controllers are separate from the physical LAN, so they cannot provide any control over the LAN.\n\nFlexConnect is similar to a Centralized WLAN, with the added ability for the local AP to operate in Autonomous mode if the link to the controller fails. Neither the upstream controller or the local AP can control the physical LAN.\n\nAutonomous mode is a single AP acting as a standalone, and would have no access to the physical LAN.","comment_id":"4818"}],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/2833-exam-200-355-topic-1-question-5-discussion/","answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":290,"answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"question_text":"A customer has requested a single point of policy enforcement for LAN and WLAN.
