The architect should summarize the access layer networks from the aggregation layer toward the core layer to optimize the network and reduce the impact when a link fails.\n\nEIGRP is a distance-vector routing protocol that can support automatic summarization at network boundaries to reduce the size of the routing table and improve network performance. In this scenario, by summarizing the access layer networks from the aggregation layer toward the core layer, the full EIGRP routing table would be reduced in size and complexity, which would minimize the impact when a link fails."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1288865","timestamp":"1727235360.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1737497700.0","content":"Topology changes should not occur because of any one link.

This confines impact of an individual access link failure to the distribution pair by stopping EIGRP queries from propagating beyond the core of the network.

EOT is a feature that enables tracking of a configurable object and can modify HSRP priority or state based on the status of the tracked object. IP SLA is a feature that generates and sends synthetic traffic to a specified destination and can trigger EOT based on the status of the tracked object.
