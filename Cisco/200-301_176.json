R1, connected to the switch, will send out a DHCP request on its Fa0/0 interface.\n2. R2's Gi0/0 interface, acting as a DHCP relay-agent, will receive the DHCP request.\n3. R2 will forward the DHCP request to the DHCP server at IP address 198.51.100.100 (connected to R2's Gi0/1 interface).\n4. The DHCP server will process the request and offer an IP address to R1.\n5. R2 will relay the DHCP offer back to R1 through its Gi0/0 interface.\n6. R1 will accept the DHCP offer and configure its Fa0/0 interface with the offered IP address.\nIn summary, by configuring R2's Gi0/0 interface as a DHCP relay-agent using the ip helper-address command, we allow R1 to obtain its IP configuration from the DHCP server connected to R2.
