This is because without needing to keep track of state information, servers can handle any incoming request at any time, making it easier to distribute the workload across multiple servers.\n\nB. modular design iteration\n\nExplanation: A modular design means the application is divided into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and scaled independently. This also allows for parallel development and can enhance the overall scalability of the system.","comment_id":"913325","poster":"tartarus23"},{"poster":"tartarus23","comment_id":"876793","timestamp":"1729540320.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nA. Session management in a stateless architecture: Stateless architectures do not maintain any session state on the server, instead, they store session data on the client-side, and each client request is treated as a new request. This approach helps to improve scalability by allowing requests to be distributed across multiple servers, without worrying about maintaining session state.\n\nB. Modular design iteration: A modular design approach breaks the application into smaller, more manageable components or modules, that can be developed and deployed independently. This approach allows for greater flexibility in scaling the application by allowing only the necessary modules to be scaled when needed, without impacting the entire application."},{"poster":"pedromarase","content":"I'll go for A and B too..
