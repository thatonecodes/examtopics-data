A network architect is preparing a network design based on the EIGRR. Routers are connected using a cat6a cable type and the inter-router connection speed is limited to 10 Mbps due to distance.

This approach minimizes the number of queries traversing low-bandwidth links and helps avoid “Stuck in Active” conditions.","comment_id":"1356397","upvote_count":"1","poster":"friscowaverider"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/300-420/image52.png"],"exam_id":305,"question_id":217,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/156484-exam-300-420-topic-1-question-332-discussion/","answer_description":""},{"id":"8NhpXVh6yRkqOoFgsRbT","isMC":true,"exam_id":305,"question_id":218,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1366747","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI will go with A","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1741490820.0","poster":"kuttatnl"}],"choices":{"C":"It uses JSON encoding and is compatible with a wide variety of tools on the market.","D":"Telemetry obtains data by parsing the CLI output from show commands.","B":"It uses MIB models to structure the data that are well known in the industry.","A":"It uses interrupt-driven polling to pull data at regular intervals."},"topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-03-09 04:27:00","answer":"A","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1741490820,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/157783-exam-300-420-topic-1-question-334-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"What is an advantage of using model-driven telemetry in the network?","answer_images":[]},{"id":"dXDD0IwHlfDR5rffVBjX","answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1729374420,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
