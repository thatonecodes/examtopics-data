B is a direct host route and it will show up in the routing table as 10.10.10.10/32 and it is called a host route. Hence subnet mask being 255.255.255.255. Whereas, E option does NOT cover the host 10.10.10.10 address as if you calculate the subnet range for the subnet in option E it only goes up to 10.10.10.0 - 10.10.10.6 and .7 being its broadcast address. It's incrementing in blocks of 8 as the subnet mask clearly states 255.255.255.248 or /29. So, how exactly the router would send traffic to host .10 which is NOT even in the subnet range.
