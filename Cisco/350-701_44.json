There are two models you can use to provide authentication via an external identity store:\n\nExternal Authentication and Authorization: There are no credentials that are specified in the local Cisco ISE database for the administrator, and authorization is based on external identity store group membership only. This model is used for Active Directory and LDAP authentication.\n\nExternal Authentication and Internal Authorization: The administratorâ€™s authentication credentials come from the external identity source, and authorization and administrator role assignment take place using the local Cisco ISE database. This model is used for RSA SecurID authentication. This method requires you to configure the same username in both the external identity store and the local Cisco ISE database.\n\nSource: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/2-3/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_guide_23/b_ise_admin_guide_23_chapter_011010.html\nScroll down to: \"Administrative Access to Cisco ISE Using an External Identity Store\""},{"comment_id":"1299994","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MomoBill","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/security-documents/ise-admin-user-authentication-from-ad/ta-p/3159662\n\nStep 3 Create user in AD.

In the case of RSA SecureID integration with Cisco ISE, a shadow user needs to be created on Cisco ISE for the admin login to work.\n\nWhen a user attempts to log in to Cisco ISE using RSA SecureID, the RSA SecureID server validates the user's credentials and generates a one-time password (OTP) or token. This OTP or token is sent to Cisco ISE for authentication. To complete the authentication process, Cisco ISE must have a shadow user account created, which mirrors the user's credentials on the RSA SecureID server.","timestamp":"1689414540.0","poster":"ums008"},{"timestamp":"1683823380.0","poster":"GCalvo","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A.

When using RSA SecureID as the ID store, a shadow user must be created in Cisco ISE for each user who will be logging in with 2FA. This shadow user is linked to the user's RSA SecureID token, and is used to authenticate the user's login credentials.\n\nIn contrast, Internal Database, Active Directory, and LDAP do not require the use of shadow users in order for admin logins to work.
