Even under circumstances that seem to fall below their maximum capacity, they can quickly become overburdened and drop packets. This can also happen because the switch prioritizes regular port-to-port date above SPAN port data. Unlike a network TAP, SPAN ports filter out physical layer errors, making some types of analyses more difficult, and as we have seen, incorrect delta times and altered frames can cause additional problems. TAPs, on the other hand, can run full duplex 1G links.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1702129680.0"},{"content":"Option A is incorrect because both TAPS and SPAN capture all packets, including physical layer errors. The difference between the two lies in how they access the traffic.\n\nOption B is incorrect because SPAN does not modify packets before sending them to other analysis tools. It only copies the traffic and sends it to the destination port.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that SPAN is more efficient for traffic analysis than TAPS or that TAPS is considerably slower than SPAN.","comment_id":"885558","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698700680.0","comments":[{"poster":"alhamry","comment_id":"885559","content":"Option C is the correct answer because TAPS allows for more complex traffic interrogation since it can receive and analyze all packets, including additional tags that traffic mirroring may not replicate.

Session data\nNetFlow is a network protocol developed by Cisco that allows network administrators to collect and analyze network traffic data. It provides information about network flows, which are essentially records of network communications between devices. This data includes details about network sessions, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and the amount of data transferred during a session. NetFlow is commonly used for network monitoring, traffic analysis, and security purposes, making it particularly useful for obtaining session data. It does not provide full packet capture, application logs, or network downtime reports on its own, but it can be used in conjunction with other tools to support these functionalities.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728135060.0","comment_id":"1025707","poster":"AhmedAbdalla"},{"timestamp":"1723999680.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"984671","poster":"SecurityGuy","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNetfFow:\n- It is a network protocol developed by Cisco for collecting IP traffic information and monitoring network traffic.\n- Traffic learned by NetFlow can be sent to remote monitoring devices for collection with UDP packets.\n- By analyzing flow data, a picture of network traffic flow in volume can be built with this kind of rich data.
