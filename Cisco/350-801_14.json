You can reduce this delay in any of the following ways:\n– Reduce the T302 timer (Service Parameter TimerT302_msec) to indicate end of dialing, but do not set it lower than 4 seconds to prevent premature transmission of the call before the user is finished dialing.\n\n– Configure a second route pattern followed by the # wildcard (for example, 9.011!# for North America or 0.00!# for Europe), and instruct the users to dial # to indicate end of dialing. This action is analogous to hitting the \"send\" button on a cell phone.","timestamp":"1611181320.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"A is correct.
