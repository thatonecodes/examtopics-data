Creating a Dockerfile is a mandatory step in this process.\n\nA Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image for your application.

Create a Dockerfile for the code base.\n\nExplanation: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) uses Docker as its container runtime, and hence, in order to make your JavaScript module ready to deploy on GKE, you need to create a Dockerfile. This Dockerfile will include instructions on how to build a Docker image of your application, which can then be deployed on GKE.\n\nThe other options are not mandatory:\n\nB. Rewriting the code in Python is not necessary if the original code is already in JavaScript. Kubernetes can run any language as long as it's packaged inside a Docker container.\n\nC. The process of \"containerizing\" is indeed necessary, but it's achieved through the creation of a Dockerfile (option A), not through building a \"wrapper\" for the code.\n\nD. Rebasing the code from the upstream git repo would only be necessary if there were changes in the upstream repo that you needed to integrate into your current working branch. It's not a mandatory step to make the code ready for deployment to GKE.","comment_id":"912200"},{"comment_id":"855714","upvote_count":"2","poster":"xXXDarkWizardXXx","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA","timestamp":"1696075680.0"},{"timestamp":"1681386240.0","comment_id":"693845","content":"Selected Answer: D\nDocker","poster":"Teringzooi","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"680255","upvote_count":"3","poster":"NetGirl","content":"A is correct.

An example of this is the MouseAdapter and similar classes in the Java AWT library. Wrapper functions are useful in the development of applications that use third-party library functions. A wrapper can be written for each of the third party functions and used in the native application. In case the third party functions change or are updated, only the wrappers in the native application need to be modified as opposed to changing all instances of third party functions in the native application","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ashf4kbd","timestamp":"1646062740.0","comment_id":"433922"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/60914-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-11-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_text":"An application is hosted on Google Kubernetes Engine.
