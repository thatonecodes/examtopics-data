These access points spend relatively less time performing off-channel scanning: about 50 milliseconds on each channel. If you want to perform high rogue detection, a monitor mode access point must be used. Alternatively, you can reduce the scan intervals from 180 seconds to a lesser value, for example, 120 or 60 seconds, ensuring that the radio goes off-channel more frequently, which improves the chances of rogue detection. However, the access point continues to spend about 50 milliseconds on each channel.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/7-4/configuration/guides/consolidated/b_cg74_CONSOLIDATED/b_cg74_CONSOLIDATED_chapter_010111000.html#:~:text=The%20local%20and%20FlexConnect%20mode%20access%20points,spend%20about%2050%20milliseconds%20on%20each%20channel.","comment_id":"719741","comments":[{"poster":"HakinXu","content":"Thank you, this explians why for Q217 it is FlexConnect and Local","comment_id":"1366571","timestamp":"1741440180.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1684240560.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1732692900.0","comment_id":"1219324"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"996077","poster":"Hamo1","content":"I think it's D....The controller enables you to configure an access point as a network “sniffer”, which captures and forwards all the packets on a particular channel to a remote machine that runs packet analyzer software.

To mitigate this problem, we\nrecommend that you use dedicated monitor mode access points.\n\n+The local and FlexConnect mode access points are designed to serve associated clients. These access points spend relatively less time performing\noff-channel scanning: about 50 milliseconds on each channel. If you want to perform high rogue detection, a monitor mode access point must be used.\nAlternatively, you can reduce the scan intervals from 180 seconds to a lesser value, for example, 120 or 60 seconds, ensuring that the radio goes offchannel more frequently, which improves the chances of rogue detection.
