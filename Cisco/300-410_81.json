This feature allows the network operator to configure a router to automatically identify and selectively dampen a local interface that is flapping. Dampening an interface removes the interface from the network until the interface stops flapping and becomes stable. Configuring the IP Event Dampening feature improves convergence times and stability throughout the network by isolating failures so that disturbances are not propagated. This, in turn, reduces the utilization of system processing resources by other devices in the network and improves overall network stability. \n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_pi/configuration/xe-16-11/iri-xe-16-11-book/iri-pi-event-damp.html","upvote_count":"32","comments":[{"timestamp":"1688452920.0","content":"Would you please explain more, how can this feature fix the issue?

Every interface state change requires all affected devices in the network to recalculate best paths, install or remove routes from the routing tables, and then advertise valid routes to peer routers. An unstable interface that flaps excessively can cause other devices in the network to consume substantial amounts of resources for recalculations. \n\nThe IP Event Dampening feature introduces a configurable mechanism to suppress the effects of excessive interface flapping events on routing protocols and routing tables in the network.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"GoodServant","comment_id":"1219298","timestamp":"1716781080.0"},{"poster":"error_909","comment_id":"449844","content":"The given answer is correct","timestamp":"1632365640.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1628094900.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"The given answer is correct","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"419830"}],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04302/0006100001.png"],"topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2021-08-04 18:35:00"},{"id":"upXHyzklZkWdoXyK8tiq","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/110373-exam-300-410-topic-1-question-460-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1685194920.0","comment_id":"908023","upvote_count":"7","content":"In this scenario both C and B are correct answers, however we already have a stub config in place so I think it's best not to delete the stub and just add the connected keyword as it will advertise the loopbacks .","poster":"potato_inet0"},{"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1689861720.0","comment_id":"957669","poster":"inteldarvid","content":"Selected Answer: B\noption B, the connected keyword as it will advertise the loopbacks ."},{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is corerct","timestamp":"1722109440.0","comment_id":"1256446"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nstub only will be enough","timestamp":"1721892180.0","poster":"amir_lotfy","comment_id":"1254802","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1106413","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ZamanR","timestamp":"1703627760.0","content":"B is correct answer"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"aqwsdfghjklp","timestamp":"1700713980.0","comment_id":"1078064","content":"The correct answer should be D, since the loopback address must also be redistributed"},{"comment_id":"980410","poster":"Muste","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1691982120.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the best answer"},{"content":"C\n\n# eigrp stub ? \nConnected - This means that the router can advertise directly connected networks that have been included into the EIGRP process\n\nLeak-Map - A leak map allows you to fully customise which prefixes can be advertised to neighbours.

BGP uses update packets for keepalives, so if the answer is A, it is because of the reason I mentioned, not because BGP needs ICMPv6. B doesn't solve anything. Enabling the peering on the other BGP may help, but the exhibit shows we don't have connectivity.\n\nWhy don't we have connectivity? The link went down, we lost the IPv6 address bindings, now we need neighbor sollicitation messages. We need ICMPv6 for Neighbor Sollicitation messages to find out link-local addresses of other router.
