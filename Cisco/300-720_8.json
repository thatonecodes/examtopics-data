For each account, you specify one or more TLS domains and error handling behavior.\n\nNote: \nFrom Encryption Service 5.4.1 release onwards, there is no support for domains with only TLS 1.0 enabled for mail delivery. You need to migrate to TLS 1.1 or higher.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/email_encryption/olh/admin/b_Admin_Guide_latest/b_Admin_Guide_chapter_0100.html#con_7787262","poster":"GVKD","comment_id":"941228","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1719953460.0"},{"poster":"mipetric93","timestamp":"1719644820.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"B is correct answer","comment_id":"937686"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/113641-exam-300-720-topic-1-question-131-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-06-29 09:07:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"A remote financial institution is implementing email encryption.
