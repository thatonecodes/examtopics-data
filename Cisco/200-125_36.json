For example, from the output “Serial0/1 is up, line protocol is down” we know that it is a\nlayer 2 problem because the first statement (Serial0/1 is up) is good while the last statement (line protocol is down) is bad. For the statement “Serial0/1 is down, line protocol is down”, both layers are down so the problem belongs to Layer 1.\nThere is only one special case with the statement “…. is administrator down, line protocol is down”. In this case, we know that the port is currently disabled and shut down by the administrators.","poster":"Subutai"},{"timestamp":"1574454840.0","comment_id":"23708","poster":"borto1412","content":"Operational\nLayer 3 Problem\nLayer 1 Problem\nPort Disabled","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26101800001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26101800000.png"],"topic":"2","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/8903-exam-200-125-topic-2-question-408-discussion/"},{"id":"bvZMg0Pq0TeqnTN7JnyF","isMC":false,"question_id":180,"question_text":"Drag the Cisco default administrative distance to the appropriate routing protocol or route (Not all options are used.)\n//IMG//\n\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","topic":"2","exam_id":285,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1574454840.0","comment_id":"23709","poster":"borto1412","content":"120\n110\n1\n90\n0"}],"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"","timestamp":"2019-11-22 21:34:00","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26101900002.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26101900000.png"],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26101900001.png"],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1574454840,"answer":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/8904-exam-200-125-topic-2-question-409-discussion/"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":209,"name":"200-125","provider":"Cisco","id":285,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":36},"__N_SSP":true}
