Stateful inspection verifies data at the transport layer, and deep packet inspection verifies data at the application layer.\n\nStateful inspection primarily operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the network protocol stack. It examines the header information of packets and tracks the state of network connections to enforce security policies.\n\nDeep packet inspection, on the other hand, operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the network protocol stack. It involves analyzing the content of packets beyond the header information, allowing for a more granular inspection of the network traffic. Deep packet inspection can identify and analyze specific protocols, applications, and even content within the packets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Stateful inspection verifies data at the transport layer, and deep packet inspection verifies data at the application layer.
