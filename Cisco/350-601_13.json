Port bandwidth to uplink bandwidth\n This is one of the most common oversubscription types. It refers to the ratio of bandwidth available on the switch's ports (connected to servers, for example) compared to the total uplink bandwidth to the next layer of the network.\n Example: If you have 10 server ports running at 10 Gbps but only a 20 Gbps uplink to the core, the oversubscription ratio is 5:1.\n\n D. Edge ISL bandwidth to core ISL bandwidth\n This refers to the oversubscription of bandwidth between the edge switches (connected to servers) and the core switches in a multi-tier network.\n ISL (Inter-Switch Link) connections often aggregate traffic from many edge devices, leading to potential oversubscription at the core.\n Example: If edge switches have 80 Gbps total bandwidth but only 20 Gbps ISL bandwidth to the core, the oversubscription ratio is 4:1.","timestamp":"1734457740.0","comment_id":"1328074"},{"poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","comment_id":"679089","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nD and E!","timestamp":"1727289180.0"}],"answers_community":["DE (50%)","BD (50%)"],"answer":"DE","choices":{"C":"server storage to end-node count","E":"host bandwidth to storage bandwidth","D":"edge ISL bandwidth to core ISL bandwidth","B":"port bandwidth to uplink bandwidth","A":"switch processing power to end-node processing power"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/62190-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-154-discussion/"},{"id":"ZtIDE4fup8XuCfChPrNZ","exam_id":326,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1664131140,"timestamp":"2022-09-25 20:39:00","answer":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04312/0015100002.jpg"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1727289540.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","comment_id":"679096","content":"Answer is correct"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/83607-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-155-discussion/","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nDrag and drop the characteristics from the left onto the correct storage systems on the right.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","question_id":63,"answer_ET":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04312/0015100001.jpg"],"isMC":false,"topic":"1","answers_community":[]},{"id":"mxYw5NOyKUpzZpV6gyoU","exam_id":326,"topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Different zone set names must be configured on both MDS switches.","C":"Zones must have the same name on both MDS switches for the E Ports to function.","A":"Zones are local to the MDS switch and name service must be used to activate the connection between E Ports.","D":"E Ports on both MDS switches must be configured as F Ports for the zoning to function."},"answer":"C","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"17","comment_id":"203583","timestamp":"1697872860.0","content":"From the book - \"When two switches in a fabric are merged using a TE\nor E port, these TE and E ports may become isolated when the active zone set databases are\ndifferent between the two switches or fabrics.\"\nAnswer should be C","poster":"Kondogbia3"},{"timestamp":"1696531620.0","upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"193730","content":"Should be C - if active zone-set is not matching E port will be isolated","poster":"kkzz82"},{"poster":"kiluahxh","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"498860","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/storage/san_switches/mds9000/sw/rel_1_x/1_0_3a/troubleshooting/guide/tsht03.html#wp7324","timestamp":"1733853060.0"},{"comment_id":"474239","timestamp":"1731064560.0","poster":"poy4242","content":"indeed C\n A E port will segment with (isolation due to zone merge failure) if the following are true.\n•If the active zoneset is different on the two switches.\n•If the active zoneset on both switches contain a zone with the same name but with different zone members \nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/storage/san_switches/mds9000/sw/rel_1_x/1_0_3a/troubleshooting/guide/tsht03.html","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1706000040.0","comment_id":"274424","content":"C is the correct","upvote_count":"7","poster":"engabelal"}],"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1601923620,"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nAn engineer is implementing zoning on two Cisco MDS switches.

DCBXP is enabled as soon as LLDP feature is turned on. No need to enable LLDP on the interfaces of the switches.\nThis is gotten from the official guide :\n DCBX runs on the physical Ethernet link between the Cisco Nexus device and the CNA. By default, DCBX is enabled on Ethernet interfaces. When an Ethernet interface is brought up, the switch automatically starts to communicate with the CNA. During the normal operation of FCoE between the switch and the CNA, DCBX provides link-error detection. DCBX is also used to negotiate capabilities between the switch and the CNA and to send configuration values to the CNA.\"\nChapter 8 Implement FCOE Unified Fabric, Key Topic : Data Center Bridging Exchange (DCBX)."}],"answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/62208-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-157-discussion/","isMC":true}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco","numberOfQuestions":521,"isBeta":false,"id":326,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"350-601"},"currentPage":13},"__N_SSP":true}
