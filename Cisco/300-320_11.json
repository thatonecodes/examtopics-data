During the computation of the\nSPT, the shortest path to each node is discovered. The topology tree is used to populate the routing table with\nroutes to IP networks. When changes to a Type-1 or Type-2 link-state advertisement (LSA) occur in an area,\nthe entire SPT is recomputed. In many cases, the entire SPT need not be recomputed because most of the tree\nremains unchanged. Incremental SPF allows the system to recompute only the affected part of the tree.","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"id":"RhJMHK1BBNvTBHEhgOEL","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2019-12-09 22:27:00","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"What is the maximum number of neighbors that a router should have in an OSPF area?","question_id":55,"unix_timestamp":1575926820,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"C":"60","A":"5","B":"30","D":"99"},"exam_id":302,"answer":"C","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Cruxten","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"41363","content":"Per Designing Cisco Network Service Architectures (ARCH) Foundation Learning Guide: (CCDP ARCH 642-874), 3rd Edition\n\nNumber of adjacent neighbors for any one router: OSPF floods all link-state changes to all routers in an area.
