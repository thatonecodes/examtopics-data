The reason is that the default configuration for Manual Fallback is for the Jabber client to apply the re-log in upper and lower limits for the fallback. These values can be modified in CUCM at System > Service Parameters > Set the Server as the Imp Server and set the service as Cisco Server Recovery Manager. \nThen look toward the bottom at Configure Re-Login limits. \nThe default value for Lower limit is 120 seconds. \nThe default value for Upper limit is 953 seconds. \nThis parameter prompts the Jabber client to log back into the services. \nThis works for both Manual and Automatic Fallback. \nAutomatic fallback is disabled by default, but can also be enabled by toggling true in the same service parameter as the Client Re-Login Upper and Lower Limit values. \n\nI tested it and it works. \nAlso - Manually rehoming the user to between publisher and subscriber also automatically logs the user into that node's respective services.","poster":"Mert_kerna"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nShould be A","comment_id":"655413","timestamp":"1677619620.0","poster":"usernamesarehard"},{"comment_id":"605716","timestamp":"1669158120.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe Answer is A","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Azrael4d"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1668949860.0","comment_id":"604365","content":"• Manual fallback: When you initiate a manual fallback, the Cisco Server Recovery Manager restarts\ncritical services on the primary node and disconnects all users that had been failed over.

In pre-10 versions of IM and Presence, the user assignment was moved from one server to the other. This user move was very expensive to server resources and added to the load that was on the server. In 10.X and later, the user stays homed on the server that they are assigned to, and the backend user session in the Presence Engine is moved from the failed node to the functional node.
