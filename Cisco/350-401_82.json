A 3 dBm increase represents a doubling of the power level, so a power level of 13 dBm would effectively double the transmit power. However, it's important to note that TPC settings can vary depending on the specific implementation and regulatory requirements, so the actual power levels available may be different in different situations.","poster":"rafaelinho88"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"772468","timestamp":"1673439900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\naggree with jj970us","poster":"Rose66"},{"timestamp":"1669270980.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDefinitely A.","poster":"Stylar","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"725593"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nDefinitivamente es la A","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Gedson","timestamp":"1668784500.0","comment_id":"721352"},{"poster":"H3kerman","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"715985","timestamp":"1668164700.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nit's widely known fact +3dB means doubled"},{"poster":"Caledonia","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"663535","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A, it is just math simply.","timestamp":"1662635580.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1662207840,"isMC":true,"answer":"A","topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2022-09-03 14:24:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":410,"question_text":"If the maximum power level assignment for global TPC 802.11a/n/ac is configured to 10 dBm. which power level effectively doubles the transmit power?","choices":{"B":"14 dBm","D":"20 dBm","C":"17 dBm","A":"13 dBm"},"exam_id":324,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/79785-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-407-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco","numberOfQuestions":1066,"name":"350-401","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"id":324,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":82},"__N_SSP":true}
