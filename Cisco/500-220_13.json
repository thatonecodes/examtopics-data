All devices can hear each other's transmissions and if any two devices transmit at the same time, their radio signals will collide and become garbled resulting in data corruption or complete frame loss. If there is an excessive amount of collisions, data would never be transmitted successfully and the wireless network would be unusable.","poster":"sattori","comment_id":"1323328","timestamp":"1733624520.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1253650","timestamp":"1721738160.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"adslextsub","content":"Answer is correct A'.

These probes are used to measure the performance metrics such as latency, jitter, and packet loss between the VPN peers, which helps in making dynamic path selection decisions to ensure optimal performance and reliability of the SD-WAN connections."},{"content":"Answer: C\nThe performance probe is a small payload (approximately 100 bytes) of UDP data sent over all established VPN tunnels every 1 second. MX appliances track the rate of successful responses and the time that elapses before receiving a response. This data allows the MX to determine the packet loss, latency, and jitter over each VPN tunnel in order to make the necessary performance-based decisions.\nRef.: https://documentation.meraki.com/Architectures_and_Best_Practices/Cisco_Meraki_Best_Practice_Design/Best_Practice_Design_-_MX_Security_and_SD-WAN/Meraki_SD-WAN","comment_id":"1084682","poster":"rnunes1110","timestamp":"1717088520.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe answer is c\nhttps://documentation.meraki.com/Architectures_and_Best_Practices/Cisco_Meraki_Best_Practice_Design/Best_Practice_Design_-_MX_Security_and_SD-WAN/Meraki_SD-WAN","timestamp":"1715587620.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"alejandro12","comment_id":"1069197"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"cdipman2","timestamp":"1697245620.0","content":"C is the correct answer\nhttps://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/latam/docs/2019/pdf/BRKCRS-1579.pdf","comment_id":"869878"}],"unix_timestamp":1681434420,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/106152-exam-500-220-topic-5-question-13-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-04-14 03:07:00","topic":"5","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"B69pqOjImVu6g9PIFMFX","topic":"5","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer: C\nSelective Wipe\nA selective wipe on managed clients will remove all managed apps and managed profiles installed via SM, without fully factory resetting the device, and prevent additional apps or profiles from being pushed down.

In BYOD mode administrators only have control over work managed applications and settings. Systems Manager will containerize all corporate data and represent it using an orange badge icon.
