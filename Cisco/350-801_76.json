Expressway E provides communications services between the enterprise and the Internet, but it is totally different to say that provides a \"perimeter network\". The only thing that provides a perimeter network is something called demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides the corporate network and Intenet.

According to SRND for Edge infrastructure it is recommended to set media encryption on B2B traversal zone to best effort, as not all far end endpoint might support TLS. Answer says it doesn't provide encryption, where it is partial truth. Whereas for answer C I guess it again wording problem. Like you said it doesn't provide perimeter, but from all remaining answer this one sounds the most probably.","poster":"WeNt48","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"826062","timestamp":"1693578060.0"}]}],"comment_id":"596037","poster":"ciscogeek","timestamp":"1667399820.0"}],"timestamp":"2022-05-02 14:37:00","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"CD","answer_description":""},{"id":"enCbdeFWfzr6rsJlbNr8","exam_id":328,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740610620.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nReference: \"Understanding SBC's Comprehensive Guide to Designing, Deploying, Troubleshooting, and Maintaining CUBE Solutions\", Chapter 14: Monitoring and Management","comment_id":"1362345","poster":"G0y0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1362346","poster":"G0y0","comments":[{"content":"So,\nA. es incorrect, there is no such a Real-Time SIP trunk utilization; rather is Trunk Capacity (when it is exceeded in the 90%) and Concurrent calls (in all of the platform, not just trunks).\nD is incorrect.

The out-of-the-box behavior is that CUBE will not accept call requests from any remote IP peer unless that peer has been explicitly defined in the system.\nWhen a session target is defined in a dial peer, CUBE automatically adds to its trust list the IP address from the session target as an approved device for accepting call requests. Administrators can then add additional SIP source addresses to allow for SIP calls that may not be defined in a session target, such as IP addresses associated with SRV (DNS service) records or inbound sources for which there are no outbound dial peers configured for receiving outbound calls. Any incoming call requests from sources that aren’t defined using these two approaches will then be rejected with cause value 21.\nIn order of these information, correct answer is D.","timestamp":"1740612420.0"},{"timestamp":"1736155560.0","comment_id":"1337053","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect is D\nA - no 192.168.101.201 is not within ip address trusted list network 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.128 includes IPs 192.168.101.1 -192.168.101.127\nB no 192.168.100.102 is not included in trusted list and not configured in dial-peer\nC no 192.168.100.103 is not included in trusted list and not configured in dial-peer\nD OK 192.168.102.102 is configured on dial-peer.
