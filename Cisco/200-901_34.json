One reason to do so is to use a router to limit the types of traffic that can flow between the clients and servers. This can help to improve network security by restricting access to certain types of resources or services. Additionally, subnets can provide more IP address space for clients and servers, which can be particularly useful in larger networks where there may be a limited number of available IP addresses.","poster":"mellohello","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1687879920.0"},{"comment_id":"671889","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nA and B make sense.\nD is incorrect.
