To stop routing loops when mixing EIGRP and OSPF, we use route tagging and filtering. when a router sends routes from one type of routing (like EIGRP) into another (like OSPF), it adds a special tag to those routes. This tag is like a note that says, 'Hey, I came from EIGRP!' Then, when another router is moving routes back from OSPF into EIGRP, it looks for that tag. If it sees the tag, it knows not to send those routes back into EIGRP again. This way, we avoid having routes go in circles, causing loops. if router R3 is moving routes from EIGRP to OSPF, it tags them. Then, R4, which is moving routes the other way, blocks any routes with that tag from going back into EIGRP. So, R3 tags the EIGRP routes with a '1' when sending them to OSPF, and R4 makes sure not to let any routes with a '1' tag back into EIGRP.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1708888920.0","poster":"MasoudGhorbani"},{"timestamp":"1696767900.0","content":"I like A here.

I believe the second choice is E. because again, there is no match statement to evaluate packets and it has no effect on routing. This is a tough question, and I could be missing something but that is my 2 cents.","comment_id":"519257","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1641601380.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1641308160.0","poster":"MrThinMints","content":"A and E","comment_id":"516744"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"501798","timestamp":"1639534740.0","poster":"JOKERR","content":"Given answer is correct.
