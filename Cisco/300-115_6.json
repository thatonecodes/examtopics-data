The topology diagram indicates their layer 2 mapping. VLAN 20 is a new VLAN that will be used to provide the shipping personnel access to the server. Corporate polices do not allow layer 3 functionality to be enabled on the switches. For security reasons, it is necessary to restrict access to VLAN 20 in the following manner:\n✑ Users connecting to VLAN 20 via port f0/1 on ASW1 must be authenticated before they are given access to the network. Authentication is to be done via a\nRadius server:\n- Radius server host: 172.120.40.46\n- Radius key: rad123\n- Authentication should be implemented as close to the host as possible.\n✑ Devices on VLAN 20 are restricted to the subnet of 172.120.40.0/24.\n- Packets from devices in the subnet of 172.120.40.0/24 should be allowed on VLAN 20.\n- Packets from devices in any other address range should be dropped on VLAN 20.\n- Filtering should be implemented as close to the server farm as possible.\nThe Radius server and application servers will be installed at a future date. You have been tasked with implementing the above access control as a pre-condition to installing the servers.
