If so, answer A would be correct, but it does not indicate that the ARP table is empty. The statement says that PC1 tries to ping PC3 for the first time, but we do not know if S1 already knows PC1's MAC because it has previously sent traffic to other devices, nor do we know if S1 has information from PC3 for the same reason.\n\n- Are the PCs supposed to be on different VLANs? It is assumed that it is, but it is not specified.\n\n- It is assumed that if they are not on the same VLAN, it is a \"Router on a Stick so:\n\nIn theory, if the PCs are not in the same VLAN, PC1 would directly send the frame to the default gateway on Router, because PC1 knows that PC3 is not in the same VLAN by looking at its own network mask.\n\nIn any case, the key would be to know if S1's ARP table is empty or not.
