So when the advertised route from R4 is expired, the looped path is also expired soon and R3 willreinstall the main path from R4. This is the cause of intermittent connectivity.In order to solve this issue, we can lower the AD of iBGP to a value which is lower than 110 so that it is preferred over OSPF-advertised route.","poster":"AliMo123","comment_id":"472077","upvote_count":"21","timestamp":"1635944640.0","comments":[{"content":"Routing protocols are mutually redistributed on R3 and R1.
