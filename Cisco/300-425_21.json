Active surveys, on the other hand, can be more time-consuming as they require the client device to associate with access points and perform data transfers, which is less efficient for quickly mapping coverage areas."},{"comment_id":"1273954","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724839980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn active mode, the survey tool actively sends probe requests and receives responses from the wireless network, which provides more detailed and accurate information about the network's performance and coverage.
