It leverages a traditional IP-based (VRF-LITE, MPLS) network, which requires remapping of VRFs and SGTs between sites.\n\nSD-Access transit: Uses LISP/VxLAN encapsulation to connect two fabric sites. The SD-Access transit area may be defined as a portion of the fabric that has its own control plane nodes, but does not have edge or border nodes. However, it can work with a fabric that has an external border. With an SD-Access transit, an end-to-end policy plane is maintained using SGT group tags.","poster":"Opreis","comment_id":"832035"},{"timestamp":"1733603640.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D are Correct","comment_id":"1226343","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]"},{"comment_id":"1217754","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1732482600.0","content":"A and D are Correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1725535740.0","content":"another marketing BS, makes me so expert with networking to remember terminologies crap.","poster":"pingguy","comment_id":"1166441"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"827763","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nhttps://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/emea/docs/2020/pdf/BRKCRS-2815.pdf","timestamp":"1693722120.0","poster":"Brian9296"}],"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"wireless transit","E":"SAN transit","D":"IP-based transit","B":"fabric interconnect","A":"SD-Access transit"},"answers_community":["AD (100%)"],"question_id":726,"unix_timestamp":1677831720,"topic":"1","question_text":"Which two methods are used to interconnect two Cisco SD-Access Fabric sites?

Each connection, which runs as a DTLS tunnel, is established after device authentication succeeds, and it carries the encrypted payload between the Cisco vSmart Controller and the edge router.
