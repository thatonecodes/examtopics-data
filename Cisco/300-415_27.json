If all the parameters are equals for a route then both are installed, it should send the traffic by default through both paths. Is what i think. Thanks and good luck to all of you. \n\nOMP Send-Path-Limit is a configuration parameter that defines the maximum number of equal-cost vroutes that a vSmart controller or a vEdge router advertises to its OMP peers\n\n\nthe number of routes that get installed in the routing tables is subject to another OMP parameter called ecmp-limit.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Zamochit","timestamp":"1721671260.0"},{"content":"Not sure which one is correct but I've found this:\n\nThe send-path-limit parameter defines the maximum number of best-paths that can be advertised.\nThe ecmp-limit parameter defines the maximum number of best paths that can be installed in the routing table.","comment_id":"1069198","poster":"bullett00th","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1715587860.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption B, omp no shutdown send-path-limit 2, is not correct because the send-path-limit parameter controls the number of equal-cost routes that a vEdge router advertises to its neighbors, not the number of routes that it installs in its own FIB.\n\nThe send-path-limit parameter is primarily used to reduce the amount of routing information that is exchanged between vEdge routers.

The question does not mention advertising prefixes (which is configured with send-path-limit).
