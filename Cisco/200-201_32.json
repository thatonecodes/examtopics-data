DNS Tunneling is much more feasible in this situation because of the back and forth communication between source and dest. and the conversation of QUERY > REQUEST > QUERY > REQUEST and so forth.","poster":"Isuckatexams","comment_id":"917387"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nDNS tunneling involves using the DNS protocol to create a covert communication channel between two endpoints. This is achieved by encoding data within DNS queries or responses, which can then be sent between the endpoints without detection by security systems. DNS tunneling can be used to bypass firewalls, exfiltrate data, or carry out other malicious activities.\n\nDNS amplification, on the other hand, involves exploiting the characteristics of the DNS protocol to amplify the volume of traffic directed at a target server. This is achieved by sending a small DNS query to a DNS server that is configured to respond with a much larger DNS response. The attacker can then spoof the source IP address of the query, causing the amplified response to be sent to the target server. This can result in a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, where the target server is overwhelmed with traffic and becomes unavailable to legitimate users.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"drdecker100","comment_id":"817386","timestamp":"1677032160.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn the case of DNS amplification, the log file would show a large number of requests coming from a spoofed source IP address, directed at open DNS resolvers. The responses from the resolvers would be much larger than the requests, resulting in a high volume of traffic being sent to the target.\n\nSimilarly in DNS tunneling, the log file would show a large number of DNS requests and responses, but with a much lower volume of traffic compared to an amplification attack. Additionally, the logs would show that the *requests and responses contain data* that is not typical of normal DNS traffic, indicating that it is being used to exfiltrate data.","timestamp":"1675761660.0","comment_id":"800716","poster":"sami43"},{"comment_id":"762234","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1672426080.0","content":"Is this an actual CISCO question?
