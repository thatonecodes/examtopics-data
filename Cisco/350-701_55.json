This can include something the user knows (like a password), something the user has (like a security token), or something the user is (like biometric data).\n\nThe benefit of using a multifactor authentication strategy is that it provides an additional level of protection to sensitive data and systems by requiring a second validation of identity beyond just a password. This makes it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access to systems or data, even if they have managed to obtain a user's password.","comment_id":"847931","upvote_count":"2","poster":"sull3y"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an access security product used to verify a user's identity at login.
