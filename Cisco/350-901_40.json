Compile the protocol buffers IDL.\nHow confident are you in your answer?\nI am highly confident in my answer as gRPC uses Protocol Buffers as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the schema of the service and data types. The Protocol Buffers IDL is used to generate client and server code in multiple languages including C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Dart, and more.
