However, the transfer of the script uses http, and is not very secure.\n\nOption 43 (Answer C): \noption 43 specifies the secure POAP related provisioning script information for IPv4 and option 17 specifies the same for IPv6. Additionally, these options allow the POAP to reach the file server in a secure manner. \n\nYou can see Option 43 goes into configuring a network in this config guide and others stated is reasonable.

The DHCP response including this option would tell the switch where to obtain its configuration file and system image.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Enable option 46. Define TFTP transfer protocol.\n\nThis option correctly utilizes DHCP Option 46 for POAP and specifies TFTP as the transfer protocol, which uses UDP, thus meeting the requirement that only UDP is permitted between the Nexus 9000 switch and the server.

POAP (PowerOn Auto Provisioning) is the solution that meets the given requirements. POAP is a feature in Cisco Nexus switches that automates the provisioning process.
