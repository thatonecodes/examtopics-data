The parameter that needs to be adjusted is Restrict Ad Hoc Conference.\n\nRestrict Ad Hoc Conference is a parameter in Cisco Unified Communications Manager that allows administrators to restrict users from creating ad hoc conferences. When this parameter is set to \"On,\" users are not able to create ad hoc conferences. This can help prevent situations like the one described in the question, where an external user is added to a conference call and stays on after the host leaves, potentially causing unauthorized charges.\n\nDrop Ad Hoc Conference is a related parameter that determines what happens when an ad hoc conference is dropped by the host or when all participants leave the conference. Limit Ad Hoc Conference is a parameter that determines the maximum number of participants that can join an ad hoc conference. Monitor Ad Hoc Conference is a parameter that determines whether or not ad hoc conferences are monitored for quality of service."}],"question_text":"During a conference call, the CTO of a company adds an external user to the call.
