As part of a major modernization and overhaul of the applications, the goal is to move to a modular and containerized application architecture mode. At the same time, decoupling from the hardware is desired to move to an on-demand provisioning. However, the CyberOps team mandated that the final architecture must provide the same security levels as an air-gapped data center. Which cloud architecture meets these requirements?","timestamp":"2024-09-21 18:38:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737638940.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think ans is C.\nair-gapped data center is private cloud.","poster":"kalulosu","comment_id":"1345412"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAIR-GAP is private cloud.","timestamp":"1730274720.0","poster":"0d1b5b9","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1304891"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Air-Gap mean the Private","timestamp":"1727918100.0","comment_id":"1292588","poster":"Baramzon"},{"timestamp":"1727533740.0","poster":"JCGO","content":"Selected Answer: C\nVoting for C.

Each link currently handles approximately 7 Mbps of traffic, which is close to the full link capacity. When a link fails, the failure leads to significantly degraded performance of all applications. Static routing is used. The current ISP cannot deliver additional bandwidth capacity on the existing links. The customer needs a network design that is resistant to failure, but does not increase CAPEX. Which solution should be proposed to the customer?","discussion":[{"content":"Stated “ each link handles 7 MB . That means both links are actively in use .

Use dynamic routing for equal-cost multipath (ECMP).\n\nBy implementing dynamic routing with ECMP, the customer can effectively utilize both 10-Mbps links and balance traffic across them. This would improve resilience and prevent a single link failure from significantly impacting performance, as traffic would be redistributed across the remaining link or any additional links added in the future. It allows better handling of link failures without increasing CAPEX, as it can work with the existing links and static routing can be replaced with a more flexible dynamic routing protocol.","poster":"Nery","comment_id":"1411827","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743274980.0"},{"poster":"sandccie","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740893100.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
