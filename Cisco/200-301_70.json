In real work, you are more likely to say 'establish an access link for vlan 6 between SW-2 and SW-4' or 'establish a trunk between SW-2 and SW-4 allowing vlan 6 only', and then you will allocate a port on each of the two switches for this purpose and configure them."}],"comment_id":"1293811","poster":"Joshua25","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"SW1 # config t\nSW1 (config)# int e0/0\nSW1 (config-if) # switchport trunk allowed vlan 5,6\nSW1 (config-if)# int e0/1\nSW1 (config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 77\nWrite memory \n\n\n\nSW2# config t\nSW2 (config)# int e0/1\nSW2 (config-if) # switchport trunk native vlan 77\nSW2 (config-if)# int e0/2\nSW2 (config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 6\nWrite memory \n\nSW3# config t\nSW3 (config)# int range e0/0-1\nSW3(config int-range)# channel-group 34 mode active\nWrite memory \n\n\nSW4# config t\nSW4 (config)# int range e0/0-1\nSW4(config int-range)# channel-group 34 mode passive\nWrite memory","poster":"Essohjay","comment_id":"1260243","timestamp":"1722682860.0"},{"poster":"bymrdas","comment_id":"1214942","timestamp":"1716295440.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"SW-1\ninterface ethernet0/0\nwitchport trunk encapsulation dot1q\nswitchport mode trunk\nswitchpor trunk allowed vlan 5-6\nwr\n\ninterface ethernet0/1\nwitchport trunk encapsulation dot1q\nswitchport mode trunk\nswitchport trunk native vlan 77\nwr\n\nSW-2\ninterface ethernet0/1\nwitchport trunk encapsulation dot1q\nswitchport mode trunk\nswitchport trunk native vlan 77\nwr\n\ninterface ethernet0/2\nwitchport trunk encapsulation dot1q\nswitchport mode trunk\nswitchport trunk allowed vlan 6\nwr\n\nSW-3\ninterface range ethernet0/0-1\nchannel-group 34 mode active\nwr\n\nSW-4\ninterface range ethernet0/0-1\nchannel-group 34 mode passive\nwr\n\ninterface port34\nwitchport trunk encapsulation dot1q\nswitchport mode trunk\nno sh\nwr"},{"poster":"lmmujsi","content":"!
