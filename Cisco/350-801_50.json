WFQ can also manage duplex data streams such as those between pairs of applications, and simplex data streams such as voice or video. There are two categories of WFQ sessions: high bandwidth and low bandwidth. Low-bandwidth traffic has effective priority over high-bandwidth traffic, and high-bandwidth traffic shares the transmission service proportionally according to assigned weights.","timestamp":"1727916360.0","poster":"b3532e4","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"925501","poster":"MaxG","timestamp":"1686943320.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThere are two categories of WFQ sessions: high bandwidth and low bandwidth. Low-bandwidth traffic has effective priority over high-bandwidth traffic, and high-bandwidth traffic shares the transmission service proportionally according to assigned weights.\n\nWhen WFQ is enabled for an interface, new messages for high-bandwidth traffic streams are discarded after the configured or default congestive messages threshold has been met. However, low-bandwidth conversations, which include control message conversations, continue to enqueue data. \n\nWith standard WFQ, packets are classified by flow. Packets with the same source IP address, destination IP address, source TCP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port, or destination TCP or UDP port belong to the same flow. WFQ allocates an equal share of the bandwidth to each flow. Flow-based WFQ is also called fair queueing because all flows are equally weighted.\n\nhttps://content.cisco.com/chapter.sjs?uri=/searchable/chapter/content/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_conmgt/configuration/15-mt/qos-conmgt-15-mt-book/qos-conmgt-cfg-wfq.html.xml#GUID-E0AB57ED-E7F8-4F2D-8F2D-FEC30D4E23B6","upvote_count":"4"}],"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/112408-exam-350-801-topic-1-question-345-discussion/"},{"id":"StcQlW7sY8RcZ8LKU3bu","exam_id":328,"timestamp":"2023-06-17 12:01:00","topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct.\n\nThe trusted boundary device verification feature configures ports on the switch to apply configured QoS port trust commands only when the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) verifies that the device attached to the port is a Cisco IP phone.\n\nThe trusted boundary feature is implemented with the platform qos trust extend command.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/15-5SY/config_guide/sup6T/15_5_sy_swcg_6T/voip.html#65307","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718618460.0","poster":"MaxG","comment_id":"925895"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1686996060,"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"platform qos trust extend","A":"platform qos trust extend cos 3","B":"platform qos extend trust","D":"platform qos trust extend cos 5"},"question_id":249,"question_text":"An engineer must configure switch port 2/8 to send CDP packets to configure an attached Cisco IP phone to trust tagged traffic on its access port.

Traffic that is adhering to a particular profile can be shaped to meet downstream requirements, which eliminates bottlenecks in topologies with data-rate mismatches. \n\nTraffic shaping regulates and smooths out the packet flow by imposing a maximum traffic rate for each port's egress queue. Packets that exceed the threshold are placed in the queue and are transmitted later. This process is similar to traffic policing; however, the packets are not dropped. Because packets are buffered, traffic shaping minimizes packet loss (based on the queue length), which provides a better traffic behavior for TCP traffic. \n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/qos/602_U1_1/b_3k_QoS_Config_602_U11/b_3k_QoS_Config_602_U11_chapter_0100.pdf","timestamp":"1718620020.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_text":"What are two characteristics of QoS Traffic shaping?
