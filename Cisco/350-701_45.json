PAC files use if-else statements to determine whether to use a proxy or a direct connection for traffic between the PC and the host. PAC files contain JavaScript code that utilizes if-else statements to evaluate conditions and decide whether to direct web traffic through a proxy or establish a direct connection. The conditions can be based on factors such as URL patterns, IP addresses, or other criteria.\n\nC. The WSA hosts PAC files on port 9001 by default. When using PAC files with the Cisco WSA, the default port for hosting the PAC file is 9001. The PAC file is typically accessible through an HTTP request to the WSA on port 9001, and clients retrieve the PAC file from this location to determine proxy usage."},{"poster":"leowulf","upvote_count":"2","content":"B and C are correct\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/web-security-appliance/118082-qanda-wsa-00.html","comment_id":"677638","timestamp":"1695535500.0"}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1663999500,"answers_community":["BC (100%)"],"timestamp":"2022-09-24 08:05:00","answer":"BC","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"BC","choices":{"C":"The WSA hosts PAC files on port 9001 by default.","D":"The WSA hosts PAC files on port 6001 by default.","B":"PAC files use if-else statements to determine whether to use a proxy or a direct connection for traffic between the PC and the host.","E":"By default, they direct traffic through a proxy when the PC and the host are on the same subnet.","A":"If the WSA host port is changed, the default port redirects web traffic to the correct port automatically."},"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/83372-exam-350-701-topic-1-question-301-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"What are two things to consider when using PAC files with the Cisco WSA?
