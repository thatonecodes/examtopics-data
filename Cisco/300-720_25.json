The concept behind bounce verification is simple. First, mark up messages leaving your ESA. Look for that markup on any bounce messages, if the markup is present, it means that this is a bounce of a message that originated in your environment. If the markup is missing, the bounce is fraudulent and can be rejected or dropped.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa11-1/user_guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_11_1/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_chapter_011001.html?bookSearch=true#con_1134690","timestamp":"1718842920.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is Correct.\n\nTo combat backscatter on a Cisco ESA (Email Security Appliance), the feature that must be activated is:\n\nB. Bounce Profile.\n\nActivating the Bounce Profile feature helps to address backscatter by controlling and customizing how bounce messages are handled by the Cisco ESA. The Bounce Profile allows administrators to define specific actions for different types of bounce messages, such as dropping them, sending them to quarantine, or redirecting them to a specific email address.\n\nBy configuring the Bounce Profile appropriately, administrators can minimize the impact of backscatter, reduce unnecessary bounce messages, and prevent innocent parties from receiving bounce notifications for spoofed or malicious emails.\n\nWhile features like Graymail Detection, Forged Email Detection, and Bounce Verification are important for overall email security, they are not specifically designed to combat backscatter. The Bounce Profile feature specifically addresses the management of bounce messages and helps mitigate the impact of backscatter.","comments":[],"comment_id":"928049","timestamp":"1718842500.0","poster":"GVKD","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-06-20 02:15:00","answer_ET":"D","exam_id":316,"question_id":122,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/112634-exam-300-720-topic-1-question-81-discussion/"},{"id":"Aau452GYmQfes54NgKgC","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (83%)","A (17%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"937220","timestamp":"1719616260.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is Correct. \n\nSee comments below.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"GVKD"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"928061","timestamp":"1718844300.0","comments":[{"content":"I think it is answer D, in the example the ssl checkbox is not marked yet, and it shows that the esa is able to telnet on port 443 so port must be open.","comments":[],"poster":"Gray44","comment_id":"931171","timestamp":"1719111060.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"poster":"GVKD","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect.\n\nIf you checked Use SSL (Port 443) in the SSL Communication for File Reputation section of the Advanced Settings for File Reputation, you must add the AMP on-premises reputation server CA certificate to the certificate store on this appliance, using either the CLI command certconfig > CERTAUTHORITY > CUSTOM, or Network > Certificates (Custom Certificate Authorities) in the Web interface.
