A new protocol, called DHCPv6 (and based closely on DHCP), is used to pass out addressing and service information in the same way that DHCP is used in IPv4. This is called \"stateful\" because the DHCP server and the client must both maintain state information to keep addresses from conflicting, to handle leases, and to renew addresses over time.\nStateless Autoconfiguration allows an interface to automatically \"lease\" an IPv6 address and does not require the establishment of an server to delve out address space. Stateless autoconfiguration allows a host to propose an address which will probably be unique (based on the network prefix and its Ethernet MAC address) and propose its use on the network. Because no server has to approve the use of the address, or pass it out, stateless autoconfiguration is simpler. This is the default mode of operation for most IPv6 systems, including servers","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/1414-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-272-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"name":"300-101","isImplemented":true,"id":296,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":437,"provider":"Cisco","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":7},"__N_SSP":true}
