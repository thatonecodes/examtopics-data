This attribute allows the user to access the WLC in a read-only mode, preventing any configuration changes.\n\nExplanation of the options:\nA. NAS Prompt: This is correct. The NAS Prompt Service-Type attribute provides read-only access to the WLC, allowing the user to view configurations but not modify them.\n\nB. Administrative: This Service-Type attribute grants full administrative access, including the ability to modify configurations, which is not suitable for read-only access.\n\nC.

However, the level of access (read-only or read-write) is further controlled by the Privilege Level attribute.\n\nTo enforce read-only access, the Privilege Level attribute should be set to 1 (read-only) in conjunction with the Service-Type attribute set to Administrative.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n\nA.

NAS Prompt\n\nExplanation:\nIn RADIUS, the Service-Type attribute defines the type of service to be provided to the user. For read-only access on a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), the Service-Type should be set to NAS Prompt. This value typically provides the user with a lower level of access, such as read-only, as opposed to full administrative access, which would be set by using the Administrative service type.\n\nBy setting the Service-Type to NAS Prompt, the user is granted read-only access to the WLC, which aligns with the requirement.","comment_id":"1270986","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1153101","poster":"claudio392","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A NAS Prompt","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708243320.0"},{"comment_id":"1114237","timestamp":"1704426600.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"tachy_22","content":"I agree with baddieandyz94"},{"poster":"baddieandyz94","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704353820.0","comment_id":"1113394","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wlan-security/71989-manage-wlc-users-radius.html#toc-hId--1799525129"}],"unix_timestamp":1704353820},{"id":"9n1DPXBTUaLZFruabB6U","timestamp":"2024-08-01 10:58:00","question_id":147,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":307,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","question_text":"An administrator receives reports of many interferes in the wireless network and wants to get these interferes' location from the maps in Cisco Prime Infrastructure.
