In the given situation, the route reflector is experiencing delays during large network changes, indicating that it is struggling to handle the TCP acknowledgments during route updates. This suggests that the hold queue may be filling up quickly, causing congestion and delays in processing the acknowledgments.\n\nBy increasing the size of the hold queue, the router can accommodate a larger number of packets in the queue, reducing the likelihood of congestion and improving performance during route updates. This allows the router to handle a higher volume of TCP acknowledgments and facilitates faster convergence.","comment_id":"914057","poster":"J_W","timestamp":"1685845980.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1685845980,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/111037-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-27-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-06-04 04:33:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":178,"choices":{"D":"Increase the size of the hold queue.","A":"Decrease the size of the small buffers.","B":"Increase the size of the large buffers.","C":"Increase the keepalive timers for each BGP neighbor."},"answer":"D","question_images":[]},{"id":"rPpJNli1NV15d2OctL2i","exam_id":331,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","topic":"1","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1712676540,"question_id":179,"question_text":"Which layer of the SDN architecture orchestrates how the applications are given the resources available in the network?","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/138264-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-270-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD for sure.","timestamp":"1726905360.0","comment_id":"1287212","poster":"JCGO","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712676540.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/","comment_id":"1192373","poster":"bdp123"}],"choices":{"D":"control layer","C":"orchestration layer","B":"northbound API","A":"southbound API"},"timestamp":"2024-04-09 17:29:00"},{"id":"H8vLrZuapXI4xghOpd25","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/140689-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-271-discussion/","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/400-007/image26.png"],"unix_timestamp":1715767260,"topic":"1","isMC":false,"exam_id":331,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"150","timestamp":"1743442200.0","content":"Correct Answer should be: \nData Sovereignty:\nStore and manage encryption keys outside the cloud\nOnly grant access to these keys based on detailed access justifications\n\nOperational Sovereignty: \n Restrict the deployment of new resources to specific provider regions.\nLimit Google personnel access based on predefined attributes such as their citizenship or geographic location.","comment_id":"1415199"},{"comment_id":"1366144","content":"Data Sovereignty\nStore and manage encryption keys outside the cloud.\nGrant access to these keys based on detailed access justifications.\nOperation Sovereignty\nRestrict the deployment of new resources to specific provider regions.\nLimit provider personnel access based on predefined attributes such as their citizenship or geographic location.","timestamp":"1741322100.0","poster":"sandccie","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"i9t6","content":"Complete wrong answers.
