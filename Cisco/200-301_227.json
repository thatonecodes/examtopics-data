The controller acts as the strategic control point, managing flow control to the switches and routers, consolidating and mediating between different controller domains, and allowing network administrators to manage the network effectively[1]. Unlike traditional networking where hardware devices control network traffic, in SDN, the controller, often using protocols like OpenFlow, separates the network's control functions from its forwarding functions, enabling centralized management and control of the network through software-based controllers[1][1]. Therefore, the primary role of the controller in a software-defined network is to determine how data packets should be routed within the network, emphasizing routing decisions over other functions like packet forwarding, multicast replication, or packet fragmentation and reassembly.","timestamp":"1727462400.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Starlord2535","comment_id":"1184365"},{"content":"Control Plane\n■ Routing protocols (OSPF, Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol [EIGRP],\nRouting Information Protocol [RIP], Border Gateway Protocol [BGP])\n■ IPv4 ARP\n■ IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)\n■ Switch MAC learning\n■ STP","comment_id":"1027943","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1712578500.0"},{"comment_id":"986812","timestamp":"1708545780.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Liquid_May","content":"I don't think C is very correct, forwarding data should be a function of the data plane, however among the given options I think it is the most correct."},{"comment_id":"930266","timestamp":"1703238840.0","comments":[{"poster":"Darkar","timestamp":"1724236560.0","comment_id":"1155528","upvote_count":"1","content":"It is C"}],"upvote_count":"1","content":"What is the function of the controller in a software-defined network?\nA. forwarding packets\nB. multicast replication at the hardware level\nC. setting packet-handling policies\nD. fragmenting and reassembling packets\n\nWHAT WILL BE ANSWER FOR THIS ONE GUYS?","poster":"HM01"},{"comment_id":"769835","content":"An SDN controller is an application in a software-defined networking (SDN) architecture that manages flow control for improved network management and application performance.

Manifests in Puppet are files written in Puppet's domain-specific language (DSL) called Puppet Language. These manifests describe the desired configuration state of a system by defining resources, attributes, and relationships between them. Resources can include files, packages, services, users, groups, and more.\n\nModules in Puppet are a way to organize and encapsulate related manifests and associated files. Modules provide a means of grouping and reusing Puppet code, making it easier to manage and maintain configurations across multiple systems. Each module typically focuses on a specific aspect of system configuration.\n\nBy writing manifests and organizing them into modules, Puppet users can define the desired state of their systems and let Puppet handle the task of bringing the systems into that state. Puppet's agent periodically applies the manifests and modules, ensuring that the systems remain in the desired configuration state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. manifests and modules"},{"content":"Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings...","comment_id":"903200","poster":"espandrews","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1700576940.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","comment_id":"719047","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1684170840.0","poster":"Panda_man"}],"answer_ET":"D","question_id":1134,"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"manifests and modules","C":"strings and marionettes","A":"recipes and cookbooks","B":"playbooks and roles"},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2022-10-02 00:47:00","question_text":"Which script paradigm does Puppet use?","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/84191-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-763-discussion/","answer":"D","isMC":true,"exam_id":288,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1664664420},{"id":"CRrJLiwcDZomaWkVAg9n","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"B":"GET, POST, MOD, ERASE","C":"GET, PUT, POST, DELETE","A":"GET, PUT, ERASE, CHANGE","D":"GET, POST, ERASE, CHANGE"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which set of methods is supported with the REST API?","topic":"1","question_id":1135,"timestamp":"2022-09-28 11:23:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1679995380.0","poster":"Vlad_Is_Love_ua","content":"https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHTTP GET\nHTTP POST\nHTTP PUT\nHTTP DELETE\nHTTP PATCH","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"681554"},{"comment_id":"1185524","timestamp":"1727615460.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":288,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/83885-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-764-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1664356980,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":""}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":1395,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"200-301","provider":"Cisco","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":288},"currentPage":227},"__N_SSP":true}
