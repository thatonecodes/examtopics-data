When traffic is sent over a L2L IPsec VPN, it is encrypted at the source and decrypted at the destination. If the encryption counter is increasing but the decryption counter is not, it suggests that the encrypted traffic is not reaching the destination properly for decryption. In this case, it is recommended to review the routing configuration on the remote peer device. Ensure that the routes are properly configured to direct the traffic destined for the HQ network (where the network share is located) over the IPsec VPN tunnel. By adjusting the routing on the remote peer device to correctly route traffic back over the tunnel, the encrypted traffic will reach the destination (HQ network) and get decrypted, resolving the issue of the decryption counter not increasing.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kylesam2017"},{"comment_id":"1069439","poster":"gondohwe","content":"answer should be A since the tunnel is working 1 way...peer needs to know the way back definately with routing","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1715606340.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/125942-exam-300-730-topic-1-question-113-discussion/"},{"id":"0N4pELazI0SbCMd4ecBn","question_text":"A user is experiencing delays on audio calls over a Cisco AnyConnect VPN.

The \"Client type not supported\" error message typically indicates that the clientless SSLVPN feature on the Cisco ASA is not enabled or the configured group policy does not allow clientless VPN connections. By enabling the clientless VPN protocol on the group policy, you allow users to connect using the clientless SSLVPN method. Enabling the Cisco AnyConnect premium license on the Cisco ASA is not directly related to resolving this particular issue. The premium license is needed if you want to use the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client software instead of the clientless SSLVPN method. In summary, to address the login issue and overcome the \"Client type not supported\" error message, the administrator should focus on enabling the clientless VPN protocol on the group policy.
