So they do not accept @ character. SIP route patterns matching on the host part of the directory URI can match on a domain name or an IP address, both of which can be configured after the @ on directory URIs. Wildcards can be used in the IPv4 patterns to match on multiple domains, such as *.cisco.com and ccm[1-4].uc.cisco.com. In IP address SIP route patterns, a subnet notation can be used, such as 192.168.10.0/24. To create a SIP route pattern that matches any domain, you can just put * (star) in the pattern string field.\nCCNP and CCIE Collaboration Core CLCOR 350-801 Official Cert Guide\nChapter 19: Configuring Globalized Call Routing in Cisco Unified Communications Manager"},{"comment_id":"1215855","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFor Domain Routing pattern usage, enter a domain name IPv4 Pattern field that can resolve to an IPv4 address.
