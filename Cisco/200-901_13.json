Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop designed to provide a rich, browser-based experience for contact center agents and supervisors. It offers a flexible, open development platform that allows developers to build custom applications and integrations to meet the specific needs of their contact center. One of the key features of Cisco Finesse is the ability to trigger actions based on events within the contact center network, such as an incoming call or a change in the status of a customer's account. This allows developers to build applications that can react to real-time events and provide relevant information or services to agents as they handle customer interactions.","comment_id":"757483","poster":"mellohello"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA key characteristic of Finesse is its ability to trigger actions based on events within the contact center network.\nB. The platform provides a ready-to-go platform for HD video and audio conferencing. While Finesse can integrate with other Cisco collaboration tools that provide video and audio conferencing, it doesn't inherently provide this functionality as a core feature.\n\nC. Applications are added to the platform from the desktop remotely. Finesse applications are typically deployed and managed centrally, not added remotely from individual desktops.\n\nD. The platform includes an enterprise-class IM engine. While Finesse can integrate with IM solutions, it doesn't have its own built-in enterprise-class IM engine.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1734574620.0","comment_id":"1328814","poster":"kelvinMS"},{"poster":"working_on_hcip","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhat Are The Business Benefits?\n\n Add applications to the Cisco Finesse desktop remotely with a click of a few buttons.\n\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#!finesse-overview/what-are-the-business-benefits","timestamp":"1726877880.0","comment_id":"1012700"},{"poster":"cerifyme85","comment_id":"796405","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#!finesse-overview/what-is-finesse\n\nThin client browser based app for call/contact centers","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1706905560.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe desktop is more than an agent state and call-control application.

These two port numbers do not have to be the same.\n\nFor example, if a service inside the container is listening on port 8080, and you want to access it from the host, you can expose that port on the host by using the -p option when starting the container. For example:\n\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 mycontainer\n\nThis will expose port 8080 on the host, and any traffic sent to that port on the host will be forwarded to port 8080 inside the container.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1672063320.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mellohello","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn the docker run command, the -p flag is used to bind a host port to a container port.
