It acts as a barrier between the internal network and external networks, allowing or denying traffic based on defined policies to enhance security. Firewalls can be configured to filter traffic based on various criteria such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. The goal is to protect the internal network from unauthorized access and potential security threats."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/131128-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1233-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1705185180,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"5OIqatHamXTVfb2Wk7kc","timestamp":"2024-04-03 13:57:00","isMC":true,"question_id":263,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","exam_id":288,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/137816-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1234-discussion/","choices":{"D":"SNMP","A":"FIP","B":"NIP","C":"NFS"},"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which protocol is implemented when an organization must verify network performance, troubleshoot issues, and use an agent to communicate between monitoring tools and end devices?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1191989","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1728450780.0"},{"comment_id":"1188634","timestamp":"1727956620.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"SNMP works with agent and server role\n\nChatgpt\nThe protocol typically used in this scenario is D.
