NHRP redirect is typically used in DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network) deployments to optimize the routing of traffic between spoke-to-spoke connections by allowing the hub to inform spokes about more efficient paths\n\nIn a FlexVPN deployment, spokes send resolution requests to the hub for spoke-to-spoke communication. These resolution requests are typically related to Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) operations.
