Use the Packet Capture feature to collect real-time network traffic.\n\nIn this scenario, since the FTD appliance utilization is peaking above 90% of total capacity, it is possible that the appliance is dropping packets and causing users to get disconnected from their corporate applications. To further analyze the issue, the network engineer can use the Packet Capture feature in the FTD to collect real-time network traffic and determine whether packets are being dropped, and if so, which packets are being dropped.\n\nOption A, Packet Export feature, allows you to export captured packets to an external storage device. It does not help in analyzing the issue at hand.\n\nOption C, Packet Tracer feature, is used to simulate and troubleshoot network traffic through the firewall. It does not help in capturing real-time network traffic for analysis.\n\nOption D, Packet Analysis feature, provides a way to analyze packet captures taken with the Packet Capture feature. However, before analysis can be done, packets must first be captured with the Packet Capture feature.","poster":"tanri04","timestamp":"1694440140.0","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"836226"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nUsing the Packet Tracer feature (option C) is indeed useful for traffic policy analysis. It helps you understand how traffic is being processed by the FTD appliance and can identify issues related to policy configurations.\n\nHowever, to specifically analyze the issue of high utilization and user disconnections, the Packet Capture feature (option B) is more appropriate. Packet Capture allows you to collect real-time network traffic data, providing detailed insights into the actual traffic patterns and potential anomalies causing the high utilization and disconnections.\n\nBoth tools are valuable, but for real-time traffic analysis and identifying the root cause of performance issues, Packet Capture is the more suitable choice.","poster":"14a1949","timestamp":"1736831520.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1340170"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nmy answer is B.\nUsers are “randomly” disconnected, right?
