This includes retrieving information about the hardware and topology, which is part of the neighbor discovery process. Specifically, protocols like LLDP are used initially for physical connectivity discovery, and HTTP GET requests help APIC gather details about the discovered nodes, such as serial numbers and hardware specifications, to register them in the fabric membership","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1354468","poster":"prospio971"}]},{"id":"3XvtzXTuseEpXlEYWxBP","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A Cisco ACI leaf node has received a Layer 2 frame from an unknown endpoint.
