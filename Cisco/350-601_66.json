Let’s go through an example.\n\nSuppose you are the creator of an online marketplace named Jack’s Shop, where people can come to buy stuff and get it delivered to their home/office. How do you track which user purchased what? You need to maintain a database with user accounts and user order history. But you don’t want to maintain a user credentials database in-house.
