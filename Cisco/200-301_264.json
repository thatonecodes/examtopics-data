This occurs when one or both ports on a link are reset and the auto-negotiation process does not result in both link partners with the same configuration. It also can occur when users reconfigure one side of a link and forget to reconfigure the other side. Both sides of a link must have auto-negotiation on, or both sides must have it off. Cisco recommends to leave auto-negotiation on for those devices compliant with 802.3u.","comment_id":"1049376","poster":"skullomania","timestamp":"1727940180.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1727940180.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nRef: Autonegotiation – Wikipedia\n\n“…\nDuplex mismatch\n\nA duplex mismatch occurs when two connected devices are configured in different duplex modes.
