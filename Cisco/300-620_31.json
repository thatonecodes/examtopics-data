To allow SNMP communications, you must configure an \"out-of-band (OOB) contract\" in the \"mgmt\" tenant\nto allow SNMP traffic. SNMP traffic typically uses UDP port 161 for SNMP requests.\n2. Configure the APIC OOB IP addresses in the \"mgmt\" tenant. Although the OOB addresses are configured\nduring APIC setup, the addresses must be explicitly configured in the \"mgmt\" tenant before the OOB\ncontract will take effect.\nAbout SNMP\nACI provides SNMPv1, v2, and v3 support, including Management Information Bases (MIBs) and notifications (traps).
