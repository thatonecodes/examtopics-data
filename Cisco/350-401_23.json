Stratum 0 devices cannot distribute time over a network directly, though, hence they must be linked to a Stratum 1 time server that will distribute time to Stratum 2 servers or clients, and so on. The higher the Stratum number, the more the timing accuracy and stability degrades.\n\nThe NTP protocol does not allow clients to accept time from a Stratum 15 device, hence Stratum 15 is the lowest NTP Stratum.\n\nhttp://manuals.spectracom.com/SS/Content/_Global/Topics/NTP/NTP_Stratums.htm#:~:text=The%20NTP%20Stratum%20model%20is,to%20e.g.%2C%20a%20GPS%20antenna.","timestamp":"1620095160.0","comment_id":"212461","poster":"Summa"}],"question_id":115,"answers_community":["B (92%)","8%"],"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1604463960}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":1066,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"id":324,"name":"350-401","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":23},"__N_SSP":true}
