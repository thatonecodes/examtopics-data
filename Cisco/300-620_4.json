This is fine for any servers that support LLDP, but the UCS B series blades only support LLDP on UCSM version 2.2(4b) and later. Because of this, ESXi cannot report LLDP information to the APIC, unless you are on the correct code.\n\nAs an alternative to LLDP, use CDP in order to discover the hosts. In order to get the DVS to use CDP, configure a vSwitch policy on the VMM Domain that has CDP enabled and LLDP disabled.\n\nAlong with this, the only supported load balancing mechanism when UCS B series is used is Route Based on Originating Virtual Port.
