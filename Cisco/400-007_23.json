OSPF uses two types of external routes: Type 1 (E1) and Type 2 (E2). Type 2 is commonly used for redistribution because it only considers the cost to reach the ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router) and does not take into account the internal cost of the path to the ASBR. This approach helps in preventing routing loops and ensures that external routes are properly managed and loop-free."},{"poster":"J_W","comment_id":"913385","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTo fulfill the requirements of mutually redistributing two OSPF networks at multiple locations while avoiding the creation of routing loops, you can use route maps on Autonomous System Boundary Routers (ASBRs) to filter routes with tags so they are not redistributed.\n\nBy applying route maps on the ASBRs, you can selectively filter and control which routes are redistributed between the OSPF networks. By tagging the routes and using route maps to filter based on these tags, you can prevent routing loops from occurring.\n\nThis approach allows you to control the redistribution of routes and ensure end-to-end connectivity to all of the company's networks while avoiding any potential routing issues.","timestamp":"1685777940.0"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1684860120.0","content":"Also, a virtual link is between two ABR's not ASBR's\nhttps://afrozahmad.com/blog/ospf-virtual-link-explained/#:~:text=An%20OSPF%20virtual%20link%20is%20a%20connection%20between,their%20OSPF%20network%20while%20maintaining%20OSPF%20design%20requirements.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"bdp123","comment_id":"905086"}],"poster":"bdp123","timestamp":"1683112320.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTo avoid routing loops you need to tag packets","comment_id":"888433"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Alionzo","content":"C. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/4170-ospfprocesses.html","comment_id":"851741","timestamp":"1679894640.0"},{"poster":"gcpengineer","timestamp":"1678316460.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"They are in different OSPF instance.

Tunnel Mode in IPsec Phase II\n\nExplanation: When using a VPN for site-to-site connections, like the GRE over IPsec setup mentioned, Tunnel Mode is usually used. In Tunnel Mode, the entire original IP packet is encapsulated and becomes the payload in a new IP packet. This allows for a new IP header to be added, preventing duplicate IP addresses in the headers.\n\nIPsec has two main modes of operation: Tunnel Mode and Transport Mode. Transport Mode only encrypts the payload and ESP trailer being sent between two parties but leaves the header untouched, while Tunnel Mode encrypts the entire original packet, making it the payload in a new packet with a new header.\n\nPhase II in IPsec negotiation is where the actual tunnel is created and the mode (Tunnel Mode or Transport Mode) is selected, thus the option 'Tunnel Mode in IPsec Phase II' would be correct.","poster":"SFXY","timestamp":"1684627740.0","comments":[{"content":"Changed my mind to C Explanation:\n\nThe purpose of using GRE over IPsec is to provide a mechanism for encapsulating packets from protocols that aren't supported natively by IPsec (like multicast packets, which are used by many routing protocols). GRE provides the encapsulation and IPsec provides the encryption.\n\n\nIn this setup, IPsec in Transport mode will encrypt the entire inner packet (which includes the inner IP header originally sent by the host), and the original, unmodified IP header will be used to route the packet across the internet.\n\nIn contrast, Tunnel mode would add another (unnecessary) IP header, leading to inefficient use of bandwidth.
