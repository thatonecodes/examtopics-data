(Choose two.)","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1263231","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nTo meet the specified requirements for configuring a Cisco UCS B-Series infrastructure with a Cisco 5108 chassis, the following two steps are essential:\n\nD. Set Link Group Preference to Port Channel.\nSetting the Link Group Preference to Port Channel ensures that the connections between the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects and the I/O modules are aggregated into a port channel. This configuration is crucial for meeting the requirement of using aggregation between the fabric interconnects and I/O modules. It helps in achieving redundancy and increasing bandwidth.\nB. Set IOM link pinning in Global Policies.\nSetting the IOM (I/O Module) link pinning in Global Policies ensures that the I/O modules are properly configured to use the required number of connections (in this case, four 10 GbE connections per I/O module). Pinning helps in maintaining consistent connectivity and managing how the links are distributed and aggregated.","timestamp":"1723239180.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Rollizo","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Rollizo","content":"Cannot be B, because you are using aggregation and port-channel then has to be A and D","timestamp":"1725821400.0","comment_id":"1280546"}]},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1166164","timestamp":"1709605200.0","content":"i think A B are correct","poster":"wickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1120568","content":"You're right:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/CLI-User-Guides/Infrastructure-Mgmt/3-2/b_UCSM_CLI_Infrastructure_Management_Guide_3_2/b_UCSM_CLI_Infrastructure_Management_Guide_3_2_chapter_011.html","timestamp":"1705049160.0","poster":"prospio971"}],"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA adn D. \nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/unified_computing/ucs/sw/gui/config/guide/141/UCSM_GUI_Configuration_Guide_141_chapter12.html\n1) reacknowlenge the chassis after discovery\n2) links should be aggregated at future.\nProvided answers incorrect, they are related to uplinks, not downlonks to IOM's","poster":"JCGO","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1090052","timestamp":"1701936420.0"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"HibZk2wTg0HKCiQstoaR","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1702332060,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/128322-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-454-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"crooks_1988","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1725365160.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"crooks_1988","comment_id":"1164827","content":"Wrong me, we are talking about a restore, so Full State -A"}],"comment_id":"1159670","timestamp":"1724667960.0","content":"C.
