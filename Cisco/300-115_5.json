SwitchA is currently configured correctly, but will need to be modified to support the addition of SwitchB. SwitchB has a minimal configuration. You have been tasked with competing the needed configuring of\nSwitchA and SwitchB. SwitchA and SwitchB use Cisco as the enable password.\nAll commands must be entered at the physical interface level.\nConfiguration Requirements for SwitchA\nThe VTP and STP configuration models on Switch A should not be modified.\n//IMG//\n\n✑ SwitchA needs to be the root switch for vlans 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23.
