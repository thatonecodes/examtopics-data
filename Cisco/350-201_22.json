Asset vulnerability assessment: This is the process of identifying and prioritizing the vulnerabilities that exist in the organization's assets, including hardware, software, and data. Without this assessment, it is impossible to determine the likelihood and potential impact of a successful attack.\n\nE. Malware analysis report: This report provides detailed information about the new malware variant, including its capabilities, attack vectors, and potential impact on the organization's assets. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the potential impact of the malware on the organization and determine appropriate risk mitigation strategies.\n\nThe other options (A, C, and D) may be important elements of a risk assessment or incident response plan, but they are not specifically related to the calculation of the risk assessment itself, according to NIST.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711390380.0","comment_id":"678986","poster":"TOLU1985","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nBE only fit here"}],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"F3eo7a2VDBEfb3Xtt9GG","unix_timestamp":1638055200,"exam_id":323,"answer_ET":"","timestamp":"2021-11-28 00:20:00","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03915/0005700001.jpg"],"question_id":107,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/66841-exam-350-201-topic-1-question-70-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03915/0005800001.jpg"],"isMC":false,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nDrag and drop the mitigation steps from the left onto the vulnerabilities they mitigate on the right.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","answers_community":[],"answer":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"6","poster":"CiscoTester","timestamp":"1685372940.0","content":"The answer shown is right.","comment_id":"490051"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"DrVoIP","content":"Retract administrative access to operating systems and applications in accordance with job duties: Privilege accounts have full rights to information systems.\nUse multifactor authentication for remote access or accessing sensitive information: User verification is weak and based on a single factor.\nChange backup and store software and configuration setting for test three months: N/A (not enough context to determine which vulnerability this mitigates)\nPatch applications including flash web browsers and PDF viewers: Application security vulnerabilities can be used to execute malicious code. - ChatGPT","comment_id":"812970","timestamp":"1723978860.0"},{"comment_id":"707829","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714476360.0","poster":"attiko","content":"correct answer"},{"content":"The answer the is correct","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"498017","poster":"maxson69","timestamp":"1686334380.0"},{"comment_id":"488576","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bobster02","timestamp":"1685222400.0","content":"1.
