When the traffic rate reaches the configured maximum rate, excess traffic is dropped (or remarked). The result is an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs.

DNS servers maintain a database of domain name to IP address mappings, allowing users to access websites and services using easy-to-remember domain names.\n\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Servers: While DHCP servers are primarily responsible for assigning IP addresses to devices on a network, they can also provide domain name resolution information to those devices. When a device connects to a network and obtains an IP address from a DHCP server, it can also receive DNS server information from the DHCP server.

For example, if you make a request from your web browser and there is no information on your computer about this domain name (it is not cached), your computer will send the request to DNS resolvers. The resolver will then try to find the name servers, that are responsible for this domain name and contain the necessary records. These name servers are called authoritative.\nWhat is authoritative name server?\nAuthoritative DNS nameservers provide answers to DNS resolvers with the correct IP addresses and records. These name servers contain the DNS zone with all information, like the IP address of the server, the responsible mail servers, etc for a domain name.\nBoth servers work hand in hand - resolvers ask the authoritative name servers.
