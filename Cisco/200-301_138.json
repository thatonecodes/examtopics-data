Each link between leaf switches allows for higher bandwidth.\nThe spine-and-leaf architecture is a network topology commonly used in data centers to provide high bandwidth, low latency, and scalability. In this architecture, network switches are organized into two layers: the spine layer and the leaf layer.\n\nIn a spine-and-leaf architecture, each leaf switch is connected to every spine switch, and the connections between these switches provide high bandwidth. This is in contrast to traditional network topologies like hierarchical designs, where not all devices are directly connected to each other.\n\nThe statement \"Each link between leaf switches allows for higher bandwidth\" is correct because every leaf switch is connected to every spine switch, forming multiple parallel paths for data to travel between devices. This arrangement ensures that the available bandwidth is effectively aggregated and distributed across all the links, resulting in increased overall network capacity.","comment_id":"981932","timestamp":"1692126360.0","poster":"ajuniad"},{"content":"From what I understand A) but I'm open to opinions \nSpine-and-leaf architecture is a type of network topology in which switches are arranged in a leaf layer that connects to a spine layer.
