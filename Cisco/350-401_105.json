This is a direct benefit of adopting a data modeling language.\n\nOn the other hand, while deploying machine-friendly codes to manage a high number of devices is also a potential benefit, it is not directly related to the idea of creating widely compatible configurations, which is what the question is asking about.","poster":"sull3y","comment_id":"855274","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1680152940.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1305982","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. refactoring vendor and platform specific configurations with widely compatible configurations.\n\nExplanation:\nAdopting a data modeling language allows for the creation of abstract, vendor-agnostic models that can be applied across different devices and platforms.

Refactoring vendor and platform-specific configurations with widely compatible configurations.\n\nBy adopting a data modeling language, organizations can create vendor-neutral and platform-agnostic configurations that are widely compatible across different network devices and platforms.\n\nThis benefit of refactoring vendor and platform-specific configurations allows for greater flexibility and interoperability in network deployments. Instead of being tied to proprietary configuration formats and limited vendor-specific features, adopting a data modeling language enables organizations to create reusable and consistent configurations that can be applied to a variety of network devices from different vendors.","comment_id":"944512"},{"timestamp":"1688055300.0","comments":[{"content":"I agree.
