While session data is very simple, it can be used to answer many important questions that arise regularly in the SOC. Threat intelligence reports may provide a list of suspicious external IP addresses. Session data\ncan be consulted to see if any internal systems have communicated with any of the suspicious external IP addresses. Similarly, if a particular TCP port is associated with an active malware campaign command and control, session data can be consulted to see if any internal systems are communicating by using that TCP port. If an internal host has been identified as being compromised, session data can identify other internal systems that it has communicated with (potential lateral movement) and any external systems that it has communicated with (potential data exfiltration).

One of the main goals of data normalization is to purge redundant data while maintaining data integrity. The normalized data is protected by making sure that any manifestation of the same data elsewhere is only making a reference to the data that is being stored.\n\nIntrusion prevention systems (IPSs) focus on throughput for the most rapid and optimal inline performance. While doing so, in most cases, it is impossible for full normalization to take place. Traditional IPS devices often rely on shortcuts that only implement partial normalization and partial inspection.

Data normalization.\n\nData normalization is the process of organizing data in a database so that it is consistent and easily manageable.

By removing duplicates or inconsistent data, it ensures that the data stored is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the process of removing IPS events to improve data integrity:\n\nA. Data availability refers to the ability to access and retrieve data when it is needed.\n\nC.
