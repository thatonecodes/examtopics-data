Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) provides gateway redundancy and load-balancing capability to a network segment. It provides redundancy with an active/standby gateway, and it provides load-balancing capability by ensuring that each member of the GLBP group takes care of forwarding the traffic to the appropriate gateway. Multiple HSRP (MSHRP) load share traffic by using multi hsrp. \n\nVSS is not valid as it combines a pair of switches into a single network element.
