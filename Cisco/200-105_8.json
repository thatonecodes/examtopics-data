These attributes are the IP packet identity or fingerprint of the packet and determine if the packet is unique or similar to other packets.\nTraditionally, an IP Flow is based on a set of 5 and up to 7 IP packet attributes. IP Packet attributes used by NetFlow:\n\nIP source address -\n\nIP destination address -\n\nSource port -\n\nDestination port -\n\nLayer 3 protocol type -\n\nClass of Service -\n\nRouter or switch interface -\nAll packets with the same source/destination IP address, source/destination ports, protocol interface and class of service are grouped into a flow and then packets and bytes are tallied. This methodology of fingerprinting or determining a flow is scalable because a large amount of network information is condensed into a database of NetFlow information called the NetFlow cache. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/ios-nx-os-software/ios-netflow/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html","question_id":40,"question_images":[],"exam_id":284}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":168,"name":"200-105","id":284,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":8},"__N_SSP":true}
