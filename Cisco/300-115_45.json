{"pageProps":{"questions":[{"id":"JJJHQgkqaW2xNEXmaNbq","answer_description":"The command show spanning-tree vlan 100 was used to provide the output in the exhibit. This output helps to identify the state of each port on the switch that is a member of VLAN 100. It is also used to identify the root bridge in the spanning tree.\nThe command show vlan 100 will provide basic information about VLAN 100, such as what ports are assigned to it, but will not display the STP information about the VLAN as the exhibit shows.\nThe command show spanning-tree summary can be used to verify the enabling of the extended system ID. This command is not used to provide the output in the exhibit.\nThe command show interface vlan 100 displays the same kind of information as would be displayed for any other interface, including the IP address configuration and whether the interface is up. It does not provide STP information about the switch as displayed in the exhibit.\nThe command show spanning-tree inconsistent port is used to identify inconsistent ports on a switch. This can occur as a result of implementing the Root Guard feature on a switch. Root Guard can be implemented on a port to prevent the reception of superior BPDUs from causing a new root bridge from being elected.\nThis can sometimes occur when a new switch is introduced with an unknown bridge ID. When a port is configured with Root Guard and it receives a superior\nBPDU, it will block the port, discard the BPDU, and assign a state of inconsistent to the port.\nBelow is an example of the partial output of the show spanning-tree inconsistent ports command:\n\nThe output shows that devices connected to ports Fa0/1 and Fa0/2 are sending superior BPDUs (perhaps from a new switch). Because of this, no traffic will be forwarded across the ports. Once these superior BPDUs are stopped by changing the priority of the new switch, the interfaces will recover and resume normal operation.\nObjective:\n\nLayer 2 Technologies -\nSub-Objective:\nConfigure and verify spanning tree\nReferences:\nCisco > Cisco IOS LAN Switching Command Reference > set port flowcontrol through show udld > show spanning-tree","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44079400000.png"],"answer_ET":"Explanation","choices":{"E":"switch# show spanning-tree inconsistent ports A","C":"switch# show spanning-tree summary","B":"switch# show vlan 100","D":"switch# show interface vlan 100","A":"switch# show spanning-tree vlan 100"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/11356-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-53-discussion/","question_text":"Which command produced the following output?\n//IMG//","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"35140","timestamp":"1578113100.0","content":"A is the correct answer","poster":"CiscoNinja"}],"exam_id":297,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44079400001.png"],"answer":"Explanation","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2020-01-04 05:45:00","topic":"5","question_id":221,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1578113100},{"id":"2sjwGju06ioJNFfwi0gW","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/11283-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-56-discussion/","answer":"Explanation","question_text":"Which VTP mode and version should be configured on a switch so that its VLAN database can be separately maintained while it forwards all VTP advertisements it receives?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"BECAUSE vtp 2 allows all vtp messages without checking the domain name","poster":"Alice2020","comment_id":"38527","timestamp":"1578929160.0"},{"content":"whats difference between ansparent mode and version 2\nF.

A switch configured in VTP transparent mode using version 1 will only forward VTP advertisements it receives if the version used to send the update is also version 1. Using version 2 it will forward advertisements it receives without checking the version number.\nThere are two versions of VTP: version 1 and version 2. VTP version 1 is the default. The two versions are not interoperable. To support version 2, all of the switches in a network need to be configured to run in VTP version 2.\nTo enable, or revert back to, VTP version 1 at the configuration prompt, use the following command: switch(config)# no vtp v2-mode\nVTP version 2 offers some features that are not available in version 1.\nToken Ring support: Version 2 provides the ability to support Token Ring LAN parameters, such as ring numbers and hop counts, used in Token Ring LAN switching and VLANs.\nUnrecognized type, length, value (TLV) support: A version 2-enabled switch in server or client modes will propagate configuration changes to its other trunks, even for TLVs it is not able to parse.\nVersion-independent transparent mode: In version 1, a transparent mode switch checks the domain name and the version of a received VTP advertisement before forwarding it. Using version 2, it ignores the version when forwarding the advertisement.\nConsistency checks: With version 2, the switch performs consistency checks of VLAN information, such as names and values, when new information is entered through the CLI or using SNMP. It does not do this when updating with information from a new advertisement.\nObjective:\n\nLayer 2 Technologies -\nSub-Objective:\n\nConfigure and verify trunking -\nReferences:\nCisco > Home > Support > Technology Support > LAN Switching > Virtual LANS/VLAN Trunking Protocol (VLANS/VTP) > Design > Design Technotes >\nUnderstanding VLAN Trunk Protocol (VTP)\nCisco > Cisco IOS LAN Switching Command Reference > udld through vtp v2-mode > vtp","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1577991960,"topic":"5","question_id":222,"exam_id":297,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"EnvGmIkwiRQ2GRq7Yoqz","timestamp":"2019-11-18 12:25:00","choices":{"B":"10 seconds","A":"20 seconds","C":"6 seconds","D":"5 seconds"},"answer":"C","question_id":223,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"With Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) hello timers set at the default interval, a non-edge port can discover that its neighbor is down in 6 seconds. One of the advantages of RSTP over STP is quicker convergence when changes occur in the topology. After a non-edge port fails to receive three Bridge Protocol Data Units\n(BPDUs) from its neighbor, it will assume the neighbor to be down and will age out all information regarding the neighbor.
