You can also add the RADIUS server to another RADIUS server group.\n\nNote \nThe local keyword is not supported (and is not required) when configuring AAA authentication groups because local authentication is the default if remote servers are unreachable. For example, if you configure aaa authentication login default group g1 , local authentication is tried if you are unable to authenticate using AAA group g1.
