In this case, AF42 is typically used to mark streaming video traffic, which requires a moderate amount of bandwidth and a low to moderate level of delay and packet loss tolerance. Therefore, option B (streaming video) is the correct answer.\nWhile AF42 can be used for video conferencing traffic in some cases, it is more commonly used for streaming video traffic. This is because video conferencing traffic requires a higher level of QoS to ensure good call quality, and is typically marked with a higher priority value such as AF41 or EF (Expedited Forwarding) to ensure that it receives the necessary bandwidth and low latency it needs to function well.","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAF42 is a DSCP value that indicates Assured Forwarding (AF) class 4, which provides medium-high drop probability and moderate latency for traffic with a class selector (CS) value of 4 and a drop precedence (DP) value of 2. This type of marking is commonly used for video conferencing traffic. Therefore, the correct answer is D, video conference.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Testme1235","comment_id":"821060","timestamp":"1677285540.0"},{"poster":"Totor27","comment_id":"815225","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/technologies/tk543/tk759/technologies_white_paper0900aecd80295a9b.pdf","timestamp":"1676897040.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"803773","content":"Selected Answer: D\nInteractive-Video traffic should be marked to DSCP AF41; excess videoconferencing traffic can be marked down by a policer to AF42 or AF43.","poster":"Mert_kerna","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1675984860.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1223129","timestamp":"1717325400.0","content":"It says in that link, *Streaming video as dscp 32 or cs4*, B is not correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JoeC716"}],"timestamp":"1674834540.0","poster":"Telcoeric","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI vote B.

The key in this configuration is that the Server Recovery Manager (SRM) service waits 30 minutes for a failed service/server to remain active before an automatic fallback is initiated. Once this 30-minute uptime is established, user sessions are moved back to their homed nodes. The Jabber client then applies the re-log in upper and lower limits for the fallback. \n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/unified-communications/unified-communications-manager-im-presence-service/200958-IM-and-Presence-Server-High-Availability.html","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718544480.0"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"ROZWaWaUAOjhUgRXbo2X","answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"A company wants to enable secure communications with remote users.
