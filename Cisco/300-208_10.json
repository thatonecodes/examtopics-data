Most attacks, such as deauthentication attacks, revert to simply degrading performance by contending with valid clients.\nSpecifically, client MFP encrypts management frames are sent between access points and CCXv5 clients so that both the access points and clients can take preventative action by dropping spoofed class 3 management frames (that is, management frames passed between an access point and a client that is authenticated and associated). Client MFP leverages the security mechanisms defined by IEEE 802.11i to protect the following types of class 3 unicast management frames: disassociation, deauthentication, and QoS (WMM) action. Client MFP protects a client-access point session from the most common type of denial-of-service attack. It protects class 3 management frames by using the same encryption method used for the session’s data frames. If a frame received by the access point or client fails decryption, it is dropped, and the event is reported to the controller.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"672","poster":"damova"}],"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer":"D","question_text":"Which statement about Cisco Management Frame Protection is true?","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"A":"It enables stations to remain in power-save mode, except at specified intervals to receive data from the access point.","B":"It detects spoofed MAC addresses.","C":"It identifies potential RF jamming attacks.","D":"It protects against frame and device spoofing."},"timestamp":"2019-03-08 17:53:00","unix_timestamp":1552063980,"question_id":48,"isMC":true},{"id":"ve6ozP7vQ2aLHgHcTIK1","choices":{"C":"MSCHAPv2","A":"EAP-FAST","B":"EAP-TLS","D":"PEAP"},"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1552055400,"answer":"A","answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"658","timestamp":"1552055400.0","poster":"damova","content":"Trust sec how to guides: Low Impact Mode\n\"It is not currently possible to enforce a dual authentication of both machine and user.
