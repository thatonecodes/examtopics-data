Here's why:\n\nICMP and Redirection:\n\nWhen a device connects to the guest network, the WLC uses ICMP to determine if the device can reach the CWA portal. If ICMP is blocked, the WLC cannot verify the portal's reachability, and redirection will fail.\n\nImportance of ICMP:\n\nAllowing ICMP ensures that the WLC can successfully redirect the device to the CWA portal for authentication.","timestamp":"1739667540.0"}],"question_id":196,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An engineer is configuring wireless guests using Cisco CWA.
