Exploitation, as it refers to the process of taking advantage of a weakness in a system or application in order to carry out some sort of malicious activity.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Action on objectives refers to the specific goals and objectives that an attacker is trying to achieve through their attack. For example, an attacker's objective might be to steal sensitive data, disrupt normal operations, or install malware on a target system.\n\nB. Delivery refers to the method by which an attacker delivers their attack payload (such as malware or other malicious code) to the target system. This might involve phishing emails, drive-by downloads, or other types of social engineering tactics.\n\nD. Installation refers to the process of actually installing the malicious payload onto the target system. This step in the attack process may involve running a malicious program or script, or modifying existing system files to enable continued access for the attacker.","poster":"drdecker100"},{"comment_id":"1230587","timestamp":"1718385300.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. exploitation","poster":"kenprewitt"},{"poster":"msg01","timestamp":"1700203320.0","comment_id":"1073063","content":"Selected Answer: C\nexploitation","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1071701","content":"C.
