The PUT methods are idempotent, meaning that there is no additional effect if they are called more than once with the same input parameters. The GET method is nullipotent, meaning that it can be called zero or more times without making any changes (or that it is a read-only operation).\"\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/aci_multi-site/sw/1x/rest_api_config/b_Cisco_ACI_Multi-Site_REST_Configuration_Guide/b_Cisco_ACI_Multi-Site_REST_Config_Guide_chapter_01.pdf"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe PUT method is used within HTTP when a client wants to update an existing resource on the server. Therefore, the correct option is A: to update a resource on a server.\nThe PUT method is a part of the HTTP protocol that allows a client to update or replace a resource on the server with a new version.

It is typically used for idempotent operations, meaning that making the same request multiple times should have the same result as making it once. However, it's important to note that the PUT method is used for updating resources, not read-only operations or displaying web pages. Option A is incorrect because updating a DNS server typically involves administrative actions and may use different protocols. Option C is incorrect because displaying a web page is a read operation and would usually involve the GET method. Option D is incorrect because the PUT method is not used for read-only operations.","comments":[{"poster":"Rick3390","comment_id":"1025516","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1696500060.0","content":"But B says: \"when a nonidempotent operation is needed\"... but mate, PUT is actually idempotent. It seams to me that you just use chatgpt for this answer without argue with it. Try to tell to chatgpt that PUT is idempotent and then you will see chatgpt correct him self and give you the right option. If we want to talk about the fact that DNS uses a specific DNS protocol to updates, let's talk about it, but for the context of these options and strictly speaking about the HTTP protocol, A would be the most appropriate choice."}],"poster":"raptuz","comment_id":"980194"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe PUT method in HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used to update a resource on the server. Non-idempotent methods are those that can have different outcomes when called multiple times with the same input parameters.

This separation allows for centralized control and management of the network through a controller, making it easier to manage and configure the network.
