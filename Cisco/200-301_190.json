The QoS\nfields that you can mark are IPprecedence and differentiated services code point (DSCP) in Layer 3. The QoS\ngroup is a label local to the system to which you can assign intermediate marking values. You can use the\nQoS group label to determine the egress scheduling.\nDSCP is the equivalent to ToS but it interprets the field differently.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nx-os/nexus9000/101x/configuration/qos/cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-quality-of-service-configuration-guide-101x/m-configuring-marking.pdf\nhttps://linuxreviews.org/Type_of_Service_(ToS)_and_DSCP_Values"}],"poster":"RougePotatoe","content":"It seems like this is correct?
