If a default route is received from an external peer, this route can be redistributed out to another peer following the transit export route control as described earlier in this article. A default route can also be advertised out using a Default Route Leak policy. This policy supports advertising a default route if it is present in the routing table or it always supports advertising a default route. The Default Route Leak policy is configured in the L3Out connection.\n\nWhen creating a Default Route Leak policy, follow these guidelines:\nFor BGP, the Always property is not applicable.
