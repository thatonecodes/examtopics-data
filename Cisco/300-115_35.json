When I attempt create private vlans in my lab on primary server I received: “%Private VLANs can only be configured when VTP is in transparent/off modes in VTP version 1 or 2 and in server/transparent/off modes in VTP version 3 when pruning is turned off”. So we must configure private vlans on SW1 previosly disabling pruning on it.","timestamp":"1574236440.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"You have been asked to install and configure a new switch in a customer network.

(Choose two.)","choices":{"D":"prevents route flapping D","C":"supports IPv4 and IPv6 multicast","A":"supported by RIPv2, OSPF, IS-IS, and EIGRP","B":"uses the FIB table"},"answer":"Explanation","answer_description":"A key element of NSF is packet forwarding. In a Cisco networking device, packet forwarding is provided by Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF). CEF maintains the\nFIB, and uses the FIB information that was current at the time of the switchover to continue forwarding packets during a switchover. This feature reduces traffic interruption during the switchover.\nDuring normal NSF operation, CEF on the active supervisor engine synchronizes its current FIB and adjacency databases with the FIB and adjacency databases on the redundant supervisor engine. Upon switchover of the active supervisor engine, the redundant supervisor engine initially has FIB and adjacency databases that are mirror images of those that were current on the active supervisor engine. For platforms with intelligent modules, the modules will maintain the current forwarding information over a switchover. For platforms with forwarding engines, CEF will keep the forwarding engine on the redundant supervisor engine current with changes that are sent to it by CEF on the active supervisor engine. The modules or forwarding engines will be able to continue forwarding after a switchover as soon as the interfaces and a data path are available.\nAs the routing protocols start to repopulate the RIB on a prefix-by-prefix basis, the updates will cause prefix-by-prefix updates to CEF, which it uses to update the\nFIB and adjacency databases. Existing and new entries will receive the new version (\"epoch\") number, indicating that they have been refreshed. The forwarding information is updated on the modules or forwarding engine during convergence. The supervisor engine signals when the RIB has converged. The software removes all FIB and adjacency entries that have an epoch older than the current switchover epoch. The FIB now represents the newest routing protocol forwarding information.","discussion":[{"comment_id":"43078","poster":"PCMustang","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1580081700.0","content":"RIP V2 not supported nor IPv6 multicast with NSF with SSO, B and D"},{"poster":"diegonamaste","content":"B and D","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"3815","timestamp":"1562707740.0"}],"answers_community":[],"question_id":172,"unix_timestamp":1562707740,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2019-07-09 23:29:00","exam_id":297},{"id":"ndsmTDKSDoj7ujEInXI5","answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"question_text":"You have just created a new VLAN on your network.
