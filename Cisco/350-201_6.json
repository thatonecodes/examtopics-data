Configure affected devices to disable the Finger service.\n\nTCP port 79 is associated with the Finger protocol, which is a service that is commonly used by attackers to gather information about users and assets. The best way to mitigate this attack is to disable the Finger service on affected devices to prevent further reconnaissance by attackers. It is also recommended to investigate the source of the requests on TCP port 79 to identify any potential indicators of compromise and further harden the organization's security posture. - ChatGPT"}],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"A SOC team is investigating a recent, targeted social engineering attack on multiple employees.

In other words, performing the same operation multiple times should have the same effect as performing it only once.

This is a common use case in configuration management and infrastructure as code, where you want to ensure that your infrastructure is in a known, desired state. By using idempotent operations and scripts, you can repeatedly apply the same configuration to a system without worrying about the current state of the system, and be confident that the final state will be the same.","timestamp":"1721563920.0","poster":"ETSec","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"783381"},{"comment_id":"768693","content":"Idempotence, the ability of a given operation to always produce the same result, is an important IaC principle.
