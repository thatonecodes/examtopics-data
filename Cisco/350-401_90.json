Under interface saturation conditions\n\nWhen the WAN interface is experiencing high utilization or saturation, an outbound QoS policy becomes especially useful. In such conditions, the link might be congested, leading to potential packet drops, latency, or degradation of critical traffic performance. Implementing QoS policies allows prioritization and control of traffic, ensuring that important applications or traffic types receive preferential treatment, minimizing the impact of congestion on critical services.\n\nQoS policies help manage and shape traffic leaving the interface, allowing network administrators to allocate bandwidth, prioritize certain types of traffic (such as voice or video), and mitigate congestion effects during periods of high utilization. This helps in maintaining better network performance and ensuring that essential applications or services continue to function optimally even under saturation conditions.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1085216","timestamp":"1701435660.0","poster":"teems5uk"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1054033","content":"B is correct answer","poster":"Haidary","timestamp":"1698272880.0"},{"comment_id":"1025709","upvote_count":"1","content":"b is correct","poster":"orenoren","timestamp":"1696512840.0"},{"content":"I think B is correct for me!!!","comment_id":"925516","poster":"ermanzan","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1686944460.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"905520","poster":"wr4net","timestamp":"1684907820.0","content":"another stupidly phrased question. if the answer is really A, i think the question needs to be phrased like this: under which conditions will an outbound QoS policy be most beneficial. given this, it would be most beneficial if traffic was marked and classified first.
