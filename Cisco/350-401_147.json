During congestion, traffic shaping buffers and queues packets above the committed rate. \nAnswer A describes Policing dropping packets exceeding a certain bitrate. Answer C is describing packet fragmentation when the router receives an IP packet above 1500 bytes. Answer D is sort of describing Random Early Detection (RED) which is a congestion avoidance mechanism that randomly drops packets from RED-enabled interfaces or queues during periods of high congestion. RED tells the packet source to decrease its transmission rate. \nSource: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_conavd/configuration/xe-16/qos-conavd-xe-16-book/qos-conavd-cfg-wred.html#GUID-F7BA5018-770F-48B7-8103-EEF22A7FC479","poster":"ciscokoolaid","comment_id":"751269","timestamp":"1726972740.0","upvote_count":"8"},{"timestamp":"1716479940.0","comment_id":"1216708","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct"},{"timestamp":"1710247440.0","comment_id":"1171686","upvote_count":"1","poster":"andy_doesnt_like_uucp","content":"\"B\" obviously"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"941433","timestamp":"1688360460.0","poster":"techriese"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"690750","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1665382200.0","poster":"cloud29"},{"timestamp":"1654162680.0","poster":"Pudu_vlad","content":"B is correct","comment_id":"610526","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1653766500.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","poster":"rquintana","comment_id":"608515","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1653376620.0","content":"traffic shaping buffers whereas policing drops the traffic","comment_id":"606533","poster":"flash007","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"pepgua","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is correct.","timestamp":"1649724840.0","comment_id":"584463"},{"content":"Strong agree","timestamp":"1632399960.0","poster":"mjunior","comment_id":"450246","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"5","content":"During shaping phase, it uses queues to force some traffic to wait (buffered traffic) to avoid congestion","comment_id":"332219","timestamp":"1618015320.0","poster":"AliMo123"}]},{"id":"3JhT7pzOakXUbTapd9tk","choices":{"C":"MRU","A":"MSS","D":"window size","B":"MTU"},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":735,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1596688440,"answer":"A","exam_id":324,"question_text":"Which TCP setting is tuned to minimize the risk of fragmentation on a GRE/IP tunnel?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/27497-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-70-discussion/","timestamp":"2020-08-06 06:34:00","discussion":[{"content":"The TCP Maximum Segment Size (TCP MSS) defines the maximum amount of data that a host is willing to accept in a single TCP/IP datagram. This TCP/IP datagram might be fragmented at the IP layer. The MSS value is sent as a TCP header option only in TCP SYN segments. Each side of a TCP connection reports its MSS value to the other side. Contrary to popular belief, the MSS value is not negotiated between hosts. The sending host is required to limit the size of data in a single TCP segment to a value less than or equal to the MSS reported by the receiving host.\n\nTCP MSS takes care of fragmentation at the two endpoints of a TCP connection, but it does not handle the case where there is a smaller MTU link in the middle between these two endpoints.
