A DoS attack is where a computer is used to flood a server with TCP and UDP packets, whereas DDoS attack is where multiple systems target a single system with a DoS attack.\n\nA Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a type of cyber attack in which a single system floods a server with a large number of packets, overwhelming the server and causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. The goal of a DoS attack is to prevent legitimate users from accessing the targeted server by consuming its resources or causing it to crash.\n\nA Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a more sophisticated form of a DoS attack. In a DDoS attack, multiple systems, often compromised through malware, are used to flood a single server with packets, overwhelming it and making it unavailable to legitimate users. The goal of a DDoS attack is the same as a DoS attack, but the scale of the attack is much larger and the resources used to launch the attack are distributed across multiple systems.

A DDoS attack, on the other hand, is launched from multiple systems, often a large number of compromised systems that form a botnet, and is intended to overwhelm the targeted system or network with a massive volume of traffic.","comment_id":"849496","upvote_count":"3"}]},{"id":"Wo08ljt3T5bxP0uNd2QZ","question_id":538,"timestamp":"2024-08-26 08:31:00","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
