TLS v1.3 is the latest version of the TLS protocol and provides enhanced security features compared to its predecessors. It includes a stronger key exchange algorithm, improved cipher suites, and better protection against downgrade attacks. Upgrading to TLS v1.3 will help to ensure that clients and servers always negotiate with the most secure protocol version and cryptographic parameters, making it harder for attackers to intercept sensitive information. Installing the latest IIS version may provide some security improvements, but it is not a substitute for upgrading to TLS v1.3.","timestamp":"1692659640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"drdecker100"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A.

It provides authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality for communications over the Internet.
