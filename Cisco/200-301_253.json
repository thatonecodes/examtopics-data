Wi-Fi Direct Client Policy\nWi-Fi Direct is a technology that allowed endpoint devices form WLAN association with each other directly. You can imagine one is an AP and the other one is a client. The most common use case is a mobile phone connecting to a printer, without an infrastructure network (hope you still remember this term). This technology can be a security risk. For example, if a Wi-Fi Direct capable printer is connected to the corporate network, and an attacker connects to the printer using Wi-Fi Direct (may have weaker security), then the printer can be used as a backdoor to the corporate network. That's why the administrator in the question wants to block it.\n \nD. P2P Block Action\nThis feature decides how a WLC handles traffic between two endpoints under the same SSID. If you have two laptops connected to the same SSID, this feature lets you decide whether to isolate them from each other. In this case, the two endpoints communicate with each other through normal WiFi. They each form association with the AP, having nothing to do with Wi-Fi Direct technology.\n \n.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729981380.0","poster":"Joshua25"}],"content":"Selected Answer: A\n.\n \nAnother tricky and nasty Cisco question.\nThe correct answer is A, and not D.\nLet me explain why."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt´s D\n\nThe P2P Block Action should configured to \"Drop\" on the WLC or AP. \nThis setting instructs the WLC or AP to drop any traffic associated with P2P communication, effectively preventing P2P-capable devices from accessing the network through that SSID.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1186992","timestamp":"1711915080.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"spazzix","timestamp":"1692659820.0","comment_id":"986963","content":"P2P block action only stops p2p traffic, not client association onto the WLAN. \n\nWi-Fi Direct Client Policy actually prevents the device from connecting to the WLAN.\n\nIf the question read: \"...block all P2P traffic on the selected SSID.\" then D would be correct\n\nBut by definition, D is only relevant if P2P devices are actually on the WLAN."},{"timestamp":"1690724760.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nNot sure about the full extent of Wi-Fi Direct capabilities but CISCO seems to want you to answer D\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/7-5/configuration-guide/b_cg75/b_cg75_chapter_01001011.pdf","comment_id":"967179","poster":"mda2h","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"913605","poster":"studying_1","timestamp":"1685799480.0","comments":[{"content":"No, this is not a CCNA 200-301 question","timestamp":"1688162580.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"939423","poster":"[Removed]"}],"content":"yes, these are real CCNA questions, study all the questions"},{"comment_id":"939422","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1688162460.0","content":"No, it is not","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1684852740.0","comment_id":"905001","poster":"pikos1","upvote_count":"3","content":"It is really CCNA question?"},{"timestamp":"1684075440.0","poster":"LekkiDee","comment_id":"897617","content":"The correct answer is A.
