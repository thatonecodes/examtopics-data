They would be useless in Court. We preserve the evidence.\n- Evidence in cybersecurity investigations that go to court is used to prove (or disprove) facts that are in dispute, as well as to prove the credibility of disputed facts (in particular, circumstantial evidence or indirect evidence).\n- Digital forensics evidence provides implications and extrapolations that may assist in proving some key fact of the case.\n- Such evidence helps legal teams and the court develop reliable hypotheses or theories as to the committer of the crime (threat actor).\n- The reliability of the evidence is vital to supporting or refuting any hypothesis put forward, including the attribution of threat actors.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724249820.0","poster":"SecurityGuy"},{"poster":"cy_analyst","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"698030","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nCE are correct.","timestamp":"1697616660.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CE\nC.

Phishing attacks typically involve the attacker posing as a trustworthy entity, such as a bank, government agency, or well-known company, to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial information, or personal details. The attacker achieves this by sending an email or message with a link that appears to be legitimate, but in fact leads to a fake website designed to steal the victim's information. In this way, phishing attacks can be used to steal sensitive information and commit fraud or identity theft.","comment_id":"802626","timestamp":"1707431940.0","poster":"drdecker100","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"837390","upvote_count":"2","poster":"mozaki","timestamp":"1710277500.0","content":"A. vishing"}],"comment_id":"771656","poster":"weganos","content":"Why not A?
