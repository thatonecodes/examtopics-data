There is a process built into the Software called “Cluster Reachability” that will perform a latency test to the Video Mesh cluster(s) on the corporate network and to the cloud Webex media resources. At the point of startup, network change, or cache expiration which is every 2 hours, the video endpoint or application will ask Webex for a list of media resources that are candidates for the video endpoint or application to use as a media resource.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/PA/WbxEdge/PAEdgeVMN.pdf.","poster":"isharif","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"908944"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe answer is C. 4 hours.\n\nWebex App endpoints perform a STUN test to calculate round-trip delay time to available media node clusters every 4 hours. This ensures that the endpoints are always using the best possible media node cluster for their connection.\n\nA STUN test is a simple way to measure the round-trip delay time between two endpoints. It works by sending a message from one endpoint to the other and then measuring the time it takes for the message to return. This information can then be used to calculate the round-trip delay time between the two endpoints.\n\nThe round-trip delay time is an important factor in determining the quality of a media connection. A high round-trip delay time can cause audio and video to be choppy and out of sync. By performing a STUN test every 4 hours, Webex App endpoints can ensure that they are always using the best possible media node cluster for their connection. This helps to improve the quality of the media connection and the overall user experience.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"865838","timestamp":"1712699880.0","poster":"Testme1235"}]},{"id":"8l233e8qt0TmD4xyQRRk","question_id":52,"exam_id":321,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/106257-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-145-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1742290980.0","comment_id":"1400053","upvote_count":"1","poster":"iamnoone","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect Answer:\nA.
