Obviously, the problems are connected EXACTLY with the wrong type of network. I will assume that a point-to-point is configured, and the router needs to establish a neighborhood with two on the same interface, so it blinks(point-to-2point).\nSecond. Why only on one spoke(is this a typical and highly scalable role for a router)?
