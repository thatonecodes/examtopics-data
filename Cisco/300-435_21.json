OrganizationID being in the body is strange, however there are other questions on this site whereby OrganizationID is part of the body and that is the correct answer (for example question 96). The reason I think A is the correct answer despite this is because the \"type: combined\" isn't actually an accepted network type. Combined is applied when you list out more than one network type, so for example it could be {\"type\": \"wireless applicance\"}. This is shown in the v0 documentation, which is the api version which this question is referring to:\n\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v0/create-organization-network/\nType: The type of the new network. Valid types are wireless, appliance, switch, systemsManager, camera, cellularGateway, or a space-separated list of those for a combined network."},{"content":"This is a bit confusing, looking at the documentation it kinda looks like none of them?\n\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api/create-organization-network/\n\nThis doesn't have a \"type\" option defined in a schema, instead having a field called \"productTypes\", so that makes them all incorrect. Perhaps this question was written for an older version of the API.\n\nHowever, considering that it has to be between A and D (because the URL in B and C is incorrect), and there isn't the option to put organizationID or anything similar in the request body, I would be most inclined to go with D.
