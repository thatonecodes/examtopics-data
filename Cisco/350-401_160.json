It is a Layer 3 IP switching technology that uses dedicated hardware processors (such as ASICs - Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) to make forwarding decisions based on information in the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and Adjacency Table. CEF offloads packet switching from the main CPU, which allows for faster and more efficient packet forwarding.\n\nIn contrast, process switching involves the main processor (CPU) of the router or switch making forwarding decisions for each packet. This method is less efficient and can result in higher CPU utilization, especially in high-traffic environments. Process switching doesn't rely on dedicated hardware processors for forwarding decisions.\n\nOption C accurately describes the difference between Cisco Express Forwarding and process switching, as CEF uses dedicated hardware processors, while process switching relies on the main CPU. The other options do not accurately describe the key differences between the two switching methods."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694368680.0","content":"Distributed CEF (dCEF) mode - When dCEF is enabled, line cards maintain identical copies of the FIB and adjacency tables.
