These channels are spaced far enough apart in the spectrum to minimize the likelihood of interference between devices operating on different channels.\n\nDSSS is a spread spectrum technique that is used to reduce the impact of interference on wireless communication. It involves spreading the data signal over a wide frequency band by modulating the data with a high-frequency code, or \"chipping\" code. This chipping code is used to spread the signal over a wide frequency range, making it less vulnerable to interference and more resistant to noise.\n\nBy using DSSS and selecting channels 1, 6, and 11, it is possible to limit collisions and improve the performance of the wireless network. It's important to note, however, that other factors, such as the number of devices on the network, the type of devices, and the distance between devices, can also impact the performance of the network and may require additional strategies to optimize network performance.","poster":"Alizadeh","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"747135"},{"timestamp":"1727934360.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRef: Channel Planning Best Practices - Cisco Meraki\n\n“…\n802.11 RF Spectrum\n\n2.4 GHz\n\nThe 802.11 standard defines fourteen 20MHz wide channels in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band.

OSPF neighbors are discovered dynamically through the exchange of hello packets, so configuring the interfaces as OSPF active is not necessary.\n\nIn OSPF, two devices become neighbors when they exchange hello packets on a common subnet. In this case, since the connecting interfaces are already in the same subnet, the next steps are:\n\nConfigure both interfaces with the same area ID (Option B). OSPF routers only become neighbors and exchange information with other routers in the same OSPF area. The area ID can be configured on the interface using the ip ospf area command.\nConfigure the hello and dead timers to match on both sides (Option C). OSPF neighbors must agree on the interval between hello packets and the interval after which an unresponsive neighbor is considered dead.
