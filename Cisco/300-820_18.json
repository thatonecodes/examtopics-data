Specifically, this problem often arises when there is a port mismatch between the Expressway and Cisco UCM.\n\nWhen configuring a SIP trunk for B2B (Business-to-Business) calling, the STEP (SIP Trunk Security Profile) must be properly set up to ensure the correct port and transport settings are used. The SIP trunk may not be able to establish a successful connection if there is a conflict with the default listening port or if there is a need for a non-default port for outgoing SIP connections on Cisco UCM.","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1734982500,"exam_id":321,"timestamp":"2024-12-23 20:35:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","question_id":88,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/153377-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-182-discussion/","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"value other than the default listening port for incoming SIP connections on Cisco UCM","B":"value other than the default listening port for outgoing SIP connections on Cisco UCM","A":"UDP for the outgoing transport type","D":"TCP for the incoming transport type"},"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (67%)","C (33%)"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/300-820/image19.png"]},{"id":"YoSWvQYZyl5UZv8UW0sI","question_text":"In a Webex Video Mesh deployment, where do Cloud-registered Webex Teams clients and devices send signaling traffic for call setup?","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1330925","timestamp":"1734982620.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer B: In a Webex Video Mesh deployment, Cloud-registered Webex Teams clients and devices send their signaling traffic directly to the Webex cloud for call setup, even if a Video Mesh node is involved in the media plane for the call.","poster":"jonycakes"}],"unix_timestamp":1734982620,"timestamp":"2024-12-23 20:37:00","exam_id":321,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","question_id":89,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/153378-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-183-discussion/","answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"to a remote Video Mesh node","A":"to a local Video Mesh node","C":"to an Expressway-E server","B":"directly to the Webex cloud"},"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[]},{"id":"i9JUZhWlOnf8MQj6mbDf","timestamp":"2024-11-22 12:41:00","choices":{"D":"Go to Configuration > Unified Communications > MRA > HTTP allow list > Editable inbound rules to view, create, modify, or delete HTTP allow list rules.","C":"Go to Configuration > MRA > Editable Inbound rules to view, create, modify, or delete HTTP allow list rules.","A":"Go to Configuration > Unified Communications > HTTP allow list > Editable inbound rules to view.","B":"Go to Configuration > MRA > HTTP allow rules > Editable inbound rules to view, create, modify, or delete HTTP allow list rules."},"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/151824-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-186-discussion/","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1734886140.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.\nFrom the 'Configuration' dropdown you can select Unified Communications>HTTP Allow List>Editable inbound rules\nB&C are wrong because there is no 'MRA' option from the 'Configuration' menu dropdown\nD is wrong because there is no 'MRA' option after selecting 'Unified Communications' from the 'Configuration' menu dropdown.","poster":"jonycakes","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1330468"},{"poster":"mrcollab","comment_id":"1316258","upvote_count":"2","content":"A is correct.","timestamp":"1732275660.0"}],"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1732275660,"answer_description":"","exam_id":321,"question_text":"A new set of Expressway-C and Expressway-E is deployed and was configured for Mobile and Remote Access with basic settings.
