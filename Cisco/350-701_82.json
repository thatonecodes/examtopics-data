In this guide, the new Cisco Stealthwatch Security Analytics (SSA) service within \nCisco DNA Center v 1.3.1 is used exclusively for provisioning ETA and FNF. The SSA service can also be used to remove ETA \nand FNF configuration from a previously provisioned device.\nNote that although the Cisco SSA application is the preferred method for provisioning ETA and FNF in Cisco \nDNA Center1.3.1 and later, it is still possible to use templates as documented in the previous guides and \ncontained in the appendix of the new ETA for Cisco SD-Access Deployment Guide. However, when using \nDesign \n12\ntemplates, there is no support for provisioning border routers in the Cisco SD-Access fabric.
