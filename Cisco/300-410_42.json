When the BFD process is started, no entries are created in the adjacency database, in other words, no BFD control packets are sent or received. BFD echo mode, which is supported in BFD Version 1 for Cisco IOS 12.4(9)T, is enabled by default. BFD echo packets are sent and received in addition to BFD control packets.

OSPF uses this state only if neighbors are statically configured with neighbor command. In this situation, it does not have to discover them dynamically. As it already knows the neighbors, it will use unicast instead of multicast in this state.\n\nOnce neighborship is built, OSPF uses hello packets as keep alive. If a router does not receive a hello packet from any particular neighbor in dead interval, it will change its state to down from full. After changing the state it will make an effort to contact the neighbor by sending Hello packets. This effort is made in Attempt state.\n\nBasically Both Init and Attempt states describe similar situation where one router has sent a hello packet and waiting for response.","poster":"SujanSikrikar","comment_id":"824633"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is corerct","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1721589300.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1252666"},{"poster":"inteldarvid","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA correct:\nThis state is only valid for manually configured neighbors in an NBMA environment.

This reduces the number of iBGP peers in each sub-AS and allows for better scaling of the iBGP network.\n\nRoute Reflectors: Route Reflectors provide an alternative to the full iBGP mesh requirement by allowing iBGP speakers to form a partial mesh instead of a full mesh. Route Reflectors serve as a central point for iBGP speakers to exchange routing information, and iBGP speakers only need to peer with the Route Reflector instead of forming a full mesh with all iBGP speakers in the network.
