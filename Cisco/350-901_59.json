Application becomes more flexible and extendable. C. Code reusability increases.\n\nModularity in software design results in an application that is more flexible and extendable. This means that modules can be added, removed, or modified without affecting the functionality of other parts of the application, which makes the application easier to maintain and scale.\n\nCode reusability is also a significant advantage of modular design. When code is broken down into modules, those modules can be reused in other parts of the application or even in other applications. This not only speeds up development time but also leads to improved consistency and less redundancy in the code base.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1106148","timestamp":"1703605380.0","poster":"1a63556"}],"timestamp":"2023-12-26 16:43:00","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"BC","question_text":"A software developer is designing a new application to collect data from the network and feed the data into a custom dashboard.

Use authorization codes to access protected resources when approved.\n\nThe three-legged OAuth2 authorization code grant flow generally involves these steps:\n\nThe client (usually a web browser) requests authorization from the resource owner (usually by directing them to an authorization server with a request for access).\nOnce the resource owner authorizes the request, the authorization server redirects the client back to the application with an authorization code.\nThe client then exchanges this authorization code for an access token by making a request to the authorization server.\nThe access token is then used by the client to access the protected resources.
