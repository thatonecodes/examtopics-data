The client sends DNS queries to the Cisco Umbrella global network, where the queries are filtered and either allowed or blocked based on the organization's security policies.\n\nThe Cisco Umbrella roaming client also provides visibility into the security posture of the devices, regardless of their location. This allows organizations to detect and respond to threats in real-time, regardless of where the device is located.\n\nTherefore, option C, by using the Cisco Umbrella roaming client, is the correct answer.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"sull3y","comment_id":"849909","timestamp":"1727244180.0"},{"poster":"Emlia1","comment_id":"738243","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717778640.0","content":"C..............."},{"timestamp":"1716094740.0","content":"Answer is B. \n\nRoaming client will modify DNS value to 127.0.0.1 and bind itself to all NIC adapters to listen to port 53 traffic.

The SPAN or mirror port allows for traffic to be copied from other ports on the switch. This function provides the system visibility within the network without being in the flow of network traffic. When you configure the FTD in a passive deployment, the FTD cannot take certain actions such as blocking or shaping traffic. Passive interfaces receive all traffic unconditionally. and no traffic received on these interfaces is retransmitted. Encapsulated remote switched port analyzer (ERSPAN) interfaces allow you to monitor traffic from source ports distributed over multiple switches, and uses GRE to encapsulate the traffic. ERSPAN interfaces are only allowed when the FTD is in routed firewall mode.","timestamp":"1722557520.0"},{"poster":"ITgeeek","content":"The reference link provided is broken.
