Therefore, the correct answer is option B. By deploying the firewall in routed mode with access control policies, the engineer can configure the firewall to route traffic between the DMZs and the internal network based on their unique private IP subnet ranges. The access control policies can be used to enforce security policies to control which traffic is allowed between the DMZs and the internal network.
