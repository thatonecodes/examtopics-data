This allows arguments to be passed to the entry point, i.e., docker run <image> -d will pass the -d argument to the entry point. You can override the ENTRYPOINT instruction using the docker run --entrypoint flag.\n\nThe shell form prevents any CMD or run command line arguments from being used, but has the disadvantage that your ENTRYPOINT will be started as a subcommand of /bin/sh -c, which does not pass signals. This means that the executable will not be the container’s PID 1 - and will not receive Unix signals - so your executable will not receive a SIGTERM from docker stop <container>.\nOnly the last ENTRYPOINT instruction in the Dockerfile will have an effect.\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint","timestamp":"1725740160.0","poster":"designated"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"446806","content":"I say A because ENTRYPOINT is better suited to run the same executable every time (in combo with CMD).
