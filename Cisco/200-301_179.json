Shaping is applied to flows that receive preferential treatment using LLQ. However, LLQs may result in flows which utilizes more BW than the committed BW over the link (e.g. to ISP). At the other side (ISP) packets can be dropped due to exceeding BW limits (Policing). Hence, to avoid packets dropping by policers at the other end we limit BW from the exit side (Shaping). Of course, shaping results in other less prioritised flows getting higher BW, so some tend to choose B.

A DHCP client is a host, such as a computer or network device, that is configured to obtain an IP address automatically from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. When a DHCP client is connected to a network, it sends a broadcast request for an IP address to the DHCP server. The DHCP server then assigns an available IP address to the client and also provides other configuration information such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses. This allows the client to communicate on the network without requiring manual IP address configuration.","comment_id":"848328"},{"content":"A is a DNS client.\nB is a DHCP client","poster":"Dutch012","comment_id":"817747","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1692695220.0"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":895,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/70591-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-548-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"a host that is configured to request an IP address automatically","D":"a router that statically assigns IP addresses to hosts.","C":"a server that dynamically assigns IP addresses to hosts.","A":"a workstation that requests a domain name associated with its IP address"},"question_text":"What is a DHCP client?","exam_id":288,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2022-01-26 06:17:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":288,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco","numberOfQuestions":1395,"isMCOnly":false,"name":"200-301","isBeta":false},"currentPage":179},"__N_SSP":true}
