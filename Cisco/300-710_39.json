Realms in the FMC is all about Active Directory integration, but when you configure Realms and also integrate Cisco ISE, it allows IP addresses to be associated with users.

In my book, as it stands, it can be any. Although I'd be leaning more towards D based on the following:\n\"A realm consists of one or more LDAP or Microsoft Active Directory servers that share the same directory credentials. You must configure a realm to perform user and user group queries, user control, or to configure an authoritative identity source.
