Write a test: Write a test that tests for the new class or function that you want to add to your code. Think about the class name and structure you will need in order to call the new capability that doesn’t exist yet—and nothing more.\nStep 2. Test fails: Of course, the test fails because you haven’t written the part that works yet. The idea here is to think about the class or function you want and test for its intended output. This initial test failure shows you exactly where you should focus your code writing to get it to pass. This is like starting with your end state in mind, which is the most effective way to accomplish a goal.\nStep 3. Write some code: Write only the code needed to make the new function or class successfully pass. This is about efficiency and focus.\nStep 4. Test passes: The test now passes, and the code works.\nStep 5. Refactor: Clean up the code as necessary, removing any test stubs or hard-coded variables used in testing. Refine the code, if needed, for speed.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"designated"}],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"OVAoMgXhO84ljrLjPJkb","exam_id":291,"choices":{"A":"{'color': 'green', 'items': ['kiwi', 'grape']}","B":"['kiwi', 'grape']","D":"kiwi","C":"lettuce"},"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nA REST API returns this JSON output for a GET HTTP request, which has been assigned to a variable called `vegetables`.
