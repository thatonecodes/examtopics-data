It provides both encryption and data integrity by combining the Counter Mode (CTR) for encryption and the Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) for data integrity.\n\nWPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) and WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) are the latest and most commonly used wireless security standards. Both WPA3 and WPA2 support the use of CCMP as the encryption and integrity protocol for securing wireless communications.\n\nOn the other hand, WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an older and weaker security standard that uses the RC4 encryption algorithm, not CCMP.
