One option is to use traditional Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN) local-mode configurations over-the-top as a non-native service. In this mode, the SD-Access fabric is simply a transport network for the wireless traffic, which can be useful during migrations to transport CAPWAP-tunneled endpoint traffic from the APs to the WLCs.","upvote_count":"12","poster":"siteoforigin"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"4","content":"THANKS!!!!\nCisco Unified Wireless Network wireless OTT\nIn this case traditional wireless is carried on top of the SD-Access fabric.
