An example is a Cisco switch authenticating and authorizing administrative access to the switchs IOS CLI. The switch is the TACACS+ client, and Cisco Secure ACS is the server.\nTACACS+ communication between the client and server uses different message types depending on the function. In other words, different messages may be used for authentication than are used for authorization and accounting. Another very interesting point to know is that TACACS+ communication will encrypt the entire packet.\nReference: http://www.networkworld.com/article/2838882/radius-versus-tacacs.html","answer":"ABC","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":294,"isMC":true,"question_text":"In which three ways does the TACACS protocol differ from RADIUS?
