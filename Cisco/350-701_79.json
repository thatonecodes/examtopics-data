While it can be an effective tool for preventing employees from receiving phishing emails, it does not provide the same level of protection as Umbrella and FTD. Umbrella is a cloud-based security service that provides protection against phishing and other types of internet-based threats by blocking access to known malicious domains and IP addresses, and FTD is a next-generation firewall that integrates advanced threat protection capabilities, such as intrusion prevention (IPS), advanced malware protection (AMP), and URL filtering. These two solutions focus on the network level, providing the first line of defense and blocking the phishing website before it reaches the employees.
