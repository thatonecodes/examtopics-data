One of its significant enhancements is support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP). This allows the operating system to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, improving performance and scalability by distributing processes across multiple processors."}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"NpBu9DydVxTPhMZVFEih","timestamp":"2023-10-30 01:48:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"picho707","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is \"C\".\nDirectly from the Cisco Press Wedbsite:\n\nFacility backup uses label stacking to reroute multiple protected TE LSPs using a single backup TE LSP.\n\nhttps://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=520184&seqNum=4","comment_id":"1259382","timestamp":"1722516960.0"},{"poster":"hicah14861","comment_id":"1190891","comments":[{"timestamp":"1713772380.0","content":"The problem with \"A\" as that it says \"a bypass LSP FOR EACH protected LSP\" .
