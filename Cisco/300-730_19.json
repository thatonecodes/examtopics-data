To make a bookmark or URL list available for clientless SSLVPN users on a Cisco ASA, it needs to be configured under the \"webvpn (group-policy)\" section. The \"webvpn (group-policy)\" configuration is specific to a particular group policy on the Cisco ASA. By configuring the bookmark or URL list under the appropriate group policy, you can control which clientless SSLVPN users have access to specific bookmarks or URLs. The \"webvpn (global configuration)\" section, on the other hand, is used for global configuration settings that apply to all clientless SSLVPN users. It defines the overall behavior and settings of the SSLVPN functionality on the Cisco ASA but does not handle the specific bookmarks or URL lists. Therefore, to make a bookmark or URL list available for clientless SSLVPN users, ensure that it is configured under the relevant group policy within the \"webvpn (group-policy)\" section.","timestamp":"1719972480.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kylesam2017","comment_id":"1112480"},{"content":"correct answer is C","upvote_count":"2","poster":"jayzo","comment_id":"1068240","timestamp":"1715466120.0"},{"comment_id":"1016798","poster":"Acnaris","content":"Selected Answer: C\nYou can specify a list of URLs to appear on the clientless SSL VPN home page for a group policy.
