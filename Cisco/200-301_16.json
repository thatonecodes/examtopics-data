This is because endpoints are devices like computers, phones, and servers that connect to the network. The key distinction here is that the endpoint itself connects to the network—it doesn’t perform the role of networking infrastructure (like switches or routers do).

This functionality falls under the broader category of connecting client devices to a network, which was represented by option B in the previous response.\n\nEndpoints encompass a wide range of devices, including user devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets. These devices can be used by users to perform various tasks, such as recording data, accessing applications, and communicating with other devices or servers on the network.\n\nWhen users record data on their devices, such as creating documents, taking photos, or capturing videos, they can then transmit this data over the network to a file server for storage, sharing, or backup purposes.
