If the target system/endpoint is configured to not use encryption, then the call will be dropped.\n • Force unencrypted: All media must be unencrypted. If the target system/endpoint is configured to use encryption, then the call may be dropped; if it is configured to use Best effort then the call will fall back to unencrypted media.\n • Best effort: Use encryption if available, otherwise fall back to unencrypted media.\n • Auto: No specific media encryption policy is applied by the Expressway. Media encryption is purely dependent on the target system/endpoint requests. This is the default behavior and is equivalent to how the Expressway operated before this feature was introduced.\n Encryption policy (any encryption setting other than Auto) is applied to a call by routing it through a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) hosted on the Expressway.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"790208","timestamp":"1706410500.0"},{"content":"Should be D","poster":"chacthor","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"547351","timestamp":"1676406600.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Available modes are \"Force encrypted, Force unencrypted, Auto and Best Effort\"\nSo the answer is option D - \"Force unencrypted\".","timestamp":"1638685020.0","poster":"Abhishek1610","comment_id":"235451"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Available modes are \"Force encrypted, Force unencrypted, Auto and Best Effort\".","comment_id":"156954","poster":"BangBang86","timestamp":"1628829120.0"}],"choices":{"D":"force unencrypted","C":"Triple Data Encryption Standard","A":"Advanced Encryption Standard","B":"IPsec"},"topic":"1","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[]},{"id":"piwhVeVzgp6DSq4SHVSg","question_text":"An organization wants to enable a Cisco Webex connector to synchronize all employees automatically with Cisco Webex instead of using a manual list.\nWhere is the Webex Hybrid Directory Service configured?","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/38873-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-80-discussion/","exam_id":321,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":162,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1607159220,"timestamp":"2020-12-05 10:07:00","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Install the Cisco Express Connector and configure the device in Cisco Unified Communications Manager under Cisco Unified Serviceability and add the service in Webex Control Hub.","C":"Enable the directory service on Cisco Expressway Edge for Office 365 or Cisco Expressway Core for internal Active Directory and add the service in Webex Control Hub.","A":"Install Cisco Directory Connector on a Microsoft Windows Domain server and configure the software and Webex Control Hub.","B":"Enable the directory service in Cisco Unified Communications Manager under Cisco Unified Serviceability and add the service in Webex Control Hub."},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722181920.0","content":"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Collaboration/hybrid/12x/hybcvd/directory.html","poster":"Collabinski","comment_id":"790891","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1701742860.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A, but it's misleading as the server does NOT have to be a domain controller....just a member of the domain.","comments":[{"content":"i think that is what was meant by domain server.","poster":"Omitted","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702691760.0","comment_id":"617007"}],"poster":"TestingAAgain","comment_id":"611633"},{"poster":"Abhishek1610","content":"CDC is installed on Windows domain","comment_id":"235536","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1654412820.0"}],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"yIBHn8ZEp9OA8k6akUEb","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722182220.0","content":"Figure 2.
