Permissions are applied on a user and group level. For example, the owner of a file can grant read, write, and execute permissions to the users and groups they choose.\nRBAC is a type of access control that defines permissions based on a user's role. Roles are assigned to users based on their job function or responsibilities. For example, a user with the role of \"employee\" might have read-only access to all files, while a user with the role of \"manager\" might have read, write, and execute permissions to all files.","poster":"Faio"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724087400.0","comment_id":"985337","poster":"SecurityGuy","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDAC (Discretionary Access Control):\nObject Owner determines permissions and \"provides users a certain amount of control\" over their data, it is a least restrictive model.\n>> I would go on A on this one.\n\nB.

They consider factors such as the criticality of the affected system, the sensitivity of the data, and the potential for further spread or damage.
