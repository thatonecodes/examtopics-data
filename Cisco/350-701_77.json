When a switch receives a spoofed ARP response on a trusted interface, it will check the IP-to-MAC address binding table to see if the source IP address and source MAC address match. If they do not match, the switch will drop the packet as it is determined to be a spoofed packet. This helps to protect the network from man-in-the-middle attacks and other ARP spoofing-based attacks.","timestamp":"1705686180.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1705686480.0","content":"sorry,the answer should be B..as per below Packets arriving on trusted interfaces bypass all DAI validation checks and are forwarded without validation by the switch","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"781426","poster":"sull3y"}],"poster":"sull3y"}],"exam_id":327,"question_id":382,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/88824-exam-350-701-topic-1-question-462-discussion/","question_text":"A switch with Dynamic ARP Inspection enabled has received a spoofed ARP response on a trusted interface.
