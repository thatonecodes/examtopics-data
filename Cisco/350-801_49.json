By randomly dropping packets prior to periods of high congestion, RED tells the packet source to decrease its transmission rate. WRED drops packets selectively based on IP precedence. Edge routers assign IP precedences to packets as they enter the network. (WRED is useful on any output interface where you expect to have congestion. However, WRED is usually used in the core routers of a network, rather than at the edge.) WRED uses these precedences to determine how it treats different types of traffic.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_conavd/configuration/xe-16/qos-conavd-xe-16-book/qos-conavd-cfg-wred.html","comment_id":"762689"},{"comment_id":"733142","poster":"Mert_kerna","timestamp":"1717272840.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn fact, RED (random early detection) randomly drops packets.

When calculating the number of calls that can be made using location-based call admission control (CAC) in Cisco UCM, it is important to consider the amount of bandwidth used by the calls. The amount of bandwidth used by a call is the sum of the media traffic and signaling traffic, including any IP packet headers. The limit of bandwidth allowed is typically defined as a total amount for all calls, and the number of calls that can be made is calculated by dividing the total amount of available bandwidth by the amount of bandwidth used by each call.

In the calculation, signaling is not considered. \nC. is incorrect. CAC includes always overhead. For audio codecs, the overhead consist in the ip headers. In video, the overhead consist in just to add a 20%. Calculation of overhead is different in audio and video, however, an overhead is always considered.\nD. Video codecs do not have a specific set bandwidth rate to them like audio codecs. You can place a video call using 480p30 resolution at 384 kbps or at 2 Mbps. However, using a higher codec can provided better efficiency and thus consume less bandwidth. For this reason in the regions, the calls are not defined by codecs, rather by per-call bandwidth.\nB. Is correct. The amount of bandwidth is the sum of the calls including the media traffic consumed in function of the codec, plus the headers.\nReference: \"CCNP and CCIE Collaboration Core CLCOR 350-801 Official Cert Guide\"\nChapter 18: Cisco Unified Communications Manager Call Admission Control (CAC).","timestamp":"1740972540.0"},{"timestamp":"1722970320.0","poster":"papahawaii","upvote_count":"2","content":"Question above this literally talks about the 20%, thus why is this question not answered correctly.","comment_id":"800260"},{"timestamp":"1722424800.0","poster":"Panda_man","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think should be A here","comment_id":"794204"},{"content":"A correct?","timestamp":"1717065180.0","comment_id":"731456","poster":"wwisp3422112","upvote_count":"3"}],"choices":{"C":"A limit of 900 kb is the total amount of bandwidth used for the sum of calls.
