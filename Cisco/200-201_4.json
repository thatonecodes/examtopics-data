ISO files are commonly used to back up disc contents or distribute software/data on discs.\n\n- CDFS format - CDFS stands for CD File System. It's a file system used to organize files and metadata on CD and DVD discs. \n\n- So in this case, we have an ISO file, which contains a full disc image, and that disc image uses the CDFS format internally.\n\nThe CDFS format is used by Windows natively to organize CD/DVD discs. ISO files are a common format used across Windows, Mac and Linux to back up and distribute disc contents.\n\nTherefore, the ISO file being in CDFS format implies it is an image of a CD that was originally copied or created on a Windows system, using the native CDFS file system.\n\nThe answer is D - data from a CD copied using Windows.","poster":"thisguyfucks"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is B.. linux","timestamp":"1701577260.0","poster":"sheyshey","comment_id":"1086581"},{"content":"The answer is D. \nCDFS is a file system for CD-ROMs that was developed by Microsoft.
