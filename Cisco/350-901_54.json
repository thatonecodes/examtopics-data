I'm leaning towards A, because B doesn't specify how the environment variable is stored, and whether such storage is secure. For example, storing on disk or in your git repo in a .env file is not secure. Typing it in by hand like: export DB_PWD=\"pass\" and then using Python import os and then DB_PWD=os.getenv(\"DB_PWD\") still leaves it in RAM until you exit your shell after running the Python script. Probably the best answer is using an API call to an on-prem or cloud-based secret manager within your code, and using the retrieved value.","comment_id":"1044371","poster":"kirrim","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1688307600.0","content":"I think I agree with the answer, although I'm not certain","poster":"ThePokemonNuzlockingMaster","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"940964"}]}],"exam":{"name":"350-901","numberOfQuestions":383,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Cisco","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"id":329,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":54},"__N_SSP":true}
