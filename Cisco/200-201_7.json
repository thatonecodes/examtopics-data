In the context of the given scenario, tunneling is used to encapsulate traffic from multiple devices within the IP header of a single IP address.\nOption D, \"NAT\" (Network Address Translation), involves translating IP addresses between different networks.

Design criteria for reviewing alerts.\n\nWhen a system is overwhelmed with alerts, indicating a high number of both false positives (incorrectly identifying benign events as threats) and false negatives (failing to detect actual threats), it is important to establish criteria for reviewing alerts. This allows for a more efficient and effective handling of the alerts and helps prioritize the investigation of genuine security incidents.\n\nDesigning criteria for reviewing alerts involves creating rules or thresholds that filter and prioritize alerts based on their severity, likelihood of being true positives, or other relevant factors. By setting criteria, analysts can focus their efforts on alerts that have a higher probability of being legitimate threats, reducing the time and resources wasted on false positives and irrelevant alerts.","poster":"Topsecret"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1665007020.0","comment_id":"687258","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. is correct answer \nTraditional intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) devices need to be tuned to avoid false positives and false negatives.","poster":"Eng_ahmedyoussef"}],"answers_community":["A (50%)","B (50%)"],"question_id":32,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-09-05 23:53:00","question_text":"Which action should be taken if the system is overwhelmed with alerts when false positives and false negatives are compared?","unix_timestamp":1630878780},{"id":"Ft9IfQiEZZscfOtUSqcU","answer_description":"","question_id":33,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/84450-exam-200-201-topic-1-question-129-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1665007140,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","choices":{"A":"True positives affect security as no alarm is raised when an attack has taken place, while false positives are alerts raised appropriately to detect and further mitigate them.","D":"False-positive alerts are detected by confusion as potential attacks, while true positives are attack attempts identified appropriately.","B":"True-positive alerts are blocked by mistake as potential attacks, while False-positives are actual attacks identified as harmless.","C":"False positives alerts are manually ignored signatures to avoid warnings that are already acknowledged, while true positives are warnings that are not yet acknowledged."},"discussion":[{"poster":"AhmedAbdalla","comment_id":"1026961","content":"False-positive alerts are detected by confusion as potential attacks, while true positives are attack attempts identified appropriately.\n\nIn the context of security alerts and detection systems, a \"false positive\" occurs when an alert is triggered for something that is not actually a security threat, potentially leading to confusion and wasted resources.
