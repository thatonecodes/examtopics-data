Device compliance ensures that devices within an organization's network adhere to the required security standards and policies, including patch management.\n\nBy checking the compliance status of devices, organizations can identify if the devices have the latest OS patches installed. This is crucial for maintaining a secure network environment, as OS patches often address known vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. Regularly verifying the latest patches helps mitigate the risk of exploitation and potential security breaches.\n\nOption C, providing attribute-driven policies, refers to the capability of tailoring security policies based on specific attributes of the devices or users, but it is not a specific benefit of device compliance.","timestamp":"1721010360.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"951952"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\namswer C\n\novides a rule-based, ATTRIBUTE-DRIVEN POLICY model for flexible and business-relevant access control policies.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/data_sheet_c78-656174.html","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720629180.0","poster":"Cokamaniako","comment_id":"948269"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAlready explained, the right one is C","upvote_count":"1","poster":"DWizard","comment_id":"942468","timestamp":"1720077420.0"},{"timestamp":"1716475560.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"905006","poster":"SegaMasterSystemAdmin","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer"},{"poster":"Jessie45785","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI work with ISE on daily basis and @NikoNiko gots a point here, most important feture of ISE is:\n\nProvides a rule-based, ATTRIBUTE-DRIVEN POLICY model for flexible and business-relevant access control policies.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/data_sheet_c78-656174.html","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"868058","timestamp":"1712910480.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705922220.0","comment_id":"784217","poster":"ddev3737","content":"I agree after all with NikoNiko"},{"comment_id":"717270","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699875060.0","content":"B & d both near correct but B is the answer as why to do compliance check ???
