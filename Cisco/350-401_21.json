Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nEfficient scalability refers to the ability of a system to quickly and easily increase its capacity in response to changing demand. In a cloud infrastructure deployment, this is achieved through the use of elastic resources, which can be automatically provisioned and deprovisioned in response to changes in workload. This allows cloud users to easily scale up or down their infrastructure as needed, without having to worry about the cost and complexity of purchasing and configuring new hardware.\n\nIn contrast, an on-premises deployment typically requires organizations to purchase and install new hardware to scale their infrastructure. This process can be time-consuming and expensive, and may not be feasible for organizations with limited resources or a rapidly-changing workload."},{"timestamp":"1716482040.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","comment_id":"1216744","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]"},{"timestamp":"1710248040.0","content":"B,C,D imho","comment_id":"1171695","upvote_count":"1","poster":"andy_doesnt_like_uucp"},{"comment_id":"969661","timestamp":"1690950240.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"\"D\" is the answer because Cloud option quickly produces the needed and sufficient.
