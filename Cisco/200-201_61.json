An attack surface is the total sum of the vulnerabilities in a given system that is accessible to an attacker. The attack surface describes different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out of the system. For example, your operating system and web browser could both need security patches. They are each vulnerable to attacks. Together, they create an attack surface the threat actor can exploit.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1731400080.0"},{"timestamp":"1730881200.0","comment_id":"890526","poster":"alhamry","upvote_count":"2","content":"The best answer is \"B. the sum of all paths for data into and out of the environment.\"\n\nAn attack surface refers to the sum of all paths through which an attacker can gain access to a system or environment to carry out an attack. This includes not only the hardware and software components of the system but also the interfaces, networks, and protocols that allow data to enter and leave the system.\n\nA vulnerability, on the other hand, is an exploitable weakness or flaw in a system or its design that can be used by an attacker to compromise the system's security and gain unauthorized access. Vulnerabilities can exist in hardware, software, network configurations, or even in human behavior.\n\nIn summary, while a vulnerability is a specific weakness or flaw that can be exploited by an attacker, an attack surface is the sum of all possible avenues an attacker can use to gain access to a system or environment and carry out an attack."},{"comment_id":"814257","poster":"drdecker100","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

If the attacker can get the user to reveal information, it is much easier for the attacker to cause harm rather than use some other method of reconnaissance. This could be done through email or misdirection of web pages, which results in the user clicking something that leads to the attacker gaining information. Social engineering can also be done in person by an insider or outside entity or over the phone.","poster":"anonymous1966"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1630750560,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-09-04 12:16:00","exam_id":287,"question_id":305}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"id":287,"isImplemented":true,"name":"200-201","provider":"Cisco","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":322},"currentPage":61},"__N_SSP":true}
