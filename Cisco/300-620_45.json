If no traffic is received from a local endpoint during a certain period (75% of the aging interval), the ACI leaf switch performs host tracking by sending three ARP requests to verify the endpoint's presence.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739989.html"},{"timestamp":"1739176560.0","comment_id":"1354346","poster":"samfab","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFor local endpoints that have IP addresses associated with them, leaf switches perform Host Tracking at 75 percent of the aging interval if no packets from the same IP address was received during the interval.
