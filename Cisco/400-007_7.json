For multimedia traffic, precise control over forwarding paths ensures that real-time data (like video or voice) is prioritized to minimize latency, jitter, and packet loss.\nQoE estimation (B) is important for evaluating user experience but is more of a monitoring task rather than a design concern.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"i9t6","comment_id":"1300033"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhen designing a network for transmitting multimedia traffic using an SDN-based model, an architect should consider the aspect of QoE estimation (Quality of Experience).\n\nQoE estimation refers to the measurement and assessment of the perceived quality of multimedia content by end users. In the context of SDN, it involves evaluating the quality of multimedia traffic in real-time and making decisions based on that assessment to ensure optimal user experience.","timestamp":"1685692080.0","poster":"J_W","comment_id":"912614"},{"timestamp":"1683830340.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"895303","poster":"bdp123","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8282058"}],"unix_timestamp":1683830340,"answer_description":""},{"id":"A5AerfCBKf1L5dFbDyVq","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_text":"A customer has a functional requirement that states HR systems within a data center should be segmented from other systems that reside in the same data center and same VLAN.

One such problem is the possibility of creating microloops.\n\nA microloop is a loop that is created between two or more devices in a network. Microloops can cause traffic to circulate between the devices indefinitely, which can lead to performance problems and even network outages.\n\nMicroloops can be created during reconvergence if PBR is not configured correctly. For example, if a PBR rule is configured to route traffic over a link that is down, the traffic may be looped back to the source device.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1017816","poster":"cryptotafkar","timestamp":"1695735900.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer should be A\n\nPolicy-based routing adds flexibility and control that other routing techniques do not, however.
