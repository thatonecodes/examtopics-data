Backdoor attacks let attackers gain control of system resources, perform network reconnaissance, and install different types of malwares. Backdoors can be installed in both software and hardware. There have been many high-profile backdoor attacks in recent years, including the SolarWinds attack in 2020, which was suspected to be carried out by nation-state actors. Backdoor attacks can be prevented by using strong passwords, keeping software up to date, and using security software. BTW, any type of malware can potentially be used to send spam."},{"timestamp":"1730692800.0","comment_id":"1306762","content":"as the name itself implies.","poster":"3040636","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nitÂ´s A","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712017260.0","comment_id":"1187749"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708420440.0","comment_id":"1154592","content":"Selected Answer: A\nNice piece on Backdoors/ Trojans\n\nhttps://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topics/general-security/malware-spotlight-what-are-backdoors/","poster":"JulesAZ"},{"comment_id":"820195","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1677222660.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt's A","poster":"lucantonelli93"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Rynurr","comment_id":"817069","timestamp":"1677007980.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIndeed, \"A\" is the correct answer."}],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1676385960,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99172-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-977-discussion/","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"malicious code with the main purpose of downloading other malicious code","A":"malicious code that is installed onto a computer to allow access by an unauthorized user","C":"malicious code that infects a user machine and then uses that machine to send spam","B":"malicious program that is used to launch other malicious programs"},"question_text":"What is the definition of backdoor malware?","timestamp":"2023-02-14 15:46:00","answer_ET":"A","question_id":1371,"exam_id":288,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"A2tERbjsRuKdBA4Vgkho","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-02-18 16:31:00","exam_id":288,"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"poster":"sdmejia01","timestamp":"1692365460.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect answer is B. https://www.swascan.com/wi-fi-security/","comment_id":"813206"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1727828520.0","comment_id":"1187750","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]"}],"answer":"B","question_id":1372,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"increased security and requirement of a complex configuration","D":"optional Protected Management Frame negotiation","A":"backward compatibility with WPA and WPA2","B":"safeguards against brute force attacks with SAE"},"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1676734260,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_text":"What does WPA3 provide in wireless networking?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99847-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-978-discussion/"},{"id":"WMAGcdYUjLm8eZAUTwR5","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_id":1373,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"topic":"1","exam_id":288,"choices":{"A":"service password-encryption","C":"enable secret","D":"password-encrypt","B":"enable password-encryption"},"unix_timestamp":1676734260,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect answer is A. https://community.cisco.com/t5/other-network-architecture-subjects/service-password-encryption-command/td-p/269324","upvote_count":"8","poster":"sdmejia01","comment_id":"813207","timestamp":"1692365460.0"},{"comment_id":"1187752","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1727828580.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct"}],"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","question_text":"Which global command encrypts all passwords in the running configuration?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99848-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-979-discussion/","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-02-18 16:31:00"},{"id":"IUJplPhBBhAqPmxE2UFT","choices":{"B":"ipv6 address 21:EB8:C1:2200:1::331/64","A":"ipv6 address 2001:EB8:C1:22:1::331/64","C":"ipv6 address 2001:EB8:C1:2200:1:0000:331/64","D":"ipv6 address 2001:EB8:C1:2200:1::331/64"},"timestamp":"2022-04-25 09:07:00","question_id":1374,"question_text":"A network administrator is setting up a new IPv6 network using the 64-bit address 2001:0EB8:00C1:2200:0001:0000:0000:0331/64.
