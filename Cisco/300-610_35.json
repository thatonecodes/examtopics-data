Therefore just like with physical switches, in order to trunk or route traffic between them, physical interfaces and cabling is required to connect two or more VDCs together before this can happen.\nA useful VDC feature is that the mgmt0 interface on the Supervisor can be assigned a different IP address by each VDC.\n \nVDC management can be done via virtualizing the management port so that, each VDC will get logical instance of management port and where we have to provide the separate IP address to each Virtual management Port present in VDC from the same subnet\nAnswer is C","poster":"sadiq990","comment_id":"589756"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"The management of the Cisco Nexus switches is provided over an isolated put-of-band network.
