Switch mode allows the fabric interconnect to connect directly to a storage device. Enabling Fibre Channel switch mode is useful in POD models where there is no SAN (for example, a single Cisco UCS system connected directly to storage), or where a SAN exists (with an upstream MDS).\""},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1693392960.0","poster":"Magneto","content":"D correct","comment_id":"435365"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"R6jng7IcPbNOyyO9WRMI","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/42362-exam-300-610-topic-1-question-39-discussion/","answer":"","exam_id":310,"discussion":[{"content":"iSCSI > provides block-level..\nTOE > offloads device CPU..\nMPIO > host software has..\nALUA > allows the storage..","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1720979700.0","poster":"missing_dll","comment_id":"267349"}],"isMC":false,"unix_timestamp":1610654100,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nDrag and drop the technologies from the left onto the correct descriptions on the right.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","timestamp":"2021-01-14 20:55:00","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03257/0002600001.png"],"question_id":123,"answer_description":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03257/0002700001.png"]},{"id":"fwwoYZRmng9KKEV3oLRb","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/59822-exam-300-610-topic-1-question-4-discussion/","exam_id":310,"unix_timestamp":1629129180,"question_id":124,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"IP redirects","B":"flow control","C":"proxy ARP","D":"HSRP"},"timestamp":"2021-08-16 17:53:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer":"C","discussion":[{"poster":"Fcpoultry","comment_id":"1122052","content":"Selected Answer: C\nLISP VM mobility across subnets requires that the same MAC address is configured across all HSRP groups that allow dynamic EIDs to roam.
