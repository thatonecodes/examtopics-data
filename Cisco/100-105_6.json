The Internet has grown beyond anyone's expectations. Sustained exponential growth continues to introduce new challenges. One\n challenge is a concern within the community that globally unique\n address space will be exhausted. A separate and far more pressing concern is that the amount of routing overhead will grow beyond the capabilities of Internet Service Providers. Efforts are in progress within the community to find long term solutions to both of these problems. Meanwhile it is necessary to revisit address allocation procedures, and their impact on the Internet routing system."},{"poster":"paulosrsf","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1561577340.0","content":"The answer is A and D.
