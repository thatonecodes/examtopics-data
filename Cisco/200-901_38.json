A large number of Cisco and third-party routers and firewalls support NAT. The devices that perform IP address translations are usually situated and route data traffic between the internal network and the outside world or the public Internet.\n\nDuring the NAT configuration phase, an internal subnet or a set of subnets is defined as being internal, or “inside”; these are usually the private IP subnets used internally in the enterprise. As a second step in the configuration process, single public IP address or an external, or “outside,” pool of IP addresses are defined. With this information, the border device can perform IP address translation between the internal and external worlds."},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"797117","content":"Selected Answer: A\nLB can do the same, configuring a virtual server with the public IP and the port and load balancing the traffic to the backend servers to different ports...the question is not so well written..anyway I would chose A","timestamp":"1722689580.0","poster":"jotajotajeje"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOne option for accessing multiple applications on a single host machine with a single public IP address and port is to use a reverse proxy.

Security measures are implemented independently, and both private and public IP addresses can be used in secure or insecure configurations.\n\nOption E is incorrect because private IP addresses are not controlled globally by an IP address registry.
