Upon further review and based on the information from the Cisco DNA Assurance User Guide, Release 2.3.3, the correct answers are:\n\nB. The interference is less than or equal to 50% on the 2.4 GHz radio.\n\nD. The interference is less than or equal to 20% on the 5 GHz radio.\n\nExplanation:\n\nCisco DNA Center calculates the Access Point (AP) health score based on several parameters, including interference levels. The thresholds for interference are:\n\n2.4 GHz Radio:\n\nIf interference is ≤50%, the health score remains unaffected.\nIf interference is >50%, the health score is impacted.\n5 GHz Radio:\n\nIf interference is ≤20%, the health score remains unaffected.\nIf interference is >20%, the health score is impacted.\nTherefore, if the interference detected is within these thresholds, Cisco DNA Center considers it negligible, and the AP health score remains unaffected.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1360736","upvote_count":"1","content":"Why Not the Other Options?\n\nA.

Cisco DNA Center does not include interference in the AP health score.\n\nThis is incorrect; interference is a factor in the AP health score calculation when it exceeds the specified thresholds.","poster":"rrahim","timestamp":"1740340620.0"}],"upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"rrahim","comments":[{"poster":"rrahim","content":"Why Not the Other Options?\nB. The interference is less than or equal to 50% on the 2.4 GHz radio:\nThis is incorrect because the threshold for 2.4 GHz interference to be considered significant in Cisco DNA Center is 30%, not 50%.\n\nD. The interference is less than or equal to 30% on the 5 GHz radio:\nWhile this could be true, it is not a primary reason for ignoring interference in the health score. Interference on the 5 GHz band is generally less impactful and often excluded from health score calculations unless it is severe.\n\nE. Cisco DNA Center does not include interference in the AP health score:\nThis is incorrect because Cisco DNA Center does include interference in the AP health score, but only for specific conditions (e.g., CleanAir interferers and thresholds).","comment_id":"1357988","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1739828640.0"}],"timestamp":"1739828640.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1357987","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nInterference Thresholds in Cisco DNA Center:\n\nCisco DNA Center uses specific thresholds to determine whether interference should impact the AP health score. For the 2.4 GHz radio, interference is only considered significant if it exceeds 30%. If the interference is less than or equal to 30%, it is ignored in the health score calculation.\n\nFor the 5 GHz radio, interference is typically less impactful due to more available channels and less congestion, so it is often not included in the health score unless it exceeds certain thresholds.\n\nCisco CleanAir Interferers:\n\nCisco DNA Center includes only Cisco CleanAir interferers in the AP health score. If the interference detected by the AP is not classified as a CleanAir interferer, it will not affect the health score. CleanAir technology identifies specific types of interference (e.g., microwaves, Bluetooth devices, cordless phones) and provides detailed metrics about them."},{"content":"For 2.4-GHz radio:\n\n(If interference is less than or equal to 50 percent, the score is 10. )***\n\nIf interference is more than 50 percent, the score is 0.\n\nFor 5-GHz radio:\n\nIf interference is less than or equal to 20 percent, the score 10.\n\nIf interference is more than 20 percent, the score is 0.\n\n\nit means that only B (The interference is less than or equal to 50% on the 2.4 GHz radio.)***\nfulfill the criteria.
