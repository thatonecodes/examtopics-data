This state effectively shuts down the port and prevents any traffic from passing through until the issue is resolved and the port is manually re-enabled.\n\nOther incorrect Options:\n- A. the shutdown command on a port will disable the port, but it does not place it in the err-disabled state. The port is administratively down but can be brought back up with the no shutdown command.\n- C. nothing plugged into the port: does not cause it to be placed in the err-disabled state. The port will simply be in an \"up/down\" or \"notconnected\" state.\n- D.
