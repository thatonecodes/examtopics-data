Radiation Patterns: Between 2 and 4 I was unsure for this one but the fact they spend a lot of time talking about graphing it, this felt best in #2.\n\n3. Beamwidth: The beamwidth is determined by finding the strongest point on the plot, which is usually somewhere on the outer circle.

The edge of the coverage for an AP is based on the signal strength and SNR measured as the client device moves away from the AP. \n\nThe signal strength required for good coverage varies dependent on the specific type of client devices and applications on the network. \n\nTo accommodate the requirement to support wireless Voice over IP (VoIP), refer to the RF guidelines specified in the Cisco 7925G Wireless IP Phone Deployment Guide. The minimum recommended wireless signal strength for voice applications is -67 dBm and the minimum SNR is 25 dB.\n\nThe first step in the analysis of a post site survey is to verify the â€˜Signal Coverageâ€™. The signal coverage is measured in dBm. You can adjust the color-coded signal gauge to your minimum-allowed signal level to view areas where there are sufficient and insufficient coverage. The example in Figure 8 shows blue, green, and yellow areas in the map have signal coverage at -67 dBm or better. The areas in grey on the coverage maps have deficient coverage.
