Assume, again, that a router has four routing processes running on it, and each process has received these routes:\n\nEIGRP (internal): 192.168.32.0/26\n\nRIP: 192.168.32.0/24\n\nOSPF: 192.168.32.0/19\n\nWhich of these routes will be installed in the routing table? Since EIGRP internal routes have the best administrative distance, it's tempting to assume the first one will be installed. However, since each of these routes has a different prefix length (subnet mask), they're considered different destinations, and they will all be installed in the routing table.","timestamp":"1662657780.0","poster":"DixieNormus","comment_id":"663845"}],"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"623764","content":"Ref: Route Selection in Cisco Routers - Cisco\n\n“…\nSummary\n\nThe LONGEST PREFIX MATCH always wins among the routes actually installed in the routing table, while the routing protocol with the LOWEST ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE always wins when installing routes into the routing table.\n…”\n\nYou have 5 routes from 4 different routing protocols. Two of these routes are from OSPF: the router must choose (between them) which one to install in the routing table, and here the longest prefix match criteria wins (router chooses OSPF route 10.0.0.0/30).\nNow, you have 4 routes. 3 routes are all /30 routes (same prefix length): the router chooses on the basis of lowest administrative distance, and OSPF wins (administrative distance for these protocols is OSPF 110, which is lower than RIP 120, which is lower than BGP 200).\n\nThe last route is an EIGRP one, and this is also a host route (look at the /32 prefix). There can’t be a longest prefix than a host route. Also, this route doesn’t have to compete with any other route to be installed in the routing table. So, this route is the router’s second choice.\n\nAnswers A and D are correct."},{"upvote_count":"26","poster":"ismatdmour","comment_id":"560108","comments":[{"poster":"mohammed018","content":"Hey there bro, I just wanted to ask do you got a Gmail account so I can message you and ask you something regarding the CCNA exam.
