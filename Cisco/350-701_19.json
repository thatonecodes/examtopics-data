It integrates with other cloud solutions via APIs and monitors and creates incidents based on events from the cloud solution.\n\nA Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) is a security solution that integrates with cloud solutions such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) via APIs. It monitors cloud usage and creates incidents based on events from the cloud solution. This allows organizations to gain visibility into and control over their cloud usage, helping to protect against security threats and ensure compliance with security policies and regulations. CASBs can perform a variety of security-related functions, including identity and access management, data loss prevention, threat protection, and compliance enforcement, among others. By acting as an intermediary between cloud solutions and the organization, CASBs help to bridge the gap between security and cloud adoption, allowing organizations to securely adopt and manage cloud services.","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":[],"choices":{"A":"It is an authentication broker to enable single sign-on and multi-factor authentication for a cloud solution.","D":"It acts as a security information and event management solution and receives syslog from other cloud solutions.","B":"It scans other cloud solutions being used within the network and identifies vulnerabilities.","C":"It integrates with other cloud solutions via APIs and monitors and creates incidents based on events from the cloud solution."},"timestamp":"2022-07-17 18:50:00","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/products/security/cloudlock/index.html#~stickynav=2","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/77578-exam-350-701-topic-1-question-184-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1658076600,"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","question_text":"How does a cloud access security broker function?","question_images":[],"exam_id":327},{"id":"6eFbUsiLAyvg00Xv7a08","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/74814-exam-350-701-topic-1-question-185-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer":"BC","question_images":[],"question_id":93,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1682719740.0","poster":"Yuta1123","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nI think BC is answer...","comment_id":"594083","comments":[{"poster":"sajoz123","timestamp":"1683077520.0","content":"Agree with you","comment_id":"596271","upvote_count":"2"}],"upvote_count":"6"},{"comment_id":"842109","poster":"loser4fun","upvote_count":"6","content":"C.
