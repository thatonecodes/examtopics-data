In the partial configuration shown, the spoke’s authorization policy mistakenly sets **192.168.200.0/24** (its own LAN) as the **remote**. Consequently, the spoke does not encrypt or forward return traffic back toward 192.168.100.0/24, causing the ICMP echo-replies to drop.\n\nTo fix this, you must tell the spoke that **192.168.100.0/24** (behind the hub) is the **remote** network so that return traffic is included in the encryption domain. Therefore, the correct action is:\n\n**D. Add the `route set remote ipv4 192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0` command to the spoke authorization policy.**","poster":"aksh9901"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"aksh9901","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOn the spoke, the show crypto ikev2 sa detailed command shows \"Remote subnets\" from the perspective of the spoke. Here, we see:\n\nRemote subnets: 10.0.0.1/32 and 192.168.100.0/24\nThese subnets are what the spoke sees as the hub's protected internal networks. This indicates that the hub has successfully communicated to the spoke that traffic to 192.168.100.0/24 should be encrypted.\n\nHowever, we do not see any mention of the spoke's own internal network (192.168.200.0/24) from the hub's perspective. For the hub to understand that it needs to build a route back to the spoke for 192.168.200.0/24, the hub's IKEv2 authorization policy must include the route set remote command specifying the spoke’s network.","comment_id":"1329064","timestamp":"1734625740.0"},{"comment_id":"1288550","timestamp":"1727175720.0","poster":"KoalaMan","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the only answer that makes sense"},{"content":"D is the correct answer. look at remote subnet in show crypto result.\n@kylesam2017 correct.

This ensures that the spoke knows how to route the response traffic back to the source host, resolving the issue.","timestamp":"1703463960.0","comment_id":"1104942"},{"content":"logical answer is C","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1069502","timestamp":"1699892700.0","poster":"gondohwe"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nisnt B ? the command should include the local network , not remote","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"991559","timestamp":"1693152540.0","poster":"mihaid"}],"choices":{"B":"Add the route set remote ipv4 192.168.200.0 255.255.255.0 command to the hub authorization policy.","A":"Add the aaa authorization group cert list default default command to the spoke ikev2 profile.","C":"Add the aaa authorization group cert list default default command to the hub ikev2 profile.","D":"Add the route set remote ipv4 192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0 command to the spoke authorization policy."},"answer_description":"","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nAn engineer has configured a spoke to connect to a FlexVPN hub.
