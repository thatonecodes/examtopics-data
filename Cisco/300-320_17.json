Policy can be enforced opportunistically at the ingress leaf; otherwise, it is enforced on the egress leaf. Whether or not policy can be enforced at ingress is determined by whether the destination EPG is known. The source EPG will always be known, and policy rules pertaining to that source as both an sEPG and a dEPG are always pushed to the appropriate leaf switch when an endpoint attaches. After policy is pushed to an leaf, it is stored and enforced in hardware. Because the Cisco APIC is aware of all EPGs and the endpoints assigned to them, the leaf to which the EPG is attached will always have all policies required and will never need to punt traffic to a controller, as might be the case in other systems. (See Figure 11).\n\nAnswer is definitely D"},{"content":"more look at this im inclined to side with D now \n\nAPIC :\n\nThe Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (Cisco APIC) is the main architectural component of the Cisco ACI solution. It is the unified point of automation and management for the Cisco ACI fabric, policy enforcement, and health monitoring. The controller optimises performance and manages and operates a scalable multitenant Cisco ACI fabric.","timestamp":"1582054800.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"nicey999","comment_id":"52227"},{"content":"D is correct","timestamp":"1578748860.0","poster":"Mahbod","comment_id":"37720","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"26493","poster":"Zim","timestamp":"1575439440.0","content":"Answer should be D"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/9698-exam-300-320-topic-2-question-3-discussion/","answers_community":[],"answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1575439440,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-12-04 07:04:00","question_images":[],"exam_id":302,"isMC":true,"topic":"2","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"ApBzMUWSuO7DlaBihu1z","answer":"BC","question_id":82,"question_text":"An engineer wants to ensure that common services communicate to several applications in various EPGs.
