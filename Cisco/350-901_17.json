Weak ETag values of two representations of the same resources might be semantically equivalent, but not byte-for-byte identical.

Currently, the only supported algorithm is spread, which tries to place them evenly. For instance, if you label each node with a label rack which has a value from 1-10, then specify a placement preference keyed on rack, then service tasks are placed as evenly as possible across all nodes with the label rack, after taking other placement constraints, placement preferences, and other node-specific limitations into account.\n\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/services/#control-service-placement"},{"poster":"testadviser","comment_id":"564756","upvote_count":"4","content":"Option \"A\" seems correct:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/services/#control-service-placement","timestamp":"1710069840.0"}],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04118/0019900001.png"],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
