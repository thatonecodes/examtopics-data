It uses attributes like device type (detected via DHCP or HTTP User-Agent) to apply policies dynamically.\n\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\nB. RADIUS server overwrite interface:\n\nThis is not a valid feature on the Cisco WLC. The correct feature for dynamic VLAN assignment based on device type is WLAN local policy.\n\nC. AAA override:\n\nAAA override requires a RADIUS server to return VLAN assignments based on user or device attributes. While it can achieve the goal, it is not necessary in this case because the WLAN local policy feature can handle device-based VLAN assignment without ISE or a RADIUS server.\n\nD. custom AVC profile:\n\nAVC (Application Visibility and Control) profiles are used for monitoring and controlling application traffic but do not support dynamic VLAN assignment based on device type.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rrahim","comment_id":"1357477","timestamp":"1739749560.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Liselot","comment_id":"638683","content":"A is correct\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/7-5/configuration-guide/b_cg75/b_cg75_chapter_0111100.html#task_5531F3E9DFD847C08A2BD66DBCDB4194","timestamp":"1722167520.0"}],"exam_id":307,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","question_id":28,"choices":{"B":"RADIUS server overwrite interface","A":"WLAN local policy","D":"custom AVC profile","C":"AAA override"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/77796-exam-300-430-topic-1-question-123-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"GfbcVWBgpqVzJz8Y09Wi","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2021-11-19 04:01:00","choices":{"B":"Provide a valid client username that has been configured on the RADIUS server.","C":"Configure the shared-secret keys on the controller and the RADIUS server.","D":"Authenticate the client using the same EAP type that has been set up on the RADIUS server.","A":"Allow connectivity from the wireless controller to the IP of the RADIUS server."},"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
