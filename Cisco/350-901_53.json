Leverage middleware caching and respond with HTTP code 204 in the API response.\n\nMiddleware caching can significantly reduce load by storing the results of expensive queries and serving them for subsequent requests. However, responding with HTTP 204 is not typically associated with caching because 204 means \"No Content,\" which would indicate that there is no data to cache. Instead, a 304 \"Not Modified\" response might be used in conjunction with ETags or Last-Modified headers to indicate that the cached version of the response is still valid.\nC. Include the ETag header in the API response.\n\nThe ETag (Entity Tag) header is used in HTTP to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is identical to the current version of the resource on the server. If the ETag matches, the server can respond with a 304 Not Modified status, indicating that the client can use its cached version, thus saving on database queries and reducing server load.","comment_id":"1079330","timestamp":"1732458780.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nhere the question 277 for comparing\nhttps://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/95766-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-277-discussion/","timestamp":"1728346680.0","comment_id":"1027656","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kati2k22cz"},{"timestamp":"1719928680.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ThePokemonNuzlockingMaster","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nI know C and D both would help because they implement caching and therefore the server would be under less load.

Leverage middleware caching and respond with HTTP code 204 in the API response** and **E. Change the query to be more efficient**. Here is why:\n\n- **A. Include the Content-Type header in the API response** is not a good option, because it does not affect the performance of the server or the API usage.\nThe Content-Type header only tells the client what type of data is in the response body, but it does not reduce the load on the server or the network bandwidth.\n\n- **E. Change the query to be more efficient** is a good option, because it can directly affect the performance of the server and reduce the API usage.\nChanging the query to be more efficient means optimizing how the server accesses and processes data from databases or other sources.\nThis can reduce the CPU and memory usage of the server, as well as shorten the response time and network bandwidth.","timestamp":"1717135200.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1717135260.0","comment_id":"910886","upvote_count":"2","content":"- **B. Leverage middleware caching and respond with HTTP code 204 in the API response** is a good option, because it can improve the performance of the server and reduce the API usage.\nMiddleware caching is a technique that stores frequently used data or responses in a layer between the server and the client, so that the server does not have to process the same request again.\nResponding with HTTP code 204 means that the server has successfully processed the request, but does not return any data in the response body. This can save network bandwidth and speed up the response time.\n\n- **C. Include the ETag header in the API response** is not a good option, because it does not optimize the API usage on the server, but rather on the client side .\nThe ETag header is a way of validating if a cached resource on the client side is still fresh or not.\nIt can help avoid unnecessary requests from the client to the server, but it does not reduce the load on the server or improve its performance.","comments":[{"poster":"whipmuffin","content":"- **D.
