To help\nmanage more and more autonomous APs as the wireless network grows, you could place an\nAP management platform such as Cisco Prime Infrastructure in a central location within the\nenterprise. The management platform would need to be purchased, configured, and maintained too.\nA simpler approach is a cloud-based AP architecture, where the AP management function\nis pushed out of the enterprise and into the Internet cloud. Cisco Meraki is cloud-based\nand offers centralized management of wireless, switched, and security networks built from\nMeraki products.

Configuration changes and firmware updates must be made manually on each AP. In contrast, cloud-based mode involves APs that operate under the control of a centralized controller located in the cloud. In this mode, configuration changes and firmware updates are pushed from the cloud to the APs, and the controller provides a centralized view of the network.\n\nWhen deciding which mode to deploy, the network administrator must consider the dependencies of each mode. In autonomous mode, the APs are less dependent on the underlying network infrastructure but require more manual maintenance, which may be more complex for a large number of APs. In cloud-based mode, the APs rely on the underlying network infrastructure and require more complex maintenance for the centralized controller, but provide easy deployment and automation for a large number of APs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is option B: \"Cloud-based mode APs rely on underlays and are more complex to maintain than APs in autonomous mode.\"","comment_id":"826530","timestamp":"1677736500.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is A.
