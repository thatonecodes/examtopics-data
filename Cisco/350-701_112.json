A vulnerability can be caused by a variety of factors, including coding errors, misconfigurations, or design flaws.\n\nAn exploit, on the other hand, is a tool or technique used by an attacker to take advantage of a vulnerability and gain unauthorized access or control over the target system. An exploit can be a piece of software, a script, or a command that leverages a vulnerability to execute malicious code or actions on the target system.\n\nTherefore, the difference between a vulnerability and an exploit is that a vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by an attacker, while an exploit is the means by which an attacker takes advantage of a vulnerability to compromise the system.","comment_id":"849499","poster":"Naderelmansi","upvote_count":"5"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct
