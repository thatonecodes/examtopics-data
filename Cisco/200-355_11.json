After the LAP gets an IP address from the DHCP server, the LAP begins this discovery process:\nA. The LAP broadcasts a Layer 3 LWAPP discovery message on the local IP subnet. Any WLC that is configured for Layer 3 LWAPP mode and that is connected to the same local subnet receives the Layer 3 LWAPP discovery message.\nB. Each of the WLCs that receives the LWAPP discovery message replies with a unicast LWAPP discovery response message to the LAP.\n\n2. LAPs use the Over-the-Air Provisioning (OTAP) feature in order to discover the WLC. \n3. If the LAP was registered to a WLC in a previous deployment, the LAP maintains the list of WLC IP addresses locally in NVRAM.\n4.
