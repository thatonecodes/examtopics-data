If you don't specify the level, it will encrypt the plaintext password supplied using the specified algorithm type.\n\n\"If you specify an encryption type, you must provide an encrypted passwordâ€”an encrypted password that you copy from another switch configuration. Secret encryption type 9 is more secure, so we recommend that you select type 9 to avoid any issues while upgrading or downgrading. \n\nYou can also configure type 9 encryption for the secret password manually by using the algorithm-type scrypt command in global configuration mode.
