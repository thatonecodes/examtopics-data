If you don't specify the level, it will encrypt the plaintext password supplied using the specified algorithm type.\n\n\"If you specify an encryption type, you must provide an encrypted password—an encrypted password that you copy from another switch configuration. Secret encryption type 9 is more secure, so we recommend that you select type 9 to avoid any issues while upgrading or downgrading. \n\nYou can also configure type 9 encryption for the secret password manually by using the algorithm-type scrypt command in global configuration mode.
