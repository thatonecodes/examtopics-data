This misconfiguration results in a packet loss and slowness, with increased packet loss when higher traffic rates occur on the link where the server is connected. For the clients who communicate with this server, the problem looks like slow interVLAN forwarding because they do not have a problem communicating to other devices or clients on the same VLAN. The problem occurs only when communicating to the server on a different VLAN. Thus, the problem occurred on a single collision domain, but is seen as slow interVLAN forwarding.","poster":"Baile"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1579717680.0","poster":"darratt","content":"Answer E","comment_id":"41702"},{"poster":"immz","timestamp":"1578950640.0","content":"correct answer is E","comment_id":"38639","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"saad82","content":"the correct answer E","timestamp":"1577107800.0","comment_id":"31972"},{"poster":"paulosrsf","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1569977280.0","comment_id":"13516","content":"The answer is definitely C.
