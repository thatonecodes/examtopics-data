To quickly find out the subnet range, we have to find out the increment and the network address of each subnet. Let's take an example with the subnet 172.28.228.144/18:\nFrom the /18 (= 1100 0000 in the 3rd octet), we find out the increment is 64. Therefore the network address of this subnet must be the greatest multiple of the increment but not greater than the value in the 3rd octet (228). We can find out the 3rd octet of the network address is 192 (because 192 = 64 * 3 and 192 < 228) -\n> The network address is 172.28.192.0. So the first usable host should be 172.28.192.1 and it matches with the 5th answer on the right. In this case we don't need to calculate the broadcast address because we found the correct answer.\nLet's take another example with subnet 172.28.228.144/23 -> The increment is 2 (as /23 = 1111 1110 in 3rd octet) -> The 3rd octet of the network address is 228\n(because 228 is the multiply of 2 and equal to the 3rd octet) -> The network address is 172.28.228.0 -> The first usable host is 172.28.228.1. It is not necessary but if we want to find out the broadcast address of this subnet, we can find out the next network address, which is 172.28.(228 + the increment number).0 or\n172.28.230.0 then reduce 1 bit -> 172.28.229.255 is the broadcast address of our subnet.

There is too much ambiguity about the word \"change\". The official definition of this word refers to a modification, a replacement, a substitution and not to something broken, deteriorated, damaged or incorrectly made. Moreover \"Changes in one layer do not impact other layer\" is not only written in netacad courses but it is a very strong message taught in all good courses on the CCNA exam. If this assertion is correct, it risks concealing that one of the fine qualities of the OSI model is to allow changes in one layer without impacting the other layers.

This means that a change in one layer impacts other layers and C is incorrect.\nAt the same time, this does not contradict with that in your course:\"Preventing technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layers above and below\". For example, for the same leased line (physical layer) they came up with many data link layer protocols, e.g HDLC and PPP. As another example, the Ethernet (which spans over physical and data-link layers) started with 10BaseT, with IP, ARP, IGMP and ICMP protocols on top at layer3. However, later on, the Ethernet Protocol continued to evolve with many variants, e.g. 100BaseT, 1000BaseT, Fuber Ethernet of many variants and so on while the L3 Protocols of IP and its colleagues remain untouched.\nHence, the answer (C) talks about operational changes while the Netacademy talks about design changes.

To enable normal operations to continue after a member failure without requiring a change in a host ARP cache.\n\nVRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) is a standardized protocol that provides a way to create a virtual gateway IP address in a multivendor environment. It allows multiple routers to work together, sharing the same virtual IP address as the default gateway for hosts on a subnet.\n\nWhen a new subnet is configured in a multivendor environment, implementing VRRP provides redundancy and fault tolerance for the default gateway. If one router fails, another router within the VRRP group can take over the virtual IP address seamlessly, ensuring that hosts can still communicate without any disruption. This capability allows normal operations to continue after a member failure without requiring a change in a host ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1685785560.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption A is incorrect.
