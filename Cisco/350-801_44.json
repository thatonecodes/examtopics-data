There is no indication of T1 vs E1, which normally only use outside of USA. \nC - is incorrect, the pri-group timeslot 1-10 cannot be 0-9 as \"0\" is not a valid number on Cisco IOS. \nD - since this is only fractional T1 circuit 1-10, by default IOS outbound calls are in descending order. All outbound calls will go out from bottom up(B-channel 23 and up) unless you manually configure the isdn busy b-channel XX to direct the IOS router not to sending calls out as a full T1 circuit. Therefore by manually revert the order of using the channels will work in this case.
