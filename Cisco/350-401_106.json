Why? \n\nThe Delay minimum quoted as 5 secs in the question means preempt delay. \n\nThe preempt delay means that, when the interface gets up it will detect that there is already an hsrp neighbour active. Thus, that active router will continue forward traffic, and this router will wait for configured time until it takes over the role.\n\nIf we don't wait, we will take over the active role immediate and that can be a problem if routing is not yet ready.\n\nAlso, if the other router is not detected, this router will take the active role immediate, and do not wait the configured time, and starts forward traffic as soon as routing is ready.\nSource : https://community.cisco.com/t5/switching/hsrp-delay-minimum-amp-reload-question/td-p/3327186\n\nC of course is right as seen from the output that the VIP is 10.1.1.1"},{"content":"Only C) is valid right now.
