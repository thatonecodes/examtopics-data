Area range should be applied on the ABRs when you are trying to summarize routes between OSPF areas. So area range is used to summarize Type 3 LSAs. On the other hand summary-address should be applied on the ASBRs when you are trying to summarize externally redistributed routes from another protocol domain (eigrp, bgp etc). So summary-address is used to summarize Type5/7 LSAs. One exception to this rule is when you have a NSSA area, the router that is responsible for the conversion of Type7 to Type 5 LSA can have the summary-address applied."}],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/90523-exam-300-410-topic-1-question-379-discussion/","exam_id":303,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-12-08 03:03:00","isMC":true,"question_text":"Network operations report issues with receiving too many external routes, which caused CPU spike on routers with smaller memories.
