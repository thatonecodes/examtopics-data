It uses two separate connections for control and data traffic.\n\nExplanation:\nThe FTP protocol typically uses two separate connections:\n\n1. **Control Connection:** This connection is used for sending commands from the client to the server and receiving responses. It is usually established on well-known port 21.\n\n2. **Data Connection:** This connection is used for the actual transfer of data files. Depending on the mode (active or passive) and the specific implementation, the data connection can be established on a different port.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not accurate:\n\n- B. FTP does use a simple form of error checking, but it does not use block numbers in the same way that some other protocols (e.g., TFTP) do.\n\n- C. FTP typically requires user authentication, which involves providing a username and password to access files on the server.\n\n- D. FTP traditionally uses TCP for its connections, and the well-known port for FTP control is 21, not UDP port 69.

The definition is so closely similar on Cisco's site. But, after further reading, I noticed Cisco (and perhaps other brands as well) prefers \"static\" and prioritizes it over a port that is configured w/ \"auto\". This seems to be a pattern with other networking concepts as well like in EtherChannel/LAG, where you stay away from \"auto\" if possible. Although, I don't think we ever configured any of our switches at work w/ \"static\". I can see how this might actually pose some issues at work though.

In \"auto\" mode, the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) detects the powered device (PD) before providing power, and then delivers the appropriate power level to the PD. If the PD is not detected, or if it is not compatible with the PSE, no power is supplied. This ensures that only compatible devices receive power, and that the appropriate power level is delivered to them.","comment_id":"887476"},{"poster":"dropspablo","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer A, because there are three configuration modes in PoE, Static, Auto and Dynamic.\nThe three modes CAN guarantee the power. But only Auto and Dynamic modes DETECT the device (along with the required power). And the Dynamic mode, in addition to guaranteeing energy, detecting the device, it also NEGOTIATES energy, because if the switch has less watts to supply, it can partially feed the device.\nAs it was only asked in the question to GUARANTEE the energy and DETECT the device, the Auto mode already answers (Answer A). If it asked to also \"negotiate\", it would have to be Dynamic mode. Static mode is wrong as it cannot detect the device, it just guarantees power. And Active mode does not exist in the configuration.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1682721300.0","comments":[{"content":"Example:\nSwitch(config-if)# power inline static max 15400\nSwitch(config-if)# power inline auto max 15400\nSwitch(config-if)# power inline dynamic max 30000\nThe MAX keyword defines the maximum amount of power that can be supplied to the device.
