The engineer uses OAuth with refresh on the Cisco UCM SIP lines for extra security and improved user experience. During the setup, Mobile and Remote Access does not work, it is enabled on the Cisco UCM and Cisco Expressways. SIP trunks on ports 5090 and 5091 are configured to avoid conflicts with other SIP trunks between internal Cisco UCM clusters. The traversal zone also uses port 6500.
