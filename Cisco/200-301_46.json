A controller with OfficeExtend access points in an access point group publishes only up to 15 WLANs to each connected OfficeExtend access point because it reserves one WLAN for the personal SSID.\n\nB wrong: Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) encryption between the access point and the controller ensures that all communications have the highest level of security. DTLS is permanently enabled on the Cisco OEAP. You cannot disable DTLS on this access point.\n\nC worng: Cisco OEAPs are designed to work behind a router or other gateway device that is using network address translation (NAT).\n\nD correct: The OfficeExtend AP feature is supported on all internal antenna AP models.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-1/configuration-guide/b_cg81/configuring_officeextend_access_points.html","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1713623880.0"},{"timestamp":"1728418140.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1191811","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt‘s D\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config-guide/b_cg85/configuring_officeextend_access_points.html#:~:text=The%20OfficeExtend%20AP%20feature%20is%20supported%20on%20all%20internal%20antenna%20AP%20models.&text=Rogue%20detection%20is%20disabled%20automatically,mode%20for%20an%20access%20point.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-7/config-guide/b_cg87/m_configuring_officeextend_access_points.html"},{"timestamp":"1727547060.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1185003","poster":"lmmujsi","content":"The Cisco OfficeExtend Access Point (OEAP) mode is designed specifically to extend the corporate network to remote workers at home or in small branch offices. One of its key features is that it supports a secure Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) tunnel back to the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), allowing both corporate and personal SSIDs to be configured. Personal SSID allows remote employees' personal traffic to be segmented from corporate traffic.\n\nCisco FlexConnect AP mode, formerly known as H-REAP, allows access points to switch network traffic locally and only send control traffic to the controller.
