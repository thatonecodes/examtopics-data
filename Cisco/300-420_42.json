If the network is not stable, this feature prevents EIGRP queries from being sent over limited bandwidth links to nontransit devices. Instead, distribution devices to which the stub device is connected answer queries on behalf of the stub device. This feature greatly reduces the chance of further network instability due to congested or problematic WAN links. The EIGRP stub routing feature also simplifies the configuration and maintenance of hub-and-spoke networks. When stub routing is enabled in dual-homed remote configurations, it is no longer necessary to configure filtering on remote devices to prevent those devices from appearing as transit paths to hub devices.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_eigrp/configuration/15-mt/ire-15-mt-book/ire-eigrp-stub-rtg.html"},{"comment_id":"613693","poster":"Hope66","timestamp":"1702116780.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"It seems that A and D or A and C are both valid.
