One common design model is to integrate these modules directly into the aggregation-layer switches within the hierarchical network design, as shown in Figure 5. This approach is commonly taken when there are available slots within existing aggregation-layer switches, or chassis slot capacity is planned and allocated to the service modules in the initial design. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Data_Center/vssdc_integrate.html","comment_id":"3471","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1562155260.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1562050800.0","content":"\"fully integrated firewall\" mean card in 6500, so I think answer: A","poster":"kbish","comment_id":"3376"}],"timestamp":"2019-07-02 09:00:00","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1562050800,"question_images":[]},{"id":"RA0v1PSYwBFBfr0f0lBY","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-07-02 09:03:00","isMC":true,"question_id":60,"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"confirmed delivery","C":"packet-switched","A":"connection-oriented","B":"end-to-end flow control"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/2103-exam-300-160-topic-1-question-375-discussion/","answer":"C","answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1562050980,"exam_id":299,"answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1600499160.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"phu","content":"Class 3â€”Datagram service.
