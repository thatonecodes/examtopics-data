Each module can be managed and updated independently, reducing the risk of unintended consequences when changes are made to one part of the network. In the case of a divestment, the affected modules can be isolated and detached more easily, minimizing disruption to the remaining parts of the network.\n\nBy adopting a modular design, organizations can ensure a smoother transition during divestments, reduce the likelihood of service interruptions, and maintain overall network stability.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Doobiedoo","timestamp":"1724817960.0"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":147,"timestamp":"2024-08-28 06:06:00","answer":"B","exam_id":331,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/146581-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-240-discussion/","choices":{"C":"less complex design","B":"modular design","D":"routed access design","A":"redundant design"},"unix_timestamp":1724817960,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Network changes because of mergers, acquisitions, and divestment can be very disruptive to the network if not carried out carefully.
