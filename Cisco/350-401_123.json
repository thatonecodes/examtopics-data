To establish secure control plane connections\n\nvSmart controllers play a crucial role in orchestrating and managing the control plane operations in an SD-WAN architecture. They are responsible for establishing and maintaining secure control plane connections among different SD-WAN devices (such as edge routers or vEdge devices).\n\nThese controllers help in enforcing policies, distributing routing information, facilitating secure communication between SD-WAN components, and ensuring that the SD-WAN fabric operates based on defined business policies and requirements. They play a key role in controlling the behavior and forwarding decisions of SD-WAN devices by providing centralized intelligence for the control plane of the network.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1085616"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"992672","timestamp":"1709171940.0","content":"i think it's D , check pag 634 of the Cert GUID","poster":"Hamo1"},{"timestamp":"1707107100.0","content":"answer is A ... but question is poorly worded.","poster":"CCNPWILL","comment_id":"972634","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer here.","poster":"Stylar","timestamp":"1684047600.0","comment_id":"717833"},{"comments":[{"poster":"Niam77","timestamp":"1691278560.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"799316","content":"maybe right, but the answer c is data plane connection, so maybe that why the answer c is wrong because we know that vsmart is in control plane"}],"comment_id":"679176","timestamp":"1679780040.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Dataset","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think C is correct to, vSmart authenticates devices connected to the SD-WAN network"},{"poster":"Dataset","comment_id":"679174","content":"I think C is correct to, vSmart authenticates devices connected to the SD-WAN network","timestamp":"1679779980.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"kebkim","comment_id":"661299","timestamp":"1678118520.0","content":"vSmart controller distributes security information between vEdge routers to facilitate data plane IPSEC tunnel creation. vSmart uses OMP to distribute routing information, security keys and policy configuration through DTLS tunnels to the vEdge routers.","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"jz2pbg3qdIfM30Akrr6y","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption A is incorrect.\nThe authentication type is cleartext; 'text' keyword is being used.\nWe can use md5 authentication by using 'authentication md5' command.\n\nOption B is incorrect, and irrelevant to the context of our question.\nWe need to use 'show ip route' command to display R2's routing table and confirm.\n\nOption C is correct.\nWe will track the reachability to IP address '10.10.1.1' in its routing table and if it's not reachable by R1, R1's priority will decrement by 20.
