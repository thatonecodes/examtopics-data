The router is open for connections from the collector. This mode is useful to establish a single channel of communication with the router. Because the collector establishes the session, there is no need to create destinations in the configuration. Additionally, the protocol (gRPC) used to establish a session provides advanced security capabilities to authenticate and encrypt the session. If the connection between the router and the collector is lost, the session is cancelled. The collector must reconnect to the router to restart streaming data. Only gRPC supports dial-in session.\n\nTo explore the dial-in mode, and to create a dial-in session, see Establish a Model-Driven Telemetry Session from a Collector to a Router.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/710x/telemetry/configuration/guide/b-telemetry-cg-asr9000-710x/scale-up-your-network-monitoring-strategy-using-telemetry.html#id_117897:~:text=Use%20gRPC%20dial%2Din%20mode","comment_id":"1282402","timestamp":"1726108200.0","poster":"namashivaya"},{"comments":[{"poster":"luckymuki","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/710x/telemetry/configuration/guide/b-telemetry-cg-asr9000-710x/scale-up-your-network-monitoring-strategy-using-telemetry.html#id_117897:~:text=Use%20gRPC%20dial%2Din%20mode","comment_id":"1224607","timestamp":"1717576680.0"}],"upvote_count":"2","poster":"luckymuki","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBoth ChatGPT and Gemini are saying C.\nDial-out: In this approach, the telemetry senders (data sources) initiate connections to the collector (receiver).
