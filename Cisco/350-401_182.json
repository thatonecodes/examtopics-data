The RF signal strength at location C is 10 times stronger than location B\n\nThis is because a 10 dB difference in RSSI corresponds to a tenfold increase in signal strength. The difference between Location C (-65 dBm) and Location B (-75 dBm) is 10 dB, meaning the signal at Location C is 10 times stronger.\nC. The RF signal strength at location B is 50% weaker than location A\n\nA 3 dB difference corresponds to approximately half the signal strength. The difference between Location B (-75 dBm) and Location A (-72 dBm) is 3 dB, which suggests that the signal strength at Location B is about 50% weaker than at Location A.\nExplanations for incorrect options:\nA: The signal strength at -65 dBm (Location C) is typically sufficient for basic web browsing, so this statement is incorrect.\nB: Location D has the weakest signal strength at -80 dBm, not the strongest, making this statement incorrect.\nE: The signal strength at Location B is not better than Location C; in fact, it is worse by 10 dB.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1301914","poster":"cjoyce1980","timestamp":"1729667040.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"chiacche","content":"Selected Answer: CD\n-3 dBm --> x1/2\n+10 dBm --> x10","comment_id":"1287198","timestamp":"1726903620.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1228131","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC & D are correct","timestamp":"1718056260.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Nickita","comment_id":"1171733","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nI'd go for A and B because read carefully - the mission is to explain it to a customer!\nA customer is non technical most probably and will see these equations as bullshit...","timestamp":"1710250800.0"},{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1152883","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1708208580.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC and D 100%"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nCorrect answer C\nfor descarting wrong A,B,E, ...... then other correct answer D","timestamp":"1700498100.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Fanny1493","comment_id":"1075603"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nC is 100% correct\nA is subjective, but the all other choices are wrong, so A and C it is.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1699726920.0","content":"-65 should be enough for web browsing..","comment_id":"1068018","upvote_count":"2","poster":"adamzet33"}],"poster":"JackDRipper","comment_id":"1063530","timestamp":"1699249140.0","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"9DJNggbgSzPXFaebLwh9","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"26","poster":"studying_1","content":"I guess answer should be \"dumps\", data. separators \nIf you have a Python object, you can convert it into a JSON string by using the json.dumps() method.","comment_id":"1071794","timestamp":"1700073900.0"},{"comment_id":"1106027","poster":"scarface35","upvote_count":"7","content":"given answer is wrong\n\nimport json\ndata = {\n \"measurement\":\"cpmCPUTotal1minRev\",\n \"collectionInterval\":\"default\",\n \"tagCount\":\"0\",\n \"policy\":None,\n \"devices\": [{\"model\":\"cisco 3500 Series WLC\",\"ipv4\":\"10.10.10.45\"}]\n}\n\nobj=json.dumps(data,separators=(',', ':'))\n\nprint(obj)","timestamp":"1703595660.0"},{"comment_id":"1287200","content":"json.dumps(data) --> This function converts the Python dictionary data into a JSON string.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\"measurement\":\"cpmCPUTotal1minRev\",\"collectionInterval\":\"default\",\"tagCount\":\"0\",\"policy\":null,\"devices\":[{\"model\":\"cisco 3500 Series WLC\",\"ipv4\":\"10.10.10.45\"}]}","timestamp":"1726904040.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"chiacche"},{"content":"given answer is incorrect\n\n\"dumps\" - data - separators=(',', ':')","comments":[{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"......................","comment_id":"1244064","timestamp":"1720409820.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1718305500.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1230059"},{"timestamp":"1716792360.0","comment_id":"1219350","upvote_count":"5","content":"I thought CCNP is for Network Engineers not for automation Engineer","poster":"Shri_Fcb10"},{"timestamp":"1710961620.0","content":"json.dumps(): used to serialize Python objects into a JSON formatted string\njson.loads(): used to deserialize a JSON formatted string into a Python object","comment_id":"1178626","upvote_count":"4","poster":"d4doppelganger"},{"poster":"slacker_at_work","content":"Code would indeed (as with the other comments below) look like:\nimport json\ndata = {\n \"measurement\": \"cpmCPUTotallminRev\",\n \"collectionInterval\": \"default\",\n \"tagCount\": \"0\",\n \"policy\": None,\n \"devices\": [{\"model\": \"Cisco 3500 Series WLC\", \"ipv4\": \"10.10.20.52\"}]\n}\nobj = json.dumps(data, separators=(',', ':')) <=======\nprint(obj)","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1168746","timestamp":"1709896260.0"},{"poster":"Alondrix","content":"Given answer appears correct.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699064880.0","comment_id":"1061872"}],"isMC":false,"question_id":907,"exam_id":324,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-401/image540.png"],"unix_timestamp":1699064880,"question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nDrag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the script to convert a Python object into a compact JSON object by removing space characters.
