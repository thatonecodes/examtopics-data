CPL to block calls with a destination URI with 8 or more digits on the Expressway-E.\n\nCPL (Call Policy Language) allows for advanced call routing and policy enforcement on Cisco Expressway. By configuring a CPL rule on the Expressway-E to block calls with a destination URI containing 8 or more digits, the engineer can effectively prevent toll fraud calls from being forwarded to the internal network. This approach ensures that only calls meeting the specified criteria (e.g., internal 5-digit extensions) are allowed to pass through to the Cisco UCM.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"An engineer reviews the configuration of a pair of Expressway servers for a company with the domain example.com.
