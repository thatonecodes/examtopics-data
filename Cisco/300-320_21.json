The fastest mechanism by far is the integrated OAM mechanism of SONET/SDH framing. Other mechanisms include Loss of optical Signal (LOS), PPP keepalives, and various LMI mechanisms. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a generic lightweight hello-based mechanism that can be used in conjunction with any type of media.\n\nTherefore, BFD should be the correct answer.","comment_id":"42012","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"I think the answer should be A.","timestamp":"1574127720.0","poster":"Sergio","comment_id":"22608","upvote_count":"2"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/8514-exam-300-320-topic-2-question-80-discussion/","timestamp":"2019-11-19 02:42:00","choices":{"A":"BFD","C":"TTL","D":"multipath A","B":"UDLD"},"topic":"2","answer":"Explanation","unix_timestamp":1574127720,"answers_community":[],"question_id":102,"question_text":"An ISP is offering two MPLS circuits to an office when one of the links fails.
