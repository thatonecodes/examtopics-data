This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the way that user input is handled by a web application. So by inserting malicious commands into the database hosted on Machine 1, an attacker can gain access to the database and potentially steal or manipulate data.\n\nOn the other hand, a buffer overflow is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code, allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected machine.
