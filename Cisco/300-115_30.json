You can also reposition a window by dragging it by the title bar.\nMost commands that use the \"Control\" or \"Escape\" keys are not supported and are not necessary to complete this simulation. The help command does not display all commands of the help system.\nScenario:\nYou work for SWITCH.com. They have just added a new switch (SwitchB) to the existing network as shown in the topology diagram. You have been tasked with completing the needed configuring of SwitchA and SwitchB.\nRouterA is currently configured correctly and is providing the routing function for devices on SwitchA and SwitchB. SwitchA is currently configured correctly, but will need to be modified to support the addition of SwitchB. SwitchB has a minimal configuration. SwitchA and SwitchB use Cisco as the enable password.\nAll interface commands must be entered at the physical interface level.\nWhen entering the range command, add a space between the interface numbers (e.g., fa0/1-2)\nConfiguration Requirements for SwitchA\n✑ The VTP and STP configuration models on Switch A should not be modified.\n✑ SwitchA needs to be the root switch for vlans 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23.\n✑ All other vlans should be left at their default values.\nConfiguration Requirements for SwitchB\n✑ Vlan21\n- Name: Marketing\n- will support two servers attached to fa0/9 and fa0/10\n✑ Vlan22\n- Name: Sales\n- will support two servers attached to fa0/13 and fa0/14\n✑ Vlan23\n- Name: Engineering\n- will support two servers attached to fa0/15 and fa0/16\n✑ Access ports that connect to server should transition immediately to forwarding state upon detecting the connection of a device\n✑ SwitchB VTP mode needs to be the same as SwitchA.\n✑ SwitchB must operate in the same spanning tree mode as SwitchA.\n✑ No routing is to be configured on SwitchB.\n✑ Only the SVI Vlan 1 is to be configured and it is to use address 192.168.1.11/24.\nInter-switch Connectivity Configuration Requirements\n✑ For operational and security reasons trunking should be unconditional and Vlans 1, 21, 22 and23 should be tagged when traversing the trunk link.\n✑ The two trunks between SwitchA and SwitchB need to be configured in a mode that allows for the maximum use of their bandwidth for all vlans. This mode should be done with a non-proprietary protocol, with SwitchA controlling activation.\n✑ Propagation of unnecessary broadcasts should be limited using manual pruning on this trunk link.\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44073700004.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44073700001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44073700006.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44073700005.png"],"isMC":false,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44073700000.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44073700003.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n44073700002.png"],"topic":"5","question_id":146,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/4103-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-1-discussion/","exam_id":297,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"8349","poster":"DimS","timestamp":"1566822780.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Should

Sw-A is a 2900x series (or lower) switch and does not support ISL trunking protocol (802.1Q is the only supported trunking protocol) so we can apply \"switchport mode trunk\" directly. \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\nSome guidelines for configuring SwitchA & SwitchB:\nConfiguration Requirements for SwitchA\n\nConfiguration Requirements for SwitchB\n\nInter-switch Connectivity Configuration Requirements:\n\nSome notes for this sim:\n+ You should check the initial status of both switches with these commands: show vtp status (transparent mode on switchA and we have to set the same mode on switchB), show spanning-tree [summary] (rapid-pvst mode on switchA and we have to set the same mode on switchB), show vlan (check the native vlan and the existence of vlan99), show etherchannel 1 port-channel and show ip int brief(check if Port-channel 1 has been created and make sure it is up),show\n(to check everything again).\nrun\n+ When using \"int range f0/x \"\" y\" command hit space bar before and after \"-\" otherwise the simulator does not accept it.\n+ You must create vlan 99 for the switchB. SwitchA already have vlan 99 configured.\n+ At the end, you can try to ping from SwitchB to RouterA (you can get the IP on RouterA via the show cdp neighbors detail on SwitchA), not sure if it can ping or not. If not, you can use the \"ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1\" on SwitchB.\n+ The name of SwitchA and SwitchB can be swapped or changed so be careful to put your configuration into appropriate switch.","answer":"Here are steps","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"Here are steps","timestamp":"2019-08-26 14:33:00","unix_timestamp":1566822780},{"id":"KoqHZdUtsxLxKl7wE2yp","choices":{"B":"command","C":"auth-proxy","D":"network","A":"EXEC"},"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/4217-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-100-discussion/","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_2/security/configuration/guide/fsecur_c/scfathor.html","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1566924780,"topic":"5","answer":"D","question_id":147,"exam_id":297,"timestamp":"2019-08-27 18:53:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which AAA authorization type applies security policies on a per-user basis?","answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"content":"The correct answer is C.","poster":"emmcosta","timestamp":"1577355180.0","comment_id":"32746","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"tamtas","timestamp":"1571468460.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Yes the answer is auth-proxy\nAuth-proxy—Applies specific security policies on a per-user basis.","comment_id":"16002"},{"timestamp":"1566924780.0","comment_id":"8597","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"timestamp":"1566968040.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"DimS","content":"Agree. \n\"To create a method list to enable authorization that applies specific security policies on a per-user basis, use the auth-proxy keyword. \"\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_usr_aaa/configuration/xe-3s/sec-usr-aaa-xe-3s-book/sec-cfg-authorizatn.html#GUID-0C7A8347-E7A7-4E7C-91BC-354DB56614BA","comment_id":"8657"}],"content":"should be auth-proxy ?","poster":"MIi2604"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"v4M8YZ1mY4wMoEk1uapF","answers_community":[],"answer":"B","topic":"5","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which feature is enabled automatically when you configure HSRP on an interface?","question_id":148,"discussion":[{"content":"\"ICMP redirect messages are automatically enabled on interfaces configured with HSRP.
