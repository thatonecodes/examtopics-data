The user has successfully authenticated, but they are not allowed access to whatever they are trying to access. No amount of backoffs or retries or looping is going to fix this. They can retry forever and will be told \"no\" repeatedly.

Use exponential backoff when retrying distributed services and other remote endpoints.\n\nExponential backoff is a common strategy for handling temporary errors like HTTP 403 (Forbidden). It involves progressively increasing the time between retries when a request encounters an error, which helps to avoid overloading the server and gives it some time to recover. This approach is more efficient and considerate than the other options listed."},{"timestamp":"1695218040.0","comment_id":"1012380","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"1398848","upvote_count":"1","poster":"examtopicstroilevw","content":"I agree with ImADude. that's only one of the possible issues, and the question does not say exactly what the problem is.","timestamp":"1742046480.0"},{"content":"If that's only one of the reasons, then you can't say exponential backoff will definitely handle the issue.
