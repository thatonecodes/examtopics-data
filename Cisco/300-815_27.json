The timeout keyword and argument set the interval length during which the call-park reminder ring is timed out or inactive. If the timeout keyword is not used, no reminder ring is sent to the extension that parked the call. The number of timeout intervals and reminder rings are configured with the limit keyword and argument. For example, a limit of 3 timeout intervals sends 2 reminder rings (interval 1, ring 1, interval 2, ring 2, interval 3). The timeout and limit keywords and arguments also set the maximum time that calls stay parked. For example, a timeout interval of 10 seconds and a limit of 5 timeout intervals (park-slot timeout 10 limit 5 ) will park calls for approximately 50 seconds.","poster":"FrankPic","timestamp":"1705437960.0"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/42997-exam-300-815-topic-1-question-44-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1611227100,"topic":"1","exam_id":320,"choices":{"B":"R2(config-ephone-dn)#park-slot timeout 60 limit 2 recall alternate 3002","D":"R2(config-ephone-dn)#park-slot timeout 30 limit 2 recall alternate 3002","A":"R2(config-ephone-dn)#park reservation-group 60","C":"R2(config-ephone-dn)#park reservation-group 1"},"question_text":"An engineer is configuring a call park feature in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express.
