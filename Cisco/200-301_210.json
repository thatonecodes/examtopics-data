Disable unused or unnecessary ports, interfaces, and services: By disabling any ports, interfaces, or services that are not actively needed, you reduce the potential attack surface of your network. Unused components may have vulnerabilities that could be exploited, so disabling them enhances security.\n\nE.

Correlates user activity with network events.\n\nNext-Generation IPS systems often have the ability to correlate user activity with network events. By monitoring and analyzing network traffic, they can associate specific network events with the user or device responsible for generating them. This correlation helps in identifying potential security incidents, pinpointing the source of malicious activities, and assisting in forensic investigations. This user-based visibility allows security teams to better understand the context and intent behind network events, enabling more effective incident response and threat mitigation.","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1702504080.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer","poster":"no_blink404","timestamp":"1701949380.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"917057"}]},{"id":"tGaGJQGHL4NjZh0yCFEs","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/87919-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-688-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1668796500,"question_id":1050,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"721501","content":"Per user attributes sounds like authorization.
