In this case after configuring this command, R3 will send hello packets to R5 every 50 seconds. But the default value of hello-interval is\n10 seconds and R5 is using it. Therefore we can think of a hello interval mismatch problem here. You can verify with the \"show ip ospf interface <interface>\" command on each router.\n\nSo we can see both hello and dead interval are mismatched because the dead interval always four times the value of hello interval, unless you manually configure the dead interval (with the ip ospf dead-interval <seconds> command)."},{"id":"uIXvE3NTQ2U1NqwOiZfW","isMC":true,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1571829900.0","content":"A is correct in my opinion..
