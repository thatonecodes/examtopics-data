If the WLCs are not added to the CMX server, the CMX dashboard will not show any data because it has no source of information about client devices and their movements.\n\nA. Configure Single Sign-On authentication: While Single Sign-On (SSO) might be useful for user access management, it is unrelated to the CMX dashboard's ability to collect and display data.\n\nC. Copy the exported Maps from CMX server to PI using SCP: This step is related to map management and is not necessary for enabling data collection from WLCs.\n\nD. Install an evaluation license to CMX server: Licensing issues might prevent certain features from working, but the absence of data on the dashboard is more likely due to the WLCs not being added to the CMX server.","comment_id":"1358442","timestamp":"1739909880.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1713599280.0","comment_id":"1048524","poster":"raphim","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOn the top of the screenshot you will see 5 APs - so APs already have been added.
