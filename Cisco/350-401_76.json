Routed access is the design that facilitates a migration from a traditional campus design to a programmable fabric design.\n\nIn a traditional campus design, the access layer is typically implemented using a Layer 2 switch with VLANs, and the distribution layer performs the routing between VLANs. In contrast, a programmable fabric design uses a routed access layer, where each access switch has an IP address and performs routing locally, eliminating the need for a separate distribution layer.\n\nBy implementing a routed access design, the company can gradually migrate from a traditional campus design to a programmable fabric design. The Layer 2 access and two-tier designs are both traditional campus designs and do not facilitate the migration to a programmable fabric design. The three-tier design includes a distribution layer, which is not needed in a programmable fabric design with routed access.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1699127940.0","comment_id":"889559"},{"poster":"habibmangal","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption D (routed access) is not necessarily wrong, but it is not the best answer to the question. Routed access can be used with a programmable fabric design, but it does not necessarily facilitate the migration from a traditional campus design to a programmable fabric design.\n\nIn a routed access design, the access layer switches are configured as Layer 3 devices, and traffic is routed directly from the access layer to the distribution or core layer. This approach can provide greater flexibility and scalability than traditional Layer 2 access designs, but it does not necessarily facilitate the migration to a programmable fabric design.\n\nOn the other hand, a three-tier architecture provides the necessary separation between the access, distribution, and core layers, which allows for greater flexibility and scalability when implementing programmable fabric designs.
