A typical connection from a distribution device to a remote device would have much less bandwidth than a connection at the network core. Attempting to use a remote device with a limited bandwidth connection as a transit path would generally produce excessive congestion at the remote device. The EIGRP stub routing feature can prevent this problem by preventing the remote device from advertising core routes back to the distribution devices. In the above example, routes learned by the remote device from distribution Device 1 will not be advertised to distribution Device 2. Therefore, distribution Device 2 will not use the remote device as a transit for traffic destined to the network core.","poster":"Ferm88","comment_id":"53269","timestamp":"1582257540.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"i dont know about anybody else but i sill stare mesmorized at all these answers wanting to choose all ....

Page 66 CCDP ARCH Foundation Guide. Following figure 2-14 in the book and below output, routes learned from spoke where stub configured are not advertised through the links (transit links) to other spokes from hub perspective. \n\nWith the EIGRP stub routing feature, the routers (typically\nthe spokes) configured as a stub will send a special peer information packet to all\nneighboring devices to report its status as a stub router. In turn, any EIGRP neighbor\nthat receives a packet informing it of the stub status will not query the stub device for\nany routes (see Figure 2-14), and a router that has a stub peer will not query that peer.\nTherefore, the stub device will depend on the hub router(s) to send proper updates to all\nother spokes. Also, when an EIGRP stub is configured at the spokes routers, they will not\nbe used as transit routers by the other spokes or hub routers.","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"50104","content":"Even with stub enabled, spokes will still advertise routes (connected, summaries, etc.) to hubs, except in the case it will be configured as stub receive-only (very uncommon).

In addition, when building topology with point-to-point links, consider using /31 subnets for the links to conserve address space when possible. Address the links out of the address space that is available on the spoke to allow for simple summarization.
