Enable Local Switching under the WLAN:\n\nLocal Switching allows traffic to be forwarded locally at the AP instead of tunneling all traffic back to the Wireless Controller. This is necessary for the locally-installed IP phone to function properly, as it requires local network access.\n\nD. Enable Office Extend AP on the Flex Profile:\n\nOffice Extend AP (OEAP) is a feature that allows remote APs to securely connect to the corporate network over the Internet.
