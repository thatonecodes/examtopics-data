This is a scenario where you have two interfaces bonded together on the server, but there is no valid port channel configuration on the switch. This way the server will send always the same MAC on both interfaces, which will appear twice on the switch on both its G1/0/1 and G1/0/2 ports, rather than only once on its port-channel interface.\n\nA is wrong, actually misleading, as if anything you'd have to change load balancing on the server as a rough workaround, not on the switch.\n\nC is wrong as the interface[s] would be down, therefore no MAC flapping would occur.\n\nD is wrong as the interface[s] would be down as well.","comments":[{"comment_id":"930494","upvote_count":"1","content":"I was going to choose A, since the load balancing configuration for port-channel on the switch would dictate which port was used for the MAC.\nBut you made a good point that the flapping is based on ingress learned MAC which would be controlled by the server.\nI believe too that if 2 interfaces were bundled into port-channel, then the switch would not consider the MAC appearing on two member interfaces as flapping.","timestamp":"1687436220.0","poster":"danman32"}],"timestamp":"1686932940.0","comment_id":"925381","poster":"Burik","upvote_count":"8"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - seen this in production multiple times, causes disasters\n\nSW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF - MAC flap caused by the same MAC learned via different interfaces\n- Invalid port channel can cause this - i.e a port-channel from a VSS configured to a Dell VLT which does not combine the management plane as VSS does and requires a port-channel to each node in the VLT otherwise a loop and MAC flap is caused\nHA flap - virtual cluster flapping between primary and secondary nodes\nHighly redundant network topologies (service provider) if not managed carefully will see this too","comment_id":"1351245","poster":"chmacnp","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1738654740.0"},{"comment_id":"1351244","timestamp":"1738654680.0","poster":"chmacnp","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - seen this in production multiple times, causes disasters\n\nSW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF - MAC flap caused by the same MAC learned via different interfaces\n- Invalid port channel can cause this - i.e a port-channel from a VSS configured to a Dell VLT which does not combine the management plane as VSS does and requires a port-channel to each node in the VLT otherwise a loop and MAC flap is caused\nHA flap - virtual cluster flapping between primary and secondary nodes\nHighly redundant network topologies (service provider) if not managed carefully will see this too","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720801440.0","comment_id":"1246904","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOnly 'B'.\nSwitch and server side can be conf'd as ON.
