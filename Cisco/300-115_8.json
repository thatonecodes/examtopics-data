All ports directly connected to end stations cannot create bridging loops in the network. Therefore, the edge port directly transitions to the forwarding state, and skips the listening and learning stages. Neither edge ports or PortFast enabled ports generate topology changes when the link toggles. An edge port that receives a BPDU immediately loses edge port status and becomes a normal spanning tree port. At this point, there is a user-configured value and an operational value for the edge port state. The Cisco implementation maintains that the PortFast keyword be used for edge port configuration. This makes the transition to RSTP simpler.","poster":"robergalvan","timestamp":"1549062420.0","comment_id":"264","upvote_count":"4"}],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2019-02-02 00:07:00","answer_ET":"BD","unix_timestamp":1549062420,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"What two things occur when an RSTP edge port receives a BPDU?
