With IKEv1, when using aggressive mode, the initiator and responder identities are passed in cleartext.\n\nExplanation:\n\nB. In IKEv1, aggressive mode negotiates faster than main mode because it requires fewer messages to establish the IKE SA (Security Association). However, aggressive mode in IKEv1 has been identified as less secure than main mode because it is more susceptible to attacks.\n\nE. With IKEv1, when using aggressive mode, the initiator and responder identities are passed in cleartext, which can potentially expose sensitive information. In IKEv2, the identities are protected by encryption, providing an additional layer of security.","timestamp":"1679899380.0","upvote_count":"8","poster":"sull3y","comment_id":"851814"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BE\nThe given answers are correct.\nhttps://www.omnisecu.com/tcpip/ikev1-main-aggressive-and-quick-mode-message-exchanges.php#:~:text=The%20first%20two%20messages%20in%20Aggressive%20mode%20exchange%20include%20almost%20everything%20required%20to%20form%20IKE%20SA.%20IKEv1%20Phase1%20Aggressive%20Mode%20is%20quicker%20than%20Main%20Mode%2C%20but%20endpoint%20identities%20are%20exchanged%20in%20Clear%2DText.","comment_id":"1255162","poster":"Bubu3k","timestamp":"1721930700.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1672288260.0","comment_id":"760579","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nanswer is correct, A is wrong, IKE_SA_INIT is IKE V2 Packet","poster":"amtf8888"}],"question_id":351,"timestamp":"2022-12-29 05:31:00"},{"id":"JIJ7118hwKSzN96wbwKX","exam_id":327,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1670845980,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/wsa/wsa11-5/user_guide/b_WSA_UserGuide_11_5_1/b_WSA_UserGuide_11_5_1_chapter_01011.html","poster":"Mark2341","comments":[{"content":"Handle personally identifiable information with care: If you choose to decrypt an end-userâ€™s HTTPS session, the Web Security appliance access logs and reports may contain personally identifiable information.

This is done by analyzing the device's MAC address, IP address, and other characteristics. Once the device has been profiled, it can be assigned to a specific security policy.\n\nPosture agents are software that is installed on endpoints. They monitor the endpoint's security posture and report back to ISE.
