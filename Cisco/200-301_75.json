The correct option describing MAC learning is:\n\nA. adds unknown source MAC addresses to the CAM table\n\nExplanation:\n\n When a switch receives an Ethernet frame, it examines the source MAC address in the frame's header.\n If the MAC address is not already in the switch's Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table (also known as MAC address table), the switch adds an entry to the CAM table associating the MAC address with the port on which the frame was received.\n This process is known as MAC learning.\n Over time, the switch builds a table mapping MAC addresses to the ports through which they are learned, allowing it to forward frames more efficiently by only sending them out the appropriate port based on their destination MAC address."},{"timestamp":"1722491640.0","content":"nice pacs","comment_id":"1259207","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719311100.0","comment_id":"1236845","poster":"DominikRWeber","content":"Selected Answer: A\nit's A"},{"poster":"BTK0311","timestamp":"1714392720.0","content":"WTF???","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1204004"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nI can't imagine how you answer B -,-","poster":"TNgen9","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1711343340.0","comment_id":"1182220"},{"comment_id":"1175597","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1710653160.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nit´s A","poster":"[Removed]"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer is A","poster":"ladarius01","comment_id":"1163563","timestamp":"1709302620.0"},{"poster":"squagmire","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1708961460.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nyea its A","comment_id":"1159882"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"f2faf2e","timestamp":"1708448940.0","comment_id":"1154860","content":"Selected Answer: A\nit is A"},{"comment_id":"1145345","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nJust to be clear!","timestamp":"1707468660.0","poster":"JulesAZ"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"picho707","comment_id":"1142557","timestamp":"1707250140.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWho is answering these questions?"}],"question_text":"How does MAC learning function?","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/133092-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1332-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1707250140,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"36zKOcge1CtjT2yRbGzF","choices":{"A":"F0/2","D":"F0/10","C":"F0/12","B":"F0/20"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732261620.0","poster":"bymrdas","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt´s A","comment_id":"1215448"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1193471","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1728625920.0"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image360.png"],"question_text":"Which interface is used to send traffic to the destination network?\n\n//IMG//","exam_id":288,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-04-11 07:52:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/138405-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1333-discussion/","question_id":374,"unix_timestamp":1712814720},{"id":"ozEKD0i5IXlAaze9rigm","answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image361.png"],"isMC":false,"answer":"","exam_id":288,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/135292-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1334-discussion/","answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image362.png"],"timestamp":"2024-03-06 10:28:00","topic":"1","question_text":"SIMULATION\n-\n\n\nGuidelines\n-\n\nThis is a lab item in which tasks will be performed on virtual devices\n\n• Refer to the Tasks tab to view the tasks for this lab item.\n• Refer to the Topology tab to access the device console(s) and perform the tasks.\n• Console access is available for all required devices by clicking the device icon or using the tab(s) above the console window.\n• All necessary preconfigurations have been applied.\n• Do not change the enable password or hostname for any device.\n• Save your configurations to NVRAM before moving to the next item.\n• Click Next at the bottom of the screen to submit this lab and move to the next question.\n• When Next is clicked the lab closes and cannot be reopened.\n\n\nTopology\n-\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nTasks\n-\n\nRefer to the topology.
