This default buffer size allows the router to hold a moderate number of log messages before they are overwritten. By increasing the buffer size, it can hold a larger number of log messages, allowing for more extensive logging during troubleshooting.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"pepgua","comment_id":"927915","timestamp":"1687207440.0"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/107895-exam-300-410-topic-1-question-248-discussion/","choices":{"D":"(config)#logging buffered 4096 informational","A":"#logging buffered 4096 critical","C":"(config)#logging buffered 16000 informational","B":"#logging buffered 16000 critical"},"exam_id":303,"unix_timestamp":1682782920},{"id":"riIELjC8AwYfbjf1ygvA","timestamp":"2022-09-19 19:17:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/82846-exam-300-410-topic-1-question-249-discussion/","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"D":"IPv6 Destination Guard","B":"IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard","C":"IPv6 Prefix Guard","A":"IPv6 Binding Security Table"},"answer":"D","question_id":167,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"Which feature minimizes DoS attacks on an IPv6 network?","exam_id":303,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1252023","timestamp":"1721515560.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is corerct","poster":"[Removed]"},{"poster":"inteldarvid","timestamp":"1689352980.0","comment_id":"951678","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD correct:\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/7600/ios/15S/configuration/guide/7600_15_0s_book/IPv6_Security.html#:~:text=on%20the%20VLAN.-,IPv6%20%2D%20Destination%20Guard,%2Dservice%20(DoS)%20attacks.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1687207740.0","comment_id":"927923","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFrom Cisco:\nIPv6 - Destination Guard\nThe Destination Guard feature helps in minimizing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
