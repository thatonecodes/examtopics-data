These endpoints are remote endpoints that point to a port that is not part of a virtual Port Channel (vPC), also called an orphan port, on a vPC peer leaf. They are special endpoints because they are remote, but they are learned through vPC synchronization on the control plane instead of through data-plane learning from the actual traffic. As a result of vPC synchronization, on-peer endpoints have MAC address, IP address, and EPG information, unlike other remote endpoints, which have either bridge domain (MAC address) or VRF (IP address) information.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"mdriraa","timestamp":"1722818280.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/145015-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-284-discussion/","isMC":true,"exam_id":312,"answer_description":"","topic":"1"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"300-620","numberOfQuestions":311,"id":312,"provider":"Cisco","isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":41},"__N_SSP":true}
