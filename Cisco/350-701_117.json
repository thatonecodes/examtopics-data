Cyber threats posing as authorized entities\n\n This describes phishing or impersonation attacks, not specifically a cloud data breach.\n\n❌ B. Exploitation of cloud application access\n\n While gaining unauthorized access to a cloud application can be a method used in a breach, it does not define the breach itself (which is the actual leakage of private data).\n\n❌ C. Deprivation of computing resources\n\n This refers to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which disrupts access to cloud services but does not involve a data breach.","comment_id":"1400898","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1355152","comments":[{"comment_id":"1391063","upvote_count":"1","content":"Both B and D are correct.
