The WSA is a full proxy, maintaining separate sessions btw. client - proxy and proxy - webserver. The source IP of the response is surely the ip of the proxy in the client-proxy connection with Explicit mode, when the client directly communicates with the proxy. However, I am not sure the redirected Transparent mode, as again the proxy is sitting in between the client and the webserver. I assume that the client does not get the response directly from the webserver, but rather from the proxy. So the source ip should be from the proxy (or does it spoof the source ip?)."},{"poster":"squirrelzzz","timestamp":"1710867600.0","comment_id":"1177553","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nTransparent means it has no L3 interface","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Leogxn","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nReference: CCNP And CCIE Security Core SCOR 350-701 Official Cert Guide-> Therefore in Transparent mode, WSA uses its own lP address to initiate a new connection the Web Server","comment_id":"955683","comments":[{"timestamp":"1722237300.0","poster":"Bubu3k","comment_id":"1257306","upvote_count":"2","content":"The only problem is that that quote is nowhere in the OCG...
