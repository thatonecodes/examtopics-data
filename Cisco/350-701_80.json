By isolating the infected endpoint, it helps contain the threat and prevents lateral movement of the malware within the network. This helps in minimizing the impact of the infection and allows security teams to investigate and remediate the compromised endpoint effectively.","comment_id":"902472","poster":"GCalvo","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1684573800.0"},{"poster":"btoopalow","timestamp":"1683261660.0","comment_id":"889787","upvote_count":"3","content":"C isolation stops all network except communications to amp cloud for malware analysis"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe answer should be C.","comment_id":"885661","upvote_count":"3","poster":"unclemonkeyboy","timestamp":"1682893380.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhen it says isolation, the question is isolation from what?
