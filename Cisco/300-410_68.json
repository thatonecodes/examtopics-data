R2 learn 192.168.200.0 route from EIGRP and R2 redistribute EIGRP in OSPF, then R2 advertive 192.168.200.0 to R1. R1 learns 192.168.200.0 from R2 via OSPF. OSPF has AD 90 and RIP 120, so OSPF route become better than RIP route, but, for a route redistribution there is a rule that says the route must be in routing table and the source of redistribution must be the source of this route in route table, in this case, the RIP. When R1 learn this route in OSPF, the OSPF route replace the RIP route in route table, so the rule is broken and the redistribution stop working, then R1 stops redistribuing 192.168.200.0 to EIGRP and R2 stop reciving this route and R2 stops redistribute this route in OSPF so R1 won't recive this route from OSPF anymore, then OSPF route is removed from LSDB and RIB so RIP route go to the route table and the redistribution to EIGRP starts again and the problem starts over and over\n\nIf you redistribute RIP in OSPF in R1, R2 is gonna have this route as the best route from OSPF, so it does not matter if R2 learns it from EIGRP or NOT, because OSPF has AD 90 and External EIGRP 170.","comments":[{"poster":"HungarianDish_111","upvote_count":"4","content":"Upvoted your comment.

is correct","poster":"[Removed]"},{"comment_id":"1141774","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThere are a lot of explanations but none explain why D is correct. Here my take on why D is correct: EIGRP routes are redistributed on R2 to OSPF (redistribute eigrp 100). This would result in a OSPF type 2 route. If you would have any route \"competing\" with another identical type 2 route, the more preferred route is a OSPF type 1 route, If you redistribute RIP on R1, and make the routes a type 1 route, they always have preference in the OSPF domain.\n\nThe answer fixes the problem but there are better solutions to solve this problem. In order of preference: There should be no redistribution from OSPF to EIGRP on R2 (option 1) OR only routes originating from EIGRP itself should be redistributed on R2 (option 2) OR you can lower the AD on RIP learned routes on R1 (option 3).\n\nMore info on OSPF path selection order: https://networklessons.com/ospf/ospf-path-selection-explained","poster":"Pietjeplukgeluk","timestamp":"1707196320.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nOption \"D\" correct. \nthe key point is router 1. because it has to redistribute rip into eigrp and rip into ospf.

But through process of elimination, we can see that A & D are wrong because \"transport input ssh telnet\" already allows remote access.\n\nSo we are just left with two answers. From the image we can see the user is using \"telnet\" to remote access, so we must choose C. Although we cannot see an ACL, we can see all configuration looks correct and the connection is failing.

In Cisco IOS route-maps, the first match is applied. Since the deny statement comes before the permit statement in the route-map, the deny will take precedence.\n\nTherefore, even if you add a second sequence with \"permit 20,\" the deny sequence with \"deny 10\" is still in effect, and the routes for 1.1.1.0/24 would continue to be denied.\n\nTo achieve the desired result of allowing routes for 1.1.1.0/24 while still filtering other routes, you need to modify the existing deny sequence to permit the desired network. Option B correctly suggests modifying the route-map to permit the access list instead of denying it, effectively allowing routes for 1.1.1.0/24.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1710664860.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1175681","poster":"bk989","content":"wrong. \"Which action restores the routes from neighbors while still filtering 1.1.1.0/24?\" Wuestion wants to filter out 1.1.1.0/24 and allow other routes.
