Configure the version of SSH.\n\nExplanation:\nTo generate an RSA key for SSH on a router, you need to configure the version of SSH. This involves specifying the desired version of SSH to be used on the router, such as SSH version 1 or SSH version 2. The specific commands to configure the SSH version may vary depending on the router's operating system.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to generating an RSA key for SSH:\nA. Configuring VTY (Virtual Terminal) access is unrelated to generating an RSA key for SSH. VTY access controls remote management access to a router using protocols such as Telnet or SSH.\nC. Assigning a DNS domain name is not directly related to generating an RSA key for SSH. DNS (Domain Name System) is used for domain name resolution and mapping domain names to IP addresses.\nD. Creating a user with a password is unrelated to generating an RSA key for SSH. User creation and password assignment are part of configuring user authentication and authorization on a router, but not specifically related to SSH key generation."},{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"780137","timestamp":"1689686460.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct"},{"timestamp":"1689162000.0","content":"- The Cisco IOS image used must be a k9 (crypto) image to support SSH.\n- the hostname must be different from the default one\n- define domain-name of the DNS","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"773488","poster":"sassasasasdccadsca"},{"content":"little things like this convince me that the only way to pass the CCNA is to do a bunch of brain dumps prior to taking it","timestamp":"1682973720.0","comment_id":"709459","upvote_count":"2","poster":"cormorant"},{"comment_id":"619808","upvote_count":"7","poster":"Liuka_92","timestamp":"1671633180.0","content":"Use this trick to remember easy: DRUL\nD: domain name R: rsa key U: username L: line vty"},{"poster":"Crazey","upvote_count":"1","content":"B.
