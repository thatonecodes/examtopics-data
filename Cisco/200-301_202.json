One of the attacks that it prevents is DHCP Starvation attack, which is a dynial of service.\n\nCommon Attacks Prevented by DHCP Snooping\nDHCP Spoofing Attack\nDHCP spoofing occurs when an attacker attempts to respond to DHCP requests and trying to list itself (spoof) as the default gateway or DNS server, hence, initiating a man in the middle attack. With that, it is possible that they can intercept traffic from users before forwarding to the real gateway or perform DoS by flooding the real DHCP server with requests to choke IP address resources.\n\nDHCP Starvation Attack\nDHCP starvation attack commonly targets network DHCP servers, in a bid to flood the authorized DHCP server with DHCP REQUEST messages using spoofed source MAC addresses. The DHCP server will respond to all requests, not knowing this is a DHCP starvation attack, by assigning available IP addresses, resulting in the depletion of DHCP pool.\n\nhttps://community.fs.com/blog/what-is-dhcp-snooping-and-how-it-works.html","timestamp":"1645557120.0","poster":"Samuelpn96"}],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","question_id":1009,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1629652320,"exam_id":288,"timestamp":"2021-08-22 19:12:00","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"propagates VLAN information between switches","D":"provides DDoS mitigation","B":"rate-limits certain traffic","A":"listens to multicast traffic for packet forwarding"},"answers_community":["B (91%)","9%"],"question_text":"Which function is performed by DHCP snooping?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/60268-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-650-discussion/"},{"id":"fJHOqU1Vdc69RgfgIhwK","answer_ET":"","answer":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1659571020.0","poster":"sasquatchshrimp","comment_id":"642129","content":"No one:\nCisco: A guy is doing something, what are the exact steps and order?","upvote_count":"42","comments":[{"comment_id":"731558","content":"Hahahaha gggggggggold :D","poster":"kamlo","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1669816500.0"}]},{"content":"Doesn't seem correct... it should be enable secret instead of service password encryption.","timestamp":"1630183020.0","upvote_count":"14","poster":"django1001","comment_id":"434145"},{"poster":"msr96msr96","comment_id":"1340767","timestamp":"1736932560.0","content":"enable secret cisco123\nsecret is for hashing not for encryption\nservice password-encryption this command is for encryption\nthe answer is not include enable secret","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729414440.0","comment_id":"1300370","poster":"Joshua25","content":"What is a 'local user database' on a router?\nThere is no mention of this term in the official certification guide.\nGoogle <\"local user database\" site:cisco.com> does not give any results about a router.\nIt's mentioned in some articles related to security appliances but not about routers.\nYou Cisco company don't even use this term.
