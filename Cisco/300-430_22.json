Nonroutable IP address assigned to the virtual interface: The virtual interface on the WLC must be configured with a nonroutable IP address (e.g., 1.1.1.1) to facilitate web authentication. This ensures that clients are redirected to the external web server for authentication.\n\nE. Preauth ACL to allow access to the external web server: A preauthentication ACL (preauth ACL) must be configured to allow clients to access the external web server for authentication before they are granted full network access.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA. WLAN being not present in the default AP group: This is not required for web authentication configuration.\n\nB. HTTPS redirection enabled: While HTTPS redirection can enhance security, it is not a mandatory requirement for external web authentication.\n\nD. Web-auth secure web option enabled: This is optional and not required for basic external web authentication.\n\nThus, the two required elements are a nonroutable IP address assigned to the virtual interface and a preauth ACL to allow access to the external web server.","timestamp":"1739384520.0","poster":"rrahim","comment_id":"1355719"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"tera671","comment_id":"1007608","timestamp":"1726316820.0","content":"Selected Answer: DE\nspoto answer DE"},{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"968475","poster":"AhcMez","timestamp":"1722456360.0","content":"i mean BD of course","upvote_count":"2"}],"comment_id":"968474","timestamp":"1722456300.0","poster":"AhcMez","content":"confused question , i go to CD"},{"content":"C and E. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/217457-configure-and-troubleshoot-external-web.html.\nACL is automatically created in 9800 but is required.","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1721658720.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"977924","timestamp":"1723308960.0","content":"I believe Minsait is correct.
