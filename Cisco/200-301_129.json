Global unicast addresses are unique, globally reachable addresses that are assigned to devices that need to communicate with other devices over the Internet. They are similar to IPv4 public addresses in that they can be used to reach devices on other networks, but they are structured differently and use a different address space.\n\nGlobal unicast addresses are identified by the prefix \"2000::/3\" and are assigned to devices by their network administrator or by an Internet service provider (ISP). They are used for communication between devices on different networks, such as between a device on a LAN and a device on the Internet.\n\nIt's important to note that global unicast addresses are not the same as link-local addresses, which are used for communication within a single network segment or link and are not intended to be routable over the Internet. Link-local addresses are identified by the prefix \"FE80::/10\" and are automatically generated by the device when it is connected to a network.","poster":"Alizadeh","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727932920.0","comment_id":"747126"},{"content":"The type of IPv6 address that is publicly routable in the same way as IPv4 public addresses is D. global unicast.\n\nGlobal unicast addresses are similar to public IPv4 addresses in that they are globally unique and can be routed on the public Internet.
