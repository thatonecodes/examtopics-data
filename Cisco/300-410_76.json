By sending rapid failure detection notices to the routing protocols in the local router to initiate the routing table recalculation process, BFD contributes to greatly reduced overall network convergence time. Figure 1 shows a simple network with two routers running OSPF and BFD. When OSPF discovers a neighbor (1) it sends a request to the local BFD process to initiate a BFD neighbor session with the OSPF neighbor router (2). The BFD neighbor session with the OSPF neighbor router is established (3).","comment_id":"631483","poster":"IceFireSoul","timestamp":"1657821540.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"621196","poster":"Dacusai","timestamp":"1656007560.0","content":"B is the correct answer.
