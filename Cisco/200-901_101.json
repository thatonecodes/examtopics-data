Why write tests for stuff you know isn’t going to\npass? Isn’t all of this testing just wasted effort? The benefit of this style of development is\nthat it starts with the end goal in mind, by defining success right away. The test you create is laser focused on the application’s purpose and a clear outcome. Many programmers add too much to their code by trying to anticipate future needs or building in too much complexity for an otherwise simple problem. TDD works extremely well with the iterative nature of Agile development, with the side benefit of having plenty of test cases to show that the software works.\n\""},{"comment_id":"803387","timestamp":"1675956420.0","poster":"nunyabeez","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think this should be A. Writing tests first forces you to think about what the code is actually supposed to do and avoid superfluous things. \n\nWhile testing -can- lead to quality code, it doesn't automatically lead to that. It only ensures that the code works.
