During failure on one spoke link, the traffic from that site can be sent to a neighboring site for it to be forwarded to the hub site. But during peak hours, a link is overloaded and traffic is re-routed to a neighbor, which subsequently becomes overloaded. This overload results in network traffic oscillation as the load varies at each spoke site. This design provides more redundancy but not more resiliency because the routing protocol must process many alternate paths to determine the lowest cost path.
