To configure switch port 5/1 to send CDP packets to configure an attached Cisco IP phone to trust tagged traffic on its access port, the command \"platform qos trust extend cos 5\" should be used. This command enables the switch port to trust the CoS value of incoming packets with a CoS value of 5 or higher.\n\nOption A, \"platform qos trust extend cos 3\", specifies that incoming packets with a CoS value of 3 or higher should be trusted, which is not consistent with the requirement to trust packets with a CoS value of 5 or higher.
