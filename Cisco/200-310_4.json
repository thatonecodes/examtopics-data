Each ISR has integrated switch ports that then connect to the users broadband connection. The solution uses a permanent always-on IPsec VPN tunnel back to the corporate network. This architecture provides for centralized IT security management, corporate-pushed security policies, and integrated identity services. In addition, this solution supports the enterprise teleworker needs through advanced applications such as voice and video. For example, the enterprise teleworker can take advantage of toll bypass, voicemail, and advanced IP phone features not available in the PSTN.\n\nEnterprise Teleworker Module -\nThe enterprise teleworker module consists of a small office or a mobile user who needs to access services of the enterprise campus. As shown in Figure 2-14, mobile users connect from their homes, hotels, or other locations using dialup or Internet access lines. VPN clients are used to allow mobile users to securely access enterprise applications. The Cisco Virtual Office solution provides a solution for teleworkers that is centrally managed using small integrated service routers\n(ISR) in the VPN solution. IP phone capabilities are also provided in the Cisco Virtual Office solution, providing corporate voice services for mobile users.","isMC":true,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01522/0002000001.png"],"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2019-05-02 14:47:00","question_id":18,"topic":"1","choices":{"G":"Leased lines","E":"Cisco 2900 Series Router","D":"Catalyst 3560 Series Switch","B":"Cisco 880 Series Router","A":"Cisco Unified IP Phone","F":"MPLS Layer 3 VPN","C":"Aironet Office Extend Access Point"},"unix_timestamp":1556801220,"exam_id":289,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/1136-exam-200-310-topic-1-question-21-discussion/","answer":"ABE","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1579372260.0","poster":"jhoan","content":"PARA MI ES ABC","comment_id":"40419"},{"content":"The correct answer is A, B, C.
