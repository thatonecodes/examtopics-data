Does this make any sense to you?\n\n\nThe correct answers are A and E.\n\nTo add a switch as a Network Access Device (NAD) in Cisco ISE for 802.1X authentications, the switch must be configured to communicate with ISE using either RADIUS or TACACS+. Specifically, the switch must be configured with the IP address of the ISE server, the authentication port, the accounting port, and the shared secret.\n\nIn the exhibit, the IP address of the ISE server is 192.168.255.16, which is the IP address of the Monitoring and Troubleshooting (MnT) node. Therefore, options B, C, and D are incorrect as they do not have the correct IP address for the ISE server.\n\nOption A has the correct IP address for the ISE server and specifies RADIUS as the protocol, which is used for 802.1X authentications. Option E also has the correct IP address for the ISE server and specifies RADIUS as the protocol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and E.","comments":[{"comment_id":"857011","poster":"Cnoteone","timestamp":"1696074840.0","content":"My mistake...\nSo we must point Radius settings to the PSN only. \nRADIUS Server Configuration on the Switch\nConfigure the switch to interact with Cisco ISE as the RADIUS source server by entering the following commands:\n\n!\nradius-server <ISE Name> \n\n!

RSA SecurID two-factor authentication consists of the PIN of the user and an individually registered RSA SecurID token that generates single-use token codes based on a time code algorithm.

Each RSA SecurID token is unique, and it is not possible to predict the value of a future token based on past tokens. Thus, when a correct token code is supplied together with a PIN, there is a high degree of certainty that the person is a valid user.

The Low-Impact mode is ideal for a Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot environments where thin clients have to download the operating system from the network before attempting network authentication.
