When the link comes up, the switch does not forward traffic to or from this port until the port is assigned to a VLAN. The source MAC address from the first packet of a new host on the dynamic port is sent to the VMPS, which attempts to match the MAC address to a VLAN in the VMPS database. If there is a match, the VMPS sends the VLAN number for that port. If there is no match, the VMPS either denies the request or shuts down the port (depending on the VMPS secure mode setting).\"\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12-2/20ew/configuration/guide/config/vmps.html","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1573571340.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"10784","timestamp":"1568288520.0","content":"check output from my switch - the correct answer is C.
