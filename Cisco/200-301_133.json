You need 2 bits: (2^2) = 4 subnets. You have to borrow the two bits from the host ID. This way, the subnet mask, which is a /25 now, becomes a /27:\n\n255.255.255.111xxxxx = 255.255.255.224\n\nThere are 5 bits remaining on the host ID. You have (2^5 – 2) = 30 addresses, and it fits the subnet on which you have the most users (floor 2).\n\nYou started with a 192.168.0.0/25 subnet and you ended up with a 192.168.0.0/27 subnet.\nAnswer C is correct."},{"upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"599529","content":"16 addresses per floor is not enough so 32 per floor is needed\nsimply count from /32=1 /31=2 /30=4....../27=32\n/27 per floor is the answer","timestamp":"1652178360.0","poster":"kentsing","comments":[{"comment_id":"611981","timestamp":"1654451460.0","content":"That's how I got the answer quickly :)","upvote_count":"2","poster":"DaveDaSpade"}]},{"content":"Subnet Mask: 128 192 224 240\nHosts: 128 64 32 16\n/Cider 25 26 27 28\n\n/27 is the smallest number that will meet the number of hosts required for all the floors","timestamp":"1635900120.0","poster":"Shamwedge","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"471870"},{"comment_id":"340901","content":"here should be add vlan also, in this situation question was a little misunderstand, but its cisco tricky question","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1619081040.0","poster":"Alibaba"},{"content":"C is correct\n/27 mask will give 30 host for each subnet (2^5-2)=30","timestamp":"1618628160.0","comment_id":"337325","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","content":"/25 gives us 126 maximum hosts per subnet (Total no. hosts in the building)\nC. 192.168.0.0/25 as summary and 192.168.0.0/27 for each floor","comment_id":"337327","timestamp":"1618628400.0","poster":"ZUMY"}],"poster":"ZUMY"},{"content":"We are Keeping in mind not to waste IPs.\n/27 gives us 30 maximum hosts per subnet (per floor)\n/25 gives us 126 maximum hosts per subnet (Total no. hosts in the building)\nC. 192.168.0.0/25 as summary and 192.168.0.0/27 for each floor","comment_id":"332305","timestamp":"1618030920.0","poster":"bigbux","upvote_count":"6"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"282890","poster":"hokieman91","timestamp":"1612376160.0","content":"C. 192.168.0.0/25 as summary and 192.168.0.0/27 for each floor\nThis gives each floor separate networks with 30 hosts (plus network id and plus BC address). \n/25 allows us to summarize the four /27 networks with 30 hosts"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"273354","content":"C is correct. given a /27 mask","timestamp":"1611271740.0","poster":"admin1982"},{"poster":"jasten","upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"260725","timestamp":"1609903860.0","content":"The main goal is always to make efficient use of IPs (Waste as little as possible). \"B\" & \"D\" it is not enough to cover all the users for each floor. \"A\" waste many IPs.
