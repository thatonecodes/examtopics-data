Traffic policing mechanisms such as Class-based policing or Committed Access Rate (CAR) also have marking capabilities in addition to rate-limiting capabilities. Instead of dropping the excess traffic, traffic policing can alternatively mark and then send the excess traffic. This allows the excess traffic to be re-marked with a lower priority before the excess traffic is sent out. Traffic shapers, on the other hand, do not re-mark traffic; these only delay excess traffic bursts to conform to a specified rate.","timestamp":"1740761760.0","poster":"G0y0","comment_id":"1363177"},{"comment_id":"1289202","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727306580.0","content":"The correct answer to the question \"CAR is an example of which technique?\" is A. traffic policing.\n\nThis is because CAR (Committed Access Rate) is a traffic policing tool used to limit the input or output transmission rate on an interface based on certain criteria, as mentioned in your document on page 318 under the section on Policing:\n\n\"Policing tools include class-based policing and committed access rate (CAR).
