To meet the requirements of securing end-user ports with minimum configuration effort, logging security breaches, and retaining the switch configuration in case of a device restart, the following configuration should be used:\nthis configuration will enable port security with sticky MAC addresses, which will allow the switch to dynamically learn the MAC addresses of connected devices and save them to the running configuration. If a security breach occurs, the switch will automatically shut down the port and log the event. The spanning-tree portfast and bpduguard commands are added to minimize the risk of a rogue device connecting to the port and disrupting the network.","poster":"Rocky_Truth","timestamp":"1678238460.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1676711520,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-02-18 10:12:00","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":"switchport port-security\nswitchport port-security violation restrict\nswitchport port-security mac-address sticky","D":"switchport port-security\nswitchport port-security max 1\nswitchport port-security violation shutdown","C":"switchport port-security\nswitchport port-security violation shutdown\nswitchport port-security mac-address dynamic","A":"switchport port-security\nswitchport port-security max 1\nswitchport port-security mac-address sticky"}},{"id":"vp9FRX9COcrg48Af54jB","choices":{"B":"Cisco Intersight","A":"Ansible","C":"Chef","D":"POAP"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1682403960,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-25 08:26:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/107394-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-382-discussion/","exam_id":326,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":315,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nWith POAP you can have clean device and it will download OS and Config.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"880033","poster":"Scheldon","timestamp":"1729837560.0"}],"question_text":"A network engineer needs a solution that simplifies the initial deployment of Cisco Nexus Series Switches.
