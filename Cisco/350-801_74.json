I we look both dial peers, one is targeting to the CUCM, and the another one targeting to ISP, but even most important, both dial peers are using session protocol sipv2. So in order of allow this communication, taking in mind those dial peers, you need only to configure allow-connections sip to sip.\nAnother interesting thing is that it is not necessary to configure anything in Ip address trusted list, because both IP's (ISP and CUCM) need to be trusted, they are already trusted since they are specified in dial-peers.\nSo I thing, that the closest answer is B. do no need anything else to that configuration works fine in compliance of the toll fraud prevention requirements.\nNote .- I do not understand the reason to be of these \"H323\" text in the drawing (between the CUCM and CUBE icons). Or the drawing is wrong, or the dial peers are wrong.
