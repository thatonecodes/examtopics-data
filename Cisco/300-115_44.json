Primary server here is a switch with ID \"aabb.cc00.2b00\", and switches 1 and 2 have these IDs:\nServer SW1 ID is : aabb.cc00.2500\nServer SW2 ID is : aabb.cc00.2600\n\nso none of them is primary!\n\nSW4 is out of the question since it is in CLIENT mode\n\nObviously answer E does not work as well as the switch is in VTP client mode which does not allow any vlan creations whatsoever.\n\nSo it seems cisco is playing full of us, since it seems NONE of the answers are really correct.

When this occurs, any packets destined for a MAC address not in the table will be flooded to all other ports. This would allow the attacker to see the flooded traffic and capture information. The switch would be essentially functioning as a hub in this case.\nTwo methods of mitigating these attacks are:\n\nImplementing port security -\n\nImplementing VLAN access maps -\nVLAN hopping is an attack that allows an attacker to access network resources on a different VLAN without passing through a router. The attacker can create a packet with two 802.1Q VLAN headers on it (called double tagging) and send it to a switch. The switch port will strip off the first header and leave the second. The second header will be seen as the originating VLAN, allowing the attacker access to a VLAN they are not connected to. Executing the switchport mode access command on all non-trunk ports can help prevent this attack. Pruning the native VLAN from a trunk link can also help.\nVLAN hopping is a security concern because it can be accomplished without the packet passing through a router and its security access lists. For this reason, private VLANs and VACLs should be used to secure access between VLANs. Techniques to prevent these attacks are:\nPrevent automatic trunk configurations by explicitly turning off Dynamic Trunking Protocol on all unused ports\nPlace unused ports in a common unrouted VLAN\nMAC spoofing is an attack that allows an attacking device to receive frames intended for a different host by changing an assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a networked device to a different one. Changing the assigned MAC address may allow the device to bypass access control lists on servers or routers, either hiding a computer on a network or allowing it to impersonate another computer.\nA rogue device is a device attached to the network that is not under the control of the organization. This term is normally used to mean a wireless device, perhaps an access point that is not operating as a part of the company's infrastructure. Employees may bring their own access points and connect them to the network so they can use their computer wirelessly. This creates a security gap since the device is probably not secured to protect the traffic. An attacker could connect a rogue access point to a company's network and capture traffic from outside the company's premises.\nObjective:\n\nLayer 2 Technologies -\nSub-Objective:\nConfigure and verify switch administration\nReferences:\nCisco > Products and Services > Switches > Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches > Product Literature > White Papers > Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches >\nVLAN Security White Paper > MAC Flooding Attack","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"question_text":"What attack technique attempts to fill a switching table so the attackers can capture traffic passing through a switch?","timestamp":"2020-02-21 00:27:00","answer_ET":"Explanation","discussion":[{"comment_id":"53216","poster":"Faisallt","content":"Correct Answer: D\nExplanation/Reference:\nExplanation:\nMAC flooding is an attack technique in which frames with unique, but invalid, source MAC addresses flood the switch and exhaust the CAM table space.

These advertisements are originated from a switch that is in server mode and are propagated by switches that are in either client or transparent mode. Before a client or another server accepts or incorporates the information sent in the advertisement, it checks the management domain name and password (if defined) against its own configuration. The revision number is checked.
