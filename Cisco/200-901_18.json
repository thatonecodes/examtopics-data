Developers typically use modules to divide a large project into smaller parts. This way the code is easier to read and understand, and each module can be developed in parallel without conflicts. A Module is packaged as a single file and in addition to being available for integration with other modules, it should work independently. A module consists of a set of functions and typically contains an interface for other modules to integrate with. It is essentially a library and cannot be instantiated.
