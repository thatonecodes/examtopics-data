But when you have two SSIDs on an AP, a unique BSSID (logical AP) is generated for each SSID and its WLAN on the AP. So perhaps the answer is referring to the unique AP that is created by each SSID. The same AP can be composed of several logical APs with their independent BSSID (DFWMAC) for each SSID created. Being a single (logical) AP for each SSID on the AP. Remembering that in another AP the same SSID will have a different BSSID (DFWMAC).","poster":"dropspablo","comments":[{"comment_id":"885571","content":"The \"broadcasts by default\" function is a property of the BSSID, which is a unique identifier assigned to each wireless access point (AP), not the SSID.

Because the letter D (supports a single access point) is wrong because we can have the same SSID in more than one AP, different from the BSSID that is unique in each AP ( and SSID on the same AP). About the letter E (broadcasts by default) it is correct, because in the GENERAL Tab exactly when we create the SSID, the BROADCAST SSID option is enabled by default. I was trying to justify the ExamTopics answer but then I realized that you can't trust these wrong answers which just confuses us.
