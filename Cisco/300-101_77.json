EIGRP is to be implemented on router A so that neither the prefix for the S/0/0/0 interface nor the prefixes from router B appear in the routing tables for the router in the enterprise network. Which action will accomplish this goal?","unix_timestamp":1582236960,"answer":"D. Implement a distribute list to exclude the link prefix from the routing updates.","question_id":381,"answer_description":"Explanation -\nIf we declare router B a stub router then the routers in Enterprise Network still learn about the network for S0/0/0 interface and the network behind router B.\nIf we use the passive-interface command on s0/0/0 interface then router A & B can not become neighbor because they don`t exchange hello messages -> A can not send traffic to the network behind B .\nTheoretically, we can use a distribute list to exclude both the link prefix and the prefix from router B but it is not efficient because:\n+ We have many stub networks so we will need a long distribute list. + We declare networks in stub routers (like router B) while filter them out at router A -> it is a waste.\nNot totally sure about answer C because if we use a mask with the network command to exclude interface Serial0/0/0 then router A and B can not become neighbors and the situation is same as answer B. But from many discussions about this question, maybe C is the best answer.","exam_id":296,"answer_ET":"D.
