The extened communities are not doing their job? Answer is yes they are, the point is that OSPF is smart! It undertand that there is something strange there and it will understand that the area 0 between the two CE routers is not a common area it smells that there is mpbgp there....

Provider Edge (PE) routers, on the other hand, are routers located at the edge of a service provider's network and are responsible for connecting customer networks to the provider's network.\n\nSham links are generally not used between PE routers because they are not part of the OSPF routing domain within the provider's network. The PE routers are typically running a different routing protocol, such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), to exchange routing information with other provider routers and establish connectivity between customer networks.\n\nThe purpose of sham links is to establish connectivity and enable OSPF routing between non-adjacent areas within the OSPF routing domain. PE routers, being at the edge of the network, are not within the OSPF domain itself and are usually responsible for exchanging routing information with other networks using different protocols like BGP.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1185763","timestamp":"1711759920.0"},{"timestamp":"1711640280.0","poster":"Commando1664","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFrom Cisco \nA sham-link overcomes the OSPF default behavior for selecting an intra-area backdoor route between VPN sites instead of an interarea (PE-to-PE) route","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1184850"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1089980","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://i2.wp.com/ipwithease.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/010-understand-configure-ospf-sham-links01.png?resize=700%2C518&ssl=1","timestamp":"1701929880.0","poster":"cebra"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe sham link is a logical link, similar to a virtual link.
