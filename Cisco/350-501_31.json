That is a good practice action, but not a requirement for the prefix list to work.\nLater on as your network grow, you might need to implement new statements in the existing prefix list, so using non-sequential numbers gives you the ability to insert numbers in between without deleting the whole prefix list and recreating it."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nSimilarly to access-lists, having sequence numbers allows you easily to add or remove individual lines.
