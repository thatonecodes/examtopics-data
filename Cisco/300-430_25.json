However, setting the 24 Mbps rates to Mandatory would require all clients to support and use 24 Mbps for data transmission, which might not be feasible or desirable in all situations.\n\nIn a typical scenario, it's more common to set data rates as Supported rather than Mandatory. This gives the network more flexibility and allows clients to use the best available data rate based on their capabilities and the conditions of the wireless environment.\n\nTherefore, setting the 24 Mbps rates to Supported would allow multicast broadcast to be sent over 24 Mbps without forcing all clients to use it exclusively, making it a more practical choice.","timestamp":"1723701840.0","comments":[{"content":"Its a multicast question, ignore the rest, as we know, multicast is delivered on the highest mandatory data rate, if 24Mbps is made mandatory, then it will go over at 24Mbps.","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1732270860.0","comment_id":"1215562","poster":"casperionx"}],"upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":["A (67%)","C (33%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/133932-exam-300-430-topic-1-question-208-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","question_id":121,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1707984240,"answer":"A"},{"id":"4dUY4hyhGN0kWkLhS1LJ","exam_id":307,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"AP > Credentials tab","A":"Management > Local Management Users","B":"Security > Advanced EAP","D":"Wireless > Global Configuration"},"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-07-22 21:38:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"A network engineer must configure APs on a controller for 802.1x access to a wired infrastructure as quickly as possible.

Here’s why:\n\nDSCP Trust Model:\nDSCP is a Layer 3 QoS marking that provides granular traffic classification and prioritization. When the switch ports trust DSCP, they honor the DSCP values in the IP headers of packets, ensuring consistent QoS treatment across the network. This is particularly important in a multi-VLAN environment where traffic from different VLANs may have different QoS requirements.\n\nLocal Mode APs:\nIn local mode, APs forward all traffic to the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), which applies QoS policies based on DSCP markings. By configuring the switch ports to trust DSCP, the switch ensures that the QoS markings are preserved as traffic travels between the APs and the WLC.","poster":"rrahim","timestamp":"1740166560.0","comment_id":"1359883"},{"content":"Because Local mode on AP, APs will terminate CAPWAP tunnel and AP will use DSCP marking of CAPWAP tunnel and convert it to UP value for 802.11 frame using DSCP to UP mapping, so C DSCP is correct","comment_id":"1101815","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718899620.0","poster":"CiscoTester1"},{"poster":"GoldLeader","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCos markings only exist as a TAG within trunk packets.
