In the context of REST API security, JWT is typically used for authentication purposes. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.\n\nWhen a user authenticates with a REST API, the server generates a JWT token that contains user information, such as the user ID and access privileges. The token is then sent to the client, typically in the form of an HTTP header, and is included in subsequent requests to the API.\n\nThe server then validates the token to ensure that it was issued by a trusted authority and that it has not been tampered with. If the token is valid, the server grants access to the requested resources. If the token is invalid or has expired, the server denies access to the resources.\n\nTherefore, the correct definition of JWT in regard to REST API security is that it is an encoded JSON token that is used for authentication.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"842045","timestamp":"1679062440.0","poster":"Zortex"},{"poster":"danny43213","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"793524","content":"JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard ( RFC 7519 ) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON","timestamp":"1675128120.0"},{"comment_id":"677091","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Check this: https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/79793-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-427-discussion/#:~:text=Which%20definition%20describes%20JWT%20in,that%20is%20used%20for%20authentication","timestamp":"1663934880.0"},{"comment_id":"674325","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"oatmealturkey","content":"I still think the answer is D.
