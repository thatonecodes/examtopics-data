Since the current configuration does not show the interface configurations in full, and the advertise passive-only command is not explicitly shown, this answer assumes that the command might be present in the full IS-IS configuration. Removing it would allow R1 to advertise non-passive interfaces, such as Loopback2, assuming Loopback2 is configured to participate in IS-IS and is not set as passive.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they reference the Loopback0 interface, which is the one currently being advertised, and making changes to this interface will not affect the advertisement of Loopback2.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because removing the ipv6 router isis area1 command from the Loopback2 interface would stop R1 from advertising Loopback2 altogether, which is the opposite of the intended goal.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1115216","timestamp":"1720268280.0"}],"timestamp":"1720268280.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn the provided configuration for R1, only the Loopback0 interface has been assigned an IPv6 address, and there is no indication that the interface has been configured to be passive or not to advertise in IS-IS.
