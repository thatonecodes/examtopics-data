ALSW1 has two paths to DSW2: a direct path and via DSW1. ALSW1 needs to decide which path has less cost.\nBoth the paths have the same cost. Direct path has a cost of 4 since the link is 1GB. The path thru DSW1 has the cost 2 + 2 = 4 as the cost of a 10GB link is 2. So, path costs are equal. Now, my understanding would be: since the port Gi0/1 is smaller than Gi0/2, Gi0/1 will be chosen as root port.
