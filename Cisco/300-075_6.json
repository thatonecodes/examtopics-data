The H.225 gatekeeper-controlled trunk enables Cisco CallManager to communicate with Cisco CallManager clusters and other H.323 devices registered to the H.323 gatekeeper. The H.225 gatekeeper-controlled trunk is not recommended in a pure Cisco CallManager environment, but it is required in a mixed environment with Cisco CallManager and Cisco CallManager Express or another third-party H.323 gateway. The H.225 trunk attempts to discover the other H.323 device on a call-by-call basis. If it discovers a device that understands intercluster trunk protocol, it automatically uses that protocol. If it cannot discover the other device, Cisco CallManager uses the standard H.225 protocol. To use this method, choose Device > Trunk and choose H.225 Trunk (Gatekeeper Controlled).","poster":"polypan","timestamp":"1575912660.0"},{"content":"correct answer:A","poster":"polypan","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1575912420.0","comment_id":"28214"}],"unix_timestamp":1575912420,"timestamp":"2019-12-09 18:27:00","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"H.225 trunk (gatekeeper-controlled)","C":"SIP trunk","D":"intercluster trunk (gatekeeper-controlled)","B":"intercluster trunk (non-gatekeeper controlled)"},"question_text":"The corporate WAN has been extended to two newly acquired sites and it includes gatekeeper support.
