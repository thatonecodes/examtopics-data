The former is often used to connect two Cisco routers while the latter is used to connect a Cisco router to a non-Cisco router. You can test with your Cisco router when typing the command\nRouter(config-if)#encapsulation frame-relay? on a WAN link.\nNote: Three LMI options are supported by Cisco routers are ansi, Cisco, and Q933a. They represent the ANSI Annex D, Cisco, and ITU Q933-A (Annex A) LMI types, respectively.\nHDLC is a WAN protocol same as Frame-Relay and PPP so it is not a Frame Relay encapsulation type.","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1562425920,"question_id":2,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/2219-exam-200-105-topic-1-question-105-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01501/0016300001.png"],"choices":{"A":"IETF","B":"ANSI Annex D","D":"HDLC","C":"Q9333-A Annex A"},"answer":"A","exam_id":284,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-07-06 17:12:00","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"pny3d13aT9HuRCINtdwc","topic":"1","answer_ET":"DF","discussion":[{"comment_id":"12676","upvote_count":"6","poster":"gogo1122","content":"heres the graphic : https://i.imgur.com/4XauO5x.png","timestamp":"1569441960.0"},{"comment_id":"52495","poster":"SmaCisco","content":"The topology of your dream :)","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1582091100.0"},{"content":"Where is the Graphic?","poster":"adeshtall","timestamp":"1564300860.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"5124"},{"poster":"Podvig","comment_id":"252","upvote_count":"1","content":"No graphic?","timestamp":"1549039680.0"}],"exam_id":284,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1549039680,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/208-exam-200-105-topic-1-question-106-discussion/","choices":{"A":"Corp-1","B":"Corp-2","C":"Corp-3","D":"Corp-4","F":"Branch-2","E":"Branch-1"},"timestamp":"2019-02-01 17:48:00","question_id":3,"answer":"DF","question_text":"The internetwork infrastructure of company XYZ consists of a single OSPF area as shown in the graphic. There is concern that a lack of router resources is impeding internetwork performance. As part of examining the router resources, the OSPF DRs need to be known.

(Choose two.)","answer_description":"There are 2 segments on the topology above which are separated by Corp-3 router.\nEach segment will have a DR so we have 2 DRs.\nTo select which router will become DR they will compare their router-IDs. The router with highest (best) router-ID will become DR. The router-ID is chosen in the order below:\nThe highest IP address assigned to a loopback (logical) interface. If a loopback interface is not defined, the highest IP address of all active router's physical interfaces will be chosen.\nIn this question, the IP addresses of loopback interfaces are not mentioned so we will consider IP addresses of all active router's physical interfaces.

Based on rules that you define, a unique identifier (the tag) is inserted in each frame header before it is forwarded. The tag is examined and understood by each device before any broadcasts or transmissions to other switches, routers, or end stations. When the frame reaches the last switch or router, the tag is removed before the frame is sent to the target end station. VLANs that are assigned on trunk or access ports without identification or a tag are called native or untagged frames.\nFor IEEE 802.1Q frames with tag information, the priority value from the header frame is used. For native frames, the default priority of the input port is used.\nEach port on the switch has a single receive queue buffer (the ingress port) for incoming traffic. When an untagged frame arrives, it is assigned the value of the port as its port default priority. You assign this value by using the CLI or CMS. A tagged frame continues to use its assigned CoS value when it passes through the ingress port.","comment_id":"5573"},{"poster":"bitsuspect","timestamp":"1554262740.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"The correct answer is E.
