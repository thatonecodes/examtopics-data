This could lead to a queueing condition, where the input queue is building up because the rate of incoming packets is higher than the rate at which they are being processed and sent out.\n\nIn this case, \"B. queueing\" becomes a more relevant option. The input queue is shown as 175/300, indicating that the input queue is at 175, with a maximum size of 300.

However, in a full-duplex environment, you would expect to see both \"txload\" and \"rxload\" at 255/255 (indicating no congestion). In this case, the \"txload\" and \"rxload\" are at 1/255, suggesting that there may be an issue.\n\nA common cause for this type of behavior is a duplex mismatch. A duplex mismatch occurs when one device (in this case, the router interface) is set to full-duplex, and the device on the other end (potentially a switch or another router) is set to half-duplex or vice versa. This can lead to performance issues, dropped packets, and general instability in the network.\n\nSo, based on the provided output, the condition occurring is a duplex mismatch.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1703799720.0","comment_id":"1108120","content":"Moderator please remove this comment and the other.
