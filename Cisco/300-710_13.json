The static route tracking feature provides a method for tracking the availability of a static route and installing a backup route if the primary route should fail. For example, you can define a default route to an ISP gateway and a backup default route to a secondary ISP in case the primary ISP becomes unavailable.\n\nThe Firepower Threat Defense device implements static route tracking by associating a static route with a monitoring target host on the destination network that the Firepower Threat Defense device monitors using ICMP echo requests. If an echo reply is not received within a specified time period, the host is considered down, and the associated route is removed from the routing table. An untracked backup route with a higher metric is used in place of the removed route.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/601/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v601/fpmc-config-guide-v60_chapter_01100100.html#ID-2105-00000029","comment_id":"801574"}],"timestamp":"2023-02-08 02:09:00","choices":{"B":"Use a default route in the FMC instead of having multiple routes contending for priority","A":"Install the static backup route and modify the metric to be less than the primary route","C":"Configure EIGRP routing on the FMC to ensure that dynamic routes are always updated","D":"Create the backup route and use route tracking on both routes to a destination IP address in the network"},"question_images":[]},{"id":"tKVQUeHRoOmww6OKesTm","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"question_text":"An administrator is adding a new URL-based category feed to the Cisco FMC for use within the policies.
