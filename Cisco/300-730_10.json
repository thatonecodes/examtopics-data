I hate questions like this. \n\nThe nature of GET VPN technology and function leads to several key benefits:\n\nInstantaneous large-scale any-to-any IP connectivity uses a group IPsec security paradigm.\n\nTakes advantage of underlying IP VPN routing infrastructure and requires no overlay routing control plane.\n\nSeamlessly integrates with multicast infrastructures without the multicast replication issues that you see typically in traditional tunnel-based IPsec solutions.\n\nPreserves the IP source and destination addresses during the IPsec encryption and encapsulation process. Therefore, GET VPN integrates very well with features such as quality of service (QoS) and traffic engineering. Because you can use the native routing protocol with GET VPN, you often get more optimal, efficient pathing for unicast and multicast traffic.","comment_id":"1181961","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707144180.0","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nSee below comment.","comment_id":"1141184","poster":"pfrank"},{"comments":[{"content":"\"Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GETVPN) is a tunnel-less VPN solution that provides highly secure communication between systems that are grouped in a network. GETVPN addresses some of the limitations of DMVPN. For example, DMVPN supports direct spoke-to-spoke traffic, but when a spoke wants to send traffic to another spoke, it first must create a new IPsec security association, which can take time and cause delays. \n\nGETVPN solves the scalability issue by using a single IPsec security association for all routers in a group rather than using individual security associations. \n\nGETVPN also supports multicast traffic natively, without using GRE, whereas other options have to use GRE for encapsulation.
