This makes the collapsed core layer a two-layer model, comprising the access layer and the collapsed distribution/core layer. In a typical scenario, this may be used in a small company that uses only a few floors in a building for their network. Each floor would have a switch (access layer) that enables clients on that floor to connect to the network. Each floor switch would then connect to a central switch in the building, which is connected to a router to access the WAN or Internet.\n\nAll-in-One CCT/CCNA Routing and Switching","timestamp":"1715658420.0"},{"poster":"Lichfield","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1066564","timestamp":"1715267220.0","content":"B.

It enables the core and access layers to connect to one logical distribution device over an EtherChannel.\n\nIn a collapsed-core network topology, the core and access layers connect to one logical distribution device (usually a switch or a set of switches) over an EtherChannel or aggregated link. This design simplifies the network architecture by reducing the number of layers and devices required, which is often suitable for small to medium-sized networks. It's a way to collapse the traditional hierarchical three-layer network design into fewer layers, making management and configuration simpler.","poster":"shaney67"}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":288,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"What is a characteristic of a collapsed-core network topology?","answer_description":"","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"It allows the core and distribution layers to run as a single combined layer.","A":"It enables all workstations in a SOHO environment to connect on a single switch with internet access.","B":"It enables the core and access layers to connect to one logical distribution device over an EtherChannel.","C":"It allows wireless devices to connect directly to the core layer, which enables faster data transmission."},"timestamp":"2023-08-11 08:54:00","question_id":1206,"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"EtIUmJj3Fm81B0daUWYo","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-05-02 14:29:00","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1683030540,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"931607","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA high number of CRCs typically result from collisions but can also indicate a physical issue (cabling, bad interface/NIC)","timestamp":"1703343420.0","upvote_count":"9","comments":[{"comment_id":"1092213","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1717973940.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Reasons for Bad Frames and CRC Errors \n\nSome of the reasons when you get bad frames and CRC errors can be:\n Bad physical connection; transceiver, copper, fiber, adapter, port expander, and so on.\n MTU Violation\n Received bad CRC stomped from neighboring cut-through switch.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/servers-unified-computing/ucs-infrastructure-ucs-manager-software/215449-commands-for-troubleshooting-connectivit.html"}],"poster":"kncappy"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727715420.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1186307","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct\n\n(high) input errors, (high) CRC, (high) frame errors = phisical issue","comments":[{"comment_id":"1347904","content":"physical* sorry :)","timestamp":"1738069140.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SeMo0o0o0o0"}]},{"comment_id":"896664","timestamp":"1699885920.0","poster":"Yannik123","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nLook on CRC"},{"content":"reliability 250/255,","poster":"HSong","timestamp":"1698935340.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"887328"}],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A technician receives a report of network slowness and the issue has been isolated to the interface FastEthemet0/13.
