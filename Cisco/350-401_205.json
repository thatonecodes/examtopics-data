In a network with multiple wireless controllers, mobility groups enable seamless roaming for clients as they move across different controllers. When a client roams from one controller's coverage area to another, the controllers within the same mobility group exchange information to ensure a smooth handover of the client's connection.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721814480.0","comment_id":"1130534"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":1021,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/132025-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-958-discussion/","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-01-24 12:48:00","exam_id":324,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1706096880,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which feature allows clients to perform Layer 2 roaming between wireless controllers?","answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"BmxSqWxRX42jnigjumcH","answer_images":[],"exam_id":324,"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","question_id":1022,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_text":"What is a characteristic of Cisco DNA Northbound APIs?","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1706096940,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/132027-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-959-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-01-24 12:49:00","choices":{"C":"They utilize RESTCONF.","A":"They utilize multivendor support APIs.","B":"They simplify the management of network infrastructure devices.","D":"They enable automation of network infrastructure based on intent."},"discussion":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1301189","upvote_count":"2","poster":"NetworkJanitor","timestamp":"1729530840.0","content":"That should be RESTful not RESTCONF it seems:\n\nKey characteristics of the Intent APIs include:\n\n- They are RESTful APIs that use HTTPS verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with JSON structures\n- They allow programmatic access to DNA Center capabilities and data\n- They enable integration with external systems and automation of DNA Center tasks\n\nSouthbound API (RESTCONF/NETCONF/XML) = application\nNorthbound API (RESTful/JSON) = device"},{"poster":"slacker_at_work","timestamp":"1710616680.0","content":"Option C, \"They utilize RESTCONF,\" is partially correct, as some Cisco DNA Northbound APIs may indeed utilize RESTCONF, but it does not fully capture the broader purpose of these APIs in enabling automation based on intent.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1175214"}],"upvote_count":"6","content":"It's C & D as the DNA-C northbound API is using RESTCONF.","comment_id":"1134372","poster":"NazgulNr5","timestamp":"1706469900.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nREST API, JSON -> NB\nNETCONF, RESTCONF, XML -> SB","timestamp":"1726985700.0","poster":"chiacche","comment_id":"1287577"},{"poster":"AbdullahMohammad251","timestamp":"1725408420.0","comment_id":"1277880","content":"Selected Answer: D\nA. a characteristic of Southbound APIs\nB. a characteristic of southbound APIs\nC.
