ACI bridge domain and the gateway will be pervasively deployed on any leaf switches with EPGs associated to the BD. Hence, a default gateway for all endpoints will be right in front of them on the first leaf they will see without having to forward a packet to another leaf that has the default gateway for the endpoint.

Each FTag tree does not necessarily use all fabric uplinks. That is why ACI creates multiple FTag trees and load balances multi-destination traffic across them.

All multi-destination traffic is forwarded in the form of encapsulated IP multicast traffic within the fabric. The ingress leaf assigns an FTAG to the traffic when forwarding it to the spine. The FTAG is assigned in the packet as part of the destination multicast address. In the fabric, the traffic is forwarded along the specified FTAG tree. Spine and any intermediate leaf switches forward traffic based on the FTAG ID. One forwarding tree is built per FTAG ID. Between any two nodes, only one link forwards per FTAG. Because of the use of multiple FTAGs, parallel links can be used with each FTAG choosing a different link for forwarding.
