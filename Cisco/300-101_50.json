When you configure ip default-network the router considers routes to that network for installation as the gateway of last resort on the router.\nFor every network configured with ip default-network, if a router has a route to that network, that route is flagged as a candidate default route.\nGateways of last resort selected using the ip default-network command are propagated differently depending on which routing protocol is propagating the default route. For IGRP and EIGRP to propagate the route, the network specified by the ip default-network command must be known to IGRP or EIGRP. This means the network must be an IGRP- or EIGRP-derived network in the routing table, or the static route used to generate the route to the network must be redistributed into\nIGRP or EIGRP, or advertised into these protocols using the network command. In this case, the 10.0.0.0 network is indeed being advertised via EIGRP.\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080094374.shtml#ipnetwork","unix_timestamp":1581543360,"isMC":true,"topic":"2","discussion":[{"content":"Correct answer:\n A.
