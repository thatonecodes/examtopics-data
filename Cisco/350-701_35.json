A MitM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts the communication between two parties and can potentially eavesdrop, modify, or manipulate the information exchanged.\n\nBy implementing MFA, organizations add an extra layer of security to the authentication process. MFA requires users to provide multiple factors of authentication, typically something they know (such as a password), something they have (such as a physical token or mobile device), or something they are (such as a fingerprint or biometric scan).

As noted earlier, TAXII is bound to neither a particular network protocol nor to a particular message binding. In order to facilitate automated communication, TAXII includes the ability to discover the specific TAXII Services a TAXII user (or group of TAXII users) fields, as well as their network address and supported bindings. This does not remove the need for human involvement in the establishment of sharing agreements - sharing agreement negotiation is outside the scope of TAXII.
