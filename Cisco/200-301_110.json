It bundles all of the controller’s distribution system ports into a single 802.3ad port channel, thereby reducing the number of IP addresses needed to configure the ports on your controller. When LAG is enabled, the system dynamically manages port redundancy and load balances access points transparently to the user.\n\nLAG simplifies controller configuration because you no longer need to configure primary and secondary ports for each interface. If any of the controller ports fail, traffic is automatically migrated to one of the other ports. As long as at least one controller port is functioning, the system continues to operate, access points remain connected to the network, and wireless clients continue to send and receive data.","comment_id":"341972","timestamp":"1635070980.0","poster":"ZUMY","upvote_count":"7"}],"answer":"D","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-04-23 00:23:00","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (67%)","C (33%)"]},{"id":"vLnadBAcxcPdBaG0wT6M","question_id":550,"exam_id":288,"question_images":[],"answer":"DE","choices":{"D":"The switch must be running a k9 (crypto) IOS image.","C":"Telnet must be disabled on the switch.","B":"A console password must be configured on the switch.","A":"IP routing must be enabled on the switch.","E":"The ip domain-name command must be configured on the switch."},"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1588844400,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which two conditions must be met before SSH operates normally on a Cisco IOS switch?
