DTLS is well-suited for securing applications and services that are delay-sensitive (and hence use datagram transport), tunneling applications such as VPNs, and applications that tend to run out of file descriptors or socket buffers.\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9260","poster":"Pecoto"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nIn the context of load balancing, TLS termination is typically handled over a TCP connection. UDP and SCTP are less common for this use case due to the lack of reliability compared to TCP, especially for applications such as file servers.\n\nOnce TLS is terminated, the load balancer can then initiate a new connection to the selected server. This can be either HTTP or HTTPS depending on the specific needs of the network and application, although using HTTP is more common after termination because the load balancer has already decrypted the traffic and can then send it unencrypted to the server in a secure network.\n\nGiven these considerations, the two correct options are:\n\nC. Terminate the TLS over the TCP connection from the router and originate an HTTP connection to the selected server.\n\nD. Terminate the TLS over the TCP connection from the router and originate an HTTPS connection to the selected server.","comment_id":"913300","poster":"tartarus23","timestamp":"1685769780.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1664668020.0","poster":"Supersede","content":"Tend to think it is - DE\nTLS with HTTPs is obvious.\nAnd from the rest the only protocol supporting TLS is SCTP.\nUDP is usind DTLS.
