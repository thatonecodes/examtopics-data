Then you do git reset --hard 56 to go back to that commit (this will only reset your local branch, your remote if you have it is still at the commit you had at the beginning).\n\nThen you do git reset --soft HEAD@{1} which will go back to where you were before git reset --hard BUT it will leave the files alone (how they were at 56).
