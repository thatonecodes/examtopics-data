Layer 2 switches do not change the MAC addresses of frames; instead, they filter, forward, or flood frames based on the information in the MAC address table[1]. When a frame is received by a Layer 2 switch, it checks the destination MAC address against its MAC address table to determine the appropriate outgoing interface for forwarding the frame. This lookup process allows the switch to efficiently direct frames to their intended destinations within the network without altering the source and destination MAC addresses[3]."}],"timestamp":"2024-03-02 21:53:00","answer":"B"}],"exam":{"id":288,"name":"200-301","numberOfQuestions":1395,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":71},"__N_SSP":true}
