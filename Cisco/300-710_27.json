A bridge group is a logical entity that enables traffic forwarding between interfaces. By creating a separate bridge group for each network segment, traffic between the segments can be routed through the FTD appliance.\n\nOnce the bridge groups are created, the FTD appliance can be configured to allow traffic between the segments using access control policies. The policies can specify which traffic is allowed to pass between the segments and which traffic is blocked.\n\nIn summary, to configure access between two network segments within the same IP subnet using a Cisco FTD appliance, separate bridge groups must be created for each segment.","upvote_count":"6"},{"timestamp":"1720797360.0","poster":"eafea4f","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1246841","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBoth interfaces in the bridge group are in the same segment, 1 group is needed."},{"comment_id":"1179825","content":"As long as two segments are in the same subnet, then just one BVI and one IP address would be needed to enforce communication between both.

Although the bridging functions are separate for each bridge group, many other functions are shared between all bridge groups. For example, all bridge groups share a syslog server or AAA server configuration.\n\nYou can include multiple interfaces per bridge group. See Guidelines for Firewall Mode for the exact number of bridge groups and interfaces supported. If you use more than 2 interfaces per bridge group, you can control communication between multiple segments on the same network, and not just between inside and outside.","comment_id":"1006514","timestamp":"1694603280.0"},{"timestamp":"1686052680.0","poster":"SegaMasterSystemAdmin","content":"Selected Answer: B\nYou do not have to create a separate bridge group for each segment.
