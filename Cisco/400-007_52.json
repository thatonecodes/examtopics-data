SNMPv3: SNMPv3 is the latest version of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and provides secure authentication and encryption for monitoring and managing network devices. It is recommended to use SNMPv3 for control plane security.\n\nC. Routing protocol authentication: Implementing authentication mechanisms, such as MD5 or SHA, for routing protocols helps ensure that only trusted devices can participate in the routing process. This helps prevent unauthorized devices from injecting false or malicious routing information.\n\nF. Control Plane Policing (CoPP): CoPP is a mechanism that allows you to control and prioritize traffic destined for the control plane of a network device. By applying policies to limit the rate and types of traffic allowed to reach the control plane, CoPP helps protect the control plane from resource exhaustion and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.","poster":"J_W","comment_id":"914358","timestamp":"1685874060.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1682704020.0","poster":"Akkisingh","content":"Selected Answer: ACF\nACF, warning banner, is for legal issues, but don't offer any security","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"883795"},{"timestamp":"1679193540.0","comment_id":"843376","upvote_count":"1","content":"BCF \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc39","poster":"main_street"},{"comment_id":"830385","timestamp":"1678055880.0","content":"ACF is the ans","poster":"gcpengineer","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1677512820.0","comment_id":"823907","poster":"Arsenal16","content":"C, F is correct for sure , it's very interesting as A,B and D are related to management plane, also E is not part from any","upvote_count":"3"}],"topic":"1","exam_id":331,"answer_images":[],"question_id":256,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-10-17 06:30:00"},{"id":"993YpV5tUtcBY58EQJs8","question_text":"What is a characteristic of a secure cloud architecture model?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/85644-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-94-discussion/","answers_community":["D (90%)","10%"],"discussion":[{"content":"from safe:\nThe Secure Cloud architecture has the following characteristics:\n\n● Visibility with centralized management, analytics, and shared services\n\n● A core connecting distribution and application-centric layers\n\n● Software-defined network segmentation\n\n● Software-defined application segmentation\n\n● Virtual servers requiring secure network access connectivity","timestamp":"1708202640.0","comment_id":"812351","poster":"ying162","upvote_count":"10"},{"comment_id":"696809","timestamp":"1697517000.0","content":"It should be D","upvote_count":"7","poster":"phenix999"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nSorry i placed my answer in wrong question.
