This can result in faster fault detection as there are fewer potential points of failure and network issues can be more easily identified.\nSimplified troubleshooting: With a traditional WAN, the network topology and configuration are typically more straightforward and standardized. This can simplify troubleshooting processes as network administrators can have a clearer understanding of the network design and can more easily identify and resolve issues.\n\nSD-WAN offers benefits such as lower control plane abstraction, comprehensive configuration standardization, and lower data plane overhead.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"945571","timestamp":"1688727240.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nBy a mile!

This results in lower control plane abstraction.\n\nAlso, since traditional WANs are not overlay networks like SD-WANs, they generally incur less data plane overhead. Overlay networks add extra information (headers) to the original packets, which results in increased overhead and potentially less efficient use of the available bandwidth.\n\nIt's important to note that while these may be perceived as benefits in certain cases, the trade-offs include less flexibility, more complex configuration and management, and lack of some features like centralized control, easy scalability, and advanced traffic management that are typically found in SD-WAN solutions.\n\nBy Chat GPT.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"934364","timestamp":"1687780380.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"934362","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA and E seems valid","poster":"HarwinderSekhon","timestamp":"1687780320.0"},{"timestamp":"1682878200.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nI agree","poster":"Chiaretta","comment_id":"885506","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"I'd choose A & E","poster":"olaniyijt","timestamp":"1682155380.0","comment_id":"877173"}],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer":"AE","question_id":811,"choices":{"C":"simplified troubleshooting","D":"comprehensive configuration standardization","A":"lower control plane abstraction","B":"faster fault detection","E":"lower data plane overhead"},"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/105696-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-769-discussion/","exam_id":324,"timestamp":"2023-04-10 09:58:00","question_text":"What are two benefits of implementing a traditional WAN instead of an SD-WAN solution?

The DHCP server drops DHCP packets carrying Option 82 and an empty relay agent IP address.\n\nThis is because the DHCP server itself is on the router (as evidenced by the presence of the DHCP pool configuration), and there's no need for an ip helper-address on the local router's interface for DHCP server functionality. The error message indicates an issue with DHCP Option 82, which suggests that the problem lies in how the DHCP server or relay agent is handling the packets, rather than a missing DHCP relay configuration.\n\nIn practical scenarios, when DHCP snooping is configured on a switch, the switch inserts information into the DHCP packets (Option 82) to indicate where the packets came from. If the DHCP server is not expecting or is not configured to handle Option 82, it may drop the packets, hence the error message about inconsistent relay information.
