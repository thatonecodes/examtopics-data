I Just confirmed on my Cisco Guides.\n\nThe Cisco component that creates the flow monitor cache is the Flow Monitor. Flow monitors are used to monitor network traffic and collect data about flows. A flow is a series of packets that share a common set of characteristics, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. The flow monitor cache stores data about the flows that are being monitored. This data can be used to troubleshoot network problems, analyze traffic patterns, and generate reports.","comment_id":"899131","timestamp":"1715859840.0","poster":"Kromwall","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Im think is A \n\nCheck this \n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/fnetflow/configuration/15-mt/fnf-15-mt-book/cfg-de-fnflow-exprts.html\n\nFlow Exporters\nFlow exporters are created as separate components in a router's configuration. Exporters are assigned to flow monitors to export the data from the flow monitor cache to a remote system such as a NetFlow collector. Flow monitors can support more than one exporter.
