One gateway is elected as the active virtual gateway (AVG), another gateway is elected as the standby virtual gateway, and the remaining gateways are placed in a listen state. If an AVG fails, the standby virtual gateway will assume responsibility for the virtual IP address. A new standby virtual gateway is then elected from the gateways in the listen state.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t15/feature/guide/ft_glbp.html#wp1043431","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1581071580.0","poster":"Vovasiy","content":"A, B and C seems to be correct, so why just GLBP?","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"47687"}],"choices":{"B":"VRRP","D":"SSO","A":"GLBP","E":"NSF","C":"HSRP"},"exam_id":299,"isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"2uv0XJsnvBmgOoOkd0pa","timestamp":"2019-05-12 23:22:00","choices":{"C":"a port channel","B":"vPC","A":"an appliance port","D":"a unified storage port"},"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":17,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1559910600.0","content":"FIB is fiber channel C","comments":[{"poster":"DrVoIP","content":"Port channel","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"2437","timestamp":"1559910660.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"DrVoIP","comment_id":"2436"},{"comment_id":"1708","poster":"Soportechnology","content":"Correct Answer: C.
