They could be ip phones, Telepresence devices, webex devices, desk devices, etc. so I do not think B be correct.\nIn fact, it is necessary to allow devices to reach control hub, A must be correct, to provision and download firmware updates. However, also it is true that the devices, since they are onboarding and changing from CUCM to Control Hub, need to have a license with a Flex Plan,\nThe caveat is that A talk about HTTP. It must be HTTPS using TLS1.2.\nSO I think correct answer is D. It is necessary to have licenses for each one device in general. You must verify that sufficient Webex Device licenses are available to support your devices in the cloud.","timestamp":"1739418000.0"},{"comment_id":"1182562","poster":"Daved90","timestamp":"1727267160.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nsee below comment","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"B","exam_id":328,"question_id":276,"answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"g65YkDTUxl1qDCxz10W4","question_id":277,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-12-08 00:18:00","answer_images":[],"exam_id":328,"answer":"A","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/128043-exam-350-801-topic-1-question-373-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"business continuity","B":"Call Admission Control","D":"ringtone selection","C":"device pool selection"},"question_text":"What is a capability of the call forwarding feature in a Cisco Webex dial plan?","answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1701991080,"discussion":[{"poster":"b3532e4","comment_id":"1273698","upvote_count":"2","content":"A. business continuity","timestamp":"1724794860.0"},{"timestamp":"1708281120.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://help.webex.com/en-us/article/4efsep/Configure-call-forwarding","poster":"ronaie","comment_id":"1153486","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"The answer is A:\n\nhttps://help.webex.com/en-us/article/4efsep/Configure-call-forwarding","comment_id":"1090654","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1701991080.0","poster":"john_doe_9999"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"5jh1plhPhRTmf6fIr0uW","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-12-03 14:10:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/127695-exam-350-801-topic-1-question-374-discussion/","question_text":"An engineer is deploying the Webex app on a Microsoft Windows computer that has multiple user accounts.
