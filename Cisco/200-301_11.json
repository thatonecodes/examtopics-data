To achieve this, we need to divide the entire IP address space into two halves and send each half to a different ISP. This is typically done using a technique called \"BGP Dual-Homed\" setup, where the company headquarters announces two routes: one for the first half of the IP address space (0.0.0.0/1) to ISP1, and the other for the second half (128.0.0.0/1) to ISP2.\n\nOption B: Two default routes are configured for each ISP. The first half of the IP address space (0.0.0.0/1) goes to ISP1, and the second half (128.0.0.0/1) goes to ISP2.","comment_id":"973672","poster":"Stevens0103"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"C and E","timestamp":"1690711680.0","comment_id":"967022","poster":"shaney67"},{"content":"ill go with B and C","comment_id":"932933","poster":"Shabeth","timestamp":"1687640940.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1687640100.0","poster":"Shabeth","comment_id":"932924","content":"cannot be A- AD of 255 is considered unreachable","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Rydaz","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1683464160.0","comment_id":"891387","content":"C and D"},{"poster":"goldenoliver","comment_id":"879163","upvote_count":"1","content":"B and C right","timestamp":"1682325060.0"},{"timestamp":"1678467000.0","poster":"bisiyemo1","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"835241","content":"A may be the second choice but C is sure"},{"timestamp":"1677032280.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"817389","poster":"tippy1000","content":"The 255 at the end of a is suspect"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"mageknight","comment_id":"817205","timestamp":"1677015900.0","content":"may be A and C i think"},{"comment_id":"812817","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1676712000.0","content":"What about the other one?","poster":"RaselAhmedIT"},{"poster":"oatmealturkey","comment_id":"809675","content":"But you have to choose two :(","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1676473500.0"}],"answer":"C"},{"id":"ugZbbsM7DIUXek3jZmPo","timestamp":"2023-02-15 20:18:00","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_id":54,"unix_timestamp":1676488680,"choices":{"B":"interface fastethernet 1/1\nchannel-group 2 mode on","C":"interface fastethernet 1/1\nchannel-group 2 mode active","A":"interface port-channel 2\nchannel-group 2 mode desirable","D":"interface port-channel 2\nchannel-group 2 mode auto"},"answer_description":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image110.png"],"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (91%)","9%"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99310-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1046-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the right awnser in order to change to LACP for multi vendor compatibility","upvote_count":"18","comment_id":"809870","timestamp":"1692119880.0","poster":"rAlexandre"},{"comment_id":"810537","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct LACP must be used","comments":[{"comment_id":"909962","poster":"rubzal","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1701331560.0","content":"PAGP mentioned in the exhibit","comments":[{"comment_id":"938168","timestamp":"1703863500.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"It must be changed to LACP","poster":"[Removed]"}]}],"timestamp":"1692173640.0","upvote_count":"8","poster":"j1mlawton"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1728180660.0","comment_id":"1190188","content":"Selected Answer: C\nit´s C"},{"comment_id":"1043932","timestamp":"1713165600.0","poster":"vaderz","comments":[{"timestamp":"1718124000.0","content":"Important tip is to always check the hostname of the console output and cross-reference with the question text.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1093748","poster":"[Removed]"}],"upvote_count":"4","content":"He updates configuration on the same interface.
