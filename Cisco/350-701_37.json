The simple detection policy section is designed for basic detection rules and does not support the use of MD5 signatures.\n\nTo add specific MD5 signatures for detections, the administrator needs to create or modify an advanced custom detection policy. In the advanced custom detection policy, there are options to define specific detection criteria, including MD5 signatures, to identify and classify threats.\n\nOption A, uploading the file instead of the hash, is not the reason for the failure.
