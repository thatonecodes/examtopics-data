For example, EIGRP doesn’t send link-state packets as OSPF does; instead, it sends traditional distance-vector updates containing information about networks plus the cost of reaching them from the perspective of the advertising router. And EIGRP has link-state characteristics as well—it synchronizes routing tables between neighbors at startup and then sends specific updates only when topology changes occur. This makes EIGRP suitable for very large networks. EIGRP has a maximum hop count of 255 (the default is set to 100).","poster":"bigbux","upvote_count":"13"}],"question_text":"Which of the following dynamic routing protocols are Distance Vector routing protocols?","answer_ET":"BE","answer_images":[]},{"id":"9PvEzm61r6NBLLIPc61W","timestamp":"2021-03-06 20:18:00","answer_description":"Once an OSPF Router ID selection is done, it remains there even if you remove it or configure another OSPF Router ID.
