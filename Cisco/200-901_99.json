Device-level management requires one controller per vendor and controller-level management does not.**\n\nIn device-level management, configurations and automation are handled individually on each device, and managing a large number of devices from multiple vendors can become challenging. This often requires different management solutions for each vendor. On the other hand, controller-level management (e.g., SDN controllers) centralizes control, allowing for easier management across devices from multiple vendors without needing separate controllers for each.","timestamp":"1725718560.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1280050"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/147157-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-572-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"What is an advantage of device-level management as compared to controller-level management to automate the configuration of network devices?","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","exam_id":291,"timestamp":"2024-09-07 16:16:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Device-level management requires one controller per vendor and controller-level management does not.","C":"Device-level management supports REST API-enabled devices and controller-level management does not.","A":"Device-level management has access to all devices from a single point on the network and controller-level management does not.","B":"Device-level management supports all subsets of the potential device settings and controller-level management does not."},"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (71%)","D (29%)"],"unix_timestamp":1725718560,"answer":"B","question_id":492},{"id":"H7sxLsRyKrZtEMXspI4f","isMC":true,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
