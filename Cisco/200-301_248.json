OCG P235: \"PortFast allows a switch to immediately transition from blocking to forwarding\"\n \n[A] is a feature of PortFast, as stated on the same page of OCG: As you might guess from the fact that PortFast speeds convergence, RSTP includes PortFast. You might recall the mention of RSTP port types, particularly point-to-point edge port types, around Figure 9-11. RSTP, by design of the protocol, converges quickly on these point-to-point edge type ports by bypassing the learning state, which is the same idea Cisco originally introduced with PortFast.\n\n[D] is incorrect. Receiving BPDUs itself does not break things or create loops. The only difference between enabling PortFast and not enabling it is whether the port listens for a while before turning into forwarding state. With PortFast enabled, it turns into forwarding state immediately. If a loop is formed at this stage, STP will still react normally and block the port (prune this branch of the spanning tree).","timestamp":"1729910880.0"},{"comment_id":"1302933","poster":"Shaifalimittal02","timestamp":"1729873800.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nExplanation:\n\nA is correct because PortFast is designed to accelerate STP convergence, which helps speed up the transition to the forwarding state after a link failure.\nC is correct because PortFast-enabled ports skip the traditional STP states (listening and learning) and move directly to the forwarding state, making convergence faster.\n\nIncorrect options:\n\nB: PortFast is not meant for uplinks to other switches, as it’s primarily for ports connecting end devices.\nD: While PortFast ports don’t expect BPDUs, they still listen for them; if BPDUs are received, PortFast disables itself to avoid loops.\nE: PortFast doesn’t detect indirect link failures; this is a feature of mechanisms like BackboneFast or other STP optimizations."},{"poster":"Fitzd","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1212140","content":"Ports Transition Directly to Forwarding State:\nPortFast allows a switch or trunk port to enter the forwarding state immediately, bypassing the listening and learning states.

One of the most common misconceptions is that PortFast effectively disables STP, and BPDUs are no longer sent or received on the port. Everything about this statement is wrong. Not only does a PortFast-enabled port transmit BPDUs, but the operational PortFast status is actually dependent on incoming BPDUs. If the port receives BPDUs, the PortFast feature is disabled. Now, it is important to understand the difference between the administrative and operational state of PortFast. The administrative state refers to what is configured on the device, and the operational state defines whether the feature is actually enabled or disabled. There are basically two ways to enable PortFast: globally (spanning-tree portfast default) or per interface (spanning-tree portfast). Both commands enable PortFast on operational access ports. For example, a port that is administratively configured to negotiate a trunk but failed to do so would operate in access mode.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1703460900.0","poster":"Starlord2535"}]},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nI originally went with A and C, but I changed my mind because \"link failure\" isn't relevant to edge-ports.
