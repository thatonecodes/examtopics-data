It is one of several counters that can be used to monitor the performance of a network interface and identify potential problems. Other counters that may be used to monitor the performance of a network interface include counters for transmitted and received frames, errors, and discards.\n\nIf the collision counter is consistently high, it may indicate that there is a problem with the network, such as a high level of contention for network resources or a configuration issue. In this case, it may be necessary to troubleshoot the issue and take steps to reduce the number of collisions on the network. This could involve optimizing network configuration, adding additional network resources, or implementing other strategies to improve network performance.","comment_id":"747133","poster":"Alizadeh"},{"poster":"Japucip12","content":"Hate this question, since a spanish native speaker I am, always get confuse with \"after\" and \"before\" - that leads me to give the wrong answer 🥲","comments":[{"comment_id":"524988","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1642341780.0","content":"Whenever you come across this, remember Adobe's \"After Effects\" post-production software.
