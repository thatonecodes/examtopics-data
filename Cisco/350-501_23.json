Traps are unreliable because the receiver does not send acknowledgments when this device receives traps. The sender cannot determine if the traps were received.

Traps are messages alerting the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) manager to a condition on the network. Informs are traps that include a request for confirmation of receipt from the SNMP manager. Notifications can indicate improper user authentication, restarts, the closing of a connection, loss of connection to a neighbor device, or other significant events.\n\nTraps are less reliable than informs because the receiver does not send an acknowledgment when it receives a trap.
