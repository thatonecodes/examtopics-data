Multiple pods provide intensive fault isolation in the control plane along with infrastructure cabling flexibility. As the name indicates, it connects multiple Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) pods using a Layer 3 interpod network (IPN).\n\nNote: Pod spine switches cannot be connected back to back. IPN supports only Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) connectivity between the IPN and the spine switches. Though each pod consists of its own spine and leaf switches, all the pods reside within the same fabric and are managed by a single APIC cluster. This approach provides a single management and policy domain across all pods for end-to-end policy enforcement. In the data plane, the Multi-Pod solution uses Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) connectivity over the IPN between the spine switches from each pod for communication using Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) encapsulation.","comment_id":"904548","timestamp":"1732344240.0","poster":"thinqtanklearningDOTcom"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/109963-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-158-discussion/","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-05-23 06:44:00","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer":"B","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (75%)","C (25%)"],"choices":{"A":"creates a virtual pod in the remote location","D":"places leaf switches in the remote site that belong to the same fabric as at the headquarters site","C":"has distance and scale limitations","B":"requires all pods to share the same Cisco APIC cluster"},"question_id":66},{"id":"YnGE12wVzgHHAyy1zY7E","question_images":[],"question_text":"A network engineer must configure a new SNMP configuration and syslog servers.

If you want traffic to flow from one external EPG to another external EPG or to an internal EPG, the subnet must be marked with this control. If you do not mark the subnet with this control, then routes learned from one EPG are advertised to the other external EPG, but packets are dropped in the fabric. The drops occur because the APIC operates in a allowed list model where the default behavior is to drop all data plane traffic between EPGs, unless it is explicitly permitted by a contract. The allowed list model applies to external EPGs and application EPGs. When using security policies that have this option configured, you must configure a contract and a security prefix.\n\nThis is by default turned on for any new prefix that you put in the External EPG.
