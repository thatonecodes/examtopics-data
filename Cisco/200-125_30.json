Both of these can be used in any number of combinations to notate the same address. It is important to note that the double colon (::) can only be used once within a single IPv6 address notation. So, the extra 0's can only be compressed once.","choices":{"C":"B514 : 82C3 : 0029 :: EC7A : 0000 : EC72","D":"B514 : 82C3 :: 0029 : EC7A : 0 : EC72 D","B":"B514 : 82C3 :: 0029 : EC7A : EC72","A":"B514 : 82C3 : 0029 : EC7A : EC72"},"answer":"Explanation","unix_timestamp":1571742840,"timestamp":"2019-10-22 13:14:00","question_id":147,"question_images":[],"exam_id":285,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"Explanation","question_text":"What is the alternative notation for the IPv6 address B514:82C3:0000:0000:0029:EC7A:0000:EC72?","discussion":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"21613","poster":"borto1412","timestamp":"1573759800.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Exactly"}],"content":"The answer is D","timestamp":"1571742840.0","poster":"RedByte","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"16681"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"topic":"2"},{"id":"FfR6oC0x7fII6K7mNkhC","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"sorry I meen ARP Cache (mac address table)","timestamp":"1580408340.0","poster":"etmerdex","comment_id":"44932"},{"content":"The mac address table never stores remote IPs.. so A is incorrect","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1580408280.0","comment_id":"44929","poster":"etmerdex"},{"content":"It's A the correct answer","comment_id":"15680","poster":"MrRobot316","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1571247780.0"}],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26077000003.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26077000000.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26077000005.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26077000001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26077000006.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26077000002.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/n26077000004.png"],"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","topic":"2","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"Hosts A and B are on different subnets and are separated by routers, so the MAC address of HostB will never get back to HostA: Router2 will decapsulate the frames that HostB sends.
