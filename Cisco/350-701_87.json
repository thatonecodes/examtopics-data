It is considered an asymmetric key algorithm because it uses a different key for encryption and decryption. The time required for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange will depend on the specific implementation and the size of the key being used. In general, larger key sizes will require more processing time","comment_id":"782016","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"sull3y","timestamp":"1705739820.0","comment_id":"782017","content":"Triple DES (3DES) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. 3DES applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption algorithm three times to each block of data, providing a more secure encryption process than the original DES algorithm.\n\nYes, 3DES requires the use of secret keys for both encryption and decryption. The secret key is used to encrypt the plaintext, and the same key is used to decrypt the ciphertext. The security of the encryption depends on the secrecy of the key. If the key is compromised, the encryption can be easily broken."}],"timestamp":"1705739760.0","poster":"sull3y"},{"timestamp":"1703610000.0","content":"it should be OK","comment_id":"757666","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Emlia1"}],"answer":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nDrag and drop the descriptions from the left onto the encryption algorithms on the right.\n\n//IMG//","question_id":432,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/92889-exam-350-701-topic-1-question-509-discussion/","isMC":false,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-701/image9.png"],"exam_id":327,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":""},{"id":"7HbcQhGZ8ZvjOmmYyYJ2","question_id":433,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which type of dashboard does Cisco DNA Center provide for complete control of the network?","topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"787483","poster":"sull3y","timestamp":"1690272360.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"D. centralized management.\nCisco DNA Center provides a centralized management dashboard that allows network administrators to have complete control over the network.
