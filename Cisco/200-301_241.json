Security on the management VLAN is typically enforced through other means, such as access control lists (ACLs), VLAN segmentation, authentication mechanisms, encryption protocols, and strict management policies.","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1711824000.0","comments":[{"poster":"Rich_rude","comment_id":"1198033","timestamp":"1713458520.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1713517140.0","comment_id":"1198464","content":"I understand your perspective and you have right on this one. but the feature you're referring to is likely port security, which is a mechanism used to restrict the number of MAC addresses that can be learned on a switch port. When the maximum number of MAC addresses is exceeded, a violation occurs, and depending on the configuration (protect or restrict), the interface can be shut down or other actions can be taken, such as sending an SNMP trap.\n\nGiven your context of working on a military base where strict security measures are enforced, enabling port security to control access to the network makes sense. \nHowever, in the context of the question about MAC address learning, the function itself refers to the basic operation of switches to associate MAC addresses with port locations for forwarding frames efficiently. Therefore, while port security is indeed an important feature for network security, it's not the same as MAC address learning.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"[Removed]"}],"upvote_count":"2","content":"a few weeks ago when i was lab configuring on udemy courses, theres a part where you can enable how many mac addresses can be learnt at max and if you exceed the max a violation occurs and this shuts off the interface.

Anycast addresses for distributed services like DHCP or DNS in IPv6 are typically chosen from the global unicast address space. The specific address range may vary based on your network's design and requirements, but it would be within the global unicast address space.\n\nOut of the options you provided:\n\nA. FF00:1/12 - This is in the multicast address space, not suitable for anycast addresses.\nB. 2001:db8:0234:ca3e::1/128 - This is a specific host address in the documentation prefix 2001:db8, not suitable for anycast.\nC. FE80::1/10 - This is in the link-local address space, not suitable for anycast.\nD. 2002:db84:3f30:ca84:be76:2/64 - This is a global unicast address, but it's not commonly used for anycast.\n\nTo configure anycast addresses for distributed services like DHCP or DNS, you should select a range of global unicast addresses that are not assigned to specific devices and advertise that address on multiple nodes in different locations. The specific address range would depend on your network design and requirements, but it would typically be within the global unicast address space, not one of the addresses you provided.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Shaolinta"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe key characteristic of anycast addresses is that they are assigned to multiple interfaces (nodes) in different locations.
