In a network without Internet connectivity, such a time source may not be available. The ntp master command is used in such cases. \nTo configure the Cisco IOS software as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) master clock to which peers synchronize themselves when an external NTP source is not available, use the ntp master command in global configuration mode."},{"comment_id":"1133766","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1706407860.0","poster":"Mizuchan","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
