In ACI, ARP flooding is typically controlled or minimized using proxy services to avoid unnecessary broadcast traffic. While ARP requests can help in endpoint discovery, this option does not apply to how silent hosts are detected since the host does not send ARP messages.\nSould be D no ? Bounce entries are created when ACI detects that an endpoint has moved from one location to another within the fabric. If the endpoint (silent host) moves but doesn't announce itself via ARP or other traffic, a bounce entry is used to track the old location of the host. When traffic is sent to this silent host, the bounce entry on the original leaf forwards the traffic to the new location, allowing the fabric to update its endpoint database.","poster":"mdriraa","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1288214","timestamp":"1727107860.0"}],"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe difference of enabling and disabling the ARP flooding option appears once ACI learns a silent host IP. One of the benefits of enabling ARP flooding is to be able to detect a silent IP that moved from one location to another without notifying an ACI leaf. Because the ARP request is flooded within the BD, even if the ACI leaf still thinks the IP is at the old location, the host with the silent IP would respond appropriately so that the ACI leaf can update its entry accordingly. If ARP flooding is disabled, the ACI leaf would keep forwarding the ARP request only to the old location until the IP endpoint ages out. On the other hand, the benefit of disabling ARP flooding is to be able to optimize traffic flow by sending the ARP request directly to the location of the target IP, assuming no endpoint moves without notifying its movement via GARP and such. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739989.html","comment_id":"1261710","timestamp":"1722955500.0"}],"question_id":207,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-08-06 16:45:00"},{"id":"z13jC9WeGWbv5AInhp4a","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/300-620/image84.png"],"topic":"1","question_id":208,"isMC":true,"exam_id":312,"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nAn engineer configures a Layer 4 to Layer 7 device object.
