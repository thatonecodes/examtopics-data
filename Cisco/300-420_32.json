This means that the router will not form EIGRP neighbor relationships on that interface.\nEffect on Routing Updates: The effect of the passive interface command in EIGRP is that it suppresses both outgoing and incoming routing updates. This is because EIGRP forms neighbor relationships by exchanging hello packets, and these relationships are required for the exchange of routing updates.\n\nUse Cases: The passive interface feature is typically used in scenarios where you want to prevent EIGRP from sending or receiving updates on an interface, but still want the network connected to that interface to be advertised to other EIGRP neighbors.","poster":"teems5uk","timestamp":"1724812440.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1138450","timestamp":"1722588900.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is right answer\n\nGet up-to-date https://www.pinterest.com/pin/937522847419119701","poster":"[Removed]"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nMaking it a stub network (Option D) will not disable Hellos being sent through any interface.

Advertise the local LAN using the network command and the passive-interface feature\n\nThe engineer should use the network command to advertise the local LAN network in EIGRP and then apply the passive-interface feature to the LAN interface. By doing this, the router will advertise the local LAN network to remote EIGRP neighbors, but it will not send any unnecessary EIGRP multicast messages on the local LAN. The passive-interface feature prevents EIGRP from sending updates or forming adjacencies on the specified interface, which is useful in this scenario since there is only one Layer 3 router at the site."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nb is correct. if you make it a stub then it wont advertise the local lan to the remote neighbor, which is a requirement. the router has as atleast 2 interfaces. one that connects to the remote neighbor and one for the local lan. passive interface can be configured per interface. so you make the local lan interface a passive interface done!","timestamp":"1687459500.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"emre076","comment_id":"753627"},{"content":"I think the confusion on this question is that the passive interface would be to the LAN and not to the remote router otherwise they cant form an adjacency, question states they dont want to send unnecessary multicast traffic to the LAN (not remote router).
