Many developers prefer JSON (over XML) because of its readability and lower overhead.\n\nWhen crafting a RESTCONF request, you specify the data format being sent and requested by the agent. This is done in a typical HTTP way; using request headers:\n\nContent-Type: Specify the type of data being sent from the client\nAccept: Specify the type of data being requested by the client\nRESTCONF describes the following MIME types to be used in these headers to indicate the format being requested.\n\napplication/yang-data+json\napplication/yang-data+xml","timestamp":"1721643000.0"},{"timestamp":"1719345060.0","comment_id":"756031","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct MIME type for data transmitted using the RESTCONF protocol is application/yang.data+json, which indicates that the data is in JSON format and follows the YANG data model. Alternatively, if the data is transmitted in XML format, the MIME type would be application/yang.data+xml.\n\nTherefore, the correct line of code to place in the snippet where it is missing would be either {'Content-Type': 'application/yang.data+json', 'Accept': 'application/yang.data+json'} or {'Content-Type': 'application/yang.data+xml', 'Accept': 'application/yang.data+xml'}, depending on the format of the data being transmitted.","poster":"mellohello"},{"poster":"nfvexpert","upvote_count":"2","content":"There is no such media type as application/restconf and as per the RFC of Restconf it can use application/xml or application/json","comment_id":"617619","timestamp":"1702808100.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"macxsz","timestamp":"1701289260.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA has the only correcto syntax to retrieve on XML format","comment_id":"608886"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1699865940.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt's definitely A.
