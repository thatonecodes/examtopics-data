Traffic is encrypted: Messenger protocols often use encryption to secure the communication between users. While encryption provides privacy and security for legitimate users, it can also make it challenging for firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to inspect and detect any potential data exfiltration. Encrypted traffic can bypass traditional security measures and make it difficult to identify if sensitive data is being transmitted.\n\nA. Messenger applications cannot be segmented with standard network controls: This statement is not accurate. Messenger applications can be subject to network segmentation, firewall rules, and network access controls like any other application. However, the ability to segment them may vary based on the specific implementation and network architecture.","comment_id":"951862","poster":"ums008","timestamp":"1689371700.0"},{"comment_id":"948819","poster":"jku2cya","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nNot C as SSL Decryption can be done on NGFW/IPS","timestamp":"1689064560.0"},{"poster":"Jessie45785","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"862858","timestamp":"1680777060.0","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nA is incorrect - most of the modern communicators enforce SSL pinning - hence man in the middle approach is not an option cause traffic is encrypted\n\nit leaves us only with C and E\nhttps://docs.diladele.com/faq/squid/sslbump_exlusions/whatsapp.html"},{"timestamp":"1680776640.0","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"comment_id":"862857","timestamp":"1680777000.0","content":"I meant A is Incorrect - traffic is encrypted !!! - remove that vote","poster":"Jessie45785","upvote_count":"3"}],"comment_id":"862854","poster":"Jessie45785","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nC is incorrect - most of the modern communicators enforce SSL pinning - hence man in the middle approach is not an option\n\nit leaves us only with A and E\nhttps://docs.diladele.com/faq/squid/sslbump_exlusions/whatsapp.html"},{"timestamp":"1679942520.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nIt's weird how many people are suggesting 'C' for encrypted traffic when any security engineer knows a modern NGFWs have Decryption policies for such traffic, C is definitely not the right answer!\nI'm going A & E.","poster":"Totosos1","comment_id":"852389"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1232720","poster":"Rododendron2","timestamp":"1718774640.0","content":"How you will magically bypass designed and setup traffic flow ?
