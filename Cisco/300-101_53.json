On major network boundaries, subnetworks are summarized to a single classful network and automatic route summarization is enabled by default. Manual route summarization can be configured on per interface basis. When summarization is configured on an interface, the router immediately creates a route pointing to null0.\nRoute summarization works in conjunction with the ip summary-address eigrp interface configuration command, in which additional summarization can be performed. If automatic summarization is in effect, there usually is no need to configure network level summaries using the ip summary-address eigrp command.\nYou can configure a summary aggregate address for a specified interface.
