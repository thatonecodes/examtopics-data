IF those VLANs extend into you legacy non-ACI network, then (by default) these frames will leak from one VLAN to another - which is probably NOT what you want, which is why there is a Multi-Destination Flooding option to Flood in Encapsulation - to prevent leakage from one EPG to another - but again, this may break some protocols.
