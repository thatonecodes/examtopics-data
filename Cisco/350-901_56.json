An engineer creates an application that leverages the Ansible framework to provision CPE endpoints that have configuration changes. The application contains an Ansible playbook named provision_cpes.yml that uses the ansible.builtin.script Ansible module to execute these two Python scripts:\n\n• gather_and_create.py, which creates a JSON file named bios.json that contains the CPE models and their respective IOS file information\n• load_and_parse.py, which loads the file data and parses it for later consumption\n\nAfter several successful runs, the application fails.

I think that there's not actually enough information to say for certain, since in theory the load_and_parse.py script might not be looking in the correct place, but most likely cause is that the bios.json file isn't being created which is why gather_and_create.py is more likely the issue","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1688308680.0"},{"timestamp":"1686110040.0","comment_id":"916839","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt should be A","poster":"tor123"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree to mkOwl","poster":"Fedesarucho","comment_id":"859215","timestamp":"1680458580.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2023-03-31 08:48:00","answer":"A"},{"id":"SUf3YAWV4cjtHHhc49LL","timestamp":"2022-01-04 20:05:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"question_text":"What is a well-defined concept for GDPR compliance?","isMC":true,"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/69472-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-35-discussion/","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Personal data that was collected before the compliance standards were set do not need to be protected.","A":"Data controllers must confirm to data subjects as to whether, where, and why personal data is being processed.","C":"Compliance standards apply to organizations that have a physical presence in Europe.","D":"Records that are relevant to an existing contract agreement can be retained as long as the contract is in effect."},"answer_description":"","exam_id":329,"unix_timestamp":1641323100,"question_id":279,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721147940.0","content":"A is correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"eairl","comment_id":"778106"},{"comment_id":"677072","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1711201560.0","poster":"Teringzooi","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA \nB - Incorrect > all data must be protected even if data was collected before the GDPR.\nC - Incorrect > Compliance standards apply to Europe and to any other country that wants to provide services to individuals within the EU, and as such it extends many of its data privacy safeguards globally.\nD - Incorrect > Data should be kept for no longer than it is necessary"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct\nB - Incorrect > all data must be protected even if data was collected before the GDPR.\nC - Incorrect > Compliance standards apply to Europe and to any other country that wants to provide services to individuals within the EU, and as such it extends many of its data privacy safeguards globally.\nD - Incorrect > Data should be kept for no longer than it is necessary\n\n### GDPR defines six principles relating to the processing of personal data: ###\n- Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: Data is to be used lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.\n- Purpose limitation: Data is to be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.\n- Data minimization: Data is to be relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is collected.
