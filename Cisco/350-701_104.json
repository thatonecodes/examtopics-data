DDOS\n\nA Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack is a type of cyber attack in which multiple systems, often compromised through malware and controlled remotely by attackers, known as \"botnets\", flood the target website or network with a huge amount of traffic in order to overload the system and make it unavailable for legitimate users. The large number of systems participating in the attack amplifies the volume of traffic, making it very difficult for the targeted website or network to handle, resulting in a denial of service. Botnets are commonly used to launch DDoS attacks as they allow attackers to launch a much larger attack than they would be able to accomplish with a single system.","timestamp":"1727243580.0","comment_id":"785068","poster":"sull3y","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"861263","content":"Selected Answer: B\nBotnets – Short for “robot network,” these are networks of infected computers under the control of single attacking parties using command-and-control servers.
