Depending on the configuration, you can:\n\nEnroll the Trustpoint automatically.\n\nThe Catalyst 9800 controller supports automatic certificate enrollment protocols like Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) and Enrollment over Secure Tunnel (EST) to forward and receive certificate requests generated on the controller to the CA.\n\nEnroll the Trustpoint manually.\n\nThe Catalyst 9800 controller supports manual enrollment that uses the PKCS#12 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) mechanism to issue certificates for the controller. Subsequent to the CSR request, the signed certificate for the controller, together with the CA root certificate, are uploaded to the controller.
