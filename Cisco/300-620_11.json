LLDP and control-plane IS-IS convergence occurs in parallel to this boot process. The ACI fabric uses LLDP- and DHCP-based fabric discovery to automatically discover the fabric switch nodes, assign the infrastructure VXLAN tunnel endpoint (VTEP) addresses, and install the firmware on the switches. Prior to this automated process, a minimal bootstrap configuration must be performed on the Cisco APIC controller. After the APIC controllers are connected and their IP addresses assigned, the APIC GUI can be accessed by entering the address of any APIC controller into a web browser. The APIC GUI runs HTML5 and eliminates the need for Java to be installed locally."}],"answer_description":""},{"id":"2TW451DDCIrOiYhUwunb","timestamp":"2023-05-11 16:53:00","question_id":54,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/108979-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-147-discussion/","isMC":true,"exam_id":312,"topic":"1","question_text":"What is the purpose of the Overlay Multicast TEP in a Cisco ACI Multi-Site deployment?","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"to source and receive unicast VXLAN data plane traffic","D":"to perform head-end replication for BUM traffic","B":"to establish MP-BGP EVPN adjacencies with the spine nodes in remote sites","C":"to encapsulate multicast traffic in a common multicast group"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"898317","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739609.html\n\n Overlay Multicast TEP (O-MTEP): This common anycast address is shared by all the spine nodes in the same site and is used to perform head-end replication for BUM traffic.
