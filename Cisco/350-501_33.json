This type of configuration is typically used in route redistribution scenarios to control which routes are redistributed between different routing protocols. In this scenario, since the organization is merging two networks that are using different routing protocols, route redistribution is likely necessary. \nThe route map named match-tag is configured to match routes with the tag 15. This route map should be applied during the redistribution process to control which routes are redistributed based on the tag.\nTo complete the implementation, the route map must be attached to the redistribution command.
