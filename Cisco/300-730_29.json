The Group Policy defines various parameters and settings for a particular group of remote access clients. Within the Group Policy configuration, you can specify whether split tunneling should be enabled or disabled for the IKEv2 remote access clients associated with that group. Split tunneling determines how network traffic is routed when a remote access client is connected to the router using IKEv2. It allows the client to decide which traffic should be sent through the VPN tunnel and which traffic should be directly routed to the local network or the internet. While IKEv2 Authorization Policy can also play a role in defining access permissions and policies for IKEv2 remote access clients, split tunneling itself is typically configured within the Group Policy. So, the correct answer is that split tunneling for IKEv2 remote access clients on a Cisco router is defined within the Group Policy.","timestamp":"1719978060.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1104369","timestamp":"1719179940.0","poster":"Rosh8787","upvote_count":"1","content":"A is the Correct answer"},{"comment_id":"1099226","content":"Group policy makes sense here.","poster":"kylesam2017","comments":[{"comment_id":"1130540","content":"Naa, Group policy if I am correct is on ASA","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721814900.0","poster":"shadow2020"}],"timestamp":"1718651160.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1715776140.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1071542","poster":"gondohwe","content":"a big A"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1692749340.0","comment_id":"818673","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Net4dd"},{"comment_id":"631093","timestamp":"1673660880.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDefined in IKEv2 auth policy","poster":"AF_Nick","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"596099","content":"Selected Answer: A\nVPN-ROUTER(config)# ip access-list extended SPLIT_TUNNEL_ACL\nVPN-ROUTER(config-std-nacl)# permit 172.20.1.0 0.0.0.255\nVPN-ROUTER(config-std-nacl)#\nVPN-ROUTER(config-std-nacl)# crypto ikev2 authorization policy\nEMPLOYEES\nVPN-ROUTER(config-ikev2-author-policy)# route set access-list\nSPLIT_TUNNEL_ACL","timestamp":"1667409900.0","poster":"[Removed]"},{"comments":[{"content":"Correction.

On IOS Router, you can configure GRE over IPsec to enable multicast traffic to traverse the VPN tunnel. It encapsulates multicast packets into GRE packets, which are then encrypted using IPsec. As for FTD (Firepower Threat Defense), it doesn't natively support GRE tunneling. However, you can still achieve multicast over IPsec functionality by using a workaround called IPsec Tunnel Mode over Transport Mode, which allows multicast traffic to pass through the IPsec tunnel. In summary, both IOS Router and FTD can handle multicast traffic over a site-to-site VPN, but the specific implementation may differ","timestamp":"1718651460.0","poster":"kylesam2017","comment_id":"1099234","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Anonymous983475","comment_id":"909949","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGRE is only supported on routers, making all other answers but A invalid","timestamp":"1701330840.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nagree with mazinhoo, Cisco link listed supports answer A","comment_id":"842308","poster":"netizen937","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694978520.0"},{"content":"GRE is not supported in FTD, so A is correct \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/ipsec-negotiation-ike-protocols/216276-configure-route-based-site-to-site-vpn-t.html#anc6","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"636499","poster":"mazinhoo","timestamp":"1674636780.0"},{"poster":"AF_Nick","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"631094","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.
