I believe that in the WLC GUI, generally, you cannot simultaneously enable both 802.1x and PSK authentication methods for the same WLAN, it would have to be on separate WLANs. Therefore, as the PSK method is already used, we should not change it to 802.1x/EAP, and legacy devices that do not have the 802.11r feature would just not take advantage of FT fast roaming with the initial handshake already pre-established with another AP via the 802.11r protocol, having to go through the entire reauthentication and reassociation process when roaming, creating a delay, but the devices it supports would take advantage of this feature (FT) while they roam the company's floors getting almost instantaneous associations when needs roaming.","poster":"dropspablo","upvote_count":"4"}],"content":"Ok, I'm going to take a swing a this...\nSo, the question specifically states compatible devices \"Users need to connect to the wireless network with IEEE 802.11r-COMPATIBLE DEVICES.\" \nAccording to the reference link, it states \"If clients do not support mixed mode or 802.11r join, they can join non-802.11r WLANs.

It allows clients to quickly transition between access points within the same ESS without reauthenticating with the RADIUS server. The clients continue using their existing 802.1x credentials as they roam.\n\nFT PSK (Pre-Shared Key): This option is used when the wireless network uses WPA2-Personal (PSK) for client authentication. It enables fast roaming for clients that use a pre-shared key passphrase for authentication. FT PSK allows clients to roam seamlessly without reentering the PSK passphrase as they move between access points within the same ESS.\nBecause PSK has been checked already. so C is correct.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Cynthia2023","timestamp":"1706056740.0"},{"timestamp":"1702898580.0","comment_id":"926588","poster":"HM01","content":"If the goal is to maintain a seamless connection for users with IEEE 802.11r-compatible devices as they move between floors or areas in a building, it is recommended to use the FT 802.1x option instead of the PSK (Pre-Shared Key) option.\n\nThe FT 802.1x option provides enhanced security and seamless authentication during the handoff process. It utilizes the IEEE 802.1x/EAP authentication method, which involves individual authentication for each user. This ensures that users are securely authenticated and their communication remains confidential.\n\nOn the other hand, the PSK option relies on a pre-shared key that is shared among all devices connecting to the network. While it provides a simpler configuration process, it may not offer the same level of security and flexibility as the FT 802.1x option.\n\nBy selecting the FT 802.1x option, you can benefit from the advanced security features and seamless authentication provided by IEEE 802.11r.
