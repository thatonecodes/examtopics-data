The two main components of Cisco Express Forwarding operation are the forwarding information base (FIB) and the adjacency tables.\nThe FIB is conceptually similar to a routing table or information base. A router uses this lookup table to make destination-based switching decisions during Cisco\nExpress Forwarding operation. The FIB is updated when changes occur in the network and contains all routes known at the time. For more information, see the\nFIB Overview section.\n\nAdjacency tables maintain Layer 2 next-hop addresses for all FIB entries. For more information, see the CEF Adjacency Tables Overview section.\nThis separation of the reachability information (in the Cisco Express Forwarding table) and the forwarding information (in the adjacency table), provides a number of benefits:\nThe adjacency table can be built separately from the Cisco Express Forwarding table, allowing both to be built without any packets being process-switched.\nThe MAC header rewrite used to forward a packet is not stored in cache entries, so changes in a MAC header rewrite string do not require validation of cache entries.\nReference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipswitch_cef/configuration/15-mt/isw-cef-15-mt-book/isw-cef-overview.html","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1567233300.0","poster":"Bastex","comment_id":"9071","upvote_count":"1","content":"“This separation of the reachability information (in the Cisco Express Forwarding table) and the forwarding information (in the adjacency table), provides a number of benefits:”\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipswitch_cef/configuration/15-mt/isw-cef-15-mt-book/isw-cef-overview.html#GUID-993D4B0C-C032-420D-8304-F56AAB1CECC6"}],"question_id":123,"unix_timestamp":1567233300,"exam_id":296,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/4413-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-517-discussion/"},{"id":"CC53HYI2MCfdzkC0cHlT","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-08-31 08:43:00","choices":{"D":"to allow only 192.168.1.3 to access the system using the community string public.","A":"to allow private communications between the router and the host","B":"to disable all SNMP informs that are on the system","C":"to collect information about the system on a network management server"},"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"What is the function of the snmp-server enable traps and snmp-server host 192.168.1.3 traps version 2c public commands?","unix_timestamp":1567233780,"isMC":true,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"question_id":124,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Roxy","content":"is only C","comment_id":"47225","timestamp":"1580975820.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Haggyman","timestamp":"1568445840.0","content":"I agree with Bastex.
