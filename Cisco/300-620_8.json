Suppose that hardware proxy has been enabled on a bridge domain, ARP flooding has been disabled, and ACI has already learned a silent host in the BD through ARP gleaning. If the silent host moves from one location to another without notifying the new ACI leaf via GARP or some other mechanism, ACI switches continue to forward traffic intended for the silent IP address to the previous location until retention timers clear the endpoint from COOP. Until that point, if an endpoint sends ARP requests toward this silent host, ARP gleaning is not triggered because COOP considers the destination endpoint to be known. On the other hand, with ARP flooding enabled on the BD, ARP requests are flooded, and the silent host responds at its new location, enabling the new local leaf to learn the silent host and update COOP.","timestamp":"1705378980.0","comment_id":"952903"},{"comment_id":"904498","timestamp":"1700714220.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHardware Proxy\nBy default, Layer 2 unknown unicast traffic is sent to the spine proxy. This behaviour is controlled by the hardware proxy option associated with a bridge domain: if the destination is not known, send the packet to the spine proxy; if the spine proxy also does not know the address, discard the packet (default mode).\n\nThe advantage of the hardware proxy mode is that no flooding occurs in the fabric. The potential disadvantage is that the fabric has to learn all the endpoint addresses.\n\nWith Cisco ACI, however, this is not a concern for virtual and physical servers that are part of the fabric: the database is built for scalability to millions of endpoints. However, if the fabric had to learn all the IP addresses coming from the Internet, it would clearly not scale.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1700714280.0","comment_id":"904499","poster":"thinqtanklearningDOTcom","content":"Flooding Mode\nAlternatively, you can enable flooding mode: if the destination MAC address is not known, flood in the bridge domain. By default, ARP traffic is not flooded but sent to the destination endpoint. By enabling ARP flooding, ARP traffic is also flooded. A good use case for enabling ARP flooding would be when the Default Gateway resides outside of the ACI Fabric. This non-optimal configuration will require ARP Flooding enabled on the BD.\n\nThis mode of operation is equivalent to that of a regular Layer 2 switch, except that in Cisco ACI this traffic is transported in the fabric as a Layer 3 frame with all the benefits of Layer 2 multi-pathing, fast convergence, and so on.\n\nHardware proxy and unknown unicast and ARP flooding are two opposite modes of operation. With hardware proxy disabled and without unicast and ARP flooding, Layer 2 switching would not work.\n\nThis option does not have any impact on what the mapping database actually learns; the mapping database is always populated for Layer 2 entries regardless of this configuration.","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"thinqtanklearningDOTcom"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"904487","comments":[{"timestamp":"1700712360.0","comment_id":"904488","upvote_count":"1","poster":"thinqtanklearningDOTcom","content":"For this reason, I would choose option C (L2 Unknown Unicasts are sent to the Hardware Proxy)"}],"timestamp":"1700712360.0","content":"ARP Gleaning...\n\nForwarding is optimized: \n\n- L2 Unknown Unicasts are sent to the Hardware Proxy\n- L3 Unknown Multicasts are flooded\n- Multi Destination frames are flooded within the BD\n- ARP flooding is disabled","poster":"thinqtanklearningDOTcom"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"866565","poster":"7korn7","timestamp":"1696964760.0","comments":[{"content":"Not necessarily.
