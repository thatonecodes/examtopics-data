This command specifies the HTTP server port number on the switch, enabling it to listen for HTTP requests on a different port than the default (which is typically port 80).

(in general you con figure a permit any any to redirect all traffic)\nHTTP Proxy Configuration\n\nIf you use an HTTP proxy for your clients, it means that your clients:\n\n Use a unconventional port for HTTP protocol\n Send all their traffic to that proxy\n\nIn order to have the switch listen on the unconventional port (for example, 8080), use these commands:\n\nip http port 8080\nip port-map http port 8080\n\nYou also need to configure all clients to keep using their proxy but to not use the proxy for the ISE IP address. All browsers include a feature that allows you to enter host names or IP addresses that should not use the proxy. If you do not add the exception for the ISE, you encounter a loop authentication page.\n\nYou also need to modify your redirection ACL to permit on the proxy port (8080 in this example).\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/identity-services-engine/113362-config-web-auth-ise-00.html#anc11","timestamp":"1741010220.0","poster":"Cachaman","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1736553900.0","poster":"327c7c8","comment_id":"1339012","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected
