This is particularly important in an outdoor setting like a sports complex, where there might be other sources of interference.\n\n14-dBi Patch Antenna: A patch antenna with a high gain (14 dBi) is directional and focuses the signal in a specific direction, which is ideal for backhaul links where the signal needs to travel a longer distance from the RAP to other access points in the network. The directional nature of the patch antenna helps in maintaining a strong and focused signal, increasing the link's reliability and performance.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1703787720.0","comment_id":"1108037","poster":"Babustest"},{"timestamp":"1688666640.0","poster":"gargionifabio","content":"omnidirectional antennas is used to cliente conectivity (2.4Ghz), to backhaul we use directional antennas with good gain and ins 5Ghz.

To optimize mesh behavior, omnidirectional antennas are used because mesh links are limited to one mile (1.6 km). The curvature of the earth does not impact line-of-sight calculations because the curvature of the earth changes every six miles (9.6 km).\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/technology/mesh/8-0/design/guide/mesh80/m_site-preparation-and-planning.html","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"916449","poster":"jorgemejiae"},{"comment_id":"914878","timestamp":"1685904780.0","content":"This question should have a diagram/map showing location data as to where this entrance is located with regard to the fields, as such we cannot answer the question accurately beyond the fact that it should be 5.0GHz.","poster":"NoWiresIncluded","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"838688","timestamp":"1678786140.0","content":"As it's about a sports complex, I assume that distances are long between APs and that APs are deployed in a serial manner, one after another, with the RAP being the first AP in the line near the entrance.\nIn order to cover long distances, you need a directional antenna with appropriate gain value, so I vote for C.\nI don't think that an omnidirectional antenna in the RAP with a lower gain could provide sufficient RSSI for MAPs to be able cover the distance of the whole complex.\n\nOf course, a walkthrough survey would help in the final decision.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"anagy11"},{"comment_id":"778304","content":"Selected Answer: C\nClearly C.","timestamp":"1673904900.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"FabriG"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Eyserith","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFor backhaul to the core you'd want a directional antenna pointed at the entrance of the Sports complex.","comment_id":"589556","timestamp":"1650564480.0","comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"its not mandatory that app MAP should connect to the RAP. so that several sport field will be in directional way for distributed places , even its distributed MAP can be connected to another MAP too then it will reach to the RAP","comment_id":"1222907","timestamp":"1717276680.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Lakshan__97"}],"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"797809","poster":"Gab99","timestamp":"1675505580.0","content":"This is not what the question asked.
