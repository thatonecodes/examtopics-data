Deploy a firewall in transparent mode between the clients and servers.\n\nTransparent mode firewall deployment can provide layer 2 segmentation between clients and servers without requiring any IP address reconfiguration. The firewall operates as a bridge, filtering traffic between the two segments based on the configured policies. This allows the clients and servers to remain on the same Layer 3 network while still providing a level of segmentation to meet the compliancy requirement.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Joe_Blue","comment_id":"835959","timestamp":"1678536780.0"},{"timestamp":"1663225860.0","comment_id":"669577","poster":"Aarow","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSame subnet, we need a layer two solution, no Routing.

A transparent firewall, on the other hand, is a Layer 2 firewall that acts like a “bump in the wire,” or a “stealth firewall,” and is not seen as a router hop to connected devices. However, like any other firewall, access control between interfaces is controlled, and all of the usual firewall checks are in place. Layer 2 connectivity is achieved by using a \"bridge group\" where you group together the inside and outside interfaces for a network, and the Firepower Threat Defense device uses bridging techniques to pass traffic between the interfaces. Each bridge group includes a Bridge Virtual Interface (BVI) to which you assign an IP address on the network. You can have multiple bridge groups for multiple networks. In transparent mode, these bridge groups cannot communicate with each other","timestamp":"1652344200.0","comment_id":"600531","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt’s pretty much a trick question\nThe clients and servers all reside on the same Layer 3 network - Same layer 3 network but it's not say \"same subnet\" so\n Without readdressing IP subnets for clients or servers - so it says subnetS no subnet! \n\nSo we can conclude there are minimum two subnets (same and one layer 3 network) so the routed mode is OK and B is correct","poster":"hz033","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"598152","timestamp":"1651934280.0"},{"comment_id":"595841","content":"B.
