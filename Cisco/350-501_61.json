A link-state routing protocol is required because link information, such as available bandwidth is crucial for the operation of TE tunnels.","timestamp":"1731977400.0"},{"content":"Information distribution is a link state protocol, such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS), which is necessary to discover the topology. These protocols have been enhanced to carry additional information related to TE, such as bandwidth available and other related parameters. IS-IS uses new Type Length Values (TLVs) and OSPF uses Type 10 (Opaque) Link State Advertisements (LSAs) for this purpose. Other IGPs cannot be used to implement MPLS TE.\n\nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-knowledge-base/how-mpls-traffic-engineering-works/ta-p/3128593","timestamp":"1694467020.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1005165","poster":"cerifyme85"}],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/120558-exam-350-501-topic-1-question-4-discussion/","question_id":301,"choices":{"D":"The tunnel endpoints use the link-state database to evaluate the entire topology and determine the best path.","B":"The link-state database provides a data repository from which the tunnel endpoints can dynamically select a source ID.","C":"Link-state routing protocols use SPF calculations that the tunnel endpoints leverage to implement the tunnel.","A":"The link-state database provides segmentation by area, which improves the path-selection process."},"unix_timestamp":1694467020,"exam_id":325,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-11 23:17:00","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"TKqJhqGPzuWFmDdzVv9O","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"AD","timestamp":"2021-11-22 07:56:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"AD","choices":{"A":"LAN","C":"MAN","D":"WAN","B":"SONET","E":"WDWM"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/66527-exam-350-501-topic-1-question-40-discussion/","answers_community":["AD (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which two PHY modes are available to implement an IOS XR 10 Gigabit Ethernet interface?
