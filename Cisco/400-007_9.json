WRED allows the router to selectively drop packets when the congestion level exceeds a certain threshold. By dropping packets early in the queue, before the queue becomes full, it helps to prevent tail drops and reduce congestion.

Control and data forwarding planes are kept separate: In the SD-WAN architecture, the control and data forwarding planes are kept separate to centralize management and policy enforcement across the network and to streamline data forwarding. This separation allows for flexible management and rapid deployment. This separation allows for flexible management and rapid network changes.\n\nD. Solutions include centralized orchestration, control, and zero-touch provisioning.
