The effects of centralized control policy are seen in how vEdge routers direct the overlay network's data traffic to its destination. The centralized control policy configuration itself remains on the vSmart controller and is never pushed to local routers.\nCentralized data policy applies to the flow of data traffic throughout the VPNs in the overlay network.
