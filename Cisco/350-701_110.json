Why drop dhcp packets if you are making the switch a dhcp server? I think the question was that the engineer is configuring 'DHCP Snooping\" so therefore the answer is C. But to answer the original question than yeah, the answer is D ... which then make sense lol.","timestamp":"1744149900.0"},{"content":"Packet Validation\n\n•The switch receives a packet on an untrusted interface, and the source MAC address and the DHCP client hardware address do not match. This check is performed only if the DHCP snooping MAC address verification option is turned on.\n\n•The switch receives a DHCPRELEASE or DHCPDECLINE message from an untrusted host with an entry in the DHCP snooping binding table, and the interface information in the binding table does not match the interface on which the message was received.\n\n•The switch receives a DHCP packet that includes a relay agent IP address that is not 0.0.0.0.\n\nC needs to have DHCP snooping configured which is not explicitly stated in the question. But in D probably the word \"not\" is missing, so either a typo or otherwise I'd still choose C. \n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/Test/dwerblo/broken_guide/snoodhcp.html#wp1109594","poster":"dfb0b7d","comment_id":"1294839","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1728411960.0"},{"comment_id":"1268260","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1724023620.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think the correct is C"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nbecause of DHCP snooping, C. seems like the most logical answer","poster":"devildog","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723760280.0","comment_id":"1266724"}],"answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1723760280,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-08-16 00:18:00"},{"id":"mNvzXIftX2xT2QQpz48d","answer":"BE","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728116640.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB and E are correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Marshpillowz","comment_id":"1189773"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"sull3y","timestamp":"1696653540.0","comment_id":"863475","content":"The two advantages of using Cisco AnyConnect over DMVPN are:\n\nB.
