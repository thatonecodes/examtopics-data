It includes grouped data such as the total number of clients, client distribution by SSID, client distribution by AP, and other relevant metrics.\n\nThis report is ideal for generating graphical summaries of client activity and connectivity.\n\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\nA. Client Traffic Stream Metrics:\n\nThis report focuses on detailed traffic metrics for individual clients, such as throughput, retries, and packet counts. It does not provide a summary of the total number of clients.\n\nC. Posture Status Count:\n\nThis report is related to network access control (NAC) and provides information about the compliance status of clients (e.g., compliant, non-compliant). It does not provide a summary of the total number of wireless clients.\n\nD. Mobility Client Summary:\n\nThis report is specific to mobility services and provides information about client roaming behavior. It does not provide a summary of the total number of clients on the network.","comment_id":"1357429","poster":"rrahim","timestamp":"1739744880.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1724485440.0","poster":"most_ahdy","content":"https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/prime/infrastructure/3-2/reference/reports_field_ref.xlsx","comment_id":"988963","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1721081160.0","poster":"GoldLeader","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. is a graphical report that displays the total number of wireless clients on the network.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"952720"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ace_Pee","comment_id":"935247","content":"I say B as you need a mobility oracle (POS and EOS) in the network to use the report referanced in D.","timestamp":"1719484560.0"},{"comment_id":"887046","poster":"Vlad_Is_Love_ua","comments":[{"comment_id":"904278","content":"Client Summary Dashboard has nice data, but is not a graphical report.
