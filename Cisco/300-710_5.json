By configuring a prefilter policy, you can optimize the rate at which traffic is inspected by selectively bypassing rules that are not needed for certain types of traffic.","timestamp":"1694440500.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_id":21,"answer":"B","exam_id":314,"choices":{"C":"Configure modular policy framework","D":"Disable TCP inspection","A":"Enable the FXOS for multi-instance","B":"Configure a prefilter policy"}},{"id":"P8aDes8Byvx5pXRsXT9O","answers_community":["C (89%)","11%"],"exam_id":314,"question_text":"Which policy rule is included in the deployment of a local DMZ during the initial deployment of a Cisco NGFW through the Cisco FMC GUI?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nans: C","timestamp":"1737258720.0","comment_id":"1342851","poster":"abul8223"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727429700.0","poster":"Grandslam","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThere is no DMZ setup during initial deployment of a CISCO NGFW using the FMC GUI... You would have to specify an interface designated to receive DMZ traffic, associate it to a security zone designated to DMZ traffic and lastly configure a policy to act on the DMZ traffic.... \n\nHowever, when creating a NEW access control policy you have to choose from one of the 3 default actions:\nBlock all traffic\nIntrusion Prevention\nNetwork Discovery\n\nSo Technical C would be correct because there is no DMZ deployment during initial setup but if you were to setup a DMZ after initial setup you would most likely block all traffic by default and change it after to allow all traffic...

The DMZ is here to throw us off, the default action for the FMC in the policy rules is Block ALL Traffic. Would they count this as a policy? Only the person who wrote the question knows. However, there are no Policies configured at all, that's why after you create your interface, you need to go and add your policy rules or it will be blocked by default. That's why I say it depends on what they are looking for with this question. Is there a \"deny ip any\" yes sure, but that's the default for everything and not only the DMZ, does it count as a policy? I don't think so, because when you go to the ACP it will tell you that you don't have any rules and you have to create a rule.\nWith that being said, I will go with the provided answer and pray for the best.","poster":"eazy99"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"835927","content":"Selected Answer: C\nNo policy rule is included in the deployment of a local DMZ during the initial deployment of a Cisco NGFW through the Cisco FMC GUI.

This ensures that critical traffic is not dropped, and network performance is not degraded during peak traffic times.\n\nEnabling IPS inline link state propagation (Option A) is a mechanism that ensures link state information is propagated to the inline security device, such as IPS.
