Virtual machines communicate primarily through broadcast mode: In a traditional physical network, communication between devices typically occurs through unicast or multicast traffic.

In VM environments, the Layer 2 domain can be large, as multiple VMs may be connected to the same virtual switch. This can lead to broadcast radiation, as broadcast packets sent by one VM are replicated to all the other VMs on the same virtual switch.\n\nD.Communication between vSwitch and network switch is typically based on Ethernet frames, which use broadcast for certain types of traffic, such as ARP requests and DHCP broadcasts. This can lead to broadcast radiation in VM environments.","comment_id":"829916","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1693910940.0","poster":"mykab"},{"timestamp":"1693810140.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"828761","poster":"Quentin_","content":"A is true, but it's not the cause of broadcast radiation.

Therefore if the layer 2 domain in virtual machine environment is too large, broadcast radiation may occur -> VLANs should be used to reduce broadcast radiation.\nAlso if virtual machines communicate via broadcast too much, broadcast radiation may occur.\nAnother reason for broadcast radiation is using a trunk (to extend VLANs) from the network switch to the physical server.","timestamp":"1626588180.0","comment_id":"270098"},{"timestamp":"1626168300.0","content":"Its B and C because the question is asking for the cause of radiation, not asking how the hypervisor is affected i.e. the interrupts.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"sledgey121","comment_id":"266236"},{"timestamp":"1622317140.0","comment_id":"230625","content":"B and C are correct answers","poster":"Helloory","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"191258","content":"A and C","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1617321720.0","poster":"tchow1985"},{"timestamp":"1616342400.0","comment_id":"183721","poster":"brunok","content":"if the number of virtual machines and the number of VLANs is limited to three or four VLANs (vswitches), a reasonable degree of flexibility can be achieved.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"patrickni","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1615082520.0","comment_id":"174854","content":"I would go with A and B"},{"timestamp":"1614497460.0","poster":"keinokinene","comment_id":"169791","upvote_count":"3","content":"BC correct"},{"comment_id":"166507","content":"This processing overhead can have a tangible effect on overall server performance if a single domain is hosting a large number of virtual machines.\nNote: This overhead effect is not a limitation of the vswitch implementation.
