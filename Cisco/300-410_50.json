Not relevant, here, as we are trying to influence outbound path selection.\n\nGiven that the engineer is dealing with two routers connected to different ISPs, using LOCAL_PREF is preferred because it ensures that the preference is consistent across the entire AS, not just on a single router.\n\nSo, while configuring **weight** can achieve a similar outcome on a single router, **local preference** is generally preferred for broader and more consistent influence across all routers within the AS."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI choose D.
