However, for testing common Snort rules while still maintaining a reasonable level of security, the Balanced Security and Connectivity policy is generally more appropriate. It strikes a good balance between security and performance, ensuring that you can test the rules effectively without compromising too much on security.\n\nIf the primary goal is to ensure maximum network traffic flow with minimal interference, then Connectivity Over Security could be considered.
