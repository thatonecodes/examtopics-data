Lost LDP adjacency: The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is used to distribute labels in MPLS networks. If the LDP adjacency between two PE routers is lost, the routers will not be able to exchange labels, causing the LSP (Label Switched Path) to break.\n\nE. MPLS not enabled: If MPLS is not enabled on either of the PE routers, the LSP cannot be established, as MPLS relies on the ability to swap labels across routers to forward packets along a path.","poster":"Sammy3637","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"poster":"Sammy3637","timestamp":"1740279120.0","comment_id":"1360378","upvote_count":"1","content":"The other options:\n\nB. Matching labels: While matching labels are important for LSPs to work properly, mismatched labels (not matching) could cause issues, but matching labels themselves aren't the cause of a broken LSP.\n\nC.

IGP hello adjacency: This refers to the hello protocol for IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) neighbors like OSPF or EIGRP. It's crucial for routing, but it doesn't directly affect the LSP in MPLS unless it impacts the overall routing table, which would indirectly affect MPLS label distribution."}],"timestamp":"1740279060.0"},{"poster":"tubirubs","timestamp":"1725267300.0","comment_id":"1276556","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nPrefix mismatch would more likely cause routing issues, but it is not directly related to the LSP breaking, as LSPs are built using label information rather than IP prefix information directly."},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA & C are correct\n\nThe label bindings must correspond to the prefixes and subnet masks in the routing tables. \nIf there's a mismatch, the labels will not be used properly, causing the LSP to fail.\n\n\ni think E is incorrect, if MPLS is not enabled on the routers, there won’t be any LSPs to break.\n\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls/mpls/23565-troubleshoot-mpls-vpn.html#cause:~:text=If%20label%20bindings,devices%20will%20fail.","timestamp":"1724159820.0","comment_id":"1269500","comments":[{"poster":"bk989","comment_id":"1272289","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724617440.0","content":"Correct and taken from the link you provided:\nIf label bindings are received from a downstream neighbor for prefixes (including subnet mask) which do not appear in a router's routing and CEF tables, these bindings will not be used.
