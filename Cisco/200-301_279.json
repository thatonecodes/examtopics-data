This is typically accomplished by adding a unique identifier, called a sequence number or nonce, to each packet. The recipient of the packet keeps track of the sequence numbers that it has received and processes only packets that have not been received before. If a packet with a duplicate sequence number is received, it is discarded."},{"poster":"Leethy","timestamp":"1680949320.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption B: Anti-replay is a security method used to prevent an attacker from intercepting and replaying valid data, but it is not specifically used to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. \n\nAnti-replay works by using sequence numbers or timestamps to ensure that each piece of data is unique and has not been intercepted and replayed by an attacker. While this can help prevent certain types of attacks, it is not a complete solution for preventing MITM attacks. Authentication, on the other hand, is specifically designed to prevent MITM attacks by verifying the identity of each party in a communication.","comment_id":"864604"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"3040636","timestamp":"1726656900.0","content":"Authentication","comment_id":"1285685"},{"poster":"Artyom","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe authentication method is used because it verifies the identities of participants in a network or communication.

Man-in-the-middle attacks occur when an attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties, without their knowledge. By authenticating the identities of the communicating parties, it becomes more difficult for an attacker to impersonate one of them and insert themselves into the communication.\n\nAuthentication methods can include passwords, digital certificates, biometric authentication, two-factor authentication (2FA), and other mechanisms that verify the identity of the communicating parties. By ensuring that the parties involved are who they claim to be, authentication helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and helps establish a secure and trusted communication channel.","comment_id":"923595","upvote_count":"3","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1686782220.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-02-21 20:38:00","question_id":1391,"exam_id":288,"answers_community":["A (83%)","B (17%)"],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/100309-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-995-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"authentication","C":"authorization","B":"anti-replay","D":"accounting"},"question_text":"Which security method is used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks?"},{"id":"m1yj3tSiTlk22VWrOAGr","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Which cipher is supported for wireless encryption only with the WPA2 standard?","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-08-05 19:32:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer":"B","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1691256720.0","poster":"mda2h","comment_id":"973247","content":"Dafuq Cisco WPA3 standard uses AES as well ...","comments":[{"poster":"Th1nk3rman","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1359263","content":"WPA 3 uses SAE, if Im correct","timestamp":"1740059100.0"},{"poster":"RPG_1984","timestamp":"1737854280.0","content":"If the intent was to identify the encryption cipher introduced by WPA2 and widely associated with it, B.

The PSK is a passphrase or password that is shared between the access point and wireless clients.\n\nEnterprise mode, also known as WPA-EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), uses a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server to authenticate wireless clients.
