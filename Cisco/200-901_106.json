Version control can protect your code by allowing changes to be checked in (through a process known as a code commit) to a hierarchical tree structure of folders with files in them. You often don’t know what a developer might need to change or has changed, but the version control system does. Each check-in is tagged with who made the change and what the person changed within the code. Instead of using inefficient techniques such as file locking, a version control system handles concurrent check-ins, allowing two programmers to commit code at the same time. [..] Another aspect of a version control system is the ability to branch and merge code built independently. This is very useful if you are writing code on a part of an application that could conflict with another part written by another team.\nPage 170 CCNA DevNet (DEVASC) - 200-901","upvote_count":"2","poster":"designated","timestamp":"1727422560.0","comment_id":"546701"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA and C\nVery obvious","poster":"macxsz","comment_id":"608840","timestamp":"1653841380.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA, C will be the answer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"516828","poster":"Fmagnago","timestamp":"1641314640.0"},{"poster":"mani2021","content":"A and C is the answer","timestamp":"1630910880.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"440153"},{"content":"A,C answer","comment_id":"401531","timestamp":"1625720280.0","poster":"rajkbm","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"A and C","timestamp":"1623373800.0","comment_id":"379371","upvote_count":"2","poster":"henrytimothy24"},{"timestamp":"1615039080.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"304682","content":"A and C should be the answer","poster":"kirankkotla"},{"timestamp":"1613506800.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"292089","content":"I will go for A, C","poster":"Aerolucky"},{"upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"292087","poster":"Aerolucky","content":"I will go for A,C","timestamp":"1613506740.0"},{"timestamp":"1612185240.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"SAGA","comments":[{"content":"oops, i mean D is wrong. correct would be A & C","timestamp":"1612185300.0","comment_id":"281246","upvote_count":"5","poster":"SAGA"}],"comment_id":"281245","content":"backlog and user stories are term of Agile methods, hereby, C is wrong"},{"content":"A and C in my opinion","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"243583","poster":"TroyMcLure","timestamp":"1607950920.0"},{"content":"A et D are correct","poster":"bpbenabd","comments":[{"content":"It is deffinitely A and C","poster":"bpbenabd","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1608486840.0","comment_id":"248852"}],"timestamp":"1604094780.0","comment_id":"209601","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"172266","content":"A and C","poster":"psyborg","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1599086220.0"},{"content":"A and C would be the correct answer","comment_id":"154327","timestamp":"1597048620.0","upvote_count":"9","poster":"NitinPathak"},{"comments":[{"content":"D is wrong because git doesn't have the ability to track user stories.
