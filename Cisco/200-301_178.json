The command \"ip route 172.16.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.4\" establishes a static route to the 172.16.3.0 network. This means that the router knows how to reach the devices in the 172.16.3.0 network, and it will use the interface with the address 192.168.2.4 to reach them.\n\nD. The command \"ip route 172.16.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.4\" also configures the router to send any traffic for an unknown destination out the interface with the address 192.168.2.4. This is because it's a default route (also known as the gateway of last resort), which means if the router doesn't have a specific route for a destination, it will send the traffic out through this interface.\n\nThe other options (B, C, E, and F) do not accurately describe the behavior of the given command.","poster":"ajuniad","comment_id":"981961"},{"comment_id":"258576","content":"AE are correct.","timestamp":"1625316240.0","poster":"Ali526","upvote_count":"8"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA.
