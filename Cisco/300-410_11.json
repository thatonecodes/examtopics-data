The applied ACL on \"10 permit udp any eq snmp any\" is WRONG as it implies source port 161 to reach the actual router. This seems odd because the DESINATION port is actually 161 here and that one is listening on this actual router. To make the ACL actually match on inbound traffic hitting the SNMP server on this router, port 161 should be allowed as destination port as otherwise the management station cannot reach this router. Again, outbound traps should not be relavent for CoPP, if the traps overheat your CPU, it does not make a difference if they are blocked or not, the damage (high cpu) is already done. Summarazing here: the answer is D for sure as we need to allow inbound SNMP with having a destination port matching 161 == permit udep any any eq snmp (so the SNMP runs on the router, actually listening on that port) The management station is just a client in the dialog and generates a random source port."}]}],"content":"The answer doesnt seem to be correct.
