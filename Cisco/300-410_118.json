This is likely because iBGP requires a full-mesh configuration by default, meaning that R4 doesnâ€™t have a direct iBGP session with R1, and so it isn't learning the route to 192.168.100.0/24.\n\nSolution:\nTo fix this without needing full-mesh peering, R1 can be configured as a route reflector server, and R2 and R3 can be configured as route reflector clients. This way, R1 can reflect the route learned from R5 to the other routers in AS 65510, including R4.\n\nThe correct answer is: A\n\nA.
