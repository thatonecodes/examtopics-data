This delay is a function of the default settings for the forward-delay and max-age settings. The max-age delay is 20 seconds by default, and is used to transition from the blocking to the listening state. The forward- delay setting is 15 seconds by default. This timer is used in the transition from the listening to learning states, and again for the transition from the learning to the forwarding state. These timers give STP time to gather the correct information about the network topology. While they can be modified to make convergence more efficient, the default settings work for most networks. To change the timers on all switches in the VTP domain, change the timer settings on the root bridge and the changes will be forwarded to the other switches.\nTo prevent switching loops, spanning tree transitions each port through several states whenever there is a change in the network topology. Each state is briefly defined as follows:\nBlocking: In the blocking state, a port does not forward frames, learn information, or send information. A forwarding port is placed in the blocked state when the port senses an absence of BPDUs, which are sent in the interval defined by the hello timer (two seconds by default). If the blocked port does not detect a BPDU for the length of time defined in the max-age setting (20 seconds by default), the port will transition into the listening state.\nListening: In the listening state, a port receives traffic but does not send information. This is the first transitional state after the blocking state. No user data is forwarded at this time, but the switch is very busy. It is during this stage that the switch participates in the election of the root bridge, the designation of root ports on the non-root bridges, and the selection of designated ports on each segment. Ports that are designated or root ports will transition to the learning state after the time defined in the forward delay (15 seconds by default) has elapsed.\nLearning: In the learning state, a switch port can add the MAC addresses that it has learned into its address table, but cannot forward user data. The switch port will remain in this state until the amount of time defined in the forward-delay setting has elapsed (15 seconds by default), at which time it will transition into the forwarding state.\nForwarding: In the forwarding state, a port is actively forwarding packets. It will remain in the forwarding state until it does not detect a BPDU within the defined hello time, at which time the port is placed in the blocking state and the process starts again.\nNOTE: One of the issues that can adversely affect the operation of STP is a duplex mismatch between the NICs on either end of a link between two switches.\nWhile this causes more of a performance problem than a loss of the link, the intermittent nature of the outage can cause one of the other links on the switch to transition into a forwarding state, as it may interpret this as a loss of connectivity. If one of the other links switches to forwarding and the link with the duplex mismatch comes back online (which could happen quickly), it can create a switching loop.\nObjective:\n\nLayer 2 Technologies -\nSub-Objective:\nConfigure and verify spanning tree\nReferences:\nCisco > Support > Technology Support > LAN Switching > Spanning Tree Protocol > Design > Design Technotes > Understanding and Tuning Spanning Tree\nProtocol Timers > Document ID: 19120\nCisco > Support > Technology Support > LAN Switching > Spanning Tree Protocol > Design > Design Technotes > Spanning Tree Protocol Problems and Related\nDesign Considerations > Document ID: 10566","answer":"Explanation","unix_timestamp":1574219940,"topic":"5","answer_images":[],"exam_id":297,"choices":{"B":"10 seconds","A":"2 seconds","D":"50 seconds","C":"25 seconds","E":"70 seconds D"},"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1574219940.0","comment_id":"22882","upvote_count":"1","content":"The answer is D/ 50 seconds","poster":"Bab500bab500"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"eX0dPLFz7SryEzGF5KX4","answer_images":[],"topic":"5","answer_ET":"Explanation","question_id":188,"question_text":"Which of the following commands configures a port with a VLAN?","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2019-11-20 04:24:00","answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"answer":"Explanation","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/8635-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-33-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1574220240,"answer_description":"The switchport access vlan command configures a port with a virtual local area network (VLAN). The syntax for the switchport access vlan command is as follows: switchport access vlan {vlan-id | dynamic}\nIf the vlan-id parameter is specified, then a static VLAN will be configured. If the dynamic keyword is specified, then dynamic VLAN assignment by a VLAN\nMembership Policy Server (VMPS) will occur. Static VLAN configuration is easy to configure, secure and works well in networks where moves, additions, and changes are rare. In environments where this not the case, dynamic VLANs may be preferable.\nThe vlan command is used to add VLANs to the VLAN database and to configure VLAN settings.\nThe vlan database command is issued to enter VLAN configuration mode. The following commands can be issued from VLAN configuration mode: abort - exits without applying changes apply - applies changes and bumps the revision number exit - applies changes, bumps the revision number and exits VLAN configuration mode no - negates a command reset - discards changes and rereads the VLAN database show - displays information vlan - configures the VLAN database vtp - configures VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) settings\nThe switchport mode access command disables trunking for a port.
