This is a common best practice to ensure that access ports do not participate in creating loops.Enabling \"spanning-tree loopguard default\" globally on a switch will activate the loop guard feature on all designated ports. Loop guard is used to prevent Layer 2 loops in spanning tree networks by detecting and responding to BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units) that are not received as expected.\n\nHowever, enabling \"spanning-tree loopguard default\" across all designated ports may not be the most appropriate action in all situations.

However, as long as it blocks the port on the STP level, loop guard blocks inconsistent ports on a per-VLAN basis (because of per-VLAN STP). That is, if BPDUs are not received on the trunk port for only one particular VLAN, only that VLAN is blocked (moved to loop-inconsistent STP state). For the same reason, if enabled on an EtherChannel interface, the entire channel is blocked for a particular VLAN, not just one link (because EtherChannel is regarded as one logical port from the STP point of view).\n\nOn which ports should the loop guard be enabled? The most obvious answer is on the blocking ports. However, this is not totally correct. Loop guard must be enabled on the non-designated ports (more precisely, on root and alternate ports) for all possible combinations of active topologies. As long as the loop guard is not a per-VLAN feature, the same (trunk) port might be designated for one VLAN and non-designated for the other.
