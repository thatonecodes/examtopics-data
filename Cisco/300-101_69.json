It is transport-agnostic with respect to transports that do not checksum the IP header, such as SCTP, and to transports that use the TCP/UDP/DCCP (Datagram\nCongestion Control Protocol) pseudo-header and checksum NPTv6 provides a simple and compelling solution to meet the address-independence requirement in\nIPv6. The address-independence benefit stems directly from the translation function of the network prefix translator. To avoid as many of the issues associated with NAPT44 as possible, NPTv6 is defined to include a two-way, checksum-neutral, algorithmic translation function, and nothing else.\nReference: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6296","unix_timestamp":1582233600,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14550-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-524-discussion/","answer":"D.
