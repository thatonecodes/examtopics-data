This API allows network administrators to automate network infrastructure tasks by expressing their intent through high-level policies rather than low-level device-specific configuration commands. The Cisco DNA Center Intent API uses RESTful APIs to provide a standardized interface for interacting with the network infrastructure. It allows network administrators to define their intent using JSON-based data models and use those models to provision, configure, and manage the network infrastructure.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Naderelmansi","comment_id":"849508","timestamp":"1695570300.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"841372","timestamp":"1694893260.0","poster":"loser4fun","content":"B. Intent\n\nIntent API is a type of API that allows developers to program the desired intent for the network rather than the specific configuration details. Intent API simplifies the process of network automation by abstracting the complexity of device-specific configurations and providing a more natural and intuitive way to interact with the network.\n\nCisco DNA Center uses Intent API to provide a simplified way to configure and manage network devices. With Intent API, administrators can specify the intent of the configuration, such as creating a new SSID or updating a QoS policy, and DNA Center takes care of the underlying device-specific configurations."},{"comment_id":"788484","upvote_count":"3","content":"B. intent\n\nCisco DNA Center uses Intent APIs to provision SSIDs, QoS policies, and update software versions on switches. Intent APIs allow the network administrator to define high-level policies, such as \"this SSID should have these characteristics\" or \"this switch should run this version of software,\" and the Cisco DNA Center platform automatically translates those policies into the necessary low-level configurations on the network devices. This simplifies the management of the network and allows for a more automated and consistent provisioning process.","poster":"sull3y","timestamp":"1690349700.0"}],"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1"},{"id":"vwzNS9NpjBl0Qee28BpO","answer_description":"","question_text":"A network engineer must create an access control list on a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance firewall.
