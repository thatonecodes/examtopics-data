The whole point of \"monitor mode\" is to see what ISE would allow and not allow. So you can continue to fine-tune your ISE policies. So in ISE, you would see a red deny in the Radius Live Logs, but the switch would not block any traffic for that device. The user or device would not be impacted at all! Then once you are comfortable that ISE is doing what it is supposed to, then you can remove the \"authentication open\" command from the switchports. Only then will the switch enforce what ISE says.","poster":"TiberiuszSun","comment_id":"1299972","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729330800.0"},{"comment_id":"1270026","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Korndal","timestamp":"1724237040.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nKeyword \"Command\" ......."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nsays command!","upvote_count":"1","poster":"factmrojas","comment_id":"1255910","timestamp":"1722030840.0"},{"timestamp":"1720087380.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1241959","poster":"ZoneHacker","content":"For me here it's the answer C.\nauthentication open"}],"question_id":180,"topic":"1","exam_id":315,"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/143268-exam-300-715-topic-1-question-276-discussion/","choices":{"D":"pae dot1x enabled","B":"authentication host-mode multi-auth","A":"monitor-mode enabled","C":"authentication open"}}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Cisco","isBeta":false,"name":"300-715","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":300,"id":315,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":36},"__N_SSP":true}
