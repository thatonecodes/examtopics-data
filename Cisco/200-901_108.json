The client is blocked or \"stuck\" until it receives a response from the server. This means that the client is unable to perform any other actions or processes until it receives the response.\n\nOn the other hand, an asynchronous API call is a request made by a client that does not wait for a response before moving on to the next task. The client is able to continue performing other actions or processes while it waits for a response from the server. This means that the client is able to handle multiple requests simultaneously, rather than having to wait for one request to be completed before moving on to the next.\n\nThe other options are not accurate. A synchronous or asynchronous API call may or may not require authentication, and there is no inherent difference in the offline capabilities or the number of calls that can be made in a specified time period between the two types of API calls.","poster":"mellohello","comment_id":"755656","timestamp":"1687691400.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"712462","timestamp":"1683382800.0","poster":"concepcionz","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSynchronous API calls are blocking calls that do not return until either the change has been completed or there has been an error\n\nAsynchronous the response to the API call is returned immediately with a polling URL while the request continues to be processed\n\n\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/docs/packaged-contact-center/#!synchronous-vs-asynchronous-writes/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-writes"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"SR_Cisco","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/docs/packaged-contact-center/#!synchronous-vs-asynchronous-writes/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-writes","timestamp":"1681187160.0","comment_id":"691721"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct\nNetacad 4.2.2\nBenefits of a synchronous API design\nSynchronous APIs enable the application to receive data immediately. If the API is designed correctly, the application will have better performance because everything happens quickly. However, if it is not designed correctly, the API request will be a bottleneck because the application has to wait for the response. \n\nWhen are APIs asynchronous?\nAPIs are usually designed to be asynchronous when the request is an action that takes some time for the server to process, or if the data is not readily available. For example, if the server has to make a request to a remote service to fetch the data, it cannot guarantee that it will receive the data immediately to send back to the client. Just because an API is asynchronous does not necessarily mean that the client will not get the data immediately. It only means that an immediate response with data is not guaranteed.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"659637","poster":"aplicacion101","timestamp":"1677982260.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI go for D because the others dont make sense","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1670471040.0","poster":"macxsz","comment_id":"613017"},{"comment_id":"577010","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","poster":"daloslav","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1664386620.0"},{"comment_id":"576994","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1664384280.0","content":"In the case of synchronous APIs, the expectation is that there will be an immediate return of data.
