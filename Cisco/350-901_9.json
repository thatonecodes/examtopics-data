For example, replacing the < character with &lt; or &#60; for the web content would disable all HTML tags. In Python, this can be done with the standard html.escape() and html.unescape() functions. Sometimes some HTML tags are acceptable, so escaping them all is not an option. In this case, sanitization is a suitable solution. Sanitization processes untrusted user input and runs it through the filter, which allows valid content but strips anything that is not permitted.
