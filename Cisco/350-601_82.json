Typical Linux methods and utilities like ifconfig and ethtool can be used to collect counters. When an interface is placed into a VRF in the NX-OS CLI, the Linux network interface is placed into a network namespace for that VRF. The name spaces can be seen at /var/run/netns and the ip netns utility can be used to run in the context of different namespaces. A couple of utilities, chvrf and vrfinfo , are provided as a convenience for running in a different namespace and getting information about which namespace/vrf a process is running in. \"","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1151269","timestamp":"1708028220.0","poster":"camelw"},{"timestamp":"1707649380.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI choose C","poster":"timeforexam","comment_id":"1147171"}],"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":326,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (80%)","C (20%)"],"timestamp":"2023-12-07 09:34:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"xNNjlEvANDQy8luIi0Me","answer":"D","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-02-13 23:23:00","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-601/image100.png"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"6","content":"Answer B: run guestshell\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Guest_Shell.html#concept_33803A70919D40C195E52C528695CE45","poster":"luisam","timestamp":"1707862980.0","comment_id":"1149638"},{"timestamp":"1723492020.0","comments":[{"poster":"Rollizo","comment_id":"1264792","upvote_count":"1","content":"NEXUS3100V# guestshell ?\n <CR> \n destroy Disable and uninstall the guest shell service package\n disable Disable the guest shell service package\n enable Enable the guest shell service\n reboot Deactivate and reactivate the guest shell service\n resize Resize the existing/default guest shell parameters\n run Execute/run program in the guest shell\n upgrade Upgrade the guest shell service package to a different version\n\nNEXUS3100V# run\nrun run-script \nNEXUS3100V# run guestshell ?\n <CR> \n LINE The command to execute","timestamp":"1723492080.0"}],"poster":"Rollizo","comment_id":"1264791","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt is D.
