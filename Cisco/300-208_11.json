Using MAC addresses as the unique identifier, ISE collects various attributes for each network endpoint to build an internal endpoint database. The classification process matches the collected attributes to prebuilt or user-defined conditions, which are then correlated to an extensive library of profiles. These profiles include a wide range of device types, including mobile clients (iPads, Android tablets, Blackberry phones, and so on), desktop operating systems (for example, Windows 7, Mac OS X, Linux, and others), and numerous nonuser systems such as printers, phones, cameras, and game consoles.\nOnce classified, endpoints can be authorized to the network and granted access based on their profile. For example, endpoints that match the IP phone profile can be placed into a voice VLAN using MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) as the authentication method. Another example is to provide differentiated network access to users based on the device used. For example, employees can get full access when accessing the network from their corporate workstation but be granted limited network access when accessing the network from their personal iPhone.","timestamp":"1552070220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"675","poster":"damova"}],"exam_id":300,"unix_timestamp":1552070220,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/540-exam-300-208-topic-1-question-45-discussion/","question_text":"Which three statements about the Cisco ISE profiler are true?
