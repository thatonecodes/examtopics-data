The range for the time is from 1 to 4294967295. \n• absolute time—Triggers an event when the specified absolute time of day occurs. \n• countdown time—Triggers an event when when the specified time counts down to zero. The timer does not reset. \n• cron cronentry—Triggers an event when the CRON string specification matches the current time. \n• watchdog time—Triggers an event when the specified time counts down to zero. The timer automatically resets to the initial value and continues to count down. \n\nIf you want to allow a triggered event to process any default actions, you must configure the EEM policy to allow the default action. For example, if you match a CLI command in a match statement, you must add the event-default action statement to the EEM policy or EEM will not allow the CLI command to execute.","timestamp":"1632351060.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"MaxG"},{"comment_id":"445905","upvote_count":"1","poster":"masal","content":"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/6-x/system_management/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide/sm_12eem.html\n\nif there is no action statement no action is taken an NO notificationsa ara generated. so answer is NOT A.","timestamp":"1631793000.0"},{"content":"A - is correct answer.\n\nswitch# show run | i event\nevent manager applet Backup-config\n event cli match \"copy running-config startup-config\"\n action 1 event-default\nswitch# \nswitch# copy run start\n[########################################] 100%\nCopy complete, now saving to disk (please wait)...\nCopy complete.\nswitch# conf t\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.
