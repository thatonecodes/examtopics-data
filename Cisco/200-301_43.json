For example, a site that occupies a single building might only require two layers while a larger campus of multiple buildings will most likely require three layers. In smaller networks, core and distribution layers are combined and the resulting architecture is called a collapsed core architecture.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"661063","poster":"Vlad_Is_Love_ua","timestamp":"1662458340.0"}],"choices":{"A":"Core and distribution","B":"access and WAN","D":"core and WAN","C":"distribution and access"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/80262-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-119-discussion/","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1662364680,"answer_images":[],"question_id":213,"question_images":[]},{"id":"wGt2LXyEsUz7DVOuMyjx","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nDrag and drop the characteristic from the left onto the IPv6 address type on the right.\n\n//IMG//","answer":"","timestamp":"2023-10-09 12:04:00","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image254.png"],"answer_description":"","exam_id":288,"isMC":false,"topic":"1","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image253.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/122963-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1190-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1712657040.0","content":"correct","comment_id":"1028726","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"7"},{"content":"given answers are correct","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1728408540.0","comment_id":"1191719","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_id":214,"unix_timestamp":1696845840},{"id":"RzspXeeENHwMXibeMKB6","timestamp":"2024-04-08 19:47:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1728409620.0","comment_id":"1191729"}],"question_images":[],"question_text":"What is a characteristic of private IPv4 addressing?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/138170-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1191-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"used when traffic on a subnet must traverse a site-to-site VPN to an outside organization","B":"supplies redundancy in the case of failure","C":"alleviates the shortage of IPv4 addresses","D":"reduces the forwarding table on network routers"},"exam_id":288,"answer_images":[],"question_id":215,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1712598420,"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"name":"200-301","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"id":288,"numberOfQuestions":1395,"provider":"Cisco","isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":43},"__N_SSP":true}
