However, this doesn’t imply that different versions of Cisco DNA Center can be implemented. Instead, it’s about how the single version of Cisco DNA Center that an organization has can be used in a flexible and scalable way.\n\nTherefore, while option A contains some elements of truth, it’s not the best answer to the question about what makes Cisco DNA Center different from traditional network management applications.","poster":"NewJeans","comment_id":"1039022","timestamp":"1712706000.0"},{"timestamp":"1690959840.0","content":"I guess A is not wrong but a fact that is possible in both management types, however, D is the real difference between these two designs.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"hamish88","comment_id":"795901"},{"upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"674232","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe primary characteristic and difference is still the separation of control and data plane:\n\nHow is the policy abstract or abstracted from the device configuration?\n\n-It is separated from the device configuration.

However, it does abstract (summarise) policy from the intent (from top) and not from the actual devices configuration. The abstracted policy is down enforced to actual devices (not vice versa).
