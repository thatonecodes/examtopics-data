This can make it easier to maintain and update the application, as changes to the interface of one device will not affect the data or interface of the other devices.","comment_id":"846110","poster":"Paola0699","timestamp":"1695301980.0","upvote_count":"7"},{"poster":"BorkedQuestions_1","comment_id":"1112214","timestamp":"1719943320.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C for sure.\n\nSee Paola's response is definitely why.","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1694239920.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"m4xr1s","comment_id":"833702","content":"Selected Answer: D\nshould be d"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\n\"MVC Framework is a good idea for a number of reasons, including: Simultaneous development â€“ Because MVC decouples the various components of an application, developers are able to work in parallel on different components without affecting or blocking one another.\"\n\nSource: https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-model-view-control-mvc/","comment_id":"811176","comments":[{"poster":"evilgoat","content":"yes, but to asynchronously update in this case does not refer to developing it in parallel.\nin the same sentence you quoted it talks about how various components of the application are decoupled from each other which for me makes it D:\n\nD. to have only one instance of the objects that contain the data: the questions says \"It must maintain the same data structure on both types of devices\", using MVD, you have one instance of the data that is rendered as needed on different devices","comment_id":"820227","timestamp":"1692856320.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"timestamp":"1692219240.0","poster":"Woonesuf"}],"choices":{"C":"to separate the logic of the graphic interface of the different devices","B":"to define different algorithms for data manipulation","A":"to asynchronously update the graphical interface","D":"to have only one instance of the objects that contain the data"},"topic":"1"},{"id":"bwQzS6eeF3iTCSgzy01C","isMC":false,"question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nDrag and drop the first four stages of a DevOps toolchain from the left into the order on the right to create a new complex product.
