This is your RPO. It's about the amount of data (or in this case, baked goods) you're willing to lose.\n* Example: If your RPO is 2 hours, you can afford to lose up to 2 hours worth of baked goods in case of a disaster.\n\nRTO (Recovery Time Objective):\n* How long can you be out of business before it's too costly? This is your RTO. It's about the amount of time it takes to get back up and running.\n* Example: If your RTO is 4 hours, you need to be able to reopen your bakery within 4 hours of a disaster.\n\nRelating to the options:\n* Options B and D directly relate to RTO because they focus on the time it takes to recover from a disaster (steps to recover and backup restoration time).\n* Option A is about the importance of systems, not the time to recover.\n* Option E is about the amount of data loss (RPO), not the time to recover (RTO).\n\nIn essence:\n* RPO is about data loss.\n* RTO is about time to recover.","timestamp":"1724091180.0","poster":"Doobiedoo","comment_id":"1268880","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1737479220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1344243","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nCorrect answer is A & B. \nBackup-related is RPO...","poster":"kalulosu"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nAnswer is CD:\n\nWhen determining the Recovery Time Objective (RTO), several important factors should be considered:\n\nCost of Downtime:\n\nCalculate the financial implications of service interruptions.
