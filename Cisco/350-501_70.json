In the old times, the internet was in the global routing table (not vrf) and the border routers were advertising only a default route via IGP to the rest of the network. Customer subnets (like a.b.c.d/30) were automatically redistributed into the IGP by the PE routers, so they are known by the other PEs and border routers. iBGP address-family ipv4 between border routers and PE routers was not used, so the IGP was involved for distributing the default route and customer subnets.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rans3001"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1237930","timestamp":"1719470880.0","poster":"rans3001","content":"When separating Internet access and MPLS L3 VPN services into different routing instances, there is no protocol separation, they use the same protocol (BGP family vpnv4/vpnv6).","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"Bambuker","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727686680.0","comment_id":"957033","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOne of the main reasons for implementing this model is to enable EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol) and IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) to operate independently. EGP is used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems (AS), while IGP is used to exchange routing information within an AS. By separating Internet access and MPLS L3 VPN services into different routing instances, it is possible to use different routing protocols for each service. This can help to optimize network performance and reduce the risk of routing conflicts and instability.\nAnother reason for implementing a full separation model is that it allows the network operator to choose whether to separate or centralize each individual service. This means that services can be deployed in a way that best suits the needs of the organization, rather than being constrained by the limitations of a single routing instance. For example, the Internet access service may be centralized for better security, while the MPLS L3 VPN service may be separated for better performance."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"rans3001","comment_id":"1237921","timestamp":"1719470220.0","content":"Let me correct my previous post.\nWe can avoid the propagation of customer subnets and default route via IGP, by enabling iBGP family ipv4/6, so putting the internet in vrf is not the only option.
