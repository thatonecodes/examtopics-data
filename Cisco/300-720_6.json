The list of authorized sending hosts for a domain is published in the Domain Name System (DNS) records for that domain in the form of a specially formatted TXT record. Email spam and phishing often use forged sender addresses, so publishing and checking SPF records can be considered anti-spam techniques.\nttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/email-security-appliance/117973-faq-esa-00.html"},{"comment_id":"944160","poster":"GVKD","timestamp":"1720220520.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA and E are correct.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"GVKD","comment_id":"943218","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nGoing with A and B are Correct.\n\nConfiguring DomainKeys and DKIM Signing:\n-Signing Keys\n-Public Keys\n-Domain Profiles\n\nCreating Domain Profiles:\nStep 1\n-Choose Mail Policies > Signing Profiles.\nStep 2\n-In the Domain Signing Profiles section, click Add Profile.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa14-0/user_guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_14-0/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_1_chapter_010110.html?bookSearch=true","timestamp":"1720140600.0"},{"comment_id":"935461","upvote_count":"2","content":"A.
