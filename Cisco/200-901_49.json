They execute scheduled tasks regularly: This statement is not accurate. Ansible playbooks are not designed to execute tasks regularly on a schedule like a task scheduler or cron job.

The purpose of running the tests before writing code is to demonstrate that the tests fail for expected reasons. This is because the tests are written to test the functionality that the developer is about to add to the codebase, and since that functionality does not yet exist, the tests should fail. This is an important step in the TDD process because it confirms that the tests are correctly identifying the missing functionality and that they are not passing due to an error in the tests themselves.","poster":"r0m"},{"poster":"nicovl","comment_id":"873879","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDefinitely answer B","timestamp":"1729269660.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nI agree with B.
