Fast Roam\n\nFast Roaming is a technique used to facilitate seamless and quick roaming of wireless clients between different access points without significant interruption. When a user roams from one AP to another on a different access switch but within the same mobility domain controlled by a single WLC, fast roaming mechanisms like Cisco's Fast Secure Roaming (FSR) or 802.11r (Fast BSS Transition) can be utilized to ensure minimal disruption during the handoff process. These methods help maintain connectivity and security while the client moves between APs."},{"poster":"Eng_H","content":"The answer is D. Fast Roam.\n\nIn a wireless Cisco SD-Access deployment, Fast Roam is the preferred method for seamless roaming between access points on the same fabric. It uses a pre-authentication and pre-association process to allow the client device to establish a connection to the new access point before it physically moves to the new location. This minimizes the amount of time the client device is disconnected from the network.\n\nInter-xTR roaming is used in a Cisco SD-Access deployment where the user is moving between different virtual networks. Auto anchor roaming is used in a multi-WLC deployment where the user is moving between different physical locations.\n\nLayer 3 roaming is not used in a wireless Cisco SD-Access deployment. It is a method of roaming that uses Layer 3 routing to move a client device from one access point to another. However, in a Cisco SD-Access deployment, all access points are part of the same fabric and are interconnected using Layer 2.
