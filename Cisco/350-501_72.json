The FRR mechanism allows data to continue to flow while the headend router attempts to establish a new end-to-end LSP that bypasses the failure. FRR locally repairs any protected LSPs by rerouting them over backup tunnels that bypass failed links or nodes.\n\nThe headend is notified of the failure through the IGP and through RSVP. The headend then attempts to establish a new LSP that bypasses the failure (LSP rerouting).\n\nThe important fact to remember is that when using fast reroute, the protection kicks in as soon as the protected interface fails, which in turn forces the head end to recalculate a new path for the dynamic Cisco MPLS TE tunnel. In that brief period of time, between when the head-end of tunnel 1 realizes that the path is invalid and when the new path is calculated, the fast reroute happens via a predefined tunnel.
