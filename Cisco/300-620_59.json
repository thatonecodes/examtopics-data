With this solution, called Multi-Pod Spines Back-to-Back, the IPN requirement can be removed for small ACI Multi-Pod deployments. Multi-Pod Spines Back-to-Back also brings operational simplification and end-to-end fabric visibility, as there are no external devices to configure.

A privilege is an MO that enables or restricts access to a particular function within the system. For example, fabric-equipment is a privilege bit. This bit is set by the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) on all objects that correspond to equipment in the physical fabric. \nA role is a collection of privilege bits.

For example, the default tenant “common” has a domain tag common. Similarly, the special domain tag all includes the entire MIT object tree. An administrator can assign custom domain tags to the MIT object hierarchy. For example, an administrator could assign the “solar” domain tag to the tenant named solar.
