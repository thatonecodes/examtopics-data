As long as one link in the fabric port channel remains active, the fabric port channel continues to operate.\n\nIf the correct hardware is connected, fabric port channels are created by Cisco UCS Manager in the following ways:\n\nDuring chassis discovery according to the settings configured in the chassis discovery policy.\n\nAfter chassis discovery according to the settings configured in the chassis connectivity policy for a specific chassis.\n\nFor each IOM there is a single fabric port channel. Each uplink connecting an IOM to a fabric interconnect can be configured as a discrete link or included in the port channel, but an uplink cannot belong to more than one fabric port channel. For example, if a chassis with two IOMs is discovered and the chassis discovery policy is configured to create fabric port channels, Cisco UCS Manager creates two separate fabric port channels: one for the uplinks connecting IOM-1 and another for the uplinks connecting IOM-2.","comment_id":"943539","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03257/0001700001.png"],"timestamp":"2023-07-05 11:36:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nA Cisco UCS chassis that has two IOMs is discovered.
