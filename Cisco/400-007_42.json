It can detect link failures, including unidirectional issues, quickly and trigger a convergence process. By enabling BFD on the fiber Ethernet connectivity between the switches, any unidirectional issues or link failures can be detected and acted upon promptly, leading to faster convergence in the network.\n\nUDLD (UniDirectional Link Detection) is another protocol that helps detect unidirectional links, but it may not provide as fast convergence as BFD. Additionally, fiber Ethernet connectivity is typically more reliable than copper Ethernet connectivity, making it a preferred choice for data center environments."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nFiber uses light waves which is faster than electron flow and they refer to Layer 3 which UDLD is L2\nhttps://www.quora.com/Is-the-speed-of-electron-equal-to-the-speed-of-light","upvote_count":"1","poster":"bdp123","comment_id":"894197","timestamp":"1715360640.0"},{"content":"UDLD is faster and works on L3 links.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Dvnn","comment_id":"827609","timestamp":"1709433600.0"},{"timestamp":"1707149940.0","comment_id":"798979","content":"Shouldn't this be A as it is the same rcak, so directly connected?\nFiber Ethernet connectivity with UDLD enabled","comments":[{"content":"UDLD is for L2, the question is about routed links.

It works by monitoring the receipt of BPDUs on non-designated ports. If a designated port stops receiving BPDUs, it assumes that there is a unidirectional link failure and puts the port into a loop-inconsistent state, blocking the port to prevent potential loops.\n\nBy enabling loop guard in addition to UDLD, you can further enhance the resilience of the network against STP-related failures. UDLD helps detect unidirectional link failures, while loop guard helps prevent loops in situations where BPDUs are not being received.","comment_id":"914094"},{"timestamp":"1714277640.0","comment_id":"706098","poster":"kitai","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI gree"}],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1666930440,"exam_id":331,"timestamp":"2022-10-28 06:14:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","question_text":"You want to mitigate failures that are caused by STP loops that occur before UDLD detects the failure or that are caused by a device that is no longer sending\nBPDUs.
