The ip http secure-server command is used to configure the switch to use HTTPS instead of HTTP for authentication. This is not necessary in this case because the switch is not being used to store any sensitive data. The ip http secure-authentication command is used to configure the switch to use a secure authentication method, such as TLS, for authentication. This is also not necessary in this case because the switch is not being used to store any sensitive data.","poster":"denverfly","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"917888","timestamp":"1717827720.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"954285","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721226600.0","content":"So you meant it's D and B?","poster":"Leogxn"}]},{"comment_id":"917886","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nThe two commands that must be entered to meet this requirement are ip http authentication and ip http redirection.\n\nThe ip http authentication command is used to enable HTTP authentication on the switch.

However, the AAA load is split between the two Cisco ISE nodes to optimize the AAA workflow. Each Cisco ISE appliance (primary or secondary) needs to be able to handle the full workload if there are any problems with AAA connectivity. Neither the primary node nor the secondary nodes handles all AAA requests during normal network operations because this workload is distributed between the two nodes.\n\nThe ability to split the load in this way directly reduces the stress on each Cisco ISE node in the system. In addition, splitting the load provides better loading while the functional status of the secondary node is maintained during the course of normal network operations.\n\nIn split Cisco ISE deployments, each node can perform its own specific operations, such as network admission or device administration, and still perform all the AAA functions in the event of a failure. If you have two Cisco ISE nodes that process authentication requests and collect accounting data from AAA clients, we recommend that you set up one of the Cisco ISE nodes to act as a log collector","comment_id":"335516","poster":"MrCalifornia","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1634219640.0"},{"poster":"Pipi","comment_id":"320274","timestamp":"1632573480.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct answer is C"},{"timestamp":"1627939560.0","poster":"Natcat","content":"C is correct.\nSplit Deployments\n\nIn split Cisco ISE deployments, you continue to maintain primary and secondary nodes as described in a small Cisco ISE deployment.

To resolve this issue, the network administrator must add a new certificate from the CA server, revoke the expired certificate, and add the new certificate in system.\n\nHere are the steps involved in resolving this issue:\n\n Log in to the CA server and generate a new certificate.\n Revoke the expired certificate.\n Install the new certificate on the users' laptops.\n\nOnce the new certificate has been installed on the users' laptops, they should be able to connect to the network.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"denverfly","comment_id":"917893"},{"poster":"Vlad_Is_Love_ua","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt is B","timestamp":"1714478880.0","comment_id":"885178"},{"timestamp":"1707879060.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOnly Answer that makes sense is B.

It is recommended to configure a specific rule in the Authorization Policy using the reusable condition CertRenewalRequired in order to control the overall authorization response to the NAD.
