We use\nISP DEF as a backup so its metric value should be set to a higher value than 20.\nThere are two types of external routes: external type 1 and external type 2. The difference between the two is in the way the cost (metric) of the route is being calculated:\n+ The cost of a type 2 route is always the external cost, irrespective of the interior cost to reach that route.\n+ Type 1 cost is the addition of the external cost and the internal cost used to reach that route.\n-> We should configure the type 2 external route to make sure the ISP ABC is always referred over ISP DEF because internal routing does not determine the path.\nNote: E2 is the default external metric, but E1 is preferred over E2 if two equal-cost paths exist.","answers_community":[],"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nA company would prefer all Internet-bound OSPF routed traffic to use ISP ABC with ISP DEF as a backup.
