The CSS on the Voice Mail Pilot should include partitions containing user phones and also the partition you set up for the voice mail pilot number. Here we can see the voice mail pilot is using the Null CSS which means the voice mail pilot can only reach numbers that are in the Null partition, ie directory numbers that have not been assigned a partition. Clearly the Hunt Pilot number (which is used for presenting the call to Unity Cnx ) is assoaited with a partition, ie INTERNAL_PT. So, in the above config the voice mail pilot would never be able to reach the Hunt Pilot number unless you gave the voice mail pilot a CSS that contained the INTERNAL_PT partition.
