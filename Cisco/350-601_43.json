If the port is receiving BPDUs, the loop guard feature puts the port into an inconsistent state until it starts receiving BPDUs again.\n\nRootguard:- It is enabled on the designated ports of root switch, so that if those ports listen to the superior BPDU then put that port in inconsistent state.\n\nBPDU Guard:-BPDUGuard enables on access port which helps the switches to put the port in shut down mode once it receives the superior BPDU.\n\nBPDU filtering - allows you to avoid transmitting BPDUs on PortFast-enabled ports that are connected to an end system.By default, spanning tree sends BPDUs from all ports regardless of whether PortFast is enabled. BDPU filtering is on a per-switch basis; after you enable BPDU filtering, it applies to all PortFast-enabled ports on the switch.","comment_id":"658636","timestamp":"1725379020.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"The correct answer is A:\nA) spanning-tree bpduguard enable = cannot receive BPDU\nB) spanning-tree guard loop = does not exist \nC) spanning-tree loopguard default = ensure BPDU being receiving \nD) spanning-tree bpdufilter enable = do not receive and send BPDU (the easy way to disable STP into a interface)\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/6-x/layer2/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Layer_2_Switching_Configuration_Guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Layer_2_Switching_Configuration_Guide_chapter_01000.html","timestamp":"1701267600.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"designated","comment_id":"489956"}]},{"id":"n8PmbtxjShSwhDQrRyWq","answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2022-09-27 22:37:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/83822-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-290-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730902620.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"A is correct.
