This can be done by installing the Microsoft Active Directory Connector (AD Connector) and configuring it to synchronize the organization's Active Directory with Cisco Umbrella.\n\nThe AD Connector will synchronize the organization's Active Directory with Cisco Umbrella, which will allow Cisco Umbrella to see the internal IP address of the device.
