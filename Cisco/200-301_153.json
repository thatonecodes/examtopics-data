Im concerned about this answer coz in my knowledge it does not need to be UP/UP. It just have to exist.","comments":[{"content":"For OSPF to use an interface to determine the router ID, the interface does not have to be in the UP/UP state. It can be in a DOWN/DOWN state. The router ID is selected based on the highest IP address of any of the router's active interfaces (including loopback interfaces) at the time of OSPF process startup. If no loopback interfaces are configured, OSPF will use the highest IP address on any physical interface, even if that interface is currently down. \n\nScrew you CCNA :)","upvote_count":"1","poster":"TmNvrWts","comment_id":"1233781","timestamp":"1718900100.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"TmNvrWts","comment_id":"1233774","timestamp":"1718899800.0"},{"comment_id":"696158","timestamp":"1665914340.0","content":"actually correct answer is poorly worded. interface could be in state UP/DOWN and still be eligible for being router ID.","poster":"ccna_goat","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1652175540.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"599496","poster":"Nnandes","content":"D: is the correct one \"The highest up/up physical interface IP address is selected as the router ID.\""}],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1636681320,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/65864-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-430-discussion/","question_id":765,"choices":{"B":"The router ID 0.0.0.0 is selected and placed in the OSPF process.","A":"The lowest IP address is incremented by 1 and selected as the router ID.","D":"The highest up/up physical interface IP address is selected as the router ID.","C":"No router ID is set, and the OSPF protocol does not run."},"question_text":"What is the effect when loopback interfaces and the configured router ID are absent during the OSPF Process configuration?","question_images":[],"exam_id":288}],"exam":{"provider":"Cisco","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"name":"200-301","numberOfQuestions":1395,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":288},"currentPage":153},"__N_SSP":true}
