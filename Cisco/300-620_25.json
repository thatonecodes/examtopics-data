All devices will need static OOB addresses (APIC controllers, leafs, and spines) that associate the IP address, NodeID, default GW, and management type (OOB, in this case).\n2. You'll need to configure a contract that will be consumed and provided to your OOB devices. The contract will allow the system to know what traffic is allowed. (In this use case, you will use the default/common contract to permit any traffic.)\n\nStep 1 – Providing the contract Tenant > Tenant mgmt > Node Management EPGs > Out-of-Band EPG default \n\nUnder the “Provided Out-of-Band Contracts” in the policy window, provide the appropriate contract. (This could be a the default/common contract or a specific contract you have created and modified). Click Submit.\n\nStep 2 – Consuming the contract Tenant > Tenant mgmt > External Management Network Instance Profiles > YourInstanceProfile \n\nConsume the same contract that you provided in the previous step. \nEnter the subnets that are allowed to have access to the APIC.

Cisco ACI data-plane endpoint learning detects these events quickly and updates the Cisco ACI endpoint database on a new leaf. In addition to data-plane learning, Cisco ACI uses bounce entries to manage the old endpoint information on the original leaf.\n\nThe difference between a bounce entry and a remote endpoint is in whether or not the leaf rewrites the outer source IP address of the packet. When a packet uses a normal remote endpoint, the Cisco ACI leaf uses its own TEP address as the outer source IP address, so the remote leaf learns this packet with its own TEP. When a packet uses a bounce entry, the Cisco ACI leaf doesn’t rewrite the outer source IP address, so the remote data-plane learning will behave as if the packet came from the originating leaf rather than the intermediate “bounce” leaf.","poster":"thinqtanklearningDOTcom"},{"poster":"imanus","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think C is right \nThe difference between a bounce entry and a remote endpoint is in whether or not the leaf rewrites the outer source IP address of the packet.
