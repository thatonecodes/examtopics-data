An out-of-band management interface is defined by the network operator to specifically receive network management traffic. The advantage isthat forwarding (or customer) traffic cannot interfere with the management of the router, which significantly reduces the possibility of denial-of-service attacks.\nOut-of-band interfaces forward traffic only between out-of-band interfaces or terminate management packets that are destined to the router. In addition, the out-of- band interfaces can participate in dynamic routing protocols. The service provider connects to the routers out-of-band interfaces and builds an independent overlay management network, with all the routing and policy tools that the router can provide.\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k_r4-0/security/configuration/guide/b_sc40asr9kbook/ b_sc40asr9kbook_chapter_0101.pdf","answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-10-28 00:46:00","question_id":14,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/86536-exam-210-260-topic-1-question-2-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1666910760,"exam_id":294,"topic":"1","isMC":true},{"id":"hzNsXdNOSNKvk08Z97LA","exam_id":294,"topic":"1","answer":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"faithy","content":"correct answer should be D","timestamp":"1581882840.0","comment_id":"51353"}],"answers_community":[],"choices":{"C":"securing data in files","B":"securing wireless transmissions","D":"securing real-time traffic","A":"securing data at rest"},"question_id":15,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Referencing the CIA model, in which scenario is a hash-only function most appropriate?","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14277-exam-210-260-topic-1-question-202-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1581882840,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-02-16 20:54:00"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":134,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":294,"name":"210-260","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Cisco","isBeta":false},"currentPage":3},"__N_SSP":true}
