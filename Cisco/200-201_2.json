Imagine a security incident has occurred on a system and you are required to perform some forensic investigation to determine who and what caused the attack. Additionally, you want to ensure the data that was captured is not tampered with or modified during the creation of a disk image process.\nRef: Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate 200-201 Certification Guide\nBy Glen D.
