In the event of a failure, the standby router assumes the role of the active router and begins forwarding traffic. This process is transparent to the network, and there is no interruption in service.\n\nSpecifically, when SSO is enabled with HSRP, the standby router maintains a synchronized copy of the active router's HSRP state information, including the virtual IP address and MAC address. If the active router fails, the standby router can immediately take over as the active HSRP router and continue forwarding traffic using the same virtual IP and MAC addresses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
