Comprehensive initial designs support robust systems.\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) is a methodology that involves managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.\n\nOne of the key principles of IaC is that comprehensive initial designs support robust systems. This means that IaC should include a well-designed architecture and a comprehensive set of templates and scripts to ensure consistency, repeatability, and predictability in system deployment and maintenance.
