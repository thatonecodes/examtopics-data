The ID (Identification) field is a 16-bit field that identifies the DNS query and is used to match responses with queries. The Z (Reserved for future use) field is a 3-bit field that is currently unused and must be set to 0. The TC (Truncated) field is a 1-bit field that indicates whether a message was truncated due to size limitations.","comment_id":"817347"},{"poster":"Eng_ahmedyoussef","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. is the correct answer \nQR ==> Flag indicating query(0) or response(1).\nID ==> is a 16-bit identifier assigned by the program.

In this case, the receptionist connected an external USB device to bypass security restrictions and steal data, which resulted in the breach.
