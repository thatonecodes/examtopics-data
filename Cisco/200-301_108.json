LAPs use the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) to communicate with a WLAN controller (WLC), as shown in the below figure. Controller-based APs are useful in situations where many APs are required in the network. As more APs are added, each AP is automatically configured and managed by the WLC.","timestamp":"1626730440.0","poster":"Aqil","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"271627"},{"timestamp":"1625678700.0","comment_id":"262095","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Techno_Head","content":"I think there all wrong, but C if pushed"},{"comment_id":"260759","poster":"Cristy","upvote_count":"3","content":"I think C is the right answer","timestamp":"1625539380.0"}],"topic":"1","question_id":538,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"monitor activity on wireless and wired LANs","A":"register with a single access point that controls traffic between wired and wireless endpoints","C":"send LWAPP packets to access points","B":"use SSIDs to distinguish between wireless clients"},"answer":"C","answer_description":"","question_text":"What is a function of Wireless LAN Controller?","timestamp":"2021-01-04 14:56:00","isMC":true,"exam_id":288,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/41484-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-225-discussion/","answer_images":[]},{"id":"Bf59VRwqyEilfrLuqvLp","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/45737-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-226-discussion/","question_images":[],"exam_id":288,"topic":"1","question_id":539,"timestamp":"2021-03-01 08:07:00","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1614582420,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which technology is used to improve web traffic performance by proxy caching?","choices":{"B":"Firepower","A":"WSA","C":"ASA","D":"FireSIGHT"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"42","poster":"mrsiafu","content":"Yeah.. but what cert guide would have gave this type of info for a question like this!","comment_id":"341786","timestamp":"1635035220.0"},{"timestamp":"1694244240.0","upvote_count":"37","comment_id":"833766","content":"dafuq is this sh!t?","comments":[{"timestamp":"1740430320.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1361182","poster":"dhewa","content":"Web Security Appliance"}],"poster":"soRwatches"},{"poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","comment_id":"1196682","timestamp":"1729095120.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWeb security application","comment_id":"954532","timestamp":"1705523640.0","poster":"Da_Costa"},{"poster":"ZUMY","timestamp":"1670692860.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"A is correct","comment_id":"614613"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the correct answer","timestamp":"1669381620.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"607181","poster":"Cyberops"},{"timestamp":"1667737860.0","poster":"ScorpionNet","comment_id":"597680","upvote_count":"2","content":"A is correct because WSAs are used to detect any sites that seems fishy"},{"poster":"ian77ex","upvote_count":"32","timestamp":"1660913040.0","content":"This is out of scope.","comment_id":"550988"},{"content":"Seems to be correct.

This is becoming less important as the percentage of HTTPS traffic increases because the WSA does not by default cache HTTPS transactions. If the proxy is deployed to serve only explicit clients, forward mode should be specified in order to reject any traffic that isn’t specifically destined for the proxy service.
