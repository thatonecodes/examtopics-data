The main advantage of MSDP is that it reduces the complexity of interconnecting multiple PIM-SM domains by allowing PIM-SM domains to use an interdomain source tree (rather than an common shared tree). When MSDP is configured in a network, RPs exchange source information with RPs in other domains. An RP can join the interdomain source tree for sources that are sending to groups for which it has receivers. The RP can do that because it is the root of the shared tree within its domain, which has branches to all points in the domain where there are active receivers. When a last-hop router learns of a new source outside the PIM-SM domain (through the arrival of a multicast packet from the source down the shared tree), it then can send a join toward the source and join the interdomain source tree.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_4t/ip_mcast/configuration/guide/mctmsdp.html","timestamp":"1687879680.0"},{"content":"I'm struggling with this because you can't run MSDP between domains without BGP so C is completely valid.
