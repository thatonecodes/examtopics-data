Identify the blocked traffic in the Cisco FMC connection events to validate the block, and modify the policy to allow the traffic to the web server.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue and restore access without sacrificing the organization's security posture, the administrator should use the Cisco FMC connection events to identify the traffic that is being blocked and validate the block. Once the traffic has been identified, the access control policy can be modified to allow the traffic to the cloud-hosted web server. Creating a new access control policy rule or allowing all traffic to the web server could potentially introduce security risks, so it is important to only allow the necessary traffic and ensure that the policy aligns with the organization's security requirements. Using the packet capture tool or flexconfig objects could be used to troubleshoot the issue but would likely be more time-consuming and complex than using the connection events dashboard.","comment_id":"837107","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"B. Identify the blocked traffic in the Cisco FMC connection events to validate the block, and modify the policy to allow the traffic to the web server.\n\nSince the issue occurred after a recent update to the access control policy, it is likely that one or more of the new policy additions or URL filtering rules is causing the block. The first step in troubleshooting the issue is to identify the blocked traffic and validate the block. This can be done by checking the Cisco FMC connection events to see which traffic is being blocked and why. Once the issue is identified, the policy can be modified to allow the required traffic to the web server, without sacrificing the organization's security posture. Creating a new access control policy rule to allow ports 80 and 443 to the FQDN of the web server (A) could be a temporary solution but it may not address the root cause of the issue and may introduce security risks. Using the action monitor for the traffic (C) may not resolve the issue since the traffic is already being blocked. Using flexconfig objects to create a rule that allows only the required traffic (D) may be a more complex and time-consuming solution.","timestamp":"1726126920.0","poster":"tanri04","comment_id":"836862","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"834880","content":"Selected Answer: B\nidentifying the blocked traffic in the Cisco FMC connection events to validate the block, and modifying the policy to allow the traffic to the web server is a valid troubleshooting step to restore access without sacrificing the organization's security posture.","poster":"Joe_Blue","timestamp":"1725959640.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"DID123","comment_id":"809028","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think B is the correct answer","timestamp":"1723683060.0"},{"timestamp":"1723457520.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSo since this is a cisco cert, I dont think cisco want you to externally examine pcap files, which is why I wouldnt use A\nC and D are to unspecific, packet capture does not get URL-filtering iirc and allowing all traffic surely isnt the way either.\nThis is why I go with B","comment_id":"806302","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Baumb"}]},{"id":"VpYtsJyVhbJdQ3mfftHQ","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Filter the connection events by the destination port 8699/udp.","B":"Filter the connection events by the source port 8699/udp.","D":"Use the context explorer to see the destination port blocks.","A":"Use the context explorer to see the application blocks by protocol."},"unix_timestamp":1676204400,"exam_id":314,"timestamp":"2023-02-12 13:20:00","topic":"1","question_id":83,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"Joe_Blue","comment_id":"837110","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe engineer should filter the connection events by the destination port 8699/udp to identify the devices that have been trying to connect to it over the last week.
