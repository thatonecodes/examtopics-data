The command enables the suppression of routing updates over some interfaces while it allows updates to be exchanged normally over other interfaces. With most routing protocols, the passive-interface command restricts outgoing advertisements only. However, when used with Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), the effect is slightly different. With EIGRP running on a network, the passive- interface command stops both outgoing and incoming routing updates, since the effect of the command causes the router to stop sending and receiving hello packets over an interface.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093f0a.shtml","choices":{"D":"Both outgoing and incoming routing updates on R1 will be permitted because the distribute-list 20 out Serial0/0 command cannot be used with association with","A":"All outgoing routing updates from router R1 to router R2 will be suppressed, but the inbound updates will continue to be received.","C":"Both outgoing and incoming routing updates on R1 will be stopped because of the passive- interface Serial0/0 configuration statement.","B":"All incoming routing updates from R2 will be suppressed, but the outgoing updates will continue to be sent."},"exam_id":296,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"50657","content":"C.
