This allows the router or gateway to match SIP requests based on the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provided in the SIP message, making it an important criterion for incoming call handling. Other options like target carrier-id, answer-address, and incoming called-number are valid but generally used after the URI matching.","timestamp":"1728481740.0","poster":"b3532e4"},{"comment_id":"1117880","timestamp":"1704837960.0","content":"A is correct\nInbound SIP Dial-Peer Selection Preference:\n1 URI incoming uri via <uri-tag> \n2 URI incoming uri request <uri-tag>\n3 URI incoming uri to <uri-tag>\n4 URI incoming uri from <uri-tag>\n5 Called Number incoming called-number <number-string> / incoming called e164-pattern-map <pattern-map-number>\n6 Calling Number incoming calling e164-pattern-map <pattern-map-number> / answer-address <number-string>\n7 Destination-pattern (ANI) destination-pattern <number-string>\n8 Carrier-ID carrier-id source <string>","poster":"FrankPic","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer":"A","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"question_id":181,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/130732-exam-300-815-topic-1-question-9-discussion/"},{"id":"mHqZ1v2UN3FPiBidIy7e","topic":"1","question_id":182,"exam_id":320,"timestamp":"2023-08-17 20:54:00","answer":"D","choices":{"D":"Add a local route group on the device pool configuration.","B":"Add a sip trunk inside route group Standard Local Route Group.","C":"Modify the route pattern to add a prefix of 91.","A":"Change the partition of the route pattern."},"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/118362-exam-300-815-topic-1-question-90-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1719695700.0","poster":"john_doe_9999","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1110125"},{"poster":"FCBear","content":"Correct answer is D - add the sip trunk under the local router group in the device pool configuration page. \nB is wring - you can' add anything inside Standard local router group, this is only a placeholder for the local route group configuration on the device pool for each location","comment_id":"1068031","timestamp":"1715446560.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"983933","poster":"MaxG","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1708203240.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think it's D.
