Encryption is a two-way function where data is passed in as plaintext and comes out as ciphertext, which is unreadable. Since encryption is two-way, the data can be decrypted so it is readable again. Hashing, on the other hand, is one-way, meaning the plaintext is scrambled into a unique digest, through the use of a salt, that cannot be decrypted. Technically, hashing can be reversed, but the computational power needed to decrypt it makes decryption infeasible.","poster":"robi1020"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/113921-exam-300-410-topic-1-question-221-discussion/"},{"id":"m3GRSk6uxRAwG1wMjTYB","timestamp":"2023-02-01 14:49:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/97553-exam-300-410-topic-1-question-222-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"poster":"GodFather","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"795192","content":"When split horizon is enabled, any route learned from an interface is not advertised back out the same interface.
