So, calculate like this:\n2 IPs for Network ID and broadcast IP for whatever subnet we use.\n2 IPs for connected interfaces on each router i.e. 1 for R1 gi0/0/0 and 1 for R2 gi0/0/0.\n2 IPs reserved for future use.\nIn this way, we need atleast 6 IPs here and the subnet that can provide a closest value in terms of total required IPs is /29 (255.255.255.248). The /29 subnet provides a total of 8 IPs addresses per subnet and out of that 6 are host usable IPs.\nSo, for given subnet 10.10.10.X/29 we can have IP range from 10.10.10.0 - 10.10.10.7. Where 10.10.10.0 will be network ID and 10.10.10.7 will be broadcast IP.

A 30-bit subnet mask allows for four IPv4 addresses: two host addresses, one all-zeros network, and one all-ones broadcast address. A point-to-point link can only have two host addresses. There is no real need to have the broadcast and all-zeros addresses with point-to-point links. Even A 31-bit subnet mask allows for exactly two host addresses, and eliminates the broadcast and all-zeros addresses, thus it conserves the use of IP addresses to the minimum for point-to-point links.","comment_id":"832084","poster":"mhayek"},{"timestamp":"1694010120.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","poster":"bisiyemo1","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"830989"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1693915380.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\n2 additional!!","poster":"JJY888","comment_id":"829953"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nDefinitely \"C\" is the correct answer","poster":"Rynurr","comment_id":"813520","timestamp":"1692386940.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"j1mlawton","timestamp":"1691912760.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIs it not .248? .252 would not leave any free ip addresses","comment_id":"807250"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"807150","content":"C is correct","timestamp":"1691905200.0","poster":"gewe"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99033-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-904-discussion/","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"exam_id":288,"answer_description":"","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
