Instead of small channels and a jumping sequence, the information is sent over a wider channel. This channel is 22 MHz wide (if the center frequency is\n2.412, this channel spans from 2.401 GHz to 2.423 GHz) and does not move (no hopping, which is why the sequence is said to be direct instead of hopping).\nThen, over this 22 MHz channel, several bits of information are sent in parallel. If a source of interference affects part of the channel, it will prevent only the bits sent in that frequency from reaching the receiver.","exam_id":290,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"ACDG"},{"id":"71kHDxwvNPUzauUcRudh","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/5831-exam-200-355-topic-1-question-36-discussion/","exam_id":290,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"KZYL","comment_id":"41658","timestamp":"1579708380.0","content":"They would like to leverage 802.11ac enhanced speeds on the trusted employee WLAN, just open","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"mueller","content":"A is wrong, because WPA2 with TKIP does not exist.
