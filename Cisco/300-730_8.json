Site A has internal subnet 192.168.0.0/24 and Site B has internal subnet 10.0.0.0/24. The engineer notices that no packets are decrypted at Site B. Pings to 192.168.0.1 from internal Site B devices make it to the Site B router, and the Site A router has incrementing encrypt and decrypt counters. What must be done to ensure bidirectional communication between both sites?","exam_id":317,"discussion":[{"poster":"kylesam2017","timestamp":"1719276300.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"If the Phase 1 and Phase 2 tunnels have been successfully established between Site A and Site B, and pings from internal devices at Site B reach the Site B router but are not decrypted, the issue might be related to the firewall in front of the Site B router. In this case, to ensure bidirectional communication between the two sites, you need to allow the encapsulating security payload (ESP) protocol through the firewall.\n\nTherefore, the correct action would be to \"Allow protocol ESP on the firewall in front of the Site B router.\"\n\nESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) is a protocol used in IPsec to provide encryption, integrity, and authentication of packets. If ESP traffic is blocked by the firewall, it can prevent the successful decryption of packets arriving at Site B.\n\nAH (Authentication Header) is another IPsec protocol, but it does not provide encryption and is less commonly used. In a typical IPsec configuration, ESP is used for encryption and authentication, so allowing ESP is usually the correct step to ensure the bidirectional communication is successful.","comment_id":"1104975"},{"comment_id":"1104790","content":"C is correct answer","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1719248880.0","poster":"Rosh8787"},{"content":"Why the answer is C? It says \"successfully established a Phase 1 and Phase 2 tunnel between two sites\" Doesn't that mean ESP or AH already allowed?","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"A is incorrect: site A is receiving packets as its decrypt counter is increasing\nB is incorrect: both phase 1 and phase 2 tunnels are successful meaning DH matches\nC is correct: IKE uses UDP/500 to communicate both phase 1 and phase 2. After phase 2 is completed, IPsec uses those keys for either ESP or AH. Site A is sending so it has a route. That means site B must be blocking protocol 50 or 51.\nD is incorrect: PFS is optional. If this would not match, the phase 2 tunnel would not appear.","timestamp":"1701543600.0","poster":"Veliion","comment_id":"912960"}],"poster":"anu_enlil","comment_id":"877554","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1698000720.0"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1691426100.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"red_sparrow_Gr","comment_id":"801280","content":"neglect my comment.

In DMVPN Phase 3, the spoke routers register with a Next Hop Server (NHS) to obtain the routing information for other spokes in the network. The backup NHS feature allows a spoke to have multiple NHSs configured, where the primary NHS is the preferred hub, and the backup NHSs act as alternatives. If the primary hub becomes unreachable, the spoke router will automatically switch to using one of the configured backup NHSs as the new hub. This ensures that the spoke can maintain connectivity and continue routing traffic even if the primary hub goes offline. On the other hand, NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol) shortcuts are used in DMVPN to dynamically establish direct spoke-to-spoke tunnels, bypassing the hub router. NHRP shortcuts improve efficiency and reduce latency by allowing spokes to communicate directly with each other. However, it is the backup NHS feature that specifically addresses the issue of switching to an alternate hub in case of primary hub unavailability.","comment_id":"1104976","poster":"kylesam2017","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Rosh8787","timestamp":"1719028320.0","content":"So many wrong answers.
