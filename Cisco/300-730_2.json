By installing and authenticating machine certificates on the devices, you can establish a secure connection between the client and the Cisco AnyConnect VPN gateway. This ensures that only devices with valid machine certificates issued by the corporate domain can connect to the VPN. Additionally, machine certificates provide a higher level of security and are applicable to multiple operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. This allows for a consistent and unified approach across different platforms. By using machine certificates, if a corporate issued device is stolen or compromised, the certificate can be revoked or disabled remotely.
