The template data timeout 120 command is used to specify the interval for exporting template records to the collector.\nOption E: This configuration includes commands to match the IPv4 protocol, source address, destination address, transport destination-port, and interface output. It also includes commands to collect the IPv4 source mask, source prefix, destination prefix, transport TCP destination-port, counter bytes long (64-bit counter), flow direction, and transport TCP flags. These commands align with the requirement to collect traffic statistics including the source and destination IP addresses, the destination ports, the total number of bytes from each flow using a 64-bit counter, and all transport flag information.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"picho707"}],"question_id":292,"topic":"1","answer":"AE","timestamp":"2024-03-09 15:59:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"exam_id":325,"answers_community":["AE (100%)"]},{"id":"tde6z79eGIerXobrnwMF","timestamp":"2024-04-05 19:36:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/137989-exam-350-501-topic-1-question-387-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"question_id":293,"topic":"1","answer":"A","choices":{"A":"Trace the attack that flows from the attacked sections of the network toward the network edges","C":"Review the whole attack-handling process","B":"Detect unusual activity or behavior and activate appropriate measures after an alert is raised","D":"Mitigate the attack that flows using various mechanisms"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1281813","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726009800.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer : In the six-phase approach to service provider security, the traceback phase involves tracing the path of the attack as it moves through the network.
