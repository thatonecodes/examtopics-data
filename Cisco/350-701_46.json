Therefore, the correct answer is D. HTTP authentication.\n\nIn the code, the requests module is imported to make HTTP requests to the API, and the client_id and api_key variables are defined to authenticate the requests. The client_id is used as an identifier for the client making the request, and the api_key is used to authenticate the request and provide access to the Cisco AMP resources.\n\nHTTP authentication is a way of authenticating requests made to a web server using standard HTTP protocols. It allows a user or application to send their credentials with an HTTP request, typically in the form of a username and password or an API key, to authenticate the request and gain access to protected resources on the server.","poster":"loser4fun","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1695043020.0"},{"poster":"luisseijuro","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_resources?api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_version=v1","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1692490140.0","comment_id":"814732"},{"poster":"Tuxzinator","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhen making API requests to https://api.amp.cisco.com/v1/computers, the API key serves as a form of HTTP authentication, allowing the user to access and manipulate data about the computers in their Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) environment.

A serverless application runs from an ephemeral, event-triggered, and stateless container that is fully managed by a cloud provider.\n\nA serverless application is a type of cloud computing architecture where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates resources as needed to run the application. The application runs in an ephemeral container, which means that it can be started and stopped dynamically based on the event that triggers it. The container is stateless, meaning that it does not persist any data between executions, relying instead on external data storage.\n\nThe cloud provider is responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure, including the provisioning of computing resources, load balancing, and security, allowing the developer to focus solely on writing the code for the application.

AES can use a 256-bit key for encryption.\n\nAES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm that is considered to be more secure than its predecessor, 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard). AES uses a fixed block size of 128 bits and support key sizes of 128,192, and 256 bits.\n\nAES is considered to be more secure than 3DES because it uses a larger block size and key size, which makes it more resistant to brute-force attacks.
