Let's take an example configuration:\n\narea 2 filter-list prefix DENY [ in | out ]\n\nHere we use area 2 as an example, and we have referenced a prefix-list named DENY. Now, we have two options for directions, INBOUND and OUTBOUND.\n\nThe IN keyword states that we will filter prefixes based on the prefix-list referenced towards the area identified in the command. Meaning that TYPE 3 LSAs going to Area 2 will be filtered based on the prefix-list.\n\nInversely, if we used OUT, it means that TYPE 3 LSAs coming FROM Area 2 will be filtered based on the prefix-list.","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"9","comment_id":"942078"},{"timestamp":"1686484380.0","poster":"msstanick","comment_id":"920630","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt is C, not A.\n\nI made the same mistake in the first place.
