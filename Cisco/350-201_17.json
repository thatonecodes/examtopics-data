By implementing secure development practices, such as regular code reviews, testing, and vulnerability assessments, vulnerabilities can be detected and addressed earlier in the development process, reducing the risk of a successful attack. In this case, the vulnerability was introduced in new code, indicating that it could have been prevented with better secure development practices. - ChatGPT","timestamp":"1676663820.0","comment_id":"812309","upvote_count":"1","poster":"DrVoIP"}],"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1676663820,"question_images":[]},{"id":"pETOHSWfYZ1vvLYq5TqH","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"An API developer is improving an application code to prevent DDoS attacks.

If the rate is exceeded, block access from the API key temporarily and return a 429 HTTP error code.\n\nThis approach is known as rate limiting and can be used to prevent DDoS attacks by limiting the number of requests that can be made within a certain time frame. It allows legitimate traffic to continue while blocking or delaying excessive traffic from malicious sources.
