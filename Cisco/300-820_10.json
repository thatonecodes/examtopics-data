This will allow you to configure two network interfaces on the Expressway-E, one for each network segment. You can then configure the Expressway-E to act as a proxy server between the two networks, allowing calls to pass between the internal and external firewalls that make up your DMZ.\n\nThe following steps are required to configure a dual-NIC Expressway-E with the Advanced Networking option key enabled:\n\nInstall the Expressway-E software on the device.\nConnect the Expressway-E to the two network segments using two separate network cables.\nLog in to the Expressway-E web interface.\nGo to the System > Network page.\nClick the Add Interface button.\nSelect the Dual NIC option.\nEnter the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway for each network interface.\nClick the Save button.","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2023-04-15 15:35:00","answer":"A","choices":{"A":"dual network interface","C":"command line interface","B":"application programming interface","D":"single network interface"},"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1681565700,"answer_ET":"A","question_id":48,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/106255-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-141-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"exam_id":321},{"id":"EtODK2IEFxoOe9FqGOUj","question_images":[],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/106256-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-142-discussion/","exam_id":321,"choices":{"B":"It allows Mobile and Remote Access endpoints to connect video calls signaling peer-to-peer.","D":"It is used to find the best media path between network elements in traversal calls.","C":"It allows calling external endpoints with reduced overhead under VPN connections.","A":"It is used by B2BUA to keep the firewall ports opened for inbound/outbound calls."},"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1681566240,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":49,"question_text":"What is a description of an Interactive Connectivity Establishment?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD","comment_id":"956737","timestamp":"1721400600.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Testme1235","timestamp":"1713188640.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is D. Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a protocol used to find the best media path between network elements in traversal calls. It does this by first discovering all possible paths between the two endpoints, and then selecting the path with the lowest latency and jitter. ICE is used by many different applications, including WebRTC, SIP, and H.323.\n\nHere are the other options and why they are incorrect:\n\nA. B2BUA stands for \"Back-to-Back User Agent\". It is a type of SIP proxy that sits between two endpoints and relays messages between them. B2BUAs are often used to keep firewall ports opened for inbound/outbound calls, but they do not use ICE to do this.\nB. Mobile and Remote Access endpoints can connect video calls signaling peer-to-peer using a variety of protocols, including ICE. However, ICE is not the only protocol that can be used for this purpose.\nC. Calling external endpoints with reduced overhead under VPN connections can be done using a variety of methods, including ICE. However, ICE is not the only method that can be used for this purpose.","comment_id":"870962","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-04-15 15:44:00"},{"id":"uD1CqDDTDqTQXN9qmJqR","answer":"A","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-07-19 16:50:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"SRV record _cisco-uds._tcp.example.com that resolves to ExpE.example.com on port 5061","A":"SRV record _collab-edge._tls.example.com that resolves to ExpE.example.com on port 8443","C":"SRV record _cisco-uds._tcp.example.com that resolves to ExpC.example.com on port 8443","D":"SRV record _collab-edge._tls.example.com that resolves ta ExpE.example.com on port 5061"},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nthe answer is A :\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/config_guide/X12-5/exwy_b_mra-expressway-deployment-guide/exwy_b_mra-expressway-deployment-guide_chapter_0100.html","poster":"Panda_man","comment_id":"1044184","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728999840.0"},{"timestamp":"1721400600.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: A\naaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAA","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"956738"}],"question_id":50,"question_text":"An administrator must configure the DNS SRV records for Mobile and Remote Access for a company with the domain example.com, the Expressway-E FQDN is ExpE.example.com, and the Expressway-C FQDN is Exp-C.example.com.
