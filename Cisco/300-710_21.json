When a file is detected on an endpoint, its prevalence score is incremented, and the information is sent to the AMP cloud. The Prevalence score allows you to see how many endpoints in your environment have seen a particular file. It also helps to understand the impact of a particular file in the environment and helps to prioritize the response to the identified threat.","poster":"Joe_Blue","timestamp":"1710074220.0"},{"timestamp":"1707970920.0","poster":"DID123","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"809088","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think D"},{"timestamp":"1707745320.0","poster":"Baumb","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct:\nhttps://cstor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cisco_Advanced-Malware-Protection-for-Endpoints_Data-Sheet.pdf","comment_id":"806379","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nPrevalence is the feature that shows each file and what computers it was executed on","timestamp":"1707488520.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mevijil","comment_id":"803304"}],"unix_timestamp":1675952520,"topic":"1","exam_id":314,"answer":"D","choices":{"D":"prevalence","A":"vulnerable software","B":"file analysis","C":"threat root cause"},"answer_description":"","question_text":"The administrator notices that there is malware present with an .exe extension and needs to verify if any of the systems on the network are running the executable file.
