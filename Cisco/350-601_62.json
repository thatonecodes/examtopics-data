Create a new locale Admin and add the Admin department to the Admin locale.\n\n\nHere's why this is the correct approach:\n\n\nCreating a new locale: A locale in Cisco UCS Central defines a set of privileges that are associated with specific resources, such as service profiles, organizations, or domains. By creating a new locale for the Admin department, you can specify the exact privileges that users in this locale should have.\n\nAdding the Admin department to the Admin locale: Once the new locale is created, you can associate the Admin department with this locale, effectively granting users in this locale access to the resources and applications of the Admin department.","comment_id":"1233179"},{"timestamp":"1675875720.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"802279","poster":"JGBARRIO","content":"It´s B"}],"unix_timestamp":1675875720,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-02-08 18:02:00","question_id":308,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/98444-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-376-discussion/","question_text":"A new user with access privileges in the Finance department moves to a new Admin department.
