Clients on this band typically experience interference from Bluetooth devices, microwave ovens, and cordless phones as well as co-channel interference from other access points because of the 802.11b/g limit of three non-overlapping channels. You can use this feature to combat these sources of interference and improve overall network performance. Band direction enables client radios that are capable of dual-band (2.4- and 5-GHz) operation to move to a less congested 5-GHz access point. \nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/wireless-mobility-documents/load-balancing-and-band-select-on-the-cisco-wireless-lan/ta-p/3128513","timestamp":"1620733500.0","poster":"skh","comment_id":"354667"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"A is correct","timestamp":"1726684620.0","comment_id":"1285951","poster":"Farhad123"},{"poster":"Ram0n_Aya1a","timestamp":"1654097100.0","comment_id":"610236","content":"A is Correct.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/9800/16-12/config-guide/b_wl_16_12_cg/802-11-parameters-and-band-selection.html","upvote_count":"4"}]},{"id":"mZHlDnCsm4U0u9VGAgpL","unix_timestamp":1615933080,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":147,"choices":{"A":"number of AP licenses","B":"controller PSU","D":"software version","C":"throughput capacity"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-03-16 23:18:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/47419-exam-300-425-topic-1-question-36-discussion/","answers_community":["D (83%)","C (17%)"],"exam_id":306,"answer":"D","question_text":"A wireless network consultant must assess an existing wireless LAN controller.
