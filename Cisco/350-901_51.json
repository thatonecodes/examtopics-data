Resource owner\n\nIn the OAuth2 three-legged authorization code flow, there are three parties involved: the client application, the authorization server, and the resource owner (the user). The flow involves multiple steps where the client application first requests authorization from the user (the resource owner) by redirecting them to the authorization server. The user then grants or denies authorization, and if they grant it, the authorization server issues an authorization code to the client. The client then uses this authorization code to obtain an access token from the authorization server, which can be used to access the protected resources on behalf of the user.\n\nThe client ID is a unique identifier that is assigned to the client application by the authorization server when the client registers with the server. The authorization server is the server responsible for issuing access tokens to the client after the client presents the authorization code. The resource server is the server that hosts the protected resources that the client is trying to access using the access token.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1683309420.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"890225","poster":"GatorSunshine","content":"\"What is the unique identifier in the OAuth2 three-legged authorization code flow?\" \n\nAccording to your own explanation: \"The client ID is a unique identifier that is assigned to the client application.\"\n\nSo the answer is correct, no?
