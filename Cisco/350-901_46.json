Webhooks are a way for a server to send real-time updates to a client, rather than the client needing to periodically poll the server for new information. This approach would reduce latency and rate limiting because the client would only receive updates when there are actual changes, rather than making unnecessary requests to the server.","upvote_count":"7"},{"timestamp":"1733412660.0","comment_id":"1224741","content":"current ChatGPT 4o\n\nUsing webhooks is an efficient approach to reduce API calls. Instead of polling the API continuously to check for updates, which can lead to exceeding the rate limit, webhooks allow the API to notify your application when a specific event occurs. This reduces the number of API calls, thereby minimizing the risk of hitting rate limits and reducing latency.\n\nOther Options:\nA. MOS scoring system before collecting information:\n\nThis is typically used for quality of experience measurement in voice and video applications, not relevant for reducing API rate limits.\nB. Leaky faucet algorithm for fault categorizing:\n\nThis is not related to reducing API rate limits or latency.\nC. Error handling to check for reachability first:\n\nWhile good error handling is important, it won't directly address the issue of reducing API call frequency to avoid rate limits.\nTherefore, the best approach in this scenario is to implement webhooks to trigger updates.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"cryptotafkar"},{"comment_id":"1045231","timestamp":"1713296760.0","content":"The main problem is that they are querying the Meraki API so often, it's rate limiting them.
