If all of this routes exist in routing table ( Directly Connected, Client VPN, Static Routes, Auto VPN Routes, Non-Meraki, VPN Peers, BGP learned Routes, NAT ) with various subnets then the most specific (longest prefix) IP address will be chosen as route. If no routes are defined, then the traffic is NATed and sent out an active Internet interface. This only occurs while the MX is configured in Routed mode."},{"poster":"sattori","content":"Selected Answer: C\nWhen multiple routes exist to the particular destination in this case router pick most specific ip address (longest prefix) to that destination this is overlapping rule nothing to do with question.

However, overlapping routes that are not identical are also present in many deployments.
