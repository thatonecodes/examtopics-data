Mimicking an unsubscribe option is a popular phishing technique. For this reason, the end users are generally wary of clicking unknown unsubscribe links. For such scenarios, the cloud-based Unsubscribe Service extracts the original unsubscribe URI, checks the reputation of the URI, and then performs the unsubscribe process on behalf of the end user. This protects end users from malicious threats masquerading as unsubscribe links.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa14-2-1/User_Guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_14-2-1/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_1_chapter_01110.html#id_101033","poster":"GVKD"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/email-security-appliance/200383-Graymail-Detection-and-Safe-Unsubscribin.html","isMC":true,"question_text":"How does the graymail safe unsubscribe feature function?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/111935-exam-300-720-topic-1-question-31-discussion/","question_id":67,"answer":"D","exam_id":316,"answers_community":["D (100%)"]},{"id":"b0gQeqtTqPmndn5pFVGj","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2021-01-25 12:59:00","choices":{"B":"Issue the altsrchost command.","D":"Apply a filter on the message.","A":"Set up the interface group with the flag.","C":"Map the envelope sender address to the host."},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":316,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"920974","poster":"GVKD","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1718138640.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is Correct:\n\nUsers requiring more power and flexibility in mapping messages to particular Virtual Gateways should investigate the use of message filters.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa12-0/user_guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_0/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_0_chapter_011001.html"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"884064","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714370040.0","poster":"Dagio78","content":"Answer D not B\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa12-0/user_guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_0/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_0_chapter_011001.html\n\nThe altsrchost command provides the simplest and most straightforward method to segment each appliance into multiple IP interfaces (Virtual Gateway addresses) from which to deliver email.
