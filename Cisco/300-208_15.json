This feature is called Layer 2(L2)-SGT Imposition. It allows Ethernet interfaces on the device to be enabled for L2-SGT imposition so that the device can insert an SGT in the packet to be carried to its next hop Ethernet neighbor. SGT-over-Ethernet is a method of hop-by-hop propagation of SGT embedded in clear-text (unencrypted) Ethernet packets.
