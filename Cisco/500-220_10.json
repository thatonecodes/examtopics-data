The three primary verbs of request available in the Cisco Meraki API are:\n\n GET: This verb is used to retrieve information from the server.

For example, it can be used to create new networks, add devices, or configure settings.\n\n PUT: This verb is used to update existing resources. It is typically used to modify configurations or update details of existing resources like devices and networks.\n\nOther verbs like DELETE are also supported, which are used to delete resources, but the three primary ones are GET, POST, and PUT.","poster":"Adrian1988","comment_id":"1223413","timestamp":"1733206320.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716799380.0","content":"Selected Answer: BEF\nCorrect: B, E and F","poster":"rnunes1110","comment_id":"1081416"},{"comment_id":"784723","content":"Selected Answer: BEF\nVerbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:\nGET returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified.\nPOST adds a new resource\nPUT updates a resource\nDELETE removes a resource\n\nhttps://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Cisco_Meraki_Dashboard_API","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1690055460.0","poster":"tliz"}]},{"id":"L0qtqJnjZiN3xJfttcfv","answer":"A","choices":{"D":"Wireless > Configure > SSIDs","C":"Wireless > Configure > Firewall & Traffic Shaping","B":"Wireless > Configure > Splash page","A":"Wireless > Configure > Access Control"},"unix_timestamp":1674153660,"timestamp":"2023-01-19 19:41:00","answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/96040-exam-500-220-topic-4-question-50-discussion/","topic":"4","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Which Meraki Dashboard menu section is accessed to enable Sentry enrollment on an SSID?","question_id":50,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1689784860.0","poster":"azjlmpang","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSM Sentry enrollment can be enabled on any MR network via the Splash page section of the Wireless > Configure > Access control page.\n\nhttps://documentation.meraki.com/MR/MR_Splash_Page/Systems_Manager_Sentry_Enrollment","comment_id":"781484"},{"timestamp":"1723462020.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kiprotich","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTo configure Sentry Enrollment on an SSID, one can Set the splash page on an SSID to Endpoint management enrollment by going to the wireless access control page of the Meraki dashboard then Select the radio button that enables Systems Manager Sentry enrollment","comment_id":"1148129"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect: A","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rnunes1110","timestamp":"1716799380.0","comment_id":"1081417"},{"comment_id":"979040","content":"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiqw4OCg9aAAxUwhv0HHfvjANsQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocumentation.meraki.com%2FMR%2FMR_Splash_Page%2FSystems_Manager_Sentry_Enrollment%23%3A~%3Atext%3DSM%2520Sentry%2520enrollment%2520can%2520be%2C%253E%2520Configure%2520%253E%2520Access%2520control%2520page.&usg=AOvVaw0cZ5QceGFK9I7LIRsGuD0R&opi=89978449","poster":"CaptainPirate","timestamp":"1707703200.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":333,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_images":[]}],"exam":{"id":333,"name":"500-220","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Cisco","isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":72},"currentPage":10},"__N_SSP":true}
