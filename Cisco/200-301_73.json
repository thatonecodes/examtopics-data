A single port on a network switch can be associated with multiple learned MAC addresses. This is common in scenarios where the port is connected to a switch or hub that has multiple devices behind it. The switch’s MAC address table will have multiple entries for that port, each with a different MAC address corresponding to the devices connected through that intermediary device. This allows the switch to correctly forward frames to any of those devices based on the destination MAC address in the frame. It’s an efficient way to handle traffic in a network with multiple devices.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727541900.0","comment_id":"1184960","poster":"lmmujsi"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct, this is a repeated question","timestamp":"1726747080.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Aritra09","comment_id":"1177385"},{"poster":"MalikMak","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect Answer is B","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1170989","timestamp":"1726049520.0"},{"comment_id":"1166965","content":"Selected Answer: A\nits A.","upvote_count":"1","comments":[],"poster":"vlkiii36","timestamp":"1725598380.0"}]},{"id":"vJEiVKuF2PRbkuTWOFkk","topic":"1","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nDrag and drop the characteristic from the left onto the cable type on the right.\n\n//IMG//","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1721839740.0","comment_id":"1254539","content":"The answer is absolutely correct!","poster":"21c069a"},{"timestamp":"1716176280.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"correct","comment_id":"1214095","poster":"KAM2023"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"given answers are correct","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1712811540.0","comment_id":"1193441"},{"comment_id":"1190640","timestamp":"1712441220.0","poster":"wazmac","content":"Correct.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":[],"question_id":362,"exam_id":288,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/138052-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1323-discussion/","answer_ET":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image351.png"],"answer":"","unix_timestamp":1712441220,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image352.png"],"isMC":false,"timestamp":"2024-04-07 00:07:00"},{"id":"oiUOuoupgXP7UjknUlc9","timestamp":"2024-03-06 08:06:00","unix_timestamp":1709708760,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728650880.0","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","comment_id":"1193785"},{"comment_id":"1190307","timestamp":"1728204420.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct.","poster":"Rolfer","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"d5c03de","timestamp":"1727115360.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWrong it's B","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1181127"},{"comment_id":"1180221","content":"can someone explain why its A not B","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kalitwol","timestamp":"1727019780.0"},{"comment_id":"1166970","comments":[{"content":"i don't think thats something a switch does tbh\nIll go with B still","timestamp":"1725950820.0","comment_id":"1170160","upvote_count":"3","poster":"squagmire"},{"content":"Dont confuse people.\n\nA switch dont send a request, it just send a frame.","timestamp":"1728204360.0","comment_id":"1190304","poster":"Rolfer","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"vlkiii36","timestamp":"1725599160.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIts A.","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"How does MAC learning function?","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","isMC":true,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"sends a retransmission request when a new frame is received","D":"protects against denial of service attacks","B":"enabled by default on all VLANs and interfaces","C":"populates the ARP table with the egress port"},"exam_id":288,"question_id":363,"answers_community":["B (83%)","A (17%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/135289-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1324-discussion/","answer_description":""},{"id":"ieCs9ZVSaS5KDRlpSFXt","isMC":false,"unix_timestamp":1707255840,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image354.png"],"answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image353.png"],"exam_id":288,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/133212-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1325-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":364,"timestamp":"2024-02-06 22:44:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1707901140.0","comment_id":"1149960","poster":"Rolfer","content":"Given answer is correct."},{"comment_id":"1261421","timestamp":"1722919560.0","content":"”Unique local address may be used by multiple organization at the same time”\n\nThis is a poor description of Unique Local Addresses.
