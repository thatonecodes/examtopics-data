If several match commands are present in a clause, all must succeed for a given route in order for that route to match the clause (in other words, the logical AND algorithm is applied for multiple match commands). In this question, both the \"match tag 6\" and \"match route-type external type-2\" must be matched for this route to be denied -> A is correct.\nIf a match command is not present, all routes match the clause. In this question, all routes that reach clause 30 match and their tags are set to 8 -> E is correct.\nIf a route is not matched with clause 10 or 20 then it will be matched with clause 30 for sure -> F is correct.\nOption C is incorrect because it says the route will be redistributed if it matches the prefix-list pfx AND the metric values. This is not true.\nThe route-map statement 20 SETS the seed metric for the prefixes identified by the prefix-list pfx. So the statement in option C is missing the \"SET\" keyword.\nOption F is correct because the only deny statement in route-map is statement 10 which only denies Type-2 External routes that have a tag value of 6. This means all Type-1 External routes will be redistributed because they will match either permit statement 20 or 30.\nNote: Route-maps that are applied to redistribution behave the same way as ACLs: if the route does not match any clause in a route-map then the route redistribution is denied, as if the route-map contained deny statement at the end.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a008047915d.shtml","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/0031700001.png"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":66,"answer":"AEF","exam_id":296,"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.
