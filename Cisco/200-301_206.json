Protect traffic on open networks.\n\nThe function of Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) in an environment is to protect traffic on open networks. Open networks, such as public Wi-Fi hotspots, do not typically have encryption enabled by default, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping and data interception. OWE provides a mechanism to encrypt wireless communication on these open networks, adding a layer of security to protect the transmitted data.
