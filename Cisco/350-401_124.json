The function of the LISP MR is to accept encapsulated Map-Request messages from ingress tunnel routers (ITRs), decapsulate those messages, and then forward the messages to the MS responsible for the egress tunnel routers (ETRs) that are authoritative for the requested EIDs.\n\nWhen an MR is implemented concurrently with an MS in a private mapping system deployment, the concurrent MS forwards the encapsulated Map-Request messages to the authoritative ETRs. When a LISP ALT is present in the deployment, the MR forwards the Map-Request messages directly over the ALT to the MS responsible for the ETRs that are authoritative for the requested EIDs.
