Why would you even need to disable LLDP when CDP is the first protocol the phones will use.. I have myriads of active deployments where both CDP and LLDP are enabled on the switches. The phones ALWAYS use CDP unless CDP is disabled from the phone's configuration or if the switch doesn't support CDP. Power and VLAN configurations are negotiated by CDP if CDP is available. If it's not, LLDP will STILL work! So why is there a need to disable it? Because it's not proprietary to Cisco?
