They can focus just on the assigned smaller task (this, it is claimed, counters the key assumption of The Mythical Man Month, making it actually possible to add more developers to a late software project without making it later still).\"","comment_id":"370306","timestamp":"1622389560.0","poster":"leranay"},{"upvote_count":"7","content":"Regarding DEVASC Official Cert Guide:\n\nChapter 4: Working with Python Modules\nSection: WORKING WITH PYTHON MODULES\n\n\"Creating modular code provides the following benefits:\n\n-Easier readability/maintainability\n-Low coupling/high cohesion\n-Code reusability\n-Collaboration\n\nB is correct","poster":"Ram0n_Aya1a","timestamp":"1633390140.0","comment_id":"457382"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Klusner","comment_id":"1298193","timestamp":"1728991140.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOrganizing code into modules helps to break down large, complex systems into smaller, manageable parts. Each module typically handles a specific functionality, making it easier to understand, test, and maintain the system. This modularity allows developers to focus on specific areas without being overwhelmed by the entire system's complexity. It also promotes reusability, as well-designed modules can be reused in different parts of the application or even in other projects.\n\nWhile improving collaboration (B) is a potential benefit of modular design, the main advantage is the ease of managing complex systems."},{"timestamp":"1718525760.0","poster":"a161757","comment_id":"1231262","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA benefit of organizing code into modules is:\n\nC. makes it easier to deal with large and complex systems\n\nModularizing code helps manage complexity by breaking down large systems into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Developers typically use modules to divide a large project into smaller parts. This way the code is easier to read and understand and each module can be developed in parallel without conflicts. A Module is packaged as a single file and in addition to being available for integration with other modules, it should work independently. A module consists of a set of functions and typically contains an interface for other modules to integrate with. It is essentially a library and cannot be instantiated.
