TKIP is an encryption protocol that was designed to provide stronger security than the previous WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) encryption standard, which was known to have vulnerabilities. TKIP uses a combination of encryption techniques, including a per-packet key mixing function, to provide data confidentiality and integrity. However, TKIP is now considered insecure and has been replaced by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in modern Wi-Fi security protocols such as WPA2 and WPA3.","poster":"Ciscoman021"},{"comment_id":"1187728","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct\n\nThe WPA protocol implements the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP).
