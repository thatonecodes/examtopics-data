The Cisco Umbrella root certificate is required for these core features:\n\nBlock Pages—If you visit a blocked domain through HTTPS, the Cisco Umbrella root certificate must be installed so that Umbrella can present a block page instead of the browser presenting an error page.\nIntelligent Proxy with SSL Decryption—If a domain is proxied, the Cisco Umbrella root certificate must be installed to decrypt HTTPS traffic instead of the browser presenting an error page.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"849891","upvote_count":"4","content":"When using SSL decryption in Cisco Umbrella Secure Internet Gateway to filter all traffic, a self-signed certificate should be presented to the end-user.\n\nSSL decryption is a feature that allows the firewall to inspect encrypted traffic by decrypting it and then re-encrypting it with a new certificate. To avoid generating trust errors in the end-user's web browser, a new certificate must be presented to the user that matches the hostname of the website being accessed.\n\nA self-signed certificate is a digital certificate that is not signed by a trusted third-party certificate authority (CA). Instead, it is generated and signed by the organization itself. While not as trusted as a certificate signed by a third-party CA, a self-signed certificate can be used for SSL decryption as long as it is installed on all client devices that will be accessing the network.","comments":[{"content":"answer is C:While an organization-owned root certificate can be used for SSL decryption, it is not the best option for presenting to end-users.\n\nAn organization-owned root certificate is a trusted certificate that is owned and managed by the organization. It is typically used to issue other certificates within the organization's PKI infrastructure, and can be used for SSL decryption.\n\nHowever, presenting an organization-owned root certificate to end-users can create confusion and distrust, as it is not a commonly recognized certificate authority. This can lead to trust errors in the end-user's web browser, which can impact user experience and potentially compromise security.","timestamp":"1679730540.0","comment_id":"849892","upvote_count":"5","comments":[{"content":"Therefore, while it is technically possible to use an organization-owned root certificate for SSL decryption, it is generally recommended to use a self-signed certificate instead.
