SLB (Server Load Balancing).\n\nSLB is a feature within Cisco devices that allows for the distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability. While SLB primarily focuses on load balancing server traffic, it can also help in recovering traffic when edge devices or access circuits fail.\n\nOptions A (FHRP), B (VRRP), and C (HSRP) are First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs) used for providing redundancy and high availability for the default gateway in a local network. They are not specifically designed to handle traffic recovery when edge devices or access circuits fail.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.
