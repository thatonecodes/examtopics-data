The main big issue here is that the API key are in the config files, hence they are in plain text. If the system is compromised the key is readeable. \n\nNow, A is not a concern because usually internal apps communicate through plain HTTP. Think it this way when you are at home you are not as vigilant of your surroundings as when you are in the streets. Same here, we have the app that communicates with external clients, that is encripted, but for internal services it is not encripted (As far as we know).
