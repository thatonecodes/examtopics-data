Authentication-Down/Switch-Local\n\nCisco FlexConnect allows remote sites to locally switch traffic without having to traverse the WAN back to the central controller. In the context of FlexConnect, the \"Authentication Down\" state refers to the situation where the connection between the access point (AP) and the central Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) is lost. In this state, the AP can still provide basic wireless services to the clients that are already authenticated, even if it cannot communicate with the central controller.\n\nThe \"Switch-Local\" mode means that the AP will locally switch user traffic without sending it back to the central controller.
