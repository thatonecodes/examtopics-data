Session data refers to the information associated with a network session or connection between two devices. This data typically includes details such as source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, protocol used, and other relevant information.\n\nBy examining session data, you can identify the specific ports being used by the source and destination devices.

Port numbers are an important part of network communication because they allow different services to use the same IP address while still maintaining unique communication channels. By analyzing session data, network administrators can gain insight into the types of traffic on their network and identify potential security risks or performance issues.\nC. Alert data is generated by security tools and indicates the detection of a specific event, such as an attempted intrusion or malware infection. While alerts can provide valuable information about security incidents, they do not necessarily include details about the ports used in the attack.\n\nD.
