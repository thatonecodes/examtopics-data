Also SwitchC needs to be able to ping server S1.\nDue to administrative restrictions and requirements you should not add/delete vlans or create trunk links. Company policies forbid the use of static or default routing. All routes must be learned via EIGRP 65010 routing protocol.\nYou do not have access to RouteC. RouterC is correctly configured. No trunking has been configured on RouterC.\nRouted interfaces should use the lowest host on a subnet when possible. The following subnets are available to implement this solution:\n10.10.10.0/24\n190.200.250.32/27\n190.200.250.64/27\nHosts H1 and H2 are configured with the correct IP address and default gateway.\nSwitchC uses Cisco as the enable password.\nRouting must only be enabled for the specific subnets shown in the diagram.\nNote: Due to administrative restrictions and requirements you should not add or delete VLANs, changes VLAN port assignments or create trunks. Company policies forbid the use of static or default routing. All routes must be learned via the EIGRP routing protocol.\n//IMG//\n\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//\n\n//IMG//","answer_description":"There are two ways to configure interVLAN routing in this case:\n+ Use RouterC as a \"router on a stick\" and SwitchC as a pure Layer2 switch. Trunking must be established between RouterC and SwitchC.\n+ Only use SwitchC for interVLAN routing without using RouterC, SwitchC should be configured as a Layer 3 switch (which supports ip routing function as a router). No trunking requires.\nThe question clearly states \"No trunking has been configured on RouterC\" so RouterC does not contribute to interVLAN routing of hosts H1 & H2 -> SwitchC must be configured as a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for interVLAN routing.\nWe should check the default gateways on H1 & H2. Click on H1 and H2 and type the \"ipconfig\" command to get their default gateways.\n\\>ipconfig\nWe will get the default gateways as follows:\n:\n\nHost1 -\n+ Default gateway: 190.200.250.33\n:\n\nHost2 -\n+ Default gateway: 190.200.250.65\nNow we have enough information to configure SwitchC (notice the EIGRP AS in this case is 650)\nNote: VLAN2 and VLAN3 were created and gi0/10, gi0/11 interfaces were configured as access ports so we dont need to configure them in this sim.\n\nSwitchC# configure terminal -\n\nSwitchC(config)# int gi0/1 -\nSwitchC(config-if)#no switchport -> without using this command, the simulator does not let you assign IP address on Gi0/1 interface.\nSwitchC(config-if)# ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0 ->RouterC has used IP 10.10.10.1 so this is the lowest usable IP address.\n\nSwitchC(config-if)# no shutdown -\n\nSwitchC(config-if)# exit -\n\nSwitchC(config)# int vlan 2 -\nSwitchC(config-if)# ip address 190.200.250.33 255.255.255.224\n\nSwitchC(config-if)# no shutdown -\n\nSwitchC(config-if)# int vlan 3 -\nSwitchC(config-if)# ip address 190.200.250.65 255.255.255.224\n\nSwitchC(config-if)# no shutdown -\n\nSwitchC(config-if)#exit -\nSwitchC(config)# ip routing (Notice: MLS will not work without this command)\nSwitchC(config)# router eigrp 65010\nSwitchC(config-router)# network 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255\nSwitchC(config-router)# network 190.200.250.32 0.0.0.31\nSwitchC(config-router)# network 190.200.250.64 0.0.0.31\nNOTE: THE ROUTER IS CORRECTLY CONFIGURED, so you will not miss within it in the exam, also dont modify/delete any port just do the above configuration.\nAlso some reports said the \"no auto-summary\" command can’t be used in the simulator, in fact it is not necessary because the network 190.200.0.0/16 is not used anywhere else in this topology.\nIn order to complete the lab, you should expect the ping to SERVER to succeed from the MLS, and from the PCs as well.\nAlso make sure you use the correct EIGRP AS number (in the configuration above it is 650 but it will change when you take the exam) but we are not allowed to access RouterC so the only way to find out the EIGRP AS is to look at the exhibit above. If you use wrong AS number, no neighbor relationship is formed between\nRouterC and SwitchC.\nIn fact, we are pretty sure instead of using two commands \"network 190.200.250.32 0.0.0.31″ and \"network 190.200.250.64 0.0.0.31″ we can use one simple command \"network 190.200.0.0″ because it is the nature of distance vector routing protocol like EIGRP: only major networks need to be advertised; even without\n\"no auto-summary\" command the network still works correctly. But in the exam the sim is just a flash based simulator so we should use two above commands, just for sure. But after finishing the configuration, we can use \"show run\" command to verify, only the summarized network 190.200.0.0 is shown.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/3840-exam-300-115-topic-1-question-100-discussion/"},{"id":"ShwuHsDcXIXa7shOwox1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1582209120.0","poster":"evgenart","comment_id":"53034","upvote_count":"1","content":"it is very vague question, cisco is trolling us.
