I spent a few hours labbing this up. When IOS-XR was the ABR, it preferred the E2 route over the N2 route. This lines up with RFC 1587. When I used IOSv as the ABR, it preferred the N2 route over the E2 route (which lines up with RFC 3101).\n\nBy the way, in IOS-XE you can clearly see which RFC version is supported by using \"show ip ospf | in RFC\" - there is no such output for IOS-XR that I've found.

This is actually pretty easy to know, because all three routers show OSPF configurations using the \"network\" command. This is only used in IOS-XE. IOS-XR enables interfaces under the area configuration in OSPF. So this configuration is NOT IOS-XR like Gi0v4ne said.
