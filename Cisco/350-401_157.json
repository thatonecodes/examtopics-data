The new active RP uses the SSO learnt checkpoint information and keeps the interfaces on the router from flapping and the router and/or line cards from reloading, however, SSO doesn’t checkpoint any Layer 3 control plane information about any neighbor router, and due to this, the existing routing protocol adjacencies go down and begin to reestablish. During this time, since the FIB was checkpointed by NSF, the data plane is not affected by the Layer 3 control plane going down and traffic continues to be forwarded while the routing protocol adjacencies reestablish.
