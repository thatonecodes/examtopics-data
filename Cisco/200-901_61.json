YAML uses indentation; JSON uses brackets and braces\n\nYAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are both data serialization formats, which are used to store and transmit data. They both have similar functionality and are used for similar purposes, but there are some key differences between the two.\n\nOne of the main differences between YAML and JSON is in their data structure. YAML uses indentation to indicate the structure of the data, while JSON uses brackets and braces. In YAML, indentation is used to indicate the level of nesting of elements and to indicate the beginning and end of an object or an array. In JSON, brackets are used to define the beginning and end of an array, and braces are used to define the beginning and end of an object.","poster":"Pelau_the_Engineer"},{"timestamp":"1733397420.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nYAML relies on indentation and whitespace to denote structure, whereas JSON uses brackets","poster":"Grace2024","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1224624"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1168433","poster":"31da450","timestamp":"1725745680.0","content":"B is the right answer"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nonly B is right","poster":"Muste","timestamp":"1725276420.0","comment_id":"1164126"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect answer","timestamp":"1706102160.0","comment_id":"961516","upvote_count":"2","poster":"knowyourself7"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer","poster":"knowyourself7","comment_id":"960383","timestamp":"1706016660.0"},{"timestamp":"1705224120.0","poster":"Ccoddes","comment_id":"951323","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer"},{"poster":"r3mo","comment_id":"787217","timestamp":"1690245780.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"It's B!"},{"timestamp":"1688902800.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"chris_edwards","comment_id":"770450","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhitespace: YAML uses whitespace to indicate the structure of the data, while JSON uses curly braces to denote objects and square brackets to denote arrays."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIts B for sure!","comment_id":"721373","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mellohello","timestamp":"1684417440.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"madelesm","comment_id":"699878","timestamp":"1681992240.0","content":"B for sure"},{"poster":"johnbran","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer B","timestamp":"1680762660.0","comment_id":"687547","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Fred78190","upvote_count":"1","content":"Response is obviously B. \nhttps://realpython.com/python-yaml/#comparison-with-xml-and-json","comment_id":"675394","timestamp":"1679428320.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB\nJSON uses brackets and braces","timestamp":"1669936380.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"macxsz","comment_id":"610337"},{"poster":"bballking","timestamp":"1668556320.0","comment_id":"602293","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI go B here","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"bblu","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1667890320.0","comment_id":"598438","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think is B"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"596165","upvote_count":"1","content":"I agree","timestamp":"1667418960.0","poster":"AJ7428"}],"poster":"joephx08","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1666866120.0","comment_id":"593049","content":"I think it is B\nhttps://www.thetechplatform.com/post/yaml-yet-another-markup-language-how-it-works-which-is-better-yaml-or-json#:~:text=One%20major%20difference%20is%20that,ability%20to%20support%20date%20attributes."}],"unix_timestamp":1650904620,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/74503-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-37-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-04-25 18:37:00","question_id":301,"question_images":[]},{"id":"eP4kgVe0yzxdvlmJ28WO","exam_id":291,"answer_ET":"","isMC":false,"unix_timestamp":1674855480,"answer_description":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nDrag and drop the capabilities from the left onto the Cisco Network Management Platforms that support the capabilities on the right.\n\n//IMG//","answers_community":[],"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-901/image83.png"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-901/image82.png"],"answer":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-01-27 22:38:00","discussion":[{"content":"provided answer is correct","poster":"DoctorDoctor","timestamp":"1691446920.0","comment_id":"801560","upvote_count":"9"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1118701","poster":"intheshadows00","timestamp":"1720615200.0","content":"ACI is DataCenter SDN\nMeraki is Cloud managed\nand vManage is SD Wan"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"1-ACI\n2-Cisco DNA \n3-Cisco SD-WAN\n4-Meraki\n5-NSO","timestamp":"1690486680.0","comment_id":"790024","poster":"moha413"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/97006-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-370-discussion/","question_id":302},{"id":"T19IiYsg6kDdV5HPgq9F","choices":{"B":"pagination","D":"filtering","C":"payload limits","A":"rate limiting"},"exam_id":291,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think the answer is correct.\n\"We can think of rate limiting as a form of both security and quality control. This is why rate limiting is integral for any API product’s growth and scalability. Many API owners would welcome growth, but high spikes in the number of users can cause a massive slowdown in the API’s performance.
