Peer Neighbor Route","answer_images":[],"question_text":"A corporate policy requires PPPoE to be enabled and to maintain a connection with the ISP, even if no interesting traffic exists. Which feature can be used to accomplish this task?","question_images":[],"answer_description":"A new interface configuration command, dialer persistent, allows a dial-on-demand routing (DDR) dialer profile connection to be brought up without being triggered by interesting traffic. When configured, the dialer persistent command starts a timer when the dialer interface starts up and starts the connection when the timer expires. If interesting traffic arrives before the timer expires, the connection is still brought up and set as persistent. The command provides a default timer interval, or you can set a custom timer interval. To configure a dialer interface as persistent, use the following commands beginning in global configuration mode:\n\nCommand Purpose -\nStep 1 Router(config)# interface dialer Creates a dialer interface and number enters interface configuration mode.\nStep 2 Router(config-if)# ip Specifies the IP address and mask addressaddress mask of the dialer interface as a node in the destination network to be called.\nStep 3 Router(config-if)# encapsulation Specifies the encapsulation type. type\nStep 4 Router(config-if)# dialer string Specifies the remote destination dial-string class class-name to call and the map class that defines characteristics for calls to this destination.\nStep 5 Router(config-if)# dialer pool Specifies the dialing pool to use number for calls to this destination.\nStep 6 Router(config-if)# dialer- Assigns the dialer interface to a groupgroup-number dialer group.\nStep 7 Router(config-if)# dialer-list Specifies an access list by list dialer-group protocol protocol- number or by protocol and list name{permit | deny | list access- number to define the interesting list-number} packets that can trigger a call.\nStep 8 Router(config-if)# dialer remote- (Optional) Specifies the name user-name authentication name of the remote router on the destination subnetwork for a dialer interface.\nStep 9 Router(config-if)# dialer Forces a dialer interface to be persistent [delay [initial] seconds connected at all times, even in | max-attemptsnumber] the absence of interesting traffic.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/dial/configuration/guide/12_4t/dia_12_4t_book/dia_dia ler_persist.html","timestamp":"2020-02-20 13:12:00","topic":"2","exam_id":296,"unix_timestamp":1582200720,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14510-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-459-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1582200720.0","poster":"diegonamaste","upvote_count":"1","content":"B.
