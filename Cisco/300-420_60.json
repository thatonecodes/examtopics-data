Then each SD-WAN device references the vBond orchestrator by a single FQDN name in its system configuration, as shown in the output below.\n \n\nsystem\n vbond vbond.xyz.com\n!\nAt the DNS layer, the organization associates multiple IP addresses with the vBond's DNS name. Generally, when an SD-WAN device queries the DNS server, the server sends back the IP addresses of all vBond orchestrators. Then the device tries each IP in succession, with the first one determined by a hash function until it establishes a successful connection. \n\nhttps://www.networkacademy.io/ccie-enterprise/sdwan/high-availability","comment_id":"903952","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":296,"unix_timestamp":1684752420,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"D":"A single Cisco Orchestrator is deployed in each network.","A":"The IP addresses of all Orchestrators are mapped to a single DNS name.","C":"Cisco WAN Edge routers are configured with all Orchestrators using their IP addresses and priority.","B":"The closest Orchestrator to each Cisco WAN Edge router is selected."},"question_text":"How is redundancy achieved among Cisco vBond Orchestrators in a Cisco SD-WAN deployment?","timestamp":"2023-05-22 12:47:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","exam_id":305},{"id":"lm8bCMckhoTE7sFBPNfR","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"C) is the correct answer.\nTraffic Symmetry for Application Visibility\n\nFor the localized application visibility features (DPI and NBAR2) to be able to classify most application traffic, it is important that the WAN Edge router sees network traffic in both directions. In dual-WAN Edge sites without any policy enabled, equal cost paths exist over each transport and to each WAN Edge router, and network traffic is hashed depending on fields in the IP header. Traffic is unlikely to always be forwarded to the same WAN Edge router in both the LAN-to-WAN direction and the WAN-to-LAN direction. To maintain symmetric traffic, it is recommended to set up routing so that traffic prefers one WAN Edge over another at dual-WAN Edge router sites.","timestamp":"1631406660.0","comment_id":"308508","poster":"sk84","upvote_count":"6"},{"timestamp":"1720933500.0","poster":"salmarin","comment_id":"1122325","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTraffic Symmetry for Application Visibility, C is correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"vangio","content":"Correct C","timestamp":"1706389620.0","comment_id":"964982","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"883831","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698519120.0","poster":"SpicyMochi","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Traffic must be symmetrical as it egresses the WAN Edges and returns from remote sites for DPI to function properly.\n\nWhen dual WAN Edge routers are deployed at a branch site, one of the design considerations is to ensure that traffic is symmetrical as it egresses the WAN Edges and returns from remote sites. This symmetry is crucial for proper functioning of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and other security features that require consistent traffic flows. Asymmetric traffic flows can lead to incorrect DPI results, ineffective security policies, and overall degraded network performance. To achieve symmetrical traffic flows, it's essential to carefully plan routing policies and load balancing mechanisms in the SD-WAN design."},{"poster":"Eards","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer C","comment_id":"697504","timestamp":"1681744560.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"simcos","comment_id":"656574","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSee: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/EE/IG-WAN/EE-WAN-IG/EE-WAN-IGch1.html","timestamp":"1677703560.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect Answer is C","comment_id":"555828","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1661404020.0","poster":"roganjosh"},{"comment_id":"469410","poster":"Surfside92","content":"Answer A is incorrect.
