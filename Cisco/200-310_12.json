When the auto-summary command has been used to enable automatic summarization on a router,\nEnhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) automatically summarizes networks on classful boundaries. Summarization minimizes the size of routing tables and advertisements and reduces a router's processor and memory requirements. Summarization is also useful in limiting the scope of EIGRP queries.\nThe 172.16.0.0/24, 172.16.1.0/24, and 172.16.3.0/24 networks in this scenario use Class B addresses. Therefore, these network ranges are summarized to the\nClass B boundary, which is /16. Subnetting a contiguous address range in structured, hierarchical fashion enables routers to maintain smaller routing tables and eases administrative burden when troubleshooting. Conversely, a discontiguous IP version 4 (IPv4) addressing scheme can cause routing tables to bloat because the subnets cannot be summarized.\nTo disable automatic summarization in an EIGRP configuration, you should issue the no auto-summary command. The no auto-summary command enables\nEIGRP to advertise the actual networks, not the classful summary. You should use the no auto-summary command when a classful network is divided and portions of the same classful network exist in different parts of the network topology. If you were to issue the no auto-summary command on RouterA, RouterA would advertise the individual network ranges and subnet mask information to RouterB.\nYou can issue the ip summary-address eigrp command to enable manual summarization. Manual summarization is configured on a per-interface basis. The syntax of the ip summary-address eigrp command is ip summary-address eigrp as number address mask, where as-number is the EIGRP autonomous system\n(AS) number, address is the summary address, and mask is the subnet mask in dotted decimal notation.\nReference:\nCisco: Cisco IOS IP Routing: EIGRP Command Reference: auto-summary (EIGRP)","answer_ET":"A","topic":"2","question_id":60,"question_text":"View the Exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nYou administer the network shown above.
