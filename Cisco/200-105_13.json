The default Ethernet VLAN is VLAN 1. It is a security best practice to configure all the ports on all switches to be associated with VLANs other than VLAN 1. \n\nThis is usually done by configuring all unused ports to a black hole VLAN that is not used for anything on the network. All used ports are associated with VLANs distinct from VLAN 1 and distinct from the black hole VLAN. It is also a good practice to shut down unused switch ports to prevent unauthorized access."},{"content":"The correct answer is A.","comment_id":"1282","poster":"bitsuspect","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1555652940.0"}]},{"id":"m25MEP18B0EVse4haz7I","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/7418-exam-200-105-topic-1-question-427-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","choices":{"B":"SOF","C":"SA","A":"FCS","D":"DA"},"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Quan","timestamp":"1572343800.0","comment_id":"18120","content":"SA: Source Address.","upvote_count":"4"}],"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1572343800,"timestamp":"2019-10-29 11:10:00","question_text":"Which six-byte field in a basic Ethernet frame must be an individual address?","exam_id":284,"question_id":62},{"id":"IynXEvw5YFmoUXE2gjC5","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1579840680,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which part of the PPPoE server configuration contains the information used to assign an IP address to a PPPoE client?","timestamp":"2020-01-24 05:38:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/12606-exam-200-105-topic-1-question-43-discussion/","choices":{"A":"virtual-template interface","B":"DHCP","D":"AAA authentication","C":"dialer interface"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":284,"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"answer":"A","topic":"1","question_id":63,"discussion":[{"content":"Answer A is Correct:\nThe pool of IP addresses from which clients are assigned a negotiated address is specified in the interface virtual-template\n\nISP1(config)# interface virtual-template 1\nISP1(config-if)# ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0\nISP1(config-if)# peer default ip address pool VTpool","comment_id":"46838","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1580898420.0","poster":"Baile"},{"timestamp":"1580082360.0","content":"Answer is A","comment_id":"43083","poster":"immz","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Omarmusheer","timestamp":"1579840680.0","comment_id":"42172","comments":[{"content":"A is correct \nDialer Inter holds the L2 configuration for PPPoE Clients","timestamp":"1581611700.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"50092","poster":"Davit"}],"content":"Shouldn't this be C dialer interface !!!","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"id":"Gwi8GsZ863VKvJuJdgEG","exam_id":284,"question_images":[],"answer":"B","question_id":64,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/12720-exam-200-105-topic-1-question-437-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"I think correct answer is site-to-site VPN","poster":"darratt","timestamp":"1579965000.0","comment_id":"42590","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"46054","poster":"Nohman","timestamp":"1580715720.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"The questione ask for multiple sites across the internet, a site-to-site VPN woulb be used for only one site, not for multiple sites.\nThe answer should be B"}]}],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-01-25 16:10:00","unix_timestamp":1579965000,"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which technology can provide security when connection multiple sites across the internet?","choices":{"B":"DMVPN","C":"Site-to-site vpn","D":"MPLS","A":"EBGP"}},{"id":"2rngzhJlAr6cKuI3cy1i","question_id":65,"unix_timestamp":1554444000,"timestamp":"2019-04-05 08:00:00","question_text":"Which functionality does an SVI provide?","answer":"Explanation","question_images":[],"exam_id":284,"answer_ET":"Explanation","discussion":[{"content":"The correct answer is B.
