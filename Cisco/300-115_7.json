HSRP and VRRP protocols allow multiple routers to participate in a virtual router group configured with a virtual IP address. One member is elected to be the active router to forward packets sent to the virtual IP address for the group. The other routers in the group are redundant until the active router fails. These standby routers have unused bandwidth that the protocol is not using. Although multiple virtual router groups can be configured for the same set of routers, the hosts must be configured for different default gateways, which results in an extra administrative burden. GLBP provides load balancing over multiple routers (gateways) using a single virtual IP address and multiple virtual MAC addresses. Each host is configured with the same virtual IP address, and all routers in the virtual router group participate in forwarding packets. GLBP members communicate between each other through hello messages sent every 3 seconds to the multicast address 224.0.0.102, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 3222 (source and destination).","poster":"depazs","timestamp":"1572226980.0","comment_id":"17870"},{"comment_id":"14564","upvote_count":"1","content":"answer c","timestamp":"1570692180.0","poster":"Nabil4"}],"timestamp":"2019-10-10 09:23:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"mP9X1VvTI35wsz536qna","choices":{"B":"If BPDUs are received by a port configured for PortFast, they are ignored and none are sent.","C":"If BPDUs are received by a port configured for PortFast, the port transitions to the forwarding state.","A":"If BPDUs are received by a port configured for PortFast, then PortFast is disabled and the BPDUs are processed normally.","D":"The command enables BPDU filtering on all ports regardless of whether they are configured for BPDU filtering at the interface level."},"timestamp":"2020-02-13 23:31:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_id":34,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"exam_id":297,"topic":"4","unix_timestamp":1581633060,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14097-exam-300-115-topic-4-question-108-discussion/","question_text":"What is the effect of configuring the following command on a switch?\nSwitch(config) # spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default","answer":"A","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"tpike","content":"A\n\"At the global level, you can enable BPDU filtering on Port Fast-enabled interfaces by using the spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default global configuration command. This command prevents interfaces that are in a Port Fast-operational state from sending or receiving BPDUs. The interfaces still send a few BPDUs at link-up before the switch begins to filter outbound BPDUs. You should globally enable BPDU filtering on a switch so that hosts connected to these interfaces do not receive BPDUs. If a BPDU is received on a Port Fast-enabled interface, the interface loses its Port Fast-operational status, and BPDU filtering is disabled.\"\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3560/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/3560_scg/swstpopt.html","timestamp":"1581633060.0","comment_id":"50304"}]},{"id":"NjVr6nODkvwZrFZWGBWl","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/226-exam-300-115-topic-4-question-109-discussion/","exam_id":297,"choices":{"D":"VRRP","A":"Proxy ARP","C":"IRDP","E":"GLBP D","B":"HSRP"},"answer_ET":"Explanation","timestamp":"2019-02-02 15:07:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which protocol will enable a group of routers to form a single virtual router and will use the real IP address of a router as the gateway address?","answer_images":[],"question_id":35,"unix_timestamp":1549116420,"answer_description":"","answer":"Explanation","topic":"4","discussion":[{"poster":"robergalvan","content":"Its D VRRP","timestamp":"1549116420.0","comment_id":"272","upvote_count":"6"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1575714960.0","comment_id":"27586","poster":"Garmaxx","content":"This means that one of the routers in the router group can have its IP address identical to the the virtual IP (vIP) of the entire router group.
