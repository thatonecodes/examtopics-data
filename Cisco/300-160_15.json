Correct answer is D.\n\"Configuring vNICs using vNIC templates provides a scalable way of configuring network connectivity for servers. This approach is practical for virtualization hosts because it allows very easy addition and removal of VLANs. Once you change the template, the newly added VLANs are added to all vNICs that were created from the template, on all hosts.\"","poster":"BrianH73","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1581179640.0"}]},{"id":"gF8dICXAMyCMSGNn6Xxe","timestamp":"2019-05-12 21:13:00","exam_id":299,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/1266-exam-300-160-topic-1-question-5-discussion/","question_id":73,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct answer: C\nCorresponding to the link: The service graph is always associated with a contract between two EPGs.","timestamp":"1580826780.0","poster":"Vovasiy","comment_id":"46536"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct Answer: C Explanation: Figure 3 of: \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-734298.html","timestamp":"1565770920.0","poster":"Silacho","comment_id":"6828"},{"content":"Correct Answer: B Explication: \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-734298.html","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1557688380.0","poster":"Soportechnology","comment_id":"1701"}],"answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Service graphs are used to define which option on the Cisco ACI platform?","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1557688380,"choices":{"D":"the Cisco APIC definitions of the contracts in REST API","A":"a function that a contract must use to get to another contract","B":"a function that an EPG must use to get to another EPG","C":"the contract between two EPGs"}},{"id":"HqIl0XqTU0Y3cT1zEP99","choices":{"A":"Configure a port channel between the Fabric Interconnect and the IOM.","C":"Configure static pining to the uplink port in the server profile.","D":"Configure dynamic pinning to the uplink port in the server profile.","E":"Configure a vPC between the Fabric Interconnect and the IOM.","B":"Implement a QoS policy that has a policy bandwidth and assign the policy to a server profile."},"answers_community":[],"exam_id":299,"question_text":"You have a Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Server chassis connected, which has four 10-Gbps connections to Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect A.
