Traditional layer 2 networks have issues because of three main reasons: Spanning-tree. Limited amount of VLANs. Large MAC address tables. Spanning-tree blocks any redundant links to avoid loops\n\nThe GRE tunnel runs on top of a physical underlay network. With VXLAN, the overlay is a layer 2 Ethernet network. The underlay network is a layer 3 IP network. Another name for the underlay network is a transport network.
