A cluster defines Video Mesh nodes with similar attributes, such as network proximity. Participants use a particular cluster or the cloud, depending on the following conditions:\n\nA client on a corporate network that can reach an on-premises cluster connects to it—the primary preference for clients on the corporate network.\n\nClients joining a Video Mesh private meeting only connect to on-premise clusters. You can create a separate cluster specifically for these private meetings.\n\nA client that can't reach an on-premises cluster connects to the cloud—the case for a mobile device unconnected to the corporate network.\n\nThe chosen cluster also depends on latency, rather than just location. For example, a cloud cluster with lower STUN round-trip (SRT) delay than a Video Mesh cluster may be a better candidate for the meeting. This logic prevents a user from landing on a geographically far cluster with a high SRT delay."}],"answer_description":""},{"id":"50w9qImCc3picYwLADjl","unix_timestamp":1612525680,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"The answer is C \"Those addresses (A, B, and C) populate the SIP SDP offer and answer as ICE candidates, and after the signaling has gone through, both endpoints will have the remote party ICE candidate addresses.
