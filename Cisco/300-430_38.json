Here's why:\n\nInbound ACL:\n\nAn inbound ACL filters traffic entering the WLC's CPU. This is the correct direction to control traffic that is destined for the CPU, such as management traffic, control traffic, or other packets that the CPU needs to process.\n\nApplying the ACL in the inbound direction ensures that unwanted or malicious traffic is filtered before it reaches the CPU, protecting the controller from potential attacks or resource exhaustion.\n\nOutbound ACL:\n\nAn outbound ACL filters traffic leaving the WLC's CPU.

Fastlane is a Cisco feature designed to optimize the performance of Apple devices on wireless networks by ensuring proper QoS handling.

It ensures that voice, video, and other real-time traffic from Apple devices receive the appropriate QoS treatment.\n\nConfiguration:\nFastlane must be enabled under each WLAN setting to ensure that the QoS policies are applied to the traffic on that WLAN. This ensures consistent performance for Apple iOS devices across the network.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA.
