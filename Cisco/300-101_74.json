This route does NOT get installed in the routing table but is kept in the topology table. The feasibility condition states that the AD from a neighbor must be less than the metric of the successor route (the feasible distance [FD]) because routing through a feasible successor when the AD > FD may cause a routing loop.\nUpdated Question"},{"id":"YGV5PckMTXmgpfuz15n8","question_text":"Your network consists of a large hub-and-spoke Frame Relay network with a CIR of 56 kb/s for each spoke. Which statement about the selection of a dynamic protocol is true?","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D. EIGRP would be appropriate, because you can manage how much bandwidth is consumed over the Frame Relay interface.","unix_timestamp":1581705960,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14149-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-551-discussion/","answer":"D. EIGRP would be appropriate, because you can manage how much bandwidth is consumed over the Frame Relay interface.","question_images":[],"answer_description":"By default, EIGRP will limit itself to using no more than 50% of the interface bandwidth. The primary benefit of controlling EIGRPs bandwidth usage is to avoid losing EIGRP packets, which could occur when EIGRP generates data faster than the interface line can absorb it. This is of particular benefit on Frame Relay networks, where the access interface bandwidth and the PVC capacity may be very different.","timestamp":"2020-02-14 19:46:00","topic":"2","choices":{"C":"EIGRP would be appropriate, because by default, queries are not propagated across the slow speed Frame Relay links.","B":"EIGRP would be appropriate, because the Frame Relay spokes could be segmented into their own areas.","A":"EIGRP would be appropriate if LMI type ANSI is NOT used."},"question_id":367,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"50602","content":"D.
