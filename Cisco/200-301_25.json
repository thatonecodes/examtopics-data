Incorrect. This is an SSID.\nB. Incorrect. This doesn't describe encryption, something that uses a password to connect to an access point is a client.\n\nSo it's C or D.\n\nI don't think it's D because encryption doesn't \"use authentication protocols\", that's something like 802.1x. Which leaves us with C; but this isn't really a good description of encryption either. Still, I think it's the right answer. Why?\n\nBecause Cisco refers to *cryptographic protocols* CCMP and GCMP as simply \"encryption\". These protocols involve integrity checks; CBC-MAC and GMAC respectively.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/220712-configure-and-verify-wi-fi-6e-wlan-layer.html#toc-hId-394597201\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCMP_(cryptography)","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"comment_id":"1289085","poster":"exiledwl","upvote_count":"2","content":"A isn't correct for this question but you said it describes an SSID which is wrong, an SSID is not limited to a single access point","timestamp":"1727279100.0"}],"comment_id":"1093867","upvote_count":"8"},{"timestamp":"1683922980.0","comment_id":"896233","poster":"JJY888","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1080302","content":"Reference please.","poster":"PaddyInNZ","timestamp":"1700942700.0"},{"content":"Whilst investigating this answer from JJY888 which I thought was the best answer so far I found these notes \n\nhttps://networklessons.com/cisco/ccna-200-301/wireless-encryption-and-integrity\nhttps://networklessons.com/cisco/ccna-200-301/wireless-authentication-methods\n\nextract from 1st link\n\nIn this lesson, we’ll take a look at some of the other algorithms and protocols to encrypt and protect the integrity of wireless traffic.\n\nThat means D to me.\n\nHoly Jeez why cant any of these Q's be a little more clear!!","comment_id":"1148445","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JulesAZ","timestamp":"1707760080.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. uses integrity checks to identify forgery attacks in the frame.\n\nEncryption in wireless networks is a security mechanism used to protect data transmitted over wireless networks from unauthorized access. Encryption involves converting plain text into cipher text using a cryptographic algorithm and a key. The encrypted data is then transmitted over the wireless network and can only be decrypted by authorized recipients who possess the key. One of the features of encryption is the use of integrity checks to identify forgery attacks in the frame, ensuring that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.","upvote_count":"7"},{"poster":"Shaifalimittal02","content":"Selected Answer: C\nEncryption in wireless networks ensures data confidentiality and integrity.

Integrity checks are used to verify whether data has been altered or corrupted during transmission and are typically implemented by certain protocols or security mechanisms like IPsec. In wireless networks, encryption is primarily used to ensure data confidentiality, not integrity.\n\nWPA, WPA2, and WPA3 are encryption features in wireless networks.
