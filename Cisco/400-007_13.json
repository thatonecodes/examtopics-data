This involves verifying that devices have proper security configurations, are up-to-date with patches, and have no vulnerabilities that could be exploited.\nSecurity Posture: Ensuring trustworthiness means implementing security measures such as authentication, encryption, and regular security updates to safeguard devices from being compromised.\nImportance:\n\nPrevent Exploitation: By ensuring the trustworthiness of devices, you reduce the risk of exploitation by attackers.
