If you put the FQDN, the CUCM will check if the FQDN is in the peer's certificate. If the FQDN is not in the CN, the CUCM will reject transactions with the peer.\nYou need to put there what is specified in the CN of the peer's certificate, be it the FQDN, the domain, the hostname, the IP address, etc. Common Name (CN) is not synonym of FQDN.\nFor example, if you do a TLS connection with an Expressway, the subject name or an subject alternate name provided, by the Expressway in its certificate.

This is an important toll-fraud prevention setting, because inside facilitators can set up a conference call to expensive international numbers and then drop out of the call. Without the conference controller, international tariffs are billed back to the company in which the conference call was set up. Valid values are as follows:\n\n—Never (default): The conference remains active after the conference controller and all on-net parties hang up. This default setting could result in potential toll fraud.\n\n—When Conference Controller Leaves: Terminate the conference when the conference controller hangs up.\n\n—When No On-Net Parties Remain in the Conference: Terminate the conference when there are no on-net parties remaining in the conference.
