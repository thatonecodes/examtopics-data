Disable Unicast Routing.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen you disable unicast routing on a bridge domain in Cisco ACI, it prevents the ACI fabric from routing unicast traffic directly. Instead, all traffic must go through the appropriate path as defined by the fabric's policies. In this scenario, by disabling unicast routing:\n\nTraffic Redirection: ICMP replies from Server2 to Server1 will not take the direct path between Leaf1 and Server1. Instead, they will be redirected to follow the intended path as defined by the ACI policies and the configurations of the Bridge Domain.\nPath Enforcement: This ensures that the packets must go through the designated path (possibly going through a service graph, firewall, or specific switches) as required by the architecture, instead of taking a shortcut that bypasses the intended flow.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1302431","timestamp":"1729770720.0"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1715792700.0","comment_id":"1212054","poster":"Marinheiro","content":"I'm going with C","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1704160080.0","comment_id":"1111544","poster":"marceaubueno","content":"That is right.
