(Choose three.)","answer_description":"The following load-balancing algorithms are provided for use with Cisco Express Forwarding traffic. You select a load-balancing algorithm with the ip cef load- algorithm command. sharing\n✑ Original algorithm--The original Cisco Express Forwarding load-balancing algorithm produces distortions in load sharing across multiple routers because the same algorithm was used on every router. Depending on your network environment, you should select either the universal algorithm (default) or the tunnel algorithm instead.\n✑ Universal algorithm--The universal load-balancing algorithm allows each router on the network to make a different load sharing decision for each source- destination address pair, which resolves load-sharing imbalances. The router is set to perform universal load sharing by default.\n✑ Tunnel algorithm--The tunnel algorithm is designed to balance the per-packet load when only a few source and destination pairs are involved.\n✑ Include-ports algorithm--The include-ports algorithm allows you to use the Layer 4 source and destination ports as part of the load-balancing decision. This method benefits traffic streams running over equal cost paths that are not load shared because the majority of the traffic is between peer addresses that use different port numbers, such as Real-Time Protocol (RTP) streams. The include-ports algorithm is available in Cisco IOS Release 12.4(11)T and later releases.\nReference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipswitch_cef/configuration/15-mt/isw-cef-15-mt-book/isw-cef-load-balancing.html","answers_community":[],"question_id":17,"answer":"BCE","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/5290-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-193-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1568703000,"exam_id":296,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"R1(config)#ip cef load-sharing algorithm ?\n include-ports Algorithm that includes layer 4 ports\n original Original algorithm\n tunnel Algorithm for use in tunnel only environments\n universal Algorithm for use in most environments","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1568703000.0","poster":"Bastex","comment_id":"11379"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2019-09-17 08:50:00","question_images":[],"choices":{"E":"tunnel","D":"per-destination","B":"include-ports","A":"per-packet","F":"per-source","C":"universal"}},{"id":"PmdgGZpD5yBXOihx3YMC","answer_description":"","exam_id":296,"timestamp":"2020-01-19 10:55:00","question_text":"In which two areas does OSPF send a summary route by default?
