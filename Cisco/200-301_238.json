By automating these processes, the need for manual intervention is reduced, leading to fewer errors and less time spent on repetitive tasks. This efficiency translates into reduced operational costs overall.\n\nOption D, \"to limit recurrent management costs,\" is somewhat related to reducing operational costs, as it implies a reduction in ongoing expenses associated with network management. However, the more common rationale for automation in network management is the broader scope of operational cost reduction, which includes but is not limited to management costs.","comment_id":"1184996","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711655940.0"},{"timestamp":"1707509040.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhy automate your network?\nOne of the biggest issues for network managers is the growth of IT costs for network operations. The growth of data and devices is starting to outpace IT capabilities, making manual approaches nearly impossible.
