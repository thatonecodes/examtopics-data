The first one \"1810944\" is the Feasible Distance (FD) and the second \"333056\" is the Advertised Distance (AD) of that route -> A is correct.\nJust for your reference, this is the output of the \"show ip route\" command on R1:\n\n\nIn the first line:\n\nD 192.168.46.0/24 [90/ 1810944] via 192.168.12.2, 00:10:01, Ethernet0/0\nThe first parameter \"90\" is the EIGRP Administrative Distance. The second parameter \"1810944\" is the metric of the route 192.168.46.0/24.

They have recently merged two organizations and now need to merge their networks as shown in the topology exhibit. One network is using OSPF as its IGP and the other is using EIGRP as its IGP. R4 has been added to the existing OSPF network to provide the interconnect between the OSPF and EIGRP networks. Two links have been added that will provide redundancy.\nThe network requirements state that you must be able to ping and telnet from loopback 101 on R1 to the OPSF domain test address of 172.16.1.100. All traffic must use the shortest path that provides the greatest bandwidth. The redundant paths from the OSPF network to the EIGRP network must be available in case of a link failure. No static or default routing is allowed in either network.\nA previous network engineer has started the merger implementation and has successfully assigned and verified all IP addressing and basic IGP routing. You have been tasked with completing the implementation and ensuring that the network requirements are met. You may not remove or change any of the configuration commands currently on any of the routers. You may add new commands or change default values.","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1560045420,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/0048700001.jpg"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"shiva","content":"where we can see explanation?","timestamp":"1560045420.0","comment_id":"2461"}],"exam_id":296},{"id":"GnHqI08YwP5MMkk9wB4I","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/0049400001.jpg"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"The spoke routers can see the routers are advertised by the hub router.","D":"The hub router can see the routes that are advertised by the spoke routers.","B":"Each of the spoke routers can see the routers that are advertised from the other spoke routers.","C":"A routing loop is created."},"question_id":118,"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","discussion":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"8332","upvote_count":"5","poster":"DimS","timestamp":"1566812400.0","content":"You are mistaken."},{"content":"DimS is right.
