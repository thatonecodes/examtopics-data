When a WAN Edge router loses connection to the SD-WAN Controllers, the router can continue forwarding traffic using last known good routing information. The default OMP graceful restart value is 12 hours and can be set to a maximum of 604,800 seconds, which is equivalent to 7 days. The IPsec rekey timer is set to 24 hours by default, and although both timers are configurable, the IPsec rekey timer must be at least two times the value of the OMP graceful restart timer. This is because the SD-WAN Controllers distribute the IPsec keys to the WAN Edge routers, and if connections to the SD-WAN Controllers are lost, any IPsec rekeying that occurs within the graceful restart time would cause traffic loss.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Tas2000","timestamp":"1727438880.0","comment_id":"1184155"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726735380.0","poster":"Stanleymahamadi","content":"B correct","comment_id":"1177229"}],"unix_timestamp":1710844980,"timestamp":"2024-03-19 11:43:00","question_id":294,"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"They continue to receive reachability updates.","A":"They continue operation normally.","D":"They cease to forward traffic in the data plane.","B":"They continue operating normally for a configurable time."},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/136585-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-372-discussion/","exam_id":304,"question_images":[],"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"How do WAN Edge devices operate when vSmart is inaccessible or fails to be reached by the WAN Edge?"},{"id":"Scf53ijxmkNfvALErWKH","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nView Routing Information\nFrom the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Monitor > Devices.\n\nCisco vManage Release 20.6.x and earlier: From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Monitor > Network.\n\nChoose a device from the list of devices that appears.\n\nClick Real Time in the left pane.\n\nClick Device Options, and choose one of the following commands as relevant:\n\nOMP Received Routes or OMP Advertised Routes\n\nshow omp routes\n\nshow sdwan omp routes\n\nDisplays OMP routes.\n\nFrom Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1, you can download OMP route details in JSON or CSV formats for Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/Monitor-And-Maintain/monitor-maintain-book/m-network.html","timestamp":"1727438640.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1184152","poster":"Tas2000"},{"poster":"Stanleymahamadi","comment_id":"1177231","content":"D correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726736100.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"exam_id":304,"timestamp":"2024-03-19 11:55:00","unix_timestamp":1710845700,"answer_description":"","answer":"D","question_id":295,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"A network engineer sets tags in OMP for routes that were originated in the Service VPN.
