What happens if all VSL connections between the virtual switch members are lost? A. VSLs can be configured with up to eight links between the two switches across any combination of line cards or supervisor ports to provide a high level of redundancy. If for some rare reason all VSL connections are lost between the virtual switch members leaving both the virtual switch members up, the VSS will transition to the dual active recovery mode. The dual active state is detected rapidly (subsecond) by any of the following three methods:\nEnhancement to PAgP used in MEC with connecting Cisco switches\n\nL3 Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) configuration on a directly connected link (besides VSL) between virtual switch members or through an L2 link\nthrough an access layer switch\nL2 Fast-Hello Dual-Active Detection configuration on a directly connected link (besides VSL) between virtual switch members (supported with 12.2(33)SXI)\n\nIn the dual active recovery mode, all interfaces except the VSL interfaces are in an operationally shut down state in the formerly active virtual switch member. The new active virtual switch continues to forward traffic on all links.\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps5718/ps9336/prod_qas0900aecd806ed74 b.html","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/5571-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-360-discussion/","choices":{"B":"The VSS transitions to the dual active recovery mode, and both virtual switch members continue to forward traffic independently.","D":"The VSS transitions to the dual active recovery mode, and only the new active virtual switch continues to forward traffic.","C":"The virtual switch members reload.","A":"Both virtual switch members cease to forward traffic."},"unix_timestamp":1569149400,"discussion":[{"poster":"cholincho","upvote_count":"2","content":"D wins","comment_id":"23354","timestamp":"1574351040.0"},{"content":"Answer is D","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1574245020.0","poster":"Bastex","comment_id":"22977"}],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18887800002.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18887800000.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01585/n18887800001.png"],"question_text":"Which statement describes what happens if all VSL connections between the virtual switch members are lost?","isMC":true,"answer":"Explanation","question_id":213,"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":297,"timestamp":"2019-09-22 12:50:00","topic":"5","answer_ET":"Explanation"},{"id":"n3yvaw6M87OqhY7jh77L","topic":"5","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/2846-exam-300-115-topic-5-question-361-discussion/","answer_description":"Within any VTP, the VTP domain name must match. So, step one is to find the correct VTP name on the other switches. Logging in to SW1 and using the \"show vtp status\" command we see this:\n\nSo we know that the VTP domain must be CCNP. This leaves only choice D and E. We also see from the topology diagram that eth 0/0 of the new switch connects to a PC in VLNA 100, so we know that this port must be an access port in VLAN 100, leaving only choice D as correct. Note that the VTP versions supported in this network are 1, 2, 3 so either VTP version 2 or 3 can be configured on the new switch.","exam_id":297,"question_text":"You have been asked to install and configure a new switch in a customer network.
