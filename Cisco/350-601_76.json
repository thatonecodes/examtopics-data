The NPV switch is connected to the NPIV switch using two 10 Gb uplinks, but the traffic originating from the connected hosts to the core switch exceeds the available bandwidth.

When disruptive load balancing is enabled, FC NPV redistributes the server interfaces across all available NP uplinks when a new NP uplink becomes operational. To move a server interface from one NP uplink to another NP uplink, FC NPV forces reinitialization of the server interface so that the server performs a new login to the core switch.\n\nOnly server interfaces that are moved to a different uplink are reinitialized. A system message is generated for each server interface that is moved.\n\nNote \nRedistributing a server interface causes traffic disruption to the attached end devices. Adding a member to the existing port-channel does not trigger disruptive auto load-balance.\n\nTo avoid disruption of server traffic, you should enable this feature only after adding a new NP uplink, and then disable it again after the server interfaces have been redistributed.\n\nIf disruptive load balancing is not enabled, you can manually reinitialize some or all of the server interfaces to distribute server traffic to new NP uplink interfaces."}],"unix_timestamp":1688319240,"question_id":376,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"switch2(config)# port-channel load-balance ethernet source-dest-port\n\n! uplink to NPV Core\nswitch2(config-if)# switchport mode np","C":"switch2(config)# npv auto-load-balance disruptive\n\n! uplink to NPV Core\nswitch2(config-if)# switchport mode np","A":"switch2(config)# npv auto-load-balance\n\n! uplink to NPV Core\nswitch2(config-if)# switchport mode npiv","B":"switch2(config)# npv traffic-map server-interface\n\n! uplink to NPV Core\nswitch2(config-if)# switchport mode npiv"},"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/113963-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-438-discussion/"},{"id":"UdLQcwhA6Z74X70oHFM9","answer_description":"","topic":"1","exam_id":326,"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1688319840,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/113965-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-439-discussion/","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":">>> output = json.dumps(clid('show ip eigrp neighbors'))\n>>> output['TABLE_asn']['ROW_asn']['asn']","C":">>> output = json.dumps(clid('show ip eigrp neighbors'))\n>>> output['asn']","A":">>> output = json.loads(clid('show ip eigrp neighbors'))\n>>> output['TABLE_asn']['ROW_asn']['asn']","D":">>> output = json.loads(clid('show ip eigrp neighbors'))\n>>> output['asn']"},"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-601/image74.png"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":377,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt is A since this is the value inside of dict inside of another dict.","comment_id":"1008833","poster":"drduck","upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1710569040.0","comments":[{"poster":"JCGO","upvote_count":"4","content":"clid return Json.
