Each router periodically generates an AES key for its data path (specifically, one key per TLOC) and transmits this key to the vSmart controller in OMP route packets, which are similar to IP route updates. These packets contain information that the vSmart controller uses to determine the network topology, including the router's TLOC (a tuple of the system IP address and traffic color) and AES key. The vSmart controller then places these OMP route packets into reachability advertisements that it sends to the other routers in the network. In this way, the AES keys for all the routers are distributed across the network. Even though the key exchange is symmetric, the routers use it in an asymmetric fashion. The result is a simple and scalable key exchange process that uses the Cisco vSmart Controller. \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/security/vedge/security-book/security-overview.html#id_112385","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1611128280.0","poster":"naddaf"},{"content":"Could someone tell me if I'm wrong?
