Allow HTTP traffic only before authentication and block all the traffic.\nD. Allow all the traffic before authentication and intercept HTTP only.\n\nExplanation:\nCMX Facebook Wi-Fi:\n\nCMX Facebook Wi-Fi is a solution that allows users to access a wireless network by logging in via their Facebook credentials. Before authentication, limited access is provided to facilitate the login process.\n\nAllow HTTP traffic only before authentication and block all the traffic:\n\nThis option allows users to access only HTTP traffic (unencrypted web traffic) before authentication. This is typically used to redirect users to the Facebook login page or a captive portal. All other traffic is blocked until authentication is completed.\n\nAllow all the traffic before authentication and intercept HTTP only:\n\nThis option allows all traffic before authentication but intercepts HTTP traffic to redirect users to the Facebook login page or captive portal. This ensures that users can still access other services (e.g., DNS) while being redirected for authentication."},{"content":"he following are the different options to choose for access before authentication:\n\nAllow HTTPs traffic only before authentication and block all the traffic:\n– To do this, click the sequence number whose Source Port or Dest Port has the value HTTPs.

This allows wireless users to access local resources even when the WAN connection to the central controller is down.\n\nlightweight mode:\n\nThe APs are operating in lightweight mode, meaning they are managed by a central wireless LAN controller (WLC). FlexConnect is a feature of lightweight APs that allows them to operate in a semi-autonomous manner when the WAN connection to the WLC is unavailable.\n\nWEB authentication:\n\nWEB authentication (captive portal) is often used in branch offices to authenticate users locally without requiring a connection to the central controller.

The client is failing to accept the certificate.\n\nExplanation:\nEAP-PEAP Authentication:\n\nEAP-PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) relies on a server certificate to establish a secure TLS tunnel for authentication. If the client cannot validate or accept the server certificate, the authentication process will fail.\n\nDebug Output Analysis:\n\nThe debug output shows the EAP-FAST process, but it does not indicate any issues with the EAP profile configuration or user credentials.\n\nThe absence of errors related to invalid credentials or misconfiguration suggests that the issue lies with the certificate exchange between the client and the server.\n\nCommon Causes for Certificate Issues:\n\nThe server certificate may be self-signed or issued by an untrusted Certificate Authority (CA), causing the client to reject it.\n\nThe client may not have the necessary root CA certificate installed to validate the server certificate.\n\nThe server certificate may be expired or have an incorrect Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN).","comments":[{"comment_id":"1357363","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1739736000.0","content":"Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:\nB.
