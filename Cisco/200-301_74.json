Uses templates to implement QoS configuration: This is correct for WLC\n \n2. Ability to boost a wi-fi signal: An AP can be configured to relay the existing WLAN, so it is correct for AP. But a WLC does not participate in transmitting wireless signal.\n \n3. Requires a special adapter for PoE: In real scenarios, people use PoE switches to supply APs with power, and WLCs usually have their own power supply. Neither requires a special adapter.\n \n4. Supplies user connection data within a device group: This sounds high-tech but it basically means 'connecting devices together'. An AP does this, or an AP in conjunction with an WLC, depending on the deployment type, autonomous or lightweight AP, but definitely not WLC on its own.\n \n5.

These addresses are commonly used within internal networks. To enable devices using private IP addresses to communicate with the public Internet, Network Address Translation (NAT) is used.
