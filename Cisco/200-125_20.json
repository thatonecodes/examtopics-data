Teredo – similar to 6to4 (connectivity by encapsulating IPv6 datagram packets within IPv4 User Datagram Protocol) (UDP)\nB. 6to4 -IPv6 traffic can be carried over IPv4 GRE tunnels. Overlay tunneling encapsulates IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets for delivery across an IPv4 infrastructure\nC. 4to6 – tunnel connecting IPv4 isolated sites on the IPv6 network is called an IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel\nD. GRE E. ISATAP – is a managed technology for providing IPv6 on an IPv4 network. It emulates IPv6 connectivity on the IPv4 infrastructure. IPv6 Router Discovery usually uses multicast. This isn’t possible on an infrastructure based on IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels, so ISATAP solves that in a different way. An ISATAP router is provided on the network and its IPv4 address is made known to the ISATAP hosts (usually using the hostname isatap. in DNS). The ISATAP hosts then can use that address to set up their IPv6 connectivity.","comment_id":"30757","timestamp":"1576697640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"bigfoot"}],"timestamp":"2019-12-18 20:34:00","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"Which tunneling mechanism embeds an IPv4 address within an IPv6 address?","exam_id":285,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/10556-exam-200-125-topic-1-question-467-discussion/","question_id":98,"answer_description":""},{"id":"zcYcX7h97pRyt7co73KQ","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1651657140,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","exam_id":285,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-05-04 11:39:00","choices":{"B":"fast switching","C":"process switching","D":"Cisco Express Forwarding","A":"cut through"},"question_id":99,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"596686","timestamp":"1651657140.0","poster":"M11156_","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCisco Express Forwarding"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/75136-exam-200-125-topic-1-question-47-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which feature builds a FIB and an adjacency table to expedite packet forwarding?","answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","question_images":[]},{"id":"h7Htx8eiXCRJ8eUi2zrw","timestamp":"2019-05-28 06:17:00","isMC":true,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/01508/0033300001.png"],"unix_timestamp":1559017020,"question_id":100,"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.
