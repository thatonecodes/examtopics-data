The IPN is not managed by the APIC, instead the user would configure it separately. Connectivity within each pod to the IPN takes place on the spine nodes, but there is no requirement to connect every spine to the IPN. All inter-pod traffic is encapsulated with VXLAN. Multi-destination traffic is dispersed to the pods via multicast, so there is a requirement for the IPN to support PIM bidirectional mode multicast.\n\nThe control-plane between the pods leverages MP-BGP EVPN. This is how endpoint information is advertised between the pods so that communication from an endpoint in one pod to an endpoint in another pod will be seamless.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"thinqtanklearningDOTcom","timestamp":"1732342440.0","comment_id":"904539"},{"poster":"imanus","comment_id":"899955","timestamp":"1731844680.0","content":"correct, IPN exists in Multipod deployments - The IPN device receives the traffic and performs multicast replication toward all the Pods from which it received an IGMP Join for GIPo1.
