Layer 2 switches will not affect the implementation of IPv6. They can be included in the design in their current state.Layer 2 switches (which operate at the data link layer) do not need to fully support IPv6 to carry IPv6 traffic. The main role of Layer 2 switches is to forward Ethernet frames based on MAC addresses, and they are agnostic to the Layer 3 protocols (IPv6 or IPv4). As long as the Layer 2 devices are functioning correctly and not blocking IPv6 traffic at the data link layer, they can continue to operate in their current state during the migration.","timestamp":"1743268380.0","comment_id":"1411784","poster":"Nery","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"noxkrugger","comment_id":"1278081","content":"Yes it is D","timestamp":"1725434760.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1222600","timestamp":"1717239720.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI don't see multicast requirements in the question","poster":"Seawanderer"},{"timestamp":"1714578720.0","poster":"bdp123","content":"Selected Answer: D\nthey can use dual stack or address translation during the migration","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1205159"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nother source is C","poster":"PeterCheng","comment_id":"1116475","timestamp":"1704700560.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"D seem correct\nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/voice-over-ip/ipv6-with-cisco-layer-2-switches/td-p/1044509","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"845425","timestamp":"1679361420.0","poster":"main_street"},{"timestamp":"1678120680.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nas layer 2 switches can potentially impact the implementation of IPv6, particularly if they do not support features such as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).","poster":"gcpengineer","comments":[{"timestamp":"1678376820.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"I agree with you, but...\n1. they want to minimize the cost and legacy L2 switches will pass IPv6;\n2.
