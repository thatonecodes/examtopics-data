If the switch or other network devices do not trust the markings from the wireless controller or endpoints, the QoS markings may be overwritten, leading to inconsistent QoS treatment.\n\nFor example, configure the switch port connected to the WLC to trust DSCP or CoS markings:\n\nplaintext\nCopy\ninterface GigabitEthernet1/0/1\n switchport mode trunk\n mls qos trust dscp\nPolicy Maps (C):\n\nPolicy maps define how traffic should be treated based on its QoS markings. They are used to enforce QoS policies, such as prioritizing voice traffic (e.g., marking DSCP EF for VoIP traffic) and ensuring consistent treatment across the network.\n\nFor example, create a policy map to prioritize voice traffic:\n\nplaintext\nCopy\npolicy-map VOICE-QOS\n class VOICE\n priority percent 20","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1358469","timestamp":"1739915040.0"},{"poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1728674160.0","comment_id":"1041052","upvote_count":"3","content":"Trust boundaries: By configuring trust boundaries, you can define which network devices should trust and prioritize the QoS markings from the VoWLAN traffic. This ensures that the QoS markings are preserved as the traffic flows through the wired network.\n\nPolicy maps: Policy maps allow you to define specific QoS policies for different traffic classes. By configuring a policy map on the switch, you can ensure that the correct QoS markings are applied to the VoWLAN traffic and preserved throughout the end-to-end traffic flow. This helps prioritize the VoWLAN traffic and ensure it receives the necessary bandwidth and quality of service."},{"comment_id":"1007567","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nSpoto answer AC","timestamp":"1726315620.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"tera671"}],"timestamp":"2023-09-14 14:07:00","isMC":true,"question_id":91},{"id":"SkyV3FdKC3JxFhWWrstR","unix_timestamp":1669752120,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Silver","D":"Platinum","B":"Best Effort","A":"Bronze"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/89307-exam-300-430-topic-1-question-182-discussion/","topic":"1","exam_id":307,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-11-29 21:02:00","question_text":"An engineer is in the process of implementing Fastlane on a wireless network with a Mobility Express AP installed.
