So by using this command in option B all VLANs 1 - 4094 are allowed over the trunk.\nFor security reasons, during our network design we tend to remove all vlans and only allow the vlans we desire.\nIf we apply the command in option C \"switchport trunk allowed VLAN 11, 12\" it would delete all vlans and only allow VLANs 11 and 12. This means that all other devices or departments who are dependent on this trunk will be cut-off.\nOne of the biggest blunders sometimes made by beginners is to delete an entire VLAN by overwriting it.
