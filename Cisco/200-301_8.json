What this means is that other kinds of traffic may be deprioritized. When this happens, the packets are simply held in a buffer until they can be forwarded without exceeding the total desired and configured rate.\n\nSource: https://www.f5.com/glossary/traffic-shaping#:~:text=Traffic%20shaping%20is%20a%20powerful,attacks%20from%20overwhelming%20network%20resources.","timestamp":"1699734900.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"895297","poster":"JJY888"},{"comment_id":"875470","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1697796660.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"891823","timestamp":"1699427640.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ac89l","content":"Thats QoS"}],"poster":"shiv3003","content":"C is the answer"}],"choices":{"C":"It organizes traffic into classes","D":"It modifies the QoS attributes of a packet","A":"It queues excess traffic","B":"It sets QoS attributes within a packet"},"question_text":"What does traffic shaping do?","topic":"1","question_id":39,"unix_timestamp":1677428040,"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/100869-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1032-discussion/","answer_images":[],"exam_id":288},{"id":"uTOydC6mEV4IodCPDrnL","timestamp":"2023-02-27 21:24:00","choices":{"D":"Switch1(config) # interface port-channel 1\nSwitch1(config-if) # lacp max-bundle 1","C":"Switch1(config) # interface Fa0/0\nSwitch1(config-if) # lacp port-priority 200\nSwitch1(config) # interface Fa0/1\nSwitch1(config-if) # lacp port-priority 100","A":"Switch1(config) # interface Fa0/0\nSwitch1(config-if) # lacp port-priority 100\nSwitch1(config) # interface Fa0/1\nSwitch1(config-if) # lacp port-priority 200","B":"Switch1(config) # interface port-channel 1\nSwitch1(config-if) # port-channel min-links 1"},"question_id":40,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"12","comment_id":"824127","content":"min-links command specifies the minimum number of interfaces that the configuration mode LAG requires to be active.

In this case, it sets the minimum number of operational links to 1, which means that if at least one physical link in the port-channel is up and functioning, the port-channel interface will also be up. If all the physical links in the port-channel go down, the port-channel interface will go down as well.\nThe port-channel min-links command is particularly useful for ensuring that the EtherChannel remains operational even if some of its member links fail.
