The \"priority\" value in an SRV record enables administrators to prioritize one server that supports the given service over another. A server with a lower priority value will receive more traffic than other servers. However, the \"weight\" value is similar: a server with a higher weight will receive more traffic than other servers with the same priority.\n\nThe main difference between them is that priority is looked at first. If there are three servers, Server A, Server B, and Server C, and they have respective priorities of 10, 20, and 30, then their \"weight\" does not matter. The service will always query Server A first.\n\nBut suppose Servers A, B, and C all have a priority of 10 — how will a service choose between them? This is where weight becomes a factor: if Server A has a \"weight\" value of 5 and Servers B and C have a \"weight\" value of 3 and 2, Server A will receive the most traffic, Server B will receive the second-most traffic, and Server C the third-most."},{"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1726987680.0","poster":"Alan100","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPriority checked first.
