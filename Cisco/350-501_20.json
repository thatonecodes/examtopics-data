A firewall VNF provides essential functions like access control, packet filtering, and threat prevention to secure the network against unauthorized access and malicious activities.\n\nWhile other options like network, storage, and compute are fundamental components of a network infrastructure, a firewall specifically represents a VNF role that focuses on security-related functionalities.","timestamp":"1684718820.0","comment_id":"903614","upvote_count":"1","poster":"xChdjdufurpew"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nI am changing to B - Fihttps://www.examtopics.com/exams/cisco/350-501/view/#rewall.
