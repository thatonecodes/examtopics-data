The BPDU frame for Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST) and Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (RPVST) have a VLAN tag. The ACI leaf can identify which EPG the BPDU needs to be flooded based on the VLAN tag in the frame.

Typically, the native VLAN is not used to carry data traffic and the native VLAN may not be configured for data traffic on the ACI fabric.
