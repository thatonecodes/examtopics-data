Configure the vPC peer gateway to enable the HSRP routers to directly handle packets sent to the local vPC peer MAC address and the remote vPC peer MAC address, as well as the HSRP virtual MAC address. See the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide, Release 5.x, for more information on the vPC peer gateway.","comment_id":"880060","poster":"ciscoshare2022","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729839900.0"}],"answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/107398-exam-300-610-topic-1-question-85-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":310,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1682406300,"timestamp":"2023-04-25 09:05:00","question_id":166},{"id":"BvNoRhXM11bEFkeou3GH","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","answer":"C","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1682407500,"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"single-sided dual vPC","D":"single-sided single vPC","A":"dual-sided single vPC","C":"dual-sided dual vPC"},"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729841100.0","comment_id":"880076","content":"Required Recommendations:\n● Use different vPC domain-id for each vPC domain (DC1: vPC domain for aggregation, vPC for DCI.
