But you want these two groups to talk to each other, even though they use different ways of talking.\n\nNow, think of a big tunnel that connects these two groups. When someone from the first group wants to send a message to someone in the second group, they put their message in a special envelope and send it through the tunnel. When the message comes out of the tunnel on the other side, it looks like a message from the second group, even though it started with the first group's way of talking.\n\nIn the same way, 6 to 4 tunneling helps the two different ways of talking, IPv6 and IPv4, to understand each other. It wraps the IPv6 message in an IPv4 wrapper and sends it through a tunnel.
