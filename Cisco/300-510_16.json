Hierarchical CLI allows for easier configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting of OSPF configurations. When configuration commands are displayed together in their hierarchical context, visual inspections are simplified. Hierarchical CLI is intrinsic for CLI inheritance to be supported.\n\nWith CLI inheritance support, you need not explicitly configure a parameter for an area or interface. In the software, the parameters of interfaces in the same area can be exclusively configured with a single command, or parameter values can be inherited from a higher hierarchical level—such as from the area configuration level or the router ospf configuration levels.\nMore information: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5500/routing/71x/b-routing-cg-ncs5500-71x/b-routing-cg-ncs5500-71x_chapter_011.html#con_1059437","timestamp":"1632431220.0"},{"timestamp":"1718630700.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1099034","poster":"thejag","content":"Also, \"show ip ospf topology command\" is not an XR command, on XR it is \"show ospf database\""},{"poster":"thejag","timestamp":"1718630460.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the only possible answer","comment_id":"1099029"},{"content":"I think A/B/C are incorrect.

It looks up the RP in the unicast routing table, and sends the PIM join message direction RP. Most PIM messages are link local; they are addressed to the link local multicast group 224.0.0.13 (all PIM routers). Therefore, the PIM join travels router by router toward the RP.\n\nPassing each router, the router creates a state for this multicast request: It creates a state for (*.G), since it has not learned anything about sources yet.
