Furthermore, prefixing of the number with \"+\" is called the globalized format of an E.164 number and is defined in the Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2806. The best practice, the incoming call must be globalized, next routed and finally Localized. Now, E.164 must be normalized to +E.164 on a globalized environment, for example, from a ISDN BRI, you do no need to prefix 011 for international call, just you can dial the E.164 format without access codes, and setting the TON to International but it is not globalization, so D can not be correct neither. If it were up to me, I would rather to choose C instead A.","comments":[{"content":"Well, I think I am changing my mind. Another think I would like to comment that E.164 number, in order to ITU-T E.164, is a external called-party number (without \"+\").\nIf it is a External incoming call (from GW), calling- and called-party numbers are usually provided in localized E.164 format. If Called-party number is internal, A. could be the best answer. If Called-party number is external (offnet to offnet call), C. could be the best answer.\nIf it is a Internal Outgoing Call (from internal IP phone DN) to external Called-Party number change the called number to +E.164 format if any other format was used (according to local dial rules, enterprise access codes, etc.) and this case, the best answer could be C.\nIn order of all of above, the closest answer would be A because it has a more specific scenario (PSTN Gateway to Internal DN).
