If both LDP peers initiate an LDP TCP connection, it might result in two concurrent TCP connections. To avoid this situation, an LSR first determines whether it should play the active or passive role in session establishment by comparing its own transport address with the transport address it obtains through the exchange of LDP Hellos. If its address has a higher value, it assumes the active role. Otherwise, it is passive. When an LSR plays the active role, it initiates a TCP connection to the LDP peer on the well-known LDP TCP port 646.","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ShadowfaKS","comment_id":"1200684","timestamp":"1713871200.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSessions are formed using UDP"},{"timestamp":"1645775340.0","comment_id":"555837","upvote_count":"3","poster":"wts","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"LDP uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and TCP to transport the protocol data unit (PDU) that carries LDP messages\""},{"content":"The given answer is correct","timestamp":"1627821420.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"418257"},{"content":"c win this question.","poster":"Jack1188","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"154993","timestamp":"1597115040.0"}]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"name":"300-410","provider":"Cisco","numberOfQuestions":620,"id":303,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":124},"__N_SSP":true}
