OpenFlow defines the way the SDN Controller should interact with the forwarding plane to make adjustments to the network, so it can better adapt to changing business requirements. With OpenFlow, entries can be added and removed to the internal flow-table of switches and routers to make the network more responsive to real-time traffic demands.","poster":"Thusi26","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1647463980.0","comment_id":"446151"},{"content":"I go with C as only Northbound APIs deals with control plane","timestamp":"1640350020.0","poster":"Raajaa","comment_id":"389472","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"bazinga31","comment_id":"385071","content":"C?
