Neighboring APs offering the same connection use the same SSID, but each AP identifies itself by associating its radio MAC address to the SSID string. This associated MAC address is called the basic service set identifier (BSSID), and it enables stations to know which AP offers which SSID.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/5917-exam-200-355-topic-1-question-236-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"CF","question_text":"An AP has been configured for personal wireless access to the Internet using appropriate security and cloaking.\nWhich two items should be configured on the wireless client?

It can receive multiple copies of the same signal and then combine them into one single signal that has a better SNR then the two individually received signals. In a nutshell though, this requires that a transmitter sends the original signal out from two or more transmitters, and that the receiver also receives multiple copies of the same signal and then tries to improve the received signal into a higher quality signal.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"9800"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/4769-exam-200-355-topic-1-question-24-discussion/","answer":"E","question_id":58,"isMC":true},{"id":"dHsgaqvci2hzIxT8Pi4t","question_text":"When a wireless client is authenticated in a controller-based wireless network, which three pieces of source identification information can be used by the controller for an Access-Request message that is sent to an external RADIUS server?
