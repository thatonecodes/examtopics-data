The policy-map is called shape_Gigabit Ethernet4.200 which is fine, as it can be called anything, doesn't have to have the correct interface name in it, and it is applied correctly to the interface.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1297727","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Rosh8787","timestamp":"1728923220.0","content":"Option D is the correct answer"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/149420-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-416-discussion/","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
