By limiting the bandwidth usage of non-critical traffic, traffic shaping can help prevent network congestion and ensure that the available bandwidth is allocated in a way that meets the organization's priorities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: it limits bandwidth usage.","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1696061220.0","poster":"Ciscoman021","comment_id":"855466"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct\n\nThe primary purpose of traffic shaping is limiting bandwidth usage. Traffic shaping is a network management technique that controls the volume of data that is transmitted into a network in order to avoid congestion. By delaying the flow of certain data packets, traffic shaping smooths out the traffic bursts, allowing for more efficient use of the available bandwidth.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727825520.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1187714"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715794620.0","comment_id":"1071821","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhat is Traffic Shaping?

The deduction was made to create a network for small and medium-sized campuses.
