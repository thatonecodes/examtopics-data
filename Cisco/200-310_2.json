VSS allows for the creation of Layer 2 port channels from the third downstream\ndevice to the pair of VSS switches, which eliminates STP blocking and allows for active/active forwarding. This technology is very similar to\nMultichassis EtherChannel (MEC) used with the Cisco Catalyst 3850 series product line, which enables switches stacked together to operate with\na single control plane and use a single command-line interface (CLI) for management. However, VSS is limited to two physical chassis connected\ntogether. Furthermore, with VSS there is no longer a need for first-hopredundancy protocols (FHRPs) such as HSRP and GLBP because both\nswitches share a single IP address for switched virtual interfaces (SVIs)."}],"unix_timestamp":1565170380,"answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":289,"topic":"1","question_id":10,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/3310-exam-200-310-topic-1-question-166-discussion/"}],"exam":{"provider":"Cisco","numberOfQuestions":64,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"id":289,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"name":"200-310"},"currentPage":2},"__N_SSP":true}
