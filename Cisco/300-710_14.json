Specify the protocol in the object.\n\nTo define a URL object on Cisco FMC without performing SSL inspection, the engineer can simply specify the protocol used by the URL, which is typically \"http://\" or \"https://\". By specifying the protocol in the object, the Cisco FMC will not attempt to perform SSL inspection on the URL.\n\nOption D is therefore the correct answer. The engineer should specify the protocol in the object to define a URL object on Cisco FMC without performing SSL inspection. The other options are not relevant to this task.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"837074","timestamp":"1694519760.0"},{"content":"Answer:C The correct method to specify the URL without performing SSL inspection is to specify the protocol in the object, which is option C. This can be done by selecting \"http\" or \"https\" from the Protocol drop-down menu in the Add URL Object window in Cisco FMC. By doing so, the FMC will create a URL object that matches only the specified protocol and will not inspect SSL traffic. Options A, B, and D are not relevant to this task.","poster":"tanri04","comment_id":"836338","timestamp":"1694447040.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"matan24","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer. \n\n\"HTTPS filtering, unlike HTTP filtering, disregards subdomains within the subject common name.
