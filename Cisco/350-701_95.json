Cisco, in association with a few other vendors, developed the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP), which can automate most of the process for requesting and installing an identity certificate. Although it is not an open standard, it is supported by most Cisco devices and makes getting and installing both root and identity certificates convenient.\n(CCNP and CCIE Security Core SCOR 350-701 Official Cert Guide page #99)","comment_id":"556949","poster":"andregor","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1645904460.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCisco Identity Services Engine Administrator Guide, Release 2.4 - Personal Devices on a Corporate Network (BYOD) [Cisco Identity Services Engine] - Cisco","comment_id":"553767","timestamp":"1645542900.0","poster":"brownbear505","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Correct answer is A: \nBackground Information\nOne of the benefits of the Cisco ISE-enabled BYOD implementation is the ability of the end users to perform self-service device registration.

Mobile Device Management (MDM) software commonly uses SCEP for devices by pushing a payload containing the SCEP URL and shared secret to managed devices.
