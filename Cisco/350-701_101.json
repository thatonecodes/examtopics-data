Incorrect : a vlan hopping attack is prevented by not using vlan 1 as the default vlan and configure the user facing ports as access ports. Port security not needed here.\n\nB.

Incorrect : although an attacker can send big amount of data to clog the port it is connected to to its maximum bandwidth, the other ports will still work correctly.\n\nD. Correct : by sending multiple frames with different mac addresses, the attacker can fill the mac adress table to its maximum capacity.

To protect against this, you can\nuse switch port security on the switches to limit the MAC addresses that could be\ninjected on any single port.

The environment to build and deploy is provided for you. \n\nPaaS is a way that developers can create a framework to build and customize their web-based applications on.
