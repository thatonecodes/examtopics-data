The active unit keeps CAPWAP tunnels, AP states, client states, configurations, and image files all in sync with the hot standby unit. The active controller also synchronizes the state of each associated client that is in the RUN state with the hot standby controller. If the active controller fails, the standby will already have the current state information for each AP and client, making the failover process transparent to the end users.","poster":"shefo1","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"1131760","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI'ts B...","poster":"Luiggi","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1706193660.0"},{"timestamp":"1706145840.0","poster":"Mizuchan","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1136450","content":"Does AP database includes client database?","timestamp":"1706682360.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nDuring stateful switchover, the active and standby WLCs synchronize critical information, such as AP and client databases, to ensure a seamless transition.
