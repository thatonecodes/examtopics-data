For asynchronous calls, the response to the API call is returned immediately with a polling URL while the request continues to be processed. In heavier load conditions, it can be more efficient to submit multiple async calls and periodically check the status than to wait for each call to complete before submitting the next one.\nhttps://developer.cisco.com/docs/packaged-contact-center/#!synchronous-vs-asynchronous-writes/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-writes","timestamp":"1727974260.0","poster":"sawdog20","comment_id":"1188774"}],"timestamp":"2024-04-03 18:51:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/137837-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-494-discussion/","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\n\nDrag and drop the common API styles from the left onto the requirement on the right.\n\n//IMG//","exam_id":291,"isMC":false,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1712163060,"question_id":436,"answer":"","answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-901/image220.png"],"answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-901/image221.png"]},{"id":"YU5eF0G7DkXFrxxX7ofU","question_text":"What is a characteristic of Agile software development compared to the Waterfall method?","exam_id":291,"answers_community":["C (75%)","D (25%)"],"choices":{"C":"In Agile, development iterations last from one to four weeks whereas the Waterfall method does not utilize iterations.","A":"Agile method values comprehensive documentation whereas Waterfall focuses on working software.","B":"Agile delivers at the end of a linear process whereas in Waterfall each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous phase.","D":"In Agile, code is deployed to production immediately whereas in Waterfall deployment is processed gradually on each cycle."},"answer":"C","question_id":437,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/138017-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-495-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nI vote D for the reasons below,\n\nAgile\nAn iterative, collaborative, and flexible approach that prioritizes customer satisfaction and adaptability. Agile development allows teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and incorporate new ideas and feedback as they arise. Agile projects are divided into achievable iterations, and multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel. Agile development also involves the client throughout the project, which can lead to better understanding and satisfaction.\n\nWaterfall\nA more traditional, linear, and sequential approach that follows a chronological process based on fixed dates, requirements, and outcomes. Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated phases that flow into each other, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. While Waterfall can provide a clear roadmap, stability, and predictability, it can also be rigid and limit flexibility and feedback opportunities.","poster":"cecb9b9","timestamp":"1722194580.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1257019"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1712384460.0","poster":"sandaruwann654","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","comment_id":"1190259"}],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-04-06 08:21:00","unix_timestamp":1712384460},{"id":"v4w5krbElSd3aHHwlJ40","choices":{"A":"cat filename | git diff","D":"git reflog","C":"git blame filename","B":"git log"},"timestamp":"2024-04-03 18:44:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_id":438,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1188771","upvote_count":"1","poster":"sawdog20","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe 'git blame' command shows the revision and author information attached to each line in a given file.
