Furthermore, breaking complex parts in the network based on a modular approach into manageable blocks will optimize the overall network manageability. In other words, from a network design point of view, modularity can promote design simplicity, flexibility, fault isolation, and scalability, as shown in Figure 1-7 [10]. At the same time, modularity reduces operational costs and complexities.\" The diagram shows modularity is the central point.","poster":"vn","timestamp":"1676166300.0","comment_id":"805855"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743272460.0","poster":"Nery","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect answer is A.

O \nDevices on overlay networks are interconnected through logical links, constituting overlay topologies.\nTunnels are established between interconnected overlay devices.
