Cisco Umbrella on-premises deployments do not require an agent to be installed on the endpoint.\n\nThe firewall is good for blocking inbound threats, but consider threats that originate inside the network. These threats cannot be stopped by perimeter security because they are already behind the firewall.\n\nCisco Umbrella can block client connections at the application layer, regardless of network connection or perimeter security, by preventing the client from resolving DNS for the remote destination. If the client cannot resolve DNS for the remote destination, it cannot establish a connection and download the malware. Cisco Umbrella can be used to prevent connections to malicious websites or to websites that violate corporate security policy."},{"poster":"ThePokemonNuzlockingMaster","comment_id":"600978","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDefinitely Umbrella","timestamp":"1731485220.0"},{"poster":"anonymous1966","timestamp":"1729719300.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"590809","content":"Selected Answer: C\nKeyWord = domain\n\nUmbrella blocks access to malicious domains, URLs, IPs, and files. The system looks at the nature of any DNS requests and takes an action based on its threat intelligence, which is a large-scale repository of historical data about threats. In turn, Umbrella is building models that classify requests so that you build on its threat intelligence. These requests can be safe and allowed, malicious and blocked, or deemed \"risky\" and sent to a proxy for deeper inspection."},{"comment_id":"571693","timestamp":"1726838340.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"anagy11","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think it should be C - Umbrella but I think Firepower can also do that sort of deny action"},{"comment_id":"564905","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nUmbrella works with URLs and Firepower with ACLs. https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cloud-security/#!enforcement-introduction-overview/overview","poster":"sds85","timestamp":"1725980940.0"},{"timestamp":"1720938720.0","poster":"king_ragnar","comment_id":"523431","content":"Why not Umbrella?","upvote_count":"4"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1642149120,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"0PBAThaPqLaQsWRG3h1t","exam_id":291,"question_text":"Why is refactoring done during test-driven development?","answer":"B","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":44,"discussion":[{"poster":"aplicacion101","comment_id":"670254","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1726427880.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://methodpoet.com/refactoring-in-tdd/\nThe goal is to get the initial messy code into a state where you can easily add new features and write new tests.
