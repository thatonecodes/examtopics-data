This is commonly seen in Layer-3 routed networks.\nAsymmetric routing is when a packet returns on a patch that is different from a path that the traffic was sent. This can be seen in normal situations when there are multiple paths to/from a destination. It can also be seen in misconfiguration situations such as a server having two NIC's for load balancing and it's instead routing between them.","topic":"1","question_text":"In which scenario can asymmetric routing occur?","timestamp":"2019-10-15 03:36:00","question_id":22,"unix_timestamp":1571103360,"discussion":[{"poster":"freis_rjo","comment_id":"29101","content":"the correct answer is B","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1576165620.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"it can occur in an \"active-active\" setup regardless of the device and can be mitigated.\nB can be an active-standby VRRP redundant setup.","comment_id":"21470","timestamp":"1573727580.0","poster":"Penn"},{"content":"the correct answer is B, active/active firewall not cause the issue if they not keep session state of connections","poster":"ReikiDude","comment_id":"15323","timestamp":"1571103360.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"redundant routers running VRRP","A":"active/active firewall setup","D":"single path in and out of the network","C":"active/standby firewall setup"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/6608-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-211-discussion/","exam_id":296,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[]},{"id":"LtNoyJxcK9llg1ZuObds","discussion":[{"poster":"Bastex","comment_id":"11388","timestamp":"1568707560.0","content":"OK. I agree now that correct answer is C.\n\nTCP MSS as described earlier takes care of fragmentation at the two endpoints of a TCP connection, but it does not handle the case where there is a smaller MTU link in the middle between these two endpoints. PMTUD was developed in order to avoid fragmentation in the path between the endpoints. It is used to dynamically determine the lowest MTU along the path from a packet's source to its destination.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/25885-pmtud-ipfrag.html#anc6","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1567847220.0","comment_id":"10029","poster":"Bastex","content":"B\n\nThe way MSS now works is that each host will first compare its outgoing interface MTU with its own buffer and choose the lowest value as the MSS to send. The hosts will then compare the MSS size received against their own interface MTU and again choose the lower of the two values.\nScenario 2 illustrates this additional step taken by the sender in order to avoid fragmentation on the local and remote wires. Notice how the MTU of the outgoing interface is taken into account by each host (before the hosts send each other their MSS values) and how this helps to avoid fragmentation.\nIn Scenario 2, fragmentation does not occur at the endpoints of a TCP connection because both outgoing interface MTUs are taken into account by the hosts. Packets can still become fragmented in the network between Router A and Router B if they encounter a link with a lower MTU than that of either hosts' outbound interface.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/25885-pmtud-ipfrag.html#anc3"}],"timestamp":"2019-09-07 11:07:00","question_text":"Which feature can mitigate fragmentation issues within network segments that are between GRE endpoints?","exam_id":296,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/4849-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-212-discussion/","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_id":23,"unix_timestamp":1567847220,"choices":{"C":"PMTU","B":"TCP MSS","D":"ICMP DF bit","A":"TCP Flow Control"},"question_images":[],"answer":"C","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"0G32W00mCiohbWR3nPTW","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"Explanation","exam_id":296,"answer":"Explanation","unix_timestamp":1574912700,"question_text":"After reviewing the EVN configuration, a network administrator notices that a predefined EVN, which is known as \"vnet global\", was configured.
