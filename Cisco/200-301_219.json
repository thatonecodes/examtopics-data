Its in the name \"software.\" \n API's= Application Programming Interface. = software\nREST API's = isn't a specific API but a set of rules for API's \nSDKs= Software Development Kits\n\nEnabling software to allow for external applications defiantly makes it more \"extensible\" (able to be extended). The traditional device management seemed to really want to keep things proprietary, or at least attempt a push in that direction. It appears now that Cisco knows it needs to adapt and allow for 3rd party devices/applications so that it can remain competitive.","timestamp":"1668116640.0","upvote_count":"11","poster":"Networknovice","comment_id":"599749"},{"comment_id":"1183699","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA & C are correct","timestamp":"1727385360.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nMakes sense coz sdks supply apis for software development projects","poster":"kalitwol","timestamp":"1727325000.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1183078"},{"content":"Chat GPT is actually right in this instance:\nwhile option D is a valid feature of Cisco DNA Center, it’s important to note that the question specifically asked for capabilities that make Cisco DNA Center more extensible. While modularity does provide benefits, it doesn’t necessarily make the system more extensible in the same way that REST APIs and SDKs do, as these allow for interaction with external applications and third-party network equipment respectively.

REST APIs: Traditional campus device management relied on vendor-specific protocols and interfaces, limiting extensibility. Cisco DNA Center's open REST APIs allow external applications and tools to easily integrate and interact with network data, enabling automation, custom workflows, and deeper network insights.\n\nD. Modular design: DNA Center's modular architecture allows adding new functionalities through additional applications and integrations. Unlike monolithic systems, this modularity enables customization and adaptation to specific needs without replacing the entire platform, making it future-proof and more extensible.\n\nOption C is incorrect because SDKs that support interaction with third-party network equipment is not a capability that makes Cisco DNA Center more extensible as compared to traditional campus device management.","comment_id":"1156032","timestamp":"1724286720.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Darkar","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nGiven are correct","timestamp":"1724247960.0","comment_id":"1155658"}],"timestamp":"2022-05-10 21:44:00","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which two capabilities of Cisco DNA Center make it more extensible as compared to traditional campus device management?
