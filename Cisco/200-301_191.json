So QoS helps minimize packet loss by prioritizing the delivery of voice packets over less time-sensitive data.\nAlso QoS enables the prioritization of critical traffic over less time-sensitive data. \nFor example, voice and video traffic can be given higher priority to maintain call clarity and video quality. This ensures that essential services continue to function smoothly, even in the face of network congestion.","comment_id":"1182047","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"1156806","content":"I'd say C","timestamp":"1708648620.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"kyut99"},{"poster":"a67c04a","timestamp":"1707432240.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt´s C","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1145083"},{"timestamp":"1702063080.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1091296","content":"It's a difficult one.\n\nB is true because QoS does indeed reduce packet loss for voice traffic since you can assign them to a priority class that minimizes their chance of being dropped such as using CoS 5 or DSCP EF markings. This means they're less likely to be dropped in times of congestion, or will be assigned to a higher priority queue in PQ/LLQ setups.\n\nHowever, the question asks about \"optimization\", and in that respect I lean toward C. Packet loss alone is only one of three important variables in voice traffic quality; the other two being jitter and delay.\n\nDifferentiation of voice and video traffic facilitates optimization of all three of these criteria. Video traffic is bandwidth-intensive, and so differentiating it from voice traffic may involve placing voice traffic into a strict priority queue where it's sent from the interface immediately, thereby ensuring all three reliability and quality criteria are met for voice traffic."},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1068033","timestamp":"1699729200.0","content":"Packet loss is acceptable that is why it uses udp and also uses platinum Qos","poster":"lxxxxxxxxx"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"NewJeans","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDon't think too much. the question is about QoS which can prioritize voice traffic over any other traffics.

Horley has also written an excellent book, Practical IPv6 for Windows Administrators.\n\nL Flag and Global ID\nULA addresses have the prefix fc00::/7, or the first 7 bits as 1111 110x. As shown in Figure 4-10, the eighth bit (x) is known as the L flag, or the local flag, and it can be either 0 or 1. This means that the ULA address range is divided into two parts:\n\nfc00::/8 (1111 1100): When the L flag is set to 0, may be defined in the future.\n\nfd00::/8 (1111 1101): When the L flag is set to 1, the address is locally assigned.\n\nBecause the only legitimate value for the L flag is 1, the only valid ULA addresses today are in the fd00::/8 prefix.\n\nAnother difference between ULA addresses and private IPv4 addresses is that ULA addresses can also be globally unique. This is helpful for ensuring that there won’t be any conflicts when combining two sites using ULA addresses or just in case they get leaked out into the Internet.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"splashy","comment_id":"675108","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think it's about range -> where do the 1's stop\n\n11111100 FC00::/6 does not exclude FD\n11111101 FD00::/8 excludes everything below FD\n\nNetacad 7.02 Module 1 12.3.4\nUnique local addresses range fc00::/7 to fdff::/7 ...\n\nsorry for double post.","timestamp":"1663761780.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"675106","content":"I think it's about range -> where do the 1's stop\n\n11111100 FC00::/6 does not exclude FD\n11111101 FD00::/8 excludes everything below FD \n\nNetacad 7.02 Module 1 12.3.4\nUnique local addresses range fc00::/7 to fdff::/7 ...","timestamp":"1663761720.0","poster":"splashy"},{"comment_id":"667586","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D","timestamp":"1663035300.0","poster":"shubhambala","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is D.
