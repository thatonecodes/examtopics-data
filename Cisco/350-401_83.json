When OSPF is running on a given loopback interface, it sees the network type of \"LOOPBACK\" and it knows that it can not establish an adjacency through that loopback interface with another router so it advertises that loopback as a host route or the only IP address on that logical interface. As Martin explained so nicely you can tell OSPF that it is not a loopback and it is a point-to-point network type, and OSPF says \"OK I am going to advertise the interface with its correct mask\". In MPLS environment where OSPF is the IGP in the core, and you have configured the loopback interface of the PE router with a /24 mask, you can have some problems, because there is a discrepancy, the loopbackâs mask is 24 but OSPF is advertising a mask of /32.
