Directly connected neighbor (the 2nd router) gets this Update message and compares its receiving interface bandwidth with the value present in Update message --> lowest is used in formula from receiving router point of view. This second router also computes sum of its interface delay and delay present in Update message --> result is used in formula from receiving router point of view.\n\nBesides, using these 2 values (sum of delay and lowest bandwidth) in local route computation, router sends these values to its own neighbors","poster":"abrahamtas","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"19178","timestamp":"1572878700.0"},{"comment_id":"9307","timestamp":"1567423140.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Bastex","content":"The right answer is B"}]},{"id":"Zv1qNN16GCCKfkyskGjg","answer":"E","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/4560-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-726-discussion/","timestamp":"2019-09-02 13:30:00","exam_id":296,"answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"E","unix_timestamp":1567423800,"discussion":[{"poster":"Roxy","content":"B is the correct answer","comment_id":"43624","timestamp":"1580199540.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Bastex","comment_id":"9308","content":"B\n\nWhen the IP SLAs responder is enabled, it allows the target device to take time stamps when the packet arrives on the interface at interrupt level and again just as it is leaving, eliminating the processing time.
