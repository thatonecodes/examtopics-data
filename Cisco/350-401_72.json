In this case, you want to import the manager class from the ncclient library. The correct import statement is:\n'from ncclient import manager'\n\nOption B: import manager\nThis option is incorrect because it does not specify the module 'ncclient' to import 'manager.' Python would not recognize 'manager' without its module.\nOption C: 'from ncclient import *'\nThis imports all public attributes from the 'ncclient' library, which is not ideal for clarity and can lead to potential conflicts.
