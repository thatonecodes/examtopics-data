This enables parallel execution of tasks, enhancing performance and efficiency.\n\nSimilarly, NETCONF supports asynchronous operations through the use of notifications and subscriptions. Notifications allow the device to send asynchronous updates to the client about specific events or conditions, while subscriptions enable the client to receive ongoing updates about changes in device state. This asynchronous capability allows for efficient handling of events and notifications without blocking the execution of other tasks.\n\nTherefore, both NX-API and NETCONF meet the requirement for supporting asynchronous requests.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714399620.0","poster":"dkhenderson2"}],"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1687834860.0","comment_id":"934986"}],"comment_id":"875988"},{"comment_id":"1415174","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB & E\nI think the key to this questions is the requirement that Ansible be used.

HTTPS\nAnalysis: HTTPS is an encrypted version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS to secure data in transit. It serves as the transport protocol for APIs like NX-API or RESTCONF on NX-OS switches. While not a standalone access mechanism, it’s a critical component enabling encrypted communication. Ansible can use HTTPS as the transport layer for NX-API or NETCONF, satisfying the encryption requirement. However, HTTPS alone doesn’t define asynchronous support—it depends on the underlying protocol (e.g., NX-API or NETCONF).\n\nFit: Meets encrypted transport but is not a complete access mechanism; requires pairing with NX-API or NETCONF.","poster":"Pina7","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"williamluo","timestamp":"1732770480.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1319025","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nNETCONF supports encrypted transport using SSH and can handle asynchronous requests."},{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1194400","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nThe correct answers are: B. NX-API and C. HTTPS\n\nExplanation:\nTo meet the requirements of automating configurations on a Cisco NX-OS switch using Ansible, with encryption and support for asynchronous requests, the best options are:\n\nNX-API (B): NX-API (NXOS API) is Cisco's application programming interface for NX-OS based devices, which allows for commands to be sent to Cisco switches and responses to be received in a structured format such as JSON or XML. NX-API supports the use of HTTPS as its transport protocol, ensuring the encryption requirement is met. It also provides the capability to make calls and receive responses asynchronously.\n\nHTTPS (C): HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server. Using HTTPS as the transport protocol for NX-API ensures that the communication is encrypted, addressing the security requirement specified in the scenario. HTTPS is commonly used with NX-API to secure the data in transit.","timestamp":"1712934900.0"},{"comment_id":"910974","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nNX-API uses HTTP/HTTPS as its transport. CLIs are encoded into the HTTP/HTTPS POST body. Starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2 (1), the NX-API feature is enabled by default on HTTPS port 443. HTTP port 80 is disabled.
