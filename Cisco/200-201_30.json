The inspection takes place in real-time and in-line with the traffic flow.\n\nTraffic mirroring - Traffic mirroring, also known as port mirroring or SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer), is a technique for forwarding a copy of network traffic to a monitoring device.

This is a typical scenario for IDS/IPS monitoring, as they are designed to detect suspicious activity within the network perimeter.\nScanning activity: The incident involves suspicious scanning, which aligns with the core function of IDS/IPS. They actively monitor network traffic for patterns and signatures indicative of reconnaissance or scanning attempts by potential attackers.\nLog detail: The image showcases a specific log format with timestamps, connection details, protocols, and potential threats.
