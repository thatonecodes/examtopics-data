As pfunky states, we can have up to 8 routes, meaning that C is a \"valid\" answer. The reason E is incorrect is that we cannot configure NSF for BGPv4 - we can only configure graceful restart, which relies on info from NSF capable/aware devices. For OSPF however, we can configure a device to be fully NSF capable/aware.
