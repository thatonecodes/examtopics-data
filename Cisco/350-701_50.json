Endpoint protection cannot open a password protected archive. Endpoint protection does not do signature based application control. you can create application block lists and allow lists using file hashes, but no signature based application control that Im aware of. Inspecting encrypted files can be done at the network level, but it is not optimal. it consumes way too much firewall CPU and can be impractical. Also, some encrypted sites implement certificate pinning and client side validation and therefore network decryption will appear as a man in the middle and fail. Endpoint protection is the recommended solution for inspecting encrypted traffic.","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1673658660.0"},{"poster":"kloug","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1304554","content":"Answer c","timestamp":"1730219700.0"},{"poster":"Abu_Muhammad","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThanks DWizard \nExcellent illustration.","comment_id":"1241655","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720040400.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1168747","timestamp":"1709896680.0","poster":"4pelos","content":"Correct answer D.\nChecked in securitytut"},{"poster":"petestudies","timestamp":"1702767480.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI like C, application control the key I would for endpoint protection.","comment_id":"1098524"},{"comment_id":"953550","poster":"fdl543","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC Performing signature-based application control (executable hash used to block application).

B is nonsense, A can be done at the network level (ETA, SSL decrytion) so you don't need an endpoint solution for that, and C can also be achieved by an IPS, so again, you don't need an endpoint solution, but if a malicious file is zipped and password-protected, it will bypass most of the security controls, only an endpoint protection solution will detect it and stop it at the moment of execution.","poster":"DWizard","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThought C initially, but agree with bigblob that it's actually D per their reasoning.
