Which additional task allows the two switches to establish an LACP port channel?\"\n\nThat said:\n- SW1 has the channel-group locked in with mode on.\n- SW2 has the channel-group configured to LACP mode active.\n- For LACP EtherChannel to work, either:\n - Both sides need to be mode on (change SW2 to mode on) – this isn’t an option. Or,\n - LACP allows “active” and “passive”. SW1 should be changed to either of these for it to work.\n For that reason, the correct answer is option ‘b’.\nNote:\n- Had PAgP been selected, the modes are “auto” and “desirable”."},{"comment_id":"1007403","content":"Any1 giving ccna in a short time...pls get in touch in insta @abdullahatharali","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1710414480.0","poster":"[Removed]"},{"timestamp":"1701870060.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"916190","content":"B is the correct answer.
