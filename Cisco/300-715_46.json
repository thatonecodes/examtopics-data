For the cold migration feature to be functional, the following condition must be met:\n\n Cisco ISE must be shutdown and powered off: Cisco ISE does not allow to stop or pause the database operations during migration. This might lead to data corruption issues. Hence, ensure that Cisco ISE is not running and active during the migration.\n\nDeploying Cisco ISE virtual appliances using the OVF templates ensures that adequate resources are assigned to each VM. If you do not use OVF templates, then ensure that you assign the equivalent resource reservations when you manually install Cisco ISE using the ISO image. \n\n Cisco ISE VM does not support hot migration (vMotion).\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-0/install_guide/b_ise_InstallationGuide30/b_ise_InstallationGuide30_chapter_2.html"}],"unix_timestamp":1742087880,"timestamp":"2025-03-16 02:18:00","isMC":true,"question_id":229,"question_images":[],"exam_id":315},{"id":"Mq4yElNereATQQ7h63yI","choices":{"D":"authorization policy","B":"authorization profile","C":"authentication profile","A":"authentication policy"},"answer_images":[],"question_id":230,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (89%)","11%"],"question_text":"What gives Cisco ISE an option to scan endpoints for vulnerabilities?","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-10-13 02:20:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/64026-exam-300-715-topic-1-question-35-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1123072","content":"my choice is B\nThe authorization profile in Cisco ISE now includes an option to scan endpoints for vulnerabilities.
