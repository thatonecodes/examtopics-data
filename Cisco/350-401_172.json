It enables customers to configure and control access points (AP) in a branch or remote office from the corporate office through a wide area network (WAN) link without deploying a controller in each office. The FlexConnect access points can switch client data traffic locally and perform client authentication locally when their connection to the controller is lost. When they are connected to the controller, they can also send traffic back to the controller. In the connected mode, the FlexConnect access point can also perform local authentication. \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config-guide/b_cg85/flexconnect.html","poster":"9e3f1c5"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","comment_id":"1218234","timestamp":"1716635820.0","poster":"[Removed]"},{"comment_id":"1162335","upvote_count":"1","poster":"cloud29","timestamp":"1709195040.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct"},{"timestamp":"1705844580.0","comment_id":"1127848","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Forwarding for locally switched traffic continues when the AP loses connectivity to the WLC.\n\nIn FlexConnect mode, the access point (AP) is capable of locally switching user traffic and forwarding it directly to the destination without the need to tunnel the traffic back to the wireless LAN controller (WLC). This allows for efficient utilization of network resources and helps to reduce latency. If the AP loses connectivity to the WLC, it can still forward locally switched traffic, providing continuity for user data forwarding even in case of a temporary disconnection from the controller.","poster":"teems5uk","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Hello Moderators, it would be kind if you could offer the Cisco documentation where the answer you chose exists.

TCAM can perform ternary (three-state) matching, which means it can match on exact values as well as wildcard masks. This capability is particularly useful for routing lookups where variable-length prefixes (subnets) are involved. TCAM is efficient for performing lookups based on both exact matches and prefix matches, making it well-suited for forwarding decisions in routers where variable-length subnet masks are common.\n\nOn the other hand, CAM (Content Addressable Memory), typically used in traditional MAC address tables, performs exact matching and doesn't support wildcard masks for variable-length matches like TCAM does.","poster":"teems5uk"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCAM can only search on exact matches of binary strings.\n\nTCAM, for its part, searches the memory to match the key, like CAM, and can also use a mask to indicate \"don't care\" or wildcard bits.
