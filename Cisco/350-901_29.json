The two main considerations for implementing an observability-driven development lifecycle are choosing the appropriate monitoring tools and determining the relevant metrics to expose. Monitoring tools are necessary to collect and analyze data from the various components of the application, while relevant metrics provide insight into the application's behavior. The other options mentioned in the question are not directly related to an observability-driven development lifecycle but they could be important in other stages of the development or after the release.","poster":"[Removed]"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC and D, from Cisco Study guide page 20: \"Three pillars of observability are logs, metrics and tracing...
