RESTCONF is a standard protocol that provides a programmatic interface for accessing and managing network devices.

With this REST APIs, developers and users can communciate with DNA Center. On Southbound interface, DNA Center uses various protocols like RESTCONF, NETCONF etc. With this interface, DNA Center can communciate with the devices it manages. Under this interface there are both the devices that support SDN protocols like NETCONF, RESTCONF etc. and traditional devices that support SNMP,Telnet, SSH.\nNorthbound interface specification consists of an XML DTD (data definition dictionary) specification that defines the data format to be exchanged between external applications and the Java API. The Northbound client application retrieves network topology and configuration through the Northbound Interface as XML data.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"masrur","comment_id":"1210317"},{"comment_id":"1184616","poster":"KZM","timestamp":"1727502660.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRESTCONF","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1177982","timestamp":"1726807680.0","poster":"Marcinko","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI don't have a deep knowlede on automation but my choice would be B based on:\nnorthbound interface (intent API) which use REST API based on HTTP has the message body in JSON or XML format.\nThe southbound interface (SDK) uses NETCONF and RESTCONF to communicate with the devices\nhttps://ipcisco.com/lesson/cisco-dna-center/"},{"comment_id":"1175062","content":"The answer is C:\nIf you scroll up the questions you will find that.","poster":"Haidary","timestamp":"1726494480.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1725985140.0","comment_id":"1170528","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBoth Cisco DNA Center and vManage utilize RESTCONF for their northbound APIs, allowing them to provide a programmatic interface for managing and configuring network devices.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"slacker_at_work"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
