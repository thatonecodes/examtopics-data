Write a test: Write a test that tests for the new class or function that you want to add to your code. Think about the class name and structure you will need in order to call the new capability that doesn’t exist yet—and nothing more.\nStep 2. Test fails: Of course, the test fails because you haven’t written the part that works yet. The idea here is to think about the class or function you want and test for its intended output. This initial test failure shows you exactly where you should focus your code writing to get it to pass. This is like starting with your end state in mind, which is the most effective way to accomplish a goal.\nStep 3. Write some code: Write only the code needed to make the new function or class successfully pass. This is about efficiency and focus.\nStep 4. Test passes: The test now passes, and the code works.\nStep 5. Refactor: Clean up the code as necessary, removing any test stubs or hard-coded variables used in testing.

The basic pattern of TDD is a five-step, repeating process:\n\n- Create a new test (adding it to existing tests, if they already exist). The idea here is to capture some requirement of the unit of application code you want to produce.\n- Run tests to see if any fail for unexpected reasons. If this happens, correct the tests. Note that expected failures, here, are acceptable (for example, if your new test fails because the function it is designed to test does not yet exist, that is an acceptable failure at this point).\n- Write application code to pass the new test. The rule here is to add nothing more to the application besides what is required to pass the test.\n- Run tests to see if any fail. If they do, correct the application code and try again.\n- Refactor and improve application code.

Version control can protect your code by allowing changes to be checked in (through a process known as a code commit) to a hierarchical tree structure of folders with files in them. You often don’t know what a developer might need to change or has changed, but the version control system does. Each check-in is tagged with who made the change and what the person changed within the code. Instead of using inefficient techniques such as file locking, a version control system handles concurrent check-ins, allowing two programmers to commit code at the same time. [..] Another aspect of a version control system is the ability to branch and merge code built independently. This is very useful if you are writing code on a part of an application that could conflict with another part written by another team.\nPage 170 CCNA DevNet (DEVASC) - 200-901","upvote_count":"4","poster":"designated","timestamp":"1727422680.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nBenefits of version control systems.
