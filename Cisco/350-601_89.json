Most multicast networks have a couple of sources and many receivers. Bidirectional PIM has been invented for networks where we have many sources and receivers talking to each other. An example of this is videoconferencing where it's not just 1 source with many listeners but all the participants are communicating with each other.\nThe downside of using PIM sparse mode with many active sources and receivers is that we will see many mroute state entries that can take quite some resources. Using PIM sparse mode the RP builds 2 entries:\n(*,G)\n(S,G)\nWhen we use PIM bidirectional mode the RP will never build a (S,G) entry and we only allow the (*,G) entry for the shared tree.
