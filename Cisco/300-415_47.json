The vBond orchestrator plays a role in initial authentication and bootstrapping of WAN Edge routers but does not rely on TLOC extensions for IPsec tunnel creation.\n\nD.

These additional transport interfaces provide hardware-level transport redundancy at the local site. By configuring TLOC extensions, you can create redundant transport paths, allowing the WAN Edge router to switch to an alternate transport interface in case the primary one fails.\n\nRedundancy at the transport level ensures high availability and fault tolerance for the SD-WAN overlay network. If one transport interface becomes unavailable, the SD-WAN traffic can automatically failover to the alternate transport interface, ensuring continuous connectivity and minimizing downtime.\n\nThe other options do not accurately represent the main purpose of TLOC extensions:","comment_id":"964847","timestamp":"1706376000.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"NetArch_Teck","content":"Option [A]\n\nTLOC Extensions allows a WAN edge router to communicate over the WAN transport (connected to the adjacent WAN Edge router) through a TLOC-extension interface\n\nCisco Guide:-\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/sd-wan/220333-configure-layer-3-tloc-extension.html#:~:text=The%20TLOC%20extension%20allows%20a,have%20redundancy%20on%20transport%20side.","timestamp":"1706025060.0","comment_id":"960482"}],"topic":"1"},{"id":"kvPunElLVvdgWs32DCTJ","question_text":"Which control policy assigned to branches in the out direction establishes a strict hub-and-spoke topology for VPN2?","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"","B":"","A":"","D":""},"answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":304,"unix_timestamp":1689834300,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/115815-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-315-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Those who say A is correct , then what about sequence 20 in it?\nWhy for God sake it is out there?\nI am asking myself what I am paying for ...","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1730711760.0","comment_id":"1306854","poster":"mikidvd51"},{"poster":"Rcont","timestamp":"1720117440.0","comment_id":"1242240","content":"Why C and D are not right?","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1116155","timestamp":"1704660840.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Knowledge33","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A. \n\nCompare to the example here:\nhttps://www.networkacademy.io/ccie-enterprise/sdwan/lab1-restricting-spoke-to-spoke-tunnels"},{"comment_id":"1077399","upvote_count":"1","poster":"S__i__D","content":"Selected Answer: A\nStrict HnS topology for VPN2 - means no Spoke-to-Spoke communication even through Hub.
