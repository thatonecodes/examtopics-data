The lldp reinit command is used to set the delay time for reinitializing LLDP information after an interface has gone down and come back up. By default, this delay time is set to 2 seconds. To configure it to 5 seconds, you would enter the command lldp reinit 5.\n\nOption A, lldp timer 5000, sets the interval at which LLDP packets are sent, measured in seconds.\n\nOption B, lldp holdtime 5, sets the amount of time a device should retain information received from its neighbors before discarding it, measured in seconds.\n\nOption C, lldp reinit 5000, sets the delay time for reinitializing LLDP information, but the value is in milliseconds, not seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, lldp reinit 5.","upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1680363480.0","comment_id":"858059"},{"poster":"xtraMiles","timestamp":"1721545380.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI would have picked B if the word \"delay\" in the question was followed by the phrase \"before discarding\". The thing is, I don't consider hold time as being a delay in this case. If anything, it is a form of retention (holding on to it no matter how short). You can shorten the hold time to 5 seconds, sure, but it's not delaying anything. You're actually advancing the clock by speeding up the process and telling the protocol to hurry up and discard that 5 second-old record.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1252283"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nit´s D","timestamp":"1710376440.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1172996","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nIthink its D","comment_id":"1007294","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1694673180.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"nzieno","content":"Answer is D. reinit Delay (in sec) for LLDP initialization on any interface","comment_id":"977463","timestamp":"1691659500.0"},{"poster":"Iamm","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect answer","comment_id":"949148","timestamp":"1689093120.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nit's D","comment_id":"806678","timestamp":"1676227320.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"iMo7ed"},{"comment_id":"783681","poster":"sol_ls95","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1674327300.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nd correct answer"}],"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Which command should you enter to configure an LLDP delay time of 5 seconds?","timestamp":"2023-01-21 19:55:00","exam_id":288,"answer":"D","question_id":516,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (69%)","B (31%)"],"choices":{"A":"lldp timer 5000","D":"lldp reinit 5","C":"lldp reinit 5000","B":"lldp holdtime 5"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/96385-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-205-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1674327300,"question_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"purpCygvUj7UQLqBzByD","question_id":517,"unix_timestamp":1609906680,"timestamp":"2021-01-06 05:18:00","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"72","comments":[{"content":"According to 4aynick who tested it through GNS3 and the CISCO documentation, answer B is correct, perhaps in Packet Tracer there is indeed this limitation, but it should include the ip address of another interface in an example of a #show cdp neighbors detail command, which does not happen leaving the ip address field empty (as I tested), but in GNS3 it manages to acquire the ip address of another interface (as mentioned by 4aynick), as well as also mentions the CISCO documentation, in this case, taking this into account limitation of Packet Tracer, I agree with answer B “updates the ip address of another interface”.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/cdp/configuration/15-mt/cdp-15-mt-book/nm-cdp-discover.html#:~:text=Restrictions%20for%20Using%20Cisco%20Discovery%20Protocol,-Cisco%20Discovery%20Protocol&text=Cisco%20Discovery%20Protocol%20is%20not,the%20non%2DIP%20address%20interface","upvote_count":"4","comments":[{"timestamp":"1743886620.0","poster":"Lovesly","comment_id":"1550591","upvote_count":"1","content":"B is correct.
