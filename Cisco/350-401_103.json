In IOS, the ip_input process runs on the general-purpose CPU for processing incoming IP packets. Process switching is the fallback for CEF because it is dedicated to processing punted IP packets when they cannot be switched by CEF.\n\nCisco Express Forwarding (CEF) \nis a Cisco proprietary switching mechanism developed to keep up with the demands of evolving network infrastructures. It has been the default switching mechanism on most Cisco platforms that do all their packet switching using the general-purpose CPU (software-based routers) since the 1990s, and it is the default switching mechanism used by all Cisco platforms that use specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and network processing units (NPUs) for high packet throughput (hardware-based routers).","comments":[{"poster":"PureInertiaCopy","content":"This is from the OCG. \nENCOR 350-401","comment_id":"983077","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1692224640.0"}],"comment_id":"983075"},{"content":"What is wrong with these people publishing the answers?\nSince when is CEF related to software and CPU?","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"966672","poster":"danman32","timestamp":"1690670280.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Given answer is incorrect.
