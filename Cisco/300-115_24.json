It has these special characteristics: All traffic in the RSPAN VLAN is always flooded.No MAC address learning occurs on the RSPAN VLAN.RSPAN VLAN traffic only flows on trunk ports.RSPAN VLANs must be configured in VLAN configuration mode by using the remote-span VLAN configuration mode command.STP can run on RSPAN VLAN trunks but not on SPAN destination ports.An RSPAN VLAN cannot be a private-VLAN primary or secondary VLAN.For VLANs 1 to 1005 that are visible to VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), the VLAN ID and its associated RSPAN characteristic are propagated by VTP. If you assign an RSPAN VLAN ID in the extended VLAN range (1006 to 4094), you must manually configure all intermediate switches.It is normal to have multiple RSPAN VLANs in a network at the same time with each RSPAN VLAN defining a network-wide RSPAN session. That is, multiple RSPAN source sessions anywhere in the network can contribute packets to the RSPAN session. It is also possible to have multiple RSPAN destination sessions throughout the network, monitoring the same RSPAN VLAN and presenting traffic to the user. The RSPAN VLAN ID separates the sessions.Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/ guide/3750xscg/ swspan.html","poster":"robergalvan","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2019-02-03 15:27:00"},{"id":"wY0nfW2T2Nk9ndxqaZgf","isMC":true,"question_id":118,"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":297,"question_text":"Which two restrictions of the port security feature are true?
