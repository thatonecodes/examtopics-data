When two connected ports are configured in dynamic mode, and at least one of the ports is configured as desirable, the two switches will negotiate the formation of a trunk across the link. DTP isn’t to be confused with VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), although the VTP domain does come into play."}],"unix_timestamp":1561825380,"timestamp":"2019-06-29 18:23:00","answers_community":[],"answer":"A","question_id":101,"exam_id":284,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/2069-exam-200-105-topic-1-question-54-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which statement about DTP is true?","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"It uses the native VLAN.","D":"It sends data on VLAN 1.","C":"It uses desirable mode by default.","B":"It negotiates a trunk link after VTP has been configured."},"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"Nm5rr1D062z00uTfBj8Z","answer_images":[],"exam_id":284,"question_text":"Which IEEE standard does PVST+ use to tunnel information?","answer":"B","isMC":true,"question_id":102,"choices":{"D":"802.1s","C":"802.1w","B":"802.1q","A":"802.1x"},"timestamp":"2019-11-15 14:58:00","answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/8281-exam-200-105-topic-1-question-56-discussion/","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"DasCert","timestamp":"1581481980.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"49372","content":"PVST+ uses a tunnel with PVST+ to a Mono Spanning Tree (the old 802.1s, nowadays by Multiple Spanning Tree).\n\nhttp://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=102157&seqNum=4\nCisco developed PVST+ to allow running several STP instances, even over an 802.1Q network by using a tunneling mechanism. PVST+ utilizes Cisco devices to connect to a Mono Spanning Tree zone, typically another vendor's 802.1Q-based network, to a PVST+ zone, typically a Cisco ISL-based network. No specific configuration is needed to achieve this. PVST+ provides support for 802.1Q trunks and the mapping of multiple spanning trees to the single spanning tree of standard 802.1Q switches running Mono Spanning Tree","comments":[{"poster":"DasCert","content":"My mistake!
