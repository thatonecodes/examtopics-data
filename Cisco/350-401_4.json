Both rely on a declarative approach.\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\n\nB. Both are used for mutable infrastructure: While both Ansible and Chef can be used for mutable infrastructure, they are not exclusively tied to it. They can also be used for immutable infrastructure, depending on the specific use case.\n\nC. Both require a client to be installed on hosts: This is not true for Ansible. Ansible uses a push-based approach, where the control node sends commands to managed nodes using SSH or other protocols. Chef, on the other hand, requires an agent to be installed on managed nodes.\n\nD. Both rely on NETCONF: NETCONF is a configuration management protocol primarily used for network devices. Neither Ansible nor Chef relies on NETCONF for their core functionalities.\n\nTherefore, the common trait between Ansible and Chef is their use of a declarative approach. This means that you define the desired state of your infrastructure, and the tools will automatically make the necessary changes to achieve that state.","comment_id":"1301972","poster":"cjoyce1980","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Beehurls","timestamp":"1730841780.0","comment_id":"1307575","content":"Ansible uses a procedural programming approach to define the steps needed to reach a desired state.
