Hereâ€™s why:\n\nRRC Templates:\nRRC templates define how radio resources are allocated for Media Stream sessions. The medium template is designed to provide a balance between resource allocation and user capacity, making it suitable for guaranteeing a minimum of 2 Mbps per user.\n\nWhy Medium?:\nThe medium template ensures that sufficient bandwidth is reserved for Media Stream sessions while still allowing other users to access the network.
