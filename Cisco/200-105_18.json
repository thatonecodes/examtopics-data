Spanning tree shuts down ports that are in a Port Fast-operational state if any BPDU is received on them. \n\nIn a valid configuration, Port Fast-enabled ports do not receive BPDUs. Receiving a BPDU on a Port Fast-enabled port means an invalid configuration, such as the connection of an unauthorized device, and the BPDU guard feature puts the port in the error-disabled state. When this happens, the switch shuts down the entire port on which the violation occurred.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1568947500.0"},{"content":"I believe it is D but then wrote the answer wrong.
