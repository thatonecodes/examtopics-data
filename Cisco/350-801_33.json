A pair of nodes is required for high availability. Each node has an independent database and set of users operating with a shared availability database that is able to support common users.\n\nAll IM and Presence Service nodes must belong to a presence redundancy group, which can consist of a single IM and Presence Service node or a pair of IM and Presence Service nodes.\n\nYou can configure high availability using two different modes:\n\nBalanced mode: This mode provides redundant high availability with automatic user load balancing and user failover in the event that one nodes fails because of component failure or power outage.\n\nActive/standby mode: The standby node automatically takes over for the active node if the active node fails.
