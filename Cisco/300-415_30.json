AD is a locally-significant value on each router and depends on the OS. Different platforms may have different AD values for different protocols. For example, OMP has AD of 250 on vEdges and 251 on cEdges. Additionally, network admins can define floating static routes with various ADs for the same prefix. AD is only compared when the same WAN edge router receives the same site-local prefix from multiple routing protocols.
