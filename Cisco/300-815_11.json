This is a gotcha question about service parameters. Actual confirmation in a production environment using Long Locals with SLRGs pointing to their respective local gateways and standard Service Params. Unless otherwise directed by CSS of the CFA setting or change in the default setting of the Service Parameters \"Clusterwide Parameters (Feature-General) > Local route group for redirected calls> \"Local route group of calling party\". Lab it out and check and do a trace for yourself. This in no way makes Phone B the calling device. Cisco is trying to trick you by only mentioning that Phone B has an SLRG configured. Answer A is misleading but points to the right answer, which is C, Answer B infers that CUCM is an SBC by default throws IP Routing to the way side, Answer D is gibberish.
