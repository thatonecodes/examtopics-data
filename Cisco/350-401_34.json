CEF is made up of two different main components: the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and the Adjacency Table.\nProcess switching is the slowest switching methods (compared to fast switching and Cisco Express Forwarding) because it must find a destination in the routing table. Process switching must also construct a new Layer 2 frame header for every packet. With process switching, when a packet comes in, the scheduler calls a process that examines the routing table, determines which interface the packet should be switched to and then switches the packet.
