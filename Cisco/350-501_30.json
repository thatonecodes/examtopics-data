OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol that maintains a link-state database (LSDB) to ensure consistent network routing. While OSPF can work with NSF to reduce convergence time during failover, simply implementing OSPF does not ensure packet forwarding during the switchover.

NSF requires the routing protocol (like OSPF) to support NSF to avoid re-convergence, but OSPF alone is not sufficient to ensure packet forwarding during the failover.\nD. Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is a key component in maintaining packet forwarding during failovers when NSF is enabled.
