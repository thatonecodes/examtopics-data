When things are mentioned briefly it's harder to remember those very few words as compared to something like OSPF which we spend a lot of time focusing on. My advice to mrsiafu and others is to take handwritten notes. Go through each chapter at least twice. First time do a read through and then go back a second time and outline the important things and things you know you might forget. This way, when you do a review you can focus on what you need instead of doing a full read-through of the chapter again and again.","timestamp":"1636809660.0","upvote_count":"7"}]}]}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/26979-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-627-discussion/","choices":{"B":"TKIP encryption","C":"scrambled encryption key","D":"AES encryption","A":"SAE encryption"},"unix_timestamp":1596096540,"question_text":"Which WPA3 enhancement protects against hackers viewing traffic on the Wi-Fi network?","exam_id":288},{"id":"NEYWATfrEdXtGoWAcpxV","choices":{"C":"router","D":"PC","A":"DHCP client","B":"access point"},"unix_timestamp":1640826840,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/69022-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-628-discussion/","question_id":984,"timestamp":"2021-12-30 02:14:00","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.

With this configuration, all ARP packets entering the network from a given switch bypass the security check. No other validation is needed at any other place in the VLAN or in the network. You configure the trust setting by using the ip arp inspection trust interface configuration command.\n\nLINK: https://content.cisco.com/chapter.sjs?uri=/searchable/chapter/www.cisco.com/content/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SXF/native/configuration/guide/swcg/dynarp.html.xml","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nROUTER !!!","timestamp":"1676278800.0","poster":"AWSEMA","comment_id":"646180"},{"timestamp":"1673051100.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHas to be a network device to be trusted.\n\nAnswer is C","poster":"ratu68","comment_id":"628135","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"AWSEMA","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1672410900.0","content":"router","comment_id":"625249"},{"comment_id":"583621","timestamp":"1665389760.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"snrov","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI swear it is C"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nDefinitly the router.
