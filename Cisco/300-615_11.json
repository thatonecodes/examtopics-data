The range of values is from 1 to 65636, and the default value is 32667. A lower value means that this switch has a better chance to be the primary vPC.\n\nWhen you change the priority of the vPC peer devices, it can cause the interfaces in your network to go up and down. If you want to configure the role priority again to make one vPC device the primary device, configure the role priority on both the primary vPC device with a lower priority value and the secondary vPC device with the higher value. Then, shut down the vPC peer link on both devices and enter the shutdown command, and finally re-enable the port-channel on both devices and enter the no shutdown command.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"BE","answers_community":["AE (50%)","BE (50%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/114003-exam-300-615-topic-1-question-3-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":52,"exam_id":311,"answer_description":"","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
