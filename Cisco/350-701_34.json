MDMs will use the term groups/policies/Group Policy, but it's never going to allow you to manage ADDS GPOs. \n\nWhat I HAVE done though, is use it to remotely manage a fleet of mobile devices and add/remove/monitor those assets, and control the applications on the device.","upvote_count":"25","comment_id":"253602","poster":"bigdadzzz"},{"poster":"j0ej0e","timestamp":"1654192980.0","upvote_count":"12","content":"A an B are correct.","comment_id":"233388"},{"content":"A. Asset inventory management: A Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution provides an organization with the ability to maintain an inventory of all the mobile devices that are being used within the organization. This includes tracking information such as device type, operating system, serial number, and other relevant details. This information helps organizations to manage their mobile device fleet effectively, keep track of devices and ensure they are properly configured and secure.\n\nB. Allowed application management: An MDM solution also enables organizations to control and manage the applications that are installed on the mobile devices being used within the organization. This includes the ability to allow or disallow specific applications, manage updates and upgrades, and enforce security policies around application usage. This helps organizations to maintain a secure and controlled environment for mobile devices and ensure that only approved applications are being used within the network.","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1723175580.0","poster":"sull3y","comment_id":"802874"},{"poster":"MoII","timestamp":"1684682340.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Agree with A and B","comment_id":"483492"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1697363820.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"586268","content":"Completely agree with A/B, however, have you dealt with a sales bod / A/B/C level exec whos mobile isn't working - Their world has come to an end.......","poster":"Smileebloke"}],"comment_id":"202713","content":"I would not call a mobile phone to be a 'critical device management'\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management\n\nSome of the core functions of MDM include:\n\n Ensuring that diverse user equipment is configured to a consistent standard / supported set of applications, functions, or corporate policies\n Updating equipment, applications, functions, or policies in a scalable manner\n Ensuring that users use applications in a consistent and supportable manner\n Ensuring that equipment performs consistently\n Monitoring and tracking equipment (e.g. location, status, ownership, activity)\n Being able to efficiently diagnose and troubleshoot equipment remotely","timestamp":"1650390480.0","poster":"thegreek1","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"FilipNel","content":"The answer is B, E","timestamp":"1647697740.0","comment_id":"182250"},{"comment_id":"138427","content":"i think the correct Answer is B & E","timestamp":"1642578600.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"naddaf"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"K53fli8Bj4V1KbFZA0wz","question_images":[],"answer":"A","topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"to register new laptops and mobile devices","D":"to request a newly provisioned mobile device","C":"to provision userless and agentless systems","B":"to manage and deploy antivirus definitions and patches on systems owned by the end user"},"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/53750-exam-350-701-topic-1-question-252-discussion/","exam_id":327,"question_id":167,"timestamp":"2021-05-29 09:47:00","unix_timestamp":1622274420,"answers_community":["A (67%)","C (33%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1655233500.0","poster":"karmaomar","upvote_count":"18","comment_id":"382088","content":"A is a correct answer \nMy Devices Portal \n\nQ.
