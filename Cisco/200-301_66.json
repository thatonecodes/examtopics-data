It is essentially the name of a wireless network. When multiple access points are used to cover a larger area or provide better coverage, they can be configured with the same ESSID to allow client devices to seamlessly roam between them while maintaining a continuous connection to the network. This helps create a common network for client connections, enabling devices to switch between access points without losing connectivity. The ESSID serves as a way for clients to identify and connect to the desired wireless network. The other options (B, C, and D) do not accurately describe the purpose of an ESSID."}],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1703737800,"timestamp":"2023-12-28 05:30:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_id":326,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/129517-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1291-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"It provides greater security than a standard SSID.","B":"It supports fast roaming features such as 802.11 r, 802.11k, and 802.11v.","A":"It allows multiple access points to provide a common network for client connections.","C":"It serves as the wireless MAC address of the access point."}},{"id":"jMxLonL4bF6R6DGftCJD","exam_id":288,"question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nRefer to the exhibit.
