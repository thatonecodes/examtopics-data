After receiving a frame from a connected device, the controlled access point forwards it to the WLC instead of the destination device. Next, WLC decides whether the received frame should be delivered or discarded based on the security configuration. If the frame is required to be forwarded, then WLC sends that frame to that (LWAPP) that is connected to the destination device.

In the provided routing table entries, the administrative distance is indicated in square brackets.\n\nIn this case, the first factor to consider is the administrative distance:\n\n- OSPF (O): Administrative distance of 110.\n- RIP (R): Administrative distance of 120.\n\nNow, comparing OSPF routes:\n\n- Entry 1 has an administrative distance of 110 and a metric of 6906.\n- Entry 2 has an administrative distance of 110 and a higher metric of 23018.\n\nBetween the OSPF routes, Entry 1 would be used first because it has a lower metric. Therefore, the route via G0/6 (Entry 1) would be used first for the destination network 10.18.75.113/27.\n\nIf both routes were from the same routing protocol, the metric would be the tiebreaker, with the lower metric being preferred.","poster":"16BitRun"}],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-12-28 18:24:00","exam_id":288,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"B":"G0/3","D":"G0/23","C":"G0/16","A":"G0/6"},"topic":"1","question_id":309,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"a8tbP1RXXqNAiETtNBqE","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image311.png"],"unix_timestamp":1710737580,"topic":"1","isMC":false,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image312.png"],"question_id":310,"exam_id":288,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/136482-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1277-discussion/","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nDrag and drop the characteristic from the left onto the cable type on the right.\n\n//IMG//","answer_ET":"","discussion":[{"content":"correct","timestamp":"1732079340.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"KAM2023","comment_id":"1214086"},{"content":"Correct folks","timestamp":"1726627980.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1176263","poster":"San_Man"}],"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2024-03-18 05:53:00","answer":"","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"id":288,"name":"200-301","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":1395,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":62},"__N_SSP":true}
