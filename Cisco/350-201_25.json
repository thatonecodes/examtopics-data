It does not cover the costs of damage done by third parties as a result of a cyber attack.\n\nCybersecurity risk insurance is designed to help organizations manage risks associated with cyber incidents. However, it typically has limitations in terms of coverage, exclusions, and conditions. One common limitation is that it may not cover damages caused by third-party vendors or suppliers, as these parties are responsible for their own cybersecurity and can have their own insurance policies. Additionally, different policies may have different exclusions and conditions, so it is important for organizations to carefully review the terms and conditions of their cybersecurity risk insurance policy to understand what is covered and what is not. - ChatGPT"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
