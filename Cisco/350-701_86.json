It solves more challenges associated with IoT, desktop or other mobile device security. UEM solutions can help enterprises secure and control the entire IT environment and its endpoints, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops. UEM solutions can also help secure their users’ personal data, apps, content and enterprise data. With an agile UEM system, enterprises can choose scalable solutions based on needs, whether those enterprise are covering a single operating system or various devices across different platforms, such as Apple iOS iPhone, Android, Microsoft Windows, macOS and Chrome OS. Mature UEM solutions are powered by machine learning and AI, which can help an enterprise’s IT department make quick security decision based on real-time data and analytics.","poster":"Jessie45785"}],"content":"Selected Answer: DE\nDE\n\nAs far as I can remember MDMs like IronMobile inTune, and and like twenty other on the market, were and still focusing on smart mobile devices like mobile phones and tablets, never fat OS ones.

It is a predefined policy that can be configured to allow or deny certain types of traffic. If the WSA is unable to match a web request to any user-defined policy, it will apply the global policy to determine whether to allow or block the request.\n\nThe WSA uses policies to determine how to handle web requests based on various factors such as user identity, time of day, content type, and URL category. If a user-defined policy matches a web request, it takes precedence over the global policy. If multiple user-defined policies match a web request, the WSA applies the policy with the highest priority.
