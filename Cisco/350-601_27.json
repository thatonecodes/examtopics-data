NETCONF\nExplanation:\n\nTo manage and collect information from multiple Cisco NX-OS devices in a large-scale data center, the most suitable technology is NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol). Here's why:\n\n NETCONF is a network management protocol designed for managing and configuring network devices. It is part of a broader set of protocols (including RESTCONF and YANG) that are used for network automation.\n NETCONF allows you to interact with network devices in a programmatic way to collect information, configure settings, and monitor the state of devices.\n It works in conjunction with YANG data models (which define the structure of the data being managed) and is ideal for managing large-scale networks such as those found in a data center.","poster":"Jota1234","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","content":"Selected Answer: C\nc is correct!","timestamp":"1727381460.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"680122"}],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (40%)","A (40%)","B (20%)"],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/83730-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-218-discussion/","exam_id":326,"timestamp":"2022-09-26 22:11:00","unix_timestamp":1664223060,"question_text":"An engineer is asked to manage a large-scale data center and collect information from multiple Cisco NX-OS devices using Cisco NX-OS Data Management\nEngine model.\nWhich technology should be used to accomplish this goal?","answer_images":[],"question_id":133},{"id":"MGXYKzEOUHhBGnXHk9UI","question_id":134,"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\n3 nodes!","timestamp":"1727381520.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"680123","poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps"},{"content":"A typical Cisco ACI Multi-Site deployment requires a 3-node cluster of Multi-Site Orchestrators to manage all the sites' fabrics in your Multi-Site environment. \n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/aci_multi-site/sw/2x/installation/Cisco-ACI-Multi-Site-Installation-Upgrade-Guide-221/m-multi-site-install-overview.html","comment_id":"461570","upvote_count":"2","poster":"GG345","timestamp":"1697204280.0"}],"question_text":"A network architect is asked to design and manage geographically distributed data centers across cities and decides to use a Multi-Site Orchestrator deployment.\nHow many orchestrators should be deployed?","choices":{"B":"3","A":"5","C":"4","D":"2"},"timestamp":"2021-10-13 15:38:00","topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/64046-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-219-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1634132280,"exam_id":326,"answer_description":"A typical Cisco ACI Multi-Site deployment requires a 3-node cluster of Multi-Site Orchestrators to manage all the sites' fabrics in your Multi-Site environment.\nReference:\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/aci_multi-site/sw/2x/installation/Cisco-ACI-Multi-Site-Installation-Upgrade-Guide-221/m- multi-site-install-overview.html"},{"id":"sSumhvQ6lugOo51PzonK","choices":{"C":"periodic polling of the device status","D":"MD5-based authentication on polling","A":"on-change traps sent to a receiver","B":"periodic push-based subscription messages"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/66919-exam-350-601-topic-1-question-22-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1638190320,"answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"exam_id":326,"timestamp":"2021-11-29 13:52:00","answer_description":"","answer":"B","question_id":135,"question_text":"What is an advantage of streaming telemetry over SNMP?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"657113","poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","content":"Selected Answer: B\nb is correct","timestamp":"1725261720.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/answer/Telemetry-vs-SNMP-Is-one-better-for-network-management","comment_id":"606775","poster":"elmodude","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716562920.0"},{"poster":"designated","timestamp":"1701262320.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Answer is B.\n\nSNMP polls network devices to collect information or set configuration properties. The approach, while generally reliable, can also lead to delays as long as five to 10 minutes before information is received from a device—veritable eons in today's networks. Streaming telemetry flips and streamlines the process. Instead of the pull model used by SNMP, streaming telemetry uses a push model to continuously stream data from network devices to one or more network monitoring systems.","comment_id":"489880"}]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Cisco","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":521,"name":"350-601","isBeta":false,"id":326,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":27},"__N_SSP":true}
