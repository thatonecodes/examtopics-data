Tasks assigned include configuration of NAT, NTP, DHCP, and SSH services.\n\n1. All traffic sent from R3 to the R1 Loopback address must be configured for NAT on R2. All source addresses must be translated from R3 to the IP address of Ethernet0/0 on R2, while using only a standard access list named PUBNET. To verify, a ping must be successful to the R1 Loopback address sourced from R3. Do not use NVI NAT configuration.\n2. Configure R1 as an NTP server and R2 as a client, not as a peer, using the IP address of the R1 Ethernet0/2 interface. Set the clock on the NTP server for midnight on May 1, 2018.\n3. Configure R1 as a DHCP server for the network 10.1.3.0/24 in a pool named NETPOOL. Using a single command, exclude addresses 1 - 10 from the range. Interface Ethernet0/2 on R3 must be issued the IP address of 10.1.3.11 via DHCP.\n4. Configure SSH connectivity from R1 to R3, while excluding access via other remote connection protocols. Access for user netadmin and password N3t4ccess must be set on router R3 using RSA and 1024 bits. Verify connectivity using an SSH session from router R1 using a destination address of 10.1.3.11.
