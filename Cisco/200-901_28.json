While bare metal does not include built-in full platform automation, it can be fully automated using tools like MAAS for provisioning, Ansible for configuration management, and Kubernetes (via Kubespray or RKE2) for orchestration. Terraform and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana can further automate ongoing platform management. Virtual machines and containers introduce performance overhead due to abstraction layers, making them less suitable for high disk I/O workloads. With the right automation stack, bare metal offers both high performance and full automation.","comment_id":"1351835"},{"poster":"Nicetomeetyou","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFor vehicle choice Miata is always the correct answer, for software development container is always the way to go.","comment_id":"943547","timestamp":"1720172880.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"r3mo","comment_id":"794611","upvote_count":"2","content":"Here is the key.. \"The platform and application deployment \" Ans.

This allows the application to be deployed and run consistently across different environments, without the need to worry about platform-specific dependencies or configurations.","poster":"chris_edwards"},{"comment_id":"753690","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nITS DDDDDD","timestamp":"1703283180.0","poster":"outrageous7"},{"poster":"aplicacion101","comment_id":"703214","timestamp":"1698166440.0","content":"specific platform requirements -> container","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"sirtul","timestamp":"1697011440.0","content":"D. container\nNetacad 7.1.6 Distributed and Dynamic Applications: Another Case for Automation\nInfrastructure automation tools - Increasingly, the dynamism of microservice-based applications is provided by infrastructure.
