Storing the username and password in a separate configuration file can potentially expose the credentials to unauthorized users if the file is not properly secured. It is generally more secure to store sensitive information, such as passwords, in a secure storage system, such as a vault, rather than in a configuration file or in code.","upvote_count":"9"},{"poster":"outrageous7","timestamp":"1719760380.0","comment_id":"762177","upvote_count":"1","content":"doubt i would say A"}],"answer_ET":"B","question_id":238,"choices":{"D":"Store the username and password in code.","C":"Store the passwords in a dictionary.","A":"Store the username and password in a separate configuration file.","B":"Store the username and password in a vault."},"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1672420380,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-12-30 18:13:00","question_text":"A developer is developing a web application that uses username and password to authenticate to the next service.

It provides a way for external applications to perform operations such as add, update, or delete users, devices, and phone features in UCM. One of its capabilities is to authenticate users who exist in UCM. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

(2) It allows sending data to other objects effectively without any change in the Subject or Observer classes.

Loose coupling refers to the degree to which one object or class knows about or depends on another object or class. In the observer pattern, the object being observed (the \"subject\") maintains a list of dependent classes (the \"observers\"), but the subject and the observers have a minimal amount of knowledge about each other. This allows the subject and the observers to be changed or replaced independently without affecting the other."}],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/93829-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-314-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"provider":"Cisco","isImplemented":true,"id":291,"isMCOnly":false,"name":"200-901","numberOfQuestions":558,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":48},"__N_SSP":true}
