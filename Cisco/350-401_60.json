This is the only other level besides 1 and 15 that is configured by default on Cisco routers.\nNext is level 1, the default user level. This level provides the user with many more commands that allow the user to display router information, telnet to other systems, and test network connectivity with ping and traceroute. Level 2, which is not enabled by default, adds a few additional show and clear commands, but provides no opportunity for a user to reconfigure the router.
