Why /29 cause lets see why\n\n32 bit mask -29 bit mask=3 bits\n2 to the power of 3 is 8 per subnet while 6 host in a subnet(2 power of 3 minus 2)\n\nSo 8 bits in a subnet. Take this questions example.\n1st Subnet = 10.10.13.0 - 10.10.13.7\n2nd Subnet = 10.10.13.8 - 10.10.13.15\n3rd Subnet = 10.10.13.16 - 10.10.13.23\n....\n...\nSome numbered Subnet later =10.10.13.208 - 10.10.13.216 so 10.10.13.214 is in the range so that's the answer right there\n\nReminder\nEach subnet has a Network and Broadcast Bit so for knowing how many host in a subnet need to ALWAYS MINUS 2. That's why we minus 2(remember just now with 2 power of 3 minus 2 so yup).","poster":"SVN05","comment_id":"798846"},{"comment_id":"815579","timestamp":"1692544140.0","poster":"daddydagoth","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIT's D"},{"content":"D: /29 is correct\n\n\nBasically look at the routing table and find the longest prefix route that's connected to Router1 and that is 10.10.13.208/29 via 10.10.10.1.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1183022","timestamp":"1727318820.0","poster":"ZK23"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","comment_id":"1178823","timestamp":"1726865280.0"},{"timestamp":"1723139340.0","poster":"a67c04a","comment_id":"1144860","content":"Selected Answer: C\nItÂ´s C for me","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis question is more about reading comprehension than technical knowledge.\nIt is NOT asking \"What is the prefix length for the network of host A?\"\nIt is asking \"What is the prefix length for *THE ROUTE THAT* router1 *WILL USE TO REACH* host A?\"\nThe route used to reach host A is 10.10.10.1\nThat IP is part of the 10.10.10.0/28 subnet, which is clearly labelled as a /28.\nTherefore the answer is C.","timestamp":"1715784840.0","poster":"BarkingSpider","comments":[{"upvote_count":"7","content":"No man.
