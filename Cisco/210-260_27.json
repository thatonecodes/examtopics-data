The DCE/RPC preprocessor detects DCE/RPC requests and responses encapsulated in TCP, UDP, and SMB transports, including TCP-transported DCE/RPC using version 1 RPC over HTTP. The preprocessor analyzes DCE/RPC data streams and detects anomalous behavior and evasion techniques in DCE/RPC traffic.

CONVENTIONAL PACKET FILTERING\nConventional packet filtering only reads the header information of each packet. This was a basic approach that was less sophisticated than the modern approach to packet filtering largely due to the technology limitations at the time. Firewalls had very little processing power, and it was not enough to handle large volumes of packets. In other words, conventional packet filtering was similar to reading the title of a book, without awareness or evaluation of the content inside the cover.\n\nWith the advent of new technologies, deep packet inspection became feasible. As it became more thorough and complete, it became more comparable to picking up a book, cracking it open, and reading it from cover to cover.\nhttps://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-deep-packet-inspection-how-it-works-use-cases-dpi-and-more\nDeep Packet Inspection is done at the Application Layer.
