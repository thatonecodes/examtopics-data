The routers share an IP address and a virtual MAC address, and one router is elected as the active router while the others act as backups. If the active router fails, one of the backup routers takes over to maintain seamless network connectivity.\n\nOption A accurately describes the purpose of VRRP, making it the correct choice.

These indicators suggest that the interface is struggling to handle the volume of Ethernet frames efficiently, leading to dropped frames and potential connectivity issues for services like printing.\n\nAdditionally, excessive collisions (option B) and a large number of broadcast packets (option C) could also potentially cause connectivity problems but are not directly supported by the provided information.
