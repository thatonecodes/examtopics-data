A MAB-enabled port can be dynamically enabled or disabled based on the MAC address of the endpoint that connects to it\n\nWebAuth, like MAB, can be used as a fallback authentication mechanism for 802.1x. If both MAB and WebAuth are configured as fallbacks for 802.1x, when 802.1x times out, a switch first attempts to authenticate through MAB, and if it fails, the switch attempts to authenticate with WebAuth\n\nExtracted from Secure Network Access Control, Chapter 25 of the OCG","timestamp":"1728995640.0","comment_id":"1196021"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1218284","timestamp":"1732542660.0","poster":"[Removed]"},{"timestamp":"1725645900.0","poster":"slacker_at_work","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1167461","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
