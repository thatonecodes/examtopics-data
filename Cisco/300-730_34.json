DMVPN Phase 3 allows routers to establish direct spoke-to-spoke connections, eliminating the need to send traffic through a hub. It provides scalability and simplifies the configuration by allowing spoke routers to dynamically establish tunnels with each other as needed. Furthermore, DMVPN Phase 3 supports the use of Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP), which enables route resolution and dynamic route advertisement between the spokes. On the other hand, FlexVPN is a different VPN technology that provides a modular framework for various VPN types, including site-to-site, remote access, and DMVPN.
