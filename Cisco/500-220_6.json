This protocol ensures that OSPF packets exchanged between OSPF-enabled routers are authenticated using MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5), thereby preventing unauthorized access or tampering of OSPF routing information.","poster":"Adrian1988","comment_id":"1223421"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A, for sure !","timestamp":"1716505020.0","poster":"rnunes1110","comment_id":"1078941","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689614280.0","comment_id":"779252","poster":"azjlmpang","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://documentation.meraki.com/MX/Site-to-site_VPN/Using_OSPF_to_Advertise_Remote_VPN_Subnets"}],"timestamp":"2023-01-17 20:18:00","topic":"3","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":26,"answer":"A","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"1ISiUiSswTxemAx2MiuU","topic":"3","answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"isMC":true,"exam_id":333,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/95737-exam-500-220-topic-3-question-27-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-01-17 20:25:00","unix_timestamp":1673983500,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nBand steering detects clients capable of 5 GHz operation and steers them to that frequency, leaving the more crowded 2.4 GHz band available for legacy clients, which helps improve the end-user experience.

Some users may want to limit how much footage their cameras can retain (for example, to meet regulatory requirements). To address this, maximum retention limits can be enabled.
