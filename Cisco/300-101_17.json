They contain temporary entries that are automatically created when a new IP session begins. They are nested within extended, named IP access lists that are applied to an interface. Reflexive access lists are typically configured on border routers, which pass traffic between an internal and external network. These are often firewall routers. Reflexive access lists do not end with an implicit deny statement because they are nested within an access list and the subsequent statements need to be examined.\n\ncisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_data_acl/configuration/15-1s/sec-access-list-ov.html","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"201910"},{"timestamp":"1568785260.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"A is correct.\nWe asked about just filter upper layer protocol, not \"based on upper-layer SESSION information\".","poster":"Bastex","comment_id":"11558"},{"timestamp":"1558868580.0","comment_id":"2074","poster":"routeweaver","content":"I agree with james","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1558343400.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer should be Reflexive ACL - it even says it in the explanation.","poster":"james","comment_id":"1940"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"Explanation","answer_description":"Remember the three Ps Per protocol, Per direction, and Per interface\nOne ACL per protocol- To control traffic flow on an interface an ACL must be defined for each protocol enabled on the interface (example IP, IPX, AppleTalk)\nOne ACL per direction- ACLs control traffic in one direction at one time on an interface. You must create two separate ACLs to control traffic in both inbound and outbound connections.\nOne ACL per interface- ACLs control traffic for an interface such as Fast Ethernet.\n\nDynamic ACLs -\nDynamic or lock-and-key ACLs are available for Internet Protocol traffic only. Dynamic ACLs starts with the application of an extended ACL to block traffic through the router.\nCommon reasons to use Dynamic ACLs are:\nWhen you want a specific remote user or group of remote users to access a host within your network.\nConnecting to the outside of your network (Internet) Lock-and-key authenticates the user and then permits limited access through your firewall router.\nYou want a subset of hosts on a local network to access a host from a remote network that is protected by a firewall.\nLock-and-key requires users to authenticate through an AAA, TACACS server or other security server before it allows access.\n\nReflexive ACLs -\nReflexive ACLs allow IP packets to be filtered based on upper-layer session information. Generally are used to allow outbound traffic and to limit inbound traffic by using sessions that originate inside the router. When a router sees a new outbound connection it adds an entry to a temporary ACL to allow replies back into the network. Reflexive ACLs can be defined only with an extended named IP ACL. They cannot be defined with numbered or standard named ACLs or with other protocols.\n\nTime-Based ACLs -\nTime-Based ACLs are like extended ACLs in function, but they allow access control based on time. To use time-based ACLs you create a time range that defines specific times of the day and days of the week. You use the time range with a name and then refer to it by a function. The time range relies on the router system clock. This feature works with NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization, but the router clock can also be used.\n\nNumbered ACL -\nYou can assign a number based on whether your ACL is standard or extended\n1 to 99 and 1300 to 1999 are Standard IP ACL\n100 to 199 and 2000 to 2699 are Extended IP ACL\nYou cannot add or delete entries within the ACL (You have to totally delete the ACL in order to edit it)\n\nNamed ACL -\nYou can assign names to the ACL instead of numbers.\nNames can contain alphanumeric characters\nRecommended to type the name in all CAPITAL LETTERS\nNames cannot contain spaces or punctuation and must begin with an alphabetic character\nYou can add or delete entries within the ACL\nYou can specify whether the ACL is standard or extended","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/1421-exam-300-101-topic-1-question-408-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Standart acl","C":"Reflexive acl","E":"Dynamic acl A","D":"Time based acl","A":"Extended acl"},"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2019-05-20 11:10:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"24zfsHklj8cRo1TTGrqe","unix_timestamp":1603012140,"answer_ET":"D","question_id":84,"exam_id":296,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Disabling asr-group commands on interfaces that are likely to receive asymmetric traffic","C":"Replacing them with redundant routers and allowing load balancing","A":"Performing packet captures","D":"Disabling stateful TCP checks"},"question_text":"Which option is one way to mitigate symmetric routing on an active/active firewall setup for TCP-based connections?","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-10-18 11:09:00","discussion":[{"content":"I think the question may have meant to read asymmetric? \n\nTCP State Bypass\nSpecifically for TCP-based connections, disabling stateful TCP checks can help mitigate asymmetric routing.
