In Large Expressway systems the first 12 ports in the range – 36000 to 36011 by default – are always reserved for multiplexed traffic. The Expressway-E listens on these ports. You cannot configure a distinct range of demultiplex listening ports on Large systems: they always use the first 6 pairs in the media port range. On Small/Medium systems you can explicitly specify which 2 ports listen for multiplexed RTP/RTCP traffic, on the Expressway-E (Configuration > Traversal > Ports). If you choose not to configure a particular pair of ports (Use configured demultiplexing ports = No), then the Expressway-E will listen on the first pair of ports in the media traversal port range (36000 and 36001 by default).","poster":"ocero","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729515360.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI would think also A\n\nMedia Demultiplexing\nThe Expressway-E uses media demultiplexing in the following call scenarios:\n\nAny H.323 or SIP call leg to/from an Expressway-C through a traversal zone configured to use Assent.\n\nAny H.323 call leg to/from an Expressway-C through a traversal server zone configured to use H460.19 in demultiplexing mode.\n\nH.323 call legs between an Expressway-E and an Assent or H.460.19 enabled endpoint.","poster":"Dregtien","comment_id":"1039208","timestamp":"1712728620.0"},{"timestamp":"1705694640.0","comments":[{"poster":"aocstr","timestamp":"1706868060.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"969910","content":"i would go for A because there are two sockets open not only one for both RTP and RTCP"}],"comment_id":"956891","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","content":"A OR B ?"}],"timestamp":"2023-07-19 20:04:00","answer":"A","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/115791-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-138-discussion/","question_text":"How do the Cisco Expressway-C and Expressway-E servers transmit media to each other?","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"RTP and RTCP are multiplexed for all internal and external video endpoints across the traversal link using UDP.","B":"When the Expressway-C receives RTP and RTCP media, it establishes a new UDP socket with the Expressway-E.","D":"When the Expressway-E receives RTP and RTCP media, it establishes a new UDP socket with the Expressway-C.","C":"RTP and RTCP are multiplexed for all internal and external video endpoints across the traversal link using TLS."},"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1689789840,"exam_id":321,"question_images":[],"question_id":44},{"id":"i3i6SxxZhCh0JmPu1ryA","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1721412780.0","comment_id":"956897","comments":[{"comments":[{"poster":"Panda_man","upvote_count":"1","content":"When u need to configure connection between 2 Expressways C u can only create neighbor zone - not traversal not transform but neighbor zone","timestamp":"1730894100.0","comment_id":"1063806"}],"content":"Why B?","timestamp":"1724950140.0","poster":"RafaKarz","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"993298"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"}],"timestamp":"2023-07-19 20:13:00","answer":"B","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/115792-exam-300-820-topic-1-question-139-discussion/","question_text":"An engineer must enable the communication between two separate Expressway-C servers to allow inbound and outbound calling between different endpoints registered on each server.
