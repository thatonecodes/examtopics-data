This new mechanism uses a mix of ICMPv6 messages and multicast addresses.\nStateless Auto-Configuration – This mechanism allows nodes on the local link to configure their IPv6 addresses by themselves by using a mix of ICMPv6 messages and multicast addresses.\nRouter Redirection – The router sends ICMPv6 messages to an IPv6 node to inform it of the presence of a better router address on the same local link to reach a destination network.","poster":"Subutai","comment_id":"33459","timestamp":"1577615340.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":285,"choices":{"A":"CLNS","B":"TCPv6","E":"ARP","C":"NHRP","D":"NDP"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/11031-exam-200-125-topic-1-question-475-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1577615340,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which protocol does ipv6 use to discover other ipv6 nodes on the same segment?","answer":"D","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2019-12-29 11:29:00","answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_id":101},{"id":"JURjyjreE2CLH5DsACuw","exam_id":285,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1571485380,"timestamp":"2019-10-19 13:43:00","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which command can you enter to verify that a 128-bit address is live and responding?","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"596685","upvote_count":"2","poster":"M11156_","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPing\" is the correct Answer.
