DNs are used for internal destinations. Normalization is achieved by stripping or translating the called number to internally used DNs. \nD. Is partially correct. It is localized call egress, not normalization. Even in this case, it is the called number which must be localized. Localizing is issued using Translations and Transformation Patterns in the local Gateway or the local Trunk, but it is not performed in the side of the Globalized Call Routing environment.\nA. is correct. E.164 global format is used for all calling-party numbers, except calls from an internal number to another internal number.\nReference: It is very well explained in the book \"Implementing Cisco IP Telephony and Video, Part 2 (CIPTV2) Foundation Learning Guide\" Chapter 3: Overview of PSTN and Intersite Connectivity Options.

If there is any codec mismatch, transcoding enters in scene, but it is other stuff. \nSo, in order of the above, correct answer is C.
