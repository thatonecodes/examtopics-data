An API is usually synchronous when data or service availability, resources and connectivity are high and low latency is a requirement.\n \nAsynchronous APIs: \nAsynchronous APIs are also known as async APIs. With an asynchronous process, the availability of a resource, service or data store may not be immediate. The API may have to wait for a backend response. These APIs may provide a callback notification to the requester when the requested resource is ready. Asynchronous requests are useful in maintaining an application's functionality rather than tying up its resources waiting on a request. An API may be asynchronous where data or service availability and connectivity is low or oversaturated with demand."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nVerified.
