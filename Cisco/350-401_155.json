It retrieves the running configuration of the device and saves it as an XML file.\n\nHere's what the script does step by step:\n\nImports the manager class from the ncclient module.\nConnects to a network device with the provided host, port, username, and disables host key verification.\nRetrieves the running configuration of the device in XML format.\nWrites the XML configuration to a file named after the host, with the extension .xml.\nSo, the script generates an XML file containing the running configuration of the network device specified by the provided host, port, and username. The filename will be based on the host's IP address or hostname.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"slacker_at_work","timestamp":"1725213600.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1678533120,"isMC":true,"exam_id":324,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/102289-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-732-discussion/","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhat is generated by the script?","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"the running configuration","B":"the cdp neighbors","C":"the routing table","A":"the router processes"}},{"id":"zOdN2PrHjUvEBhpyWER4","unix_timestamp":1678533180,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/102290-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-733-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_text":"What is a benefit of YANG modules?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"","question_id":772,"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-03-11 12:13:00","isMC":true,"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"single protocol and model coupling to simplify maintenance and support","B":"easier multivendor interoperability provided by common or industry models","C":"avoidance of ecosystem fragmentation by having fixed modules that cannot be changed","A":"tightly coupled models with encoding to improve performance"},"exam_id":324,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","comment_id":"1218115","timestamp":"1732528920.0"},{"content":"B.
