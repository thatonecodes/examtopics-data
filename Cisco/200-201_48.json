NAT \n\nExplanation:\nNAT allows multiple devices on a private network to access the internet using a single public IP address. It achieves this by translating the private IP addresses into the public IP and using port numbers to distinguish between connections.\nThis behavior makes it feasible for multiple UDP connections through the same port because NAT tracks the connections based on the combination of source IP, source port, destination IP, and destination port.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1342546"},{"timestamp":"1719580320.0","poster":"c79ecd3","comment_id":"1238739","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSurely its D"},{"poster":"dharmik303","comment_id":"1178565","timestamp":"1710957000.0","content":"D for me","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","answer_images":[],"question_text":"An analyst performs traffic analysis to detect suspicious activity and identifies the multiple UDP connections through the same port.
