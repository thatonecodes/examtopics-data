Multicast traffic is increased throughout the network.\n\nWhen multiple wireless controllers are part of the same CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) multicast group, the multicast traffic used for communication between the controllers and access points (APs) will increase. This is because each controller in the group will send and receive multicast packets to manage and communicate with the APs, leading to higher multicast traffic across the network.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is B.

Cisco Jabber, like many modern applications, uses DSCP to mark IP packets for QoS prioritization at Layer 3. Trusting the DSCP value ensures that the QoS markings set by the application are preserved as traffic traverses the network.\n\nExplanation of the options:\nA. DSCP: This is correct. DSCP is a Layer 3 marking used in the IP header for QoS prioritization. Trusting DSCP ensures that the markings set by Cisco Jabber are preserved.\n\nB. 802.1p: This is a Layer 2 marking used in the Ethernet frame for QoS prioritization. It is not relevant for preserving markings set by Cisco Jabber, which operates at Layer 3.\n\nC. CoS (Class of Service): This is another term for 802.1p, which is a Layer 2 marking. It is not applicable for preserving Layer 3 DSCP markings.\n\nD. IP precedence: This is an older Layer 3 QoS marking method that has been largely replaced by DSCP.
