Enable coverage hole detection.\n\nThe symptoms described in the scenario, where wireless users experience frequent disconnections from the network but the connection re-establishes automatically without any input, can be indicative of coverage holes in the wireless network. Coverage holes are areas where the wireless signal strength is insufficient, leading to connectivity issues for users within those areas.\n\nBy enabling coverage hole detection, the wireless network can identify and mitigate these coverage holes more effectively. Coverage hole detection allows the access points (APs) to monitor the signal strength and quality within their coverage areas. If a coverage hole is detected, the AP can take proactive measures to address the issue, such as adjusting transmit power, optimizing channel selection, or triggering alarms for further investigation.\n\nEnabling coverage hole detection helps in identifying and resolving areas with poor coverage, improving the overall user experience by reducing the frequency of disconnections.","comment_id":"934245","timestamp":"1687771740.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nOf the options provided, the most relevant action that can help with this issue is to enable coverage hole detection.
