This information is then used to create a profile for each endpoint. The profile is used by Cisco ISE to make decisions about how to authenticate, authorize, and account for the endpoint.\n\nThe profiling service can be used to protect endpoint access in a variety of ways. For example, the profiling service can be used to:\n\n Block access to the network for endpoints that are not known or that are not compliant with security policies.\n Restrict access to the network for endpoints that are running unapproved applications.\n Monitor the behavior of endpoints on the network and take action if an endpoint is behaving in a suspicious manner.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"denverfly"},{"timestamp":"1716697080.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer C.

In this case, Cisco ISE is the RADIUS server and the NAD is the device that is authenticating the user. After the user logs in successfully using CWA, Cisco ISE sends a CoA to the NAD with new permissions for the user. The NAD then applies these new permissions to the user's session.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\n It terminates the client session. This is not the purpose of a CoA. A CoA is used to update the attributes of an existing session, not to terminate it.\n It applies the downloadable ACL provided in the CoA. This is not the only thing that a CoA can do.
