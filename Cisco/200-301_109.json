At least one server is required in a VTP domain to propagate VLAN information within the VTP domain. We can create, add, or delete VLANs of a VTP domain in a Switch which is in VTP Server mode and change VLAN information in a VTP Server. The changes made in a switch in server mode are advertised to the entire VTP domain.\n\nThe VTP Transparent mode is something between a VTP Server and a VTP Client but does not participate in the VTP Domain.

If multiple companies were to use the same private IP addresses, conflicts would arise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, which states that the range of private IPv4 addresses ensures that NAT (Network Address Translation) is not required to reach the Internet with private range addressing. This is because private IP addresses are not routable on the public Internet, so NAT is required to translate between private and public IP addresses. By using private IP addresses within an organization, NAT can be avoided for internal communication, which can reduce network complexity and improve security."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"arjune","comment_id":"858419","content":"A is Correct.This is where NAT is used also.","timestamp":"1680398640.0"},{"comment_id":"764241","timestamp":"1672723560.0","poster":"Bilal1992","content":"A is correct.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"195702","content":"Repeating question","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Crazey","timestamp":"1602127140.0"}]},{"id":"4b9YDtN1ik5JjJZrnm9f","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"Jay1324","timestamp":"1657735440.0","upvote_count":"22","comment_id":"523058","content":"Key is multi-vendor--lldp. cdp is cisco only"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1173173","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1726288560.0"},{"comment_id":"1171572","timestamp":"1726126260.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"LazizS","content":"cdp - cisco discovery protocol"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
