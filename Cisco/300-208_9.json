There is no concept of pre-authentication access, which means that no access is allowed—such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), HTTP, and Domain Name System (DNS)—while authentication is in progress. Closed Mode can be useful for VLAN-based enforcement since the client does not get an IP address until they have been successfully authenticated.","poster":"damova","timestamp":"1552055580.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"659"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":300},{"id":"dzdWAfBOVMP8fTufkXsU","timestamp":"2019-03-08 17:21:00","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1552062060.0","content":"Cisco ISE Administration guide 2.6 page 87:\nSpecify System Time and NTP Server Settings\nBefore you begin\nYou must have either the Super Admin or System Admin administrator role assigned.\nIf you have both a primary and a secondary Cisco ISE node, you must log in to the user interface of the\nsecondary node and configure the system time and NTP server settings on each Cisco ISE node in your\ndeployment individually.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"667","poster":"damova"}],"question_id":43,"answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1552062060,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/534-exam-300-208-topic-1-question-30-discussion/","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which statement about system time and NTP server configuration with Cisco ISE is true?","choices":{"B":"The system time can be configured centrally on the Cisco ISE, but NTP server settings must be configured individually on each ISE node.","C":"NTP server settings can be configured centrally on the Cisco ISE, but the system time must be configured individually on each ISE node.","D":"The system time and NTP server settings must be configured individually on each ISE node.","A":"The system time and NTP server settings can be configured centrally on the Cisco ISE."},"exam_id":300},{"id":"Pw0Vm6r6aQIJ5sreZcyQ","question_text":"Wireless client supplicants attempting to authenticate to a wireless network are generating excessive log messages.
