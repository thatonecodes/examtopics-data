A little helpin hint for you: to calculate the amount of subnets that can be made, do 2 to the power of borrowed host bits and you get the result. We're subnetting a /8 block, that means 14 borrowed bits in a /22 to make subnets. 2 to the power of 14 is 16384. We can make that many addresses from the /22.","comments":[{"comment_id":"904200","upvote_count":"1","poster":"dropspablo","timestamp":"1700676840.0","content":"daddydagoth I'm sorry but what you say doesn't make any sense, 22 - 32 = 10 bits for Hosts, that is 1024 - 2. 14 bits would be prefixed with /18 which would give about 16000 hosts, but nobody mentioned 18 or 14 bits borrowed prefix hahaha"}],"comment_id":"815503","timestamp":"1692540600.0","poster":"daddydagoth","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1684346700.0"}],"comment_id":"720822","poster":"RougePotatoe","timestamp":"1684346640.0"},{"comment_id":"701891","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1682221740.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer","poster":"[Removed]"},{"timestamp":"1681398000.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"255.255.254.0 only gives you 2 subnets, we need 3. 255.255.252.0 gives you 4 subnets with 1022 hosts each so B is correct.","poster":"JohnJacobJr","comment_id":"694016"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Just going to plug this here as it's a good chart:\n/32 1\n/31 2\n/30 4 \n/29 8 \n/28 16\n/27 32\n/26 64\n/25 128\n/24 256\n/23 512\n/22 1024\n/21 2048\n\n# of addresses on the right. -2 = # of hosts\n255.255.252.0 is /22","poster":"Customexit","timestamp":"1681349760.0","comment_id":"693507"},{"poster":"clivebarker86","upvote_count":"1","content":"i selected B, 600 servers need 10bit host and a 255.255.252.0 mask","timestamp":"1680938700.0","comment_id":"689102"},{"timestamp":"1680847500.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: A\n300 servers : 3 subnets , 300 hosts in each subnet - /23 gives 510 host addresses .
