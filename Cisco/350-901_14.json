There is a lot of room for interpretation and one engineer could say Dynamic Routing combined with Multi-AZ creates a complex architecture that is prone to error, for example, whereas another will say that it is a robust netowrk. \nOne engineer may trust the provider A LOT and say that VPC virtual gateways provide high availability, whereas another may have had a terrible experience and think they are not good enough. So on, and so forth.\n\nThe only 2 options that kind of conflict with one another are C and E. So definitely only one of them should be picked (if any). In that case, I would go with E.\n\nSo to me, final answer here could be any two of A, B, D and E. \nThanks Cisco, for being such a horrible certification provider!"}],"content":"Question after question, we see how Cisco is absolutely terrible on coming-up with good cert exams.

E is about separation of duties and benefits based upon the separation of the transit from the rest of the VPC. A and B however I consider are related by the robustness and availability. At 13 min the video goes into detail regarding the multiple tunnels between the VGW and the transit VPC providing high availability and access to multiple VPC networks. The network that B is referring to is the VPC that has the VGW. The VGW initiates the dual connections to the transit VPC CSRs and hence provides high availability to its VPC. As the dual connections could be IPSec as per the video perhaps D is also correct.
