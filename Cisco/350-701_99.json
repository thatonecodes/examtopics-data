Upload the hash for the file into the policy.\n\nWhen a custom file detection policy is created in order to track a specific file, it is necessary to ensure that the file is being properly detected by the security scans. One way to do this is by uploading the hash of the file into the policy. The hash, also known as a digital fingerprint, is a unique identification code that is specific to a file. By including the hash of the infected file in the policy, the scans will be able to detect the file based on its unique characteristics, even if the file has been modified or renamed. This ensures that the policy is functioning as it should and that the infected file will be detected in the future.\n\nAlthough options like blocking the application that the file was using to open, sending the file to Cisco Threat Grid for dynamic analysis or creating an IP block list for the website from which the file was downloaded are good options to prevent the attack but they are not related to the custom file detection policy functionality.","timestamp":"1690274340.0"},{"comment_id":"1189768","poster":"Marshpillowz","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","timestamp":"1728116340.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is C. Upload the hash for the file into the policy.\n\nOption A is not an appropriate response to ensure the policy is functioning, as it involves blocking an IP address rather than detecting the file.\n\nOption B is also not an appropriate response, as blocking the application used to open the file may not prevent the file from being downloaded or executed on the endpoint.\n\nOption D is a good practice for threat analysis, but it does not address the issue of the custom file detection policy not detecting the file as an indicator of compromise. Uploading the hash of the file into the policy is a more direct approach to ensuring the policy is functioning as it should.","comment_id":"849485","timestamp":"1695568860.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Naderelmansi"},{"poster":"Emlia1","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1686159300.0","content":"It should be D","comment_id":"738288"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"696222","content":"The correct answer is D","timestamp":"1681646400.0","poster":"sis_net_sec"},{"poster":"otzu1","comment_id":"590246","content":"C,\n\nconfiguring the policy doesn't imply it was configured correctly, add the file hash using sha 256/ \n\nOCG:\n\nSimple custom detection allows you to add file\nsignatures, while the advanced custom detections are\nmore like traditional antivirus signatures.\nCreating a simple custom detection is similar to adding\nnew entries to a blacklist.
