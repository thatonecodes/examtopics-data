To address this issue, a custom QoS policy should be created and applied directly to the L3Out interface. This ensures that the QoS settings align with the specific requirements of the traffic being handled.\n\nWhy Not the Other Options?\nA. Acknowledge the QoS-related error:\nAcknowledging the error in the APIC GUI won't resolve the underlying configuration issue. The fault will persist until the QoS policy is corrected.\n\nB. Associate a custom QoS class:\nWhile associating a QoS class is part of the solution, you first need to create the custom QoS policy itself, which defines how the classes behave.\n\nD. Set the QoS policy to Level 3:\nSetting a QoS policy to a specific level (e.g., Level 3) may not align with your specific traffic requirements and won't address the root cause if a custom policy is needed.","comment_id":"1350783","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1738569120.0","poster":"prospio971"},{"comment_id":"1317727","poster":"designated","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\n1.
