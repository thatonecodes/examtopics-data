RTO refers to the amount of time it takes to restore a system to its normal operation after a failure, while RPO refers to the amount of data that can be lost as a result of a failure.\n\nIn synchronous replication, data is written to both the primary and secondary systems at the same time. This ensures that the data on the secondary system is always up-to-date and ready for use in the event of a disaster or failure. Geographically dispersed dual data centers refer to two data centers that are located in different geographical locations, which can help to reduce the risk of a disaster or failure impacting both data centers at the same time."},{"content":"should be B","poster":"prep4examss","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1247998","timestamp":"1721000100.0"},{"poster":"XalaGyan","timestamp":"1704299820.0","comment_id":"1112938","content":"MetroEthernet has lower delay for geographically dispersed DCs and replication.\n\nAnswer B","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Akkisingh","timestamp":"1682849400.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think key phrase is - \"RTO and RPO for a new system should be as close as possible to zero\"\n means we should put it different country via MPLS, should be dispersed but close by, the more far it is the more RTO/RPO","comment_id":"885090"},{"timestamp":"1682126100.0","poster":"SFXY","comment_id":"876950","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nMetro Ethernet is a high-speed, low-latency network technology that enables synchronous replication between data centers that are relatively close geographically, minimising the impact of latency on system performance and helping to maintain a low RTO."},{"content":"Answer A","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1680364320.0","poster":"cryptotafkar","comment_id":"858077"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is the ans","poster":"gcpengineer","comment_id":"833876","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1678359720.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1676981760.0","comment_id":"816538","content":"should be B based on https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/en_my/training-events/cnsf/files/T2-S3_Rajinder.pdf\nas distance increase between DCs synchronous replication become difficult","poster":"Arsenal16"}],"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (82%)","A (18%)"],"answer_ET":"B","question_text":"An architect receives a business requirement from a CTO that states the RTO and RPO for a new system should be as close as possible to zero.
