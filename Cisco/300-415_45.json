When you initiate an action or task through a REST API call, such as deploying a configuration change or performing a specific operation on a device, you can use the \"monitor status\" API call to check the progress and current status of that action.\n\nBy making the \"monitor status\" API call, you can retrieve information about the ongoing or completed action, including its current state, completion status, success or failure status, and any relevant details or metrics associated with the task.\n\nThe other options (A. admin status, B. troubleshoot status, and C. configuration status) are not standard terms used in REST API calls to check the status of actions on a device. While they might be relevant in certain contexts, they are not specifically related to monitoring the status of actions performed on a device using REST APIs.","poster":"colipto","timestamp":"1706353560.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"poster":"RafaJohnston76","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD\nhttps://blogs.cisco.com/developer/sd-wan-api-doc\nSome of the use cases for vManage API are:\n- Monitoring device status --> CORRECT ANSWER\n- Configuring a device, such as attaching a template to a device\n- Querying and aggregating device statistics","timestamp":"1722793080.0","comment_id":"1140468","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706233380.0","content":"isnt d?","comment_id":"963194","poster":"cybman76"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"admin status","D":"monitor status","C":"configuration status","B":"troubleshoot status"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/116450-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-304-discussion/","question_text":"Which REST API call checks the status of an action that is performed on a device?","answer_description":"","question_images":[]},{"id":"hnIb6vdE3HHxYCLyhtQZ","exam_id":304,"question_id":222,"timestamp":"2023-07-26 01:45:00","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer":"CE","answer_ET":"CE","unix_timestamp":1690328700,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"So together we have here suggestions for B C D E\nAnd be smart now..","poster":"mikidvd51","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730676600.0","comment_id":"1306687"},{"content":"Hello mates! \nIn my opinion the answer here is B&C. \n\nIs clear that D is not necessary.
