This is because allocating too much bandwidth to real-time traffic could lead to congestion for other types of traffic.

In some cases, specific business objectives cannot be met while holding to this recommendation. In such cases, enterprises must provision according to their detailed requirements and constraints. However, it is important to recognize the trade-offs involved with overprovisioning strict-priority traffic with respect to the negative performance impact on response times in non-real-time applications.\n\nBTW, strict-priority queue or formal called LLQ is an add-on to CBWFQ, for real-time, delay sensitive traffic.","timestamp":"1682625420.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nD is not correct\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_conmgt/configuration/xe-3s/qos-conmgt-xe-3s-book/qos-conmgt-oview.html#GUID-48F6AF58-5CCC-44A0-B868-125AE453FF2A%20%20%20%20%20%20(75%20Mbps)\n\nThe sum of all bandwidth allocation on an interface cannot exceed 75 percent of the total available interface bandwidth.

Extensive testing and customer deployments have shown that a general best queuing practice is to limit the amount of strict-priority queuing to 33 percent of a link's capacity. This strict-priority queuing rule is a conservative and safe design ratio for merging real-time applications with data applications.","comments":[{"content":"correct!
