Scale the Docker swarm service to 2 and set endpoint-mode to DNSRR instead of the default value of VIP.\n\nC. Configure an external load balancer to route requests to the swarm service by using session persistence.\n\nThese two design approaches can help meet the requirements mentioned. Scaling the Docker swarm service to two replicas allows for high availability and resilience against a data center outage. Setting endpoint-mode to DNSRR ensures that requests are distributed across replicas in a round-robin fashion. Configuring an external load balancer to route requests to the swarm service with session persistence will ensure that HTTP sessions remain on the server from which the original request was sent, and if a server fails, the client will be forced to reconnect.\n\n\n\n\n\nnow it changed its opinion :/","poster":"Fedesarucho"}],"timestamp":"1674040620.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"779919"}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-901/image33.png"],"answer":"AC","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/95153-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-255-discussion/"},{"id":"RCgFF8i8qNuGZeD65KZG","choices":{"D":"Leverage an external secret vault to retrieve MER_API_KEY and embed the vault key as a new variable before running the code.","B":"Leverage an external secret vault to retrieve MER_API_KEY and set the vault key as an OS environment variable before running the code.","A":"Set an OS environment variable for MER_API_KEY to the API key before running the code and no longer set MER_API_KEY within the code.","C":"Set the Base64 encoded version of the API key as MER_API_KEY in the code and Base64 decode before using in the header."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/95671-exam-350-901-topic-1-question-256-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/350-901/image34.png"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"lznlxl","content":"the answer should be B.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Correct","comment_id":"874985","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1128509","timestamp":"1721636460.0","content":"Sneaky, but B doesn't specifically state to remove the key from the source code.","poster":"AndyUK2022"}],"poster":"MalonJay","timestamp":"1697737800.0"}],"timestamp":"1689578340.0","comment_id":"778731","upvote_count":"17"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe appropriate secret storage approach depends on the specific use case and the security requirements of the application. However, in general, it is recommended to use an external secret vault to store sensitive data such as API keys and passwords. This approach provides a secure way of storing secrets by encrypting them before storing them on disk. The vault can be accessed by applications to retrieve the secrets when required.\n\nOption A is not recommended as it requires setting the API key as an environment variable which can be accessed by other applications running on the same machine. Option C is also not recommended as it requires hardcoding the API key in the code which can be easily accessed by anyone with access to the code. Option D is better than option A and C but still requires embedding the vault key in the code which can be accessed by anyone with access to the code.\n\nOption B is recommended as it provides a secure way of storing secrets by encrypting them before storing them on disk.
