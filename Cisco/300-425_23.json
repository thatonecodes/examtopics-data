The foreign controller load balances guest clients across the list of anchor controllers: Upgrading to version 8.10 or later provides the ability for the foreign controller to distribute guest clients across multiple anchor controllers. This helps to optimize network resources and ensures better performance and reliability by preventing any single anchor controller from becoming a bottleneck.\nPrimary and Secondary Anchor Designation:\n\nE. The foreign controller designates one anchor as primary and one or more anchors as secondary: With the newer code, the foreign controller can designate a primary anchor controller and one or more secondary anchor controllers. This provides redundancy and ensures that if the primary anchor controller fails, the secondary controllers can take over, thus maintaining service availability for guest clients.","comment_id":"1258463","poster":"TonyVi","timestamp":"1722382680.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"The foreign controller load balances guest clients across the list of anchor controllers","B":"Guest clients are load balanced in round-robin fashion among the anchor controllers.","D":"Guest clients are tunneled to anchors with the highest priority.","C":"User devices must upgrade their WLAN card drivers.","E":"The foreign controller designates one anchor as primary and one or more anchors as secondary."},"question_id":111,"topic":"1","question_text":"A company installs a new anchor controller in the DMZ.
