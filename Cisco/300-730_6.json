In this case, you would specify the printers' IP addresses or the subnet they belong to in the split-tunnel configuration. By using the \"exclude specified\" split-tunnel policy, you only need to define the IP addresses or subnets that should bypass the VPN tunnel. All other traffic will automatically be sent over the VPN tunnel, simplifying the configuration on the ASA headend. This approach allows remote access users to access printers on their local LAN directly, without routing that traffic through the VPN tunnel, while still ensuring that all other traffic is securely transmitted over the tunnel","comments":[{"comment_id":"1137616","poster":"pfrank","content":"I would say tunnel specified but the question states which tunnel configuration would reduce configuration overhead.
