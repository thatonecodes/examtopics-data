These are characteristics typically found in IDS logs (Intrusion Detection System). IDS logs provide information about security events detected by an IDS system, which monitors network traffic for signs of unauthorized activity or security policy violations. On the other hand, proxy logs record client connections to a proxy server, NetFlow logs capture network traffic data, and syslogs are a type of system log that captures messages from various components of a computer system.","comment_id":"885943","poster":"alhamry","comments":[{"timestamp":"1730452140.0","content":"sorry it's A (IDS)","poster":"alhamry","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"885945"}],"timestamp":"1730452080.0"},{"comment_id":"812398","content":"Selected Answer: A\n\"Sig ID\" typically refers to a Signature ID, which is a unique identifier assigned to a particular security threat or event by an intrusion detection or prevention system (IDS/IPS).

In fact,\non the exam you may need to differentiate between a firewall log versus a traditional\nIPS or IDS event. One of the things to remember is that traditional IDS and IPS use\nsignatures, so an easy way to differentiate is by looking for a signature ID (SigID).
