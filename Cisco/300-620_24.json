Enabling this feature is a best practice and it should be enabled globally and on all interfaces, regardless of the end device. MCP works to stop Layer-2 loops, it should be enabled right away on an ACI Fabric prior to connecting Layer-2 devices for migration purposes.\n\nAs explained in this article, ACI Operation with L2 Switches and Spanning-tree Link Types, by default, the STP link type on Legacy switches is P2P. ACI acts as a hub for BPDUs. By configuring the STP link type as Shared for your external switch interfaces which connect to ACI, you ensure that you allow the switches to take their time with the STP transition process, thereby protecting your environment from potential STP loop formation. Even though ACI does not generate STP BPDUs, ACI switches will forward STP BPDUs across EPGs on which they are received. This allows the externally connected switches to maintain a loop-free topology and avoid broadcast storms and other nastiness that goes hand-in-hand when layer-2 loops form!","timestamp":"1700893260.0","comment_id":"906333"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1699734000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nvoting A","comment_id":"895286","poster":"Rododendron2"}],"question_id":120,"topic":"1","answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
