An entry contains three pieces of information; the source MAC address, the port or interface on which the frame arrived, and the time when the frame arrived.\n\nIf the switch finds an entry for the source MAC address, it updates that entry and resets the timer of that specific entry. The switch assigns a separate timer to each entry of the CAM table. This timer is used to age out old entries from the CAM table, allowing room to store new entries. This feature is known as the Aging.\n\nOnce the CAM table is full, the switch has no place to store any new addresses. Aging resolves this issue by automatically removing the old entries from the CAM table. It keeps the MAC addresses of only those devices that are constantly sending the frames.\n\nIf any device is not sending the frames, once the timer is expired, it removes the MAC address of that device from the CAM table.
