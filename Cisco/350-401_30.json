B. with ecmp enables (and it can be diabled), that will actually install multiple routes in the RIB. lookup ECMP. this implies that the RIB often doesnt have multiple routes in it. In my simple mind, route protocol database (sh ip ospf database) feeds into the RIB, and RIB coudl get overwritten by lets say a same prefix EIGRP route (ad=90, rather than ad=110). this would install in the RIB. then the RIB would feed the FIB, which combines the adjacency table to the route. so C is likely the best answer in a very strict case. but its a tricky question.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1005949","poster":"Passionaire","content":"Answer options mentions RIB not RIBs. Answer is C. Each routing protocol has its own RIB and each RIB contains only one route to destination.\n\nRouting protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP each have their own Routing Information Base (RIB). The best routes to each destination network are selected to be installed in the global RIB, or the IP routing table from each routing protocol RIB. If more than one routing protocol is being executed on a router, the best routes from each RIB will be chosen by a parameter called administrative distance.\n\nAdministrative distance is the feature that routers use to select the best path when there are two or more different routes to the same destination from two different routing protocols. Administrative distance defines the reliability of a routing protocol. Each routing protocol is prioritized in order of most to least reliable (believable) with the help of an administrative distance value.\n\nThe FIB is derived from the IP routing table and is arranged for maximum lookup throughput.","timestamp":"1726973220.0"},{"content":"I agree with D.\nRIB is, in essence, a comprehensive database, housing a myriad of routing entries.
