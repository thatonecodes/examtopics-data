Class 1\n“industrial” devices use a maximum transmit power level of 100 mW and have a typical\nrange of 100 meters. Classes 2 and 3 are usually mobile devices which use a maximum\ntransmit power of 2.5 mW and 1 mW, for a useful range of 10 and 1 meters, respectively.","poster":"JEVC"},{"content":"I think A is also correct.\nBluetooth uses 2.4Ghz but normally does not affect WLAN networks becuase the transmit power with class 1 and 2 blutooth devices is very low.\nHowever, class 3 bluetooth devices can transmit at up to 100mw, which could be detrimental to all WLAN channels within range. \nHaving said that, bluetooth devices are often mobile and so you often have little control over them, which might be why that is not considered a best practice.","comment_id":"5749","poster":"xtrattitude4u","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1564782240.0"}],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":46},{"id":"36ArByXS0cZxPgo0nLCb","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1564782480,"question_text":"What is the equivalent of 26 dBm in milliwatts?","timestamp":"2019-08-02 23:48:00","answer":"D","question_id":47,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"dBm = log10 (mW)*10\nmW =10^(dBm/10)\nSamples:\n40 dBm=10.00 watts\n36 dBm=4.00 watts\n30 dBm=1.00 watts\n27 dBm=500 milliwatts\n26 dBm=400 milliwatts\nhttp://www.h-peters.com/dbmtomw.html","choices":{"E":"1000 mW","A":"4 mW","D":"400 mW","B":"40 mW","C":"100 mW"},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1564782480.0","comment_id":"5751","upvote_count":"3","poster":"xtrattitude4u","comments":[{"poster":"enpuna","timestamp":"1565075820.0","comment_id":"6054","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct!"}],"content":"1mw = 1dbm\nWork from there.\n+3dbm = X2mw\n+10dbm = X10mw"}],"exam_id":290,"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/3138-exam-200-355-topic-1-question-221-discussion/"},{"id":"aSIEsb7aWM0AHQMUS71v","answer_images":[],"exam_id":290,"question_text":"What is the EIRP value for a transmitter that has a transmitter capable of 15 dBm, an antenna that has a gain of 12 dBi, and a cable that connects the transmitter to the antenna that has 1 db loss?","answer_ET":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/12520-exam-200-355-topic-1-question-222-discussion/","answer_description":"To determine EIRP follow this equation:\n<Transmit Power> -Cable Loss + Antenna Gain = EIRP So in this case 15 - 1 + 12 = 26","question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1579721880,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2020-01-22 20:38:00","question_id":48,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Tameal","comment_id":"41723","timestamp":"1579721880.0","content":"Correct!","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"100 mW","C":".86 dBm","D":"165 dBm","A":"26 dBm","E":"1000 mW"}},{"id":"HexMFQdjnIBf5xHIocIs","exam_id":290,"timestamp":"2019-01-20 16:20:00","question_images":[],"question_text":"When an AP, in its default configuration mode, connects to a Cisco WLC, which methods are available for remote management access to an AP?","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/57-exam-200-355-topic-1-question-224-discussion/","choices":{"C":"HTTPS, and SSH","A":"SSL and SSH are available only after configuration by a Cisco WLC version 7.0.","E":"SSH and Telnet are available only after configuration by a Cisco WLC version 7.0.","D":"SSH and Telnet","B":"SSH only"},"answer":"D","topic":"1","answer_description":"In Wireless LAN Controller release 5.0 and later, the controller supports the use of Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH) protocols to troubleshoot lightweight access points.
