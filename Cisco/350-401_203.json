The PITR attracts traffic from non-LISP sites by advertising aggregate prefixes for the LISP EID into the non-LISP network. When PITR receives packets from non-LISP sites it encapsulate and forward these packets to LISP sites. The second element to establish communication between the LISP and non-LISP sites is called a proxy egress tunnel router (PETR). The PETR allows the communication from the LISP sites to the non-LISP sites. The PETR receives LISP encapsulated traffic from ITR. The PITR and PETR can be combine and deployed on the same node called (PxTR) to provide symmetric traffic when stateful inspection devices are deployed between LISP and non-LISP sites.”"},{"poster":"Nhan","timestamp":"1647219300.0","content":"Given answer is correct","upvote_count":"12","comment_id":"444209"},{"comment_id":"1217827","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732490220.0"},{"comment_id":"1118437","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720599180.0","content":"Proxy ETR (PETR): A PETR is a LISP Infrastructure device that allows EIDs at LISP sites to successfully communicate with devices located at non-LISP sites","poster":"Haidary"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1704274380.0","poster":"techriese","comment_id":"941595","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"5","poster":"olaniyijt","timestamp":"1698257160.0","content":"Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) – LISP-encapsulates IP packets from EIDs forwarded outside the LISP site.\nEgress Tunnel Router (ETR) – de-encapsulates LISP-encapsulated IP packets from non-LISP sites destined for EIDs in the LISP site.\nTunnel Router (xTR) – can execute both ITR and ETR functionalities.\nProxy Ingress Tunnel Router (PITR) – functions similarly to ITR but for non-LISP sites that send traffic to EIDs.\nProxy Egress Tunnel Router (PETR) – functions similarly to ETR but for EIDs that send traffic to non-LISP destinations.\nProxy xTR (PxTR) – can execute both PETR and PITR functionalities.\nLISP Router – A router that functions as ITR, ETR, PITR, and/or PETR.\nMap Server (MS) – learns EID-to-prefix mapping entries from the ETR and stores the entries in an EID-to-RLOC mapping database.\nMap Resolver (MR) – receives LISP-encapsulated map requests from the ITR and checks the Map Server (MS) to locate the proper ETR response to the requests.\nMap Server/Map Resolver (MS/MR) – a device with integrated MS and MR functionalities.","comment_id":"880715"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sarmed_abidali","timestamp":"1697274600.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"991769","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1709096700.0","content":"I'd think of it like this: You need the ITR to communicate with the RLOC space as that's the next hop but the PETR is what's doing the talking with the non-LISP site"}],"content":"I see your point but the questions states \"what is required for a LISP site\" so shouldn't the focus be on what the LISP site needs ?\nA LISP site needs an ITR to communicate with ETRs and PETRs.","comment_id":"870086"},{"poster":"uhljeb","content":"Proxy ITR (PITR): PITRs are just like ITRs but for non-LISP sites that send traffic to\nEID destinations.\nProxy ETR (PETR): PETRs act just like ETRs but for EIDs that send traffic to destinations at non-LISP sites.\nSource: CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core: ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"868033","timestamp":"1697096580.0"},{"content":"LISP Proxy ETR\nA LISP PETR implements ETR functions on behalf of non-LISP sites.
