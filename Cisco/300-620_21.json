Cisco ACI data-plane endpoint learning detects these events quickly and updates the Cisco ACI endpoint database on a new leaf. In addition to data-plane learning, Cisco ACI uses bounce entries to manage the old endpoint information on the original leaf.\n\nWhen a new local endpoint is detected on a leaf, the leaf updates the COOP database on spine switches with its new local endpoint. If the COOP database has already learned the same endpoint from another leaf, COOP will recognize this event as an endpoint move and report this move to the original leaf that contained the old endpoint information. The old leaf that receives this notification will delete its old endpoint entry and create a bounce entry, which will point to the new leaf. A bounce entry is basically a remote endpoint created by COOP communication instead of data-plane learning."}],"choices":{"D":"A new leaf switch floods GARP to every other leaf switch in the fabric, which advertises a new endpoint location to the fabric.","A":"A new leaf switch updates a COOP database on the spine, which causes the old leaf switch to install a bounce entry.","B":"A new leaf switch sends a COOP message to the Cisco APIC cluster to populate a new location of the endpoint.","C":"A new leaf switch sends a COOP message directly to the old leaf switch to update it with new information about the endpoint move."},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_text":"In a Cisco ACI fabric, an endpoint moves between two leaf switches during a virtual machine migration.
