Read the question carefully, it's saying what would be the \"Summary of the route\" meaning summary network address or also known as route summarisation in subnetting. Option C covers all the addresses in the range starting from .16 to .30. Broadcast address on this subnet is 192.168.25.31 which is always one address less from the next block of addresses, which in this case will be a .32 block ending at .47 as it's Broadcast and .48 as the next block. So, 192.168.25.16/28 255.255.255.240 is the summary address for those EIGRP learnt subnets in the routing table showing up in the exhibit.\nAnother note for those who are confusing it with /30 network: Read the question as it's asking for route summarisation address which will cover .16 to .28 addresses and your /30 prefix for 192.168.25.16 will only go up to .19(Broadcast on this subnet) and then it would be .20 block which does NOT fall in that .16 block as it's the next block of addresses. So, .16 only has .17 and .18 as two allocable host addresses with of course .19 being the broadcast address on this subnet.
