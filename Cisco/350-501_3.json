The IP sub flow cache is a separate cache from the main NetFlow cache. This means that the IP sub flow cache can store information about flows that are not being exported using NetFlow.\nThe IP sub flow cache can be enabled on a per-interface basis.

It specifically talks about tracing the source of an attack and using NetFlow to know the source interface. Keywords are in all caps.\n\n\"The originator of DoS attacks cannot be easily identified because the IP source address of the device sending the traffic is usually forged. However, you can easily TRACE the traffic BACK through the network to the router on which it is arriving by using the NetFlow Layer 2 and Security Monitoring Exports feature to capture the MAC address and VLAN-ID fields. If the router on which traffic is arriving supports NetFlow, you can configure the NetFlow Layer 2 and Security Monitoring Exports feature on it to identify the INTERFACE on which the traffic is ARRIVING.\"\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/netflow/configuration/15-2s/nf-detct-analy-thrts.html","poster":"karen1337","timestamp":"1727686800.0"},{"poster":"ariasse","timestamp":"1708180200.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe whole purpose of Netflow is to provide information about data flows, so correct answer would be “C”.
