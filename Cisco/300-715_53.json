It also allows multiple authenticated 802.1X, MAB, or web authorization clients on the data VLAN. When a hub or access point is connected to an 802.1X port, multi-auth mode provides enhanced security over the multi-hosts mode by requiring authentication of each connected client. For non-802.1X devices, MAB, or web-based authentication, can be used as the fallback method for individual host authentications, which allows different hosts to be authenticated through different methods on a single port.","comment_id":"915473","poster":"redpassion","timestamp":"1717594980.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"content":"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/8021x/98523-8021x-cat-layer3.html#MDA\n\" Introduction\n\nMulti-Domain Authentication allows an IP Phone and a PC to authenticate on the same switch port while it places them on appropriate Voice and Data VLANs.
