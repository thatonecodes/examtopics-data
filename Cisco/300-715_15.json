And screenshot in the question shows, that identity group really \"is being assigned instead of the logical profile\", which is answer C).\n\n2. reason (eBook SISE):\n“Even though ENDPOINT IDENTITY GROUPS were useful in very early versions of ISE, their use for profiling has been deprecated in favor of using actual endpoint profiles or logical profiles directly in the authorization policy.\n...\nToday, ENDPOINT IDENTITY GROUPS are used for a different purpose. They are used for a MAC Address Management (MAM) model, where you can create a STATIC LIST of MAC addresses to be authorized specifically (for example, a list of all Apple iPads that are owned by the company so they can be differentiated from personally owned iPads).”","poster":"NikoTomas"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/87010-exam-300-715-topic-1-question-169-discussion/","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
