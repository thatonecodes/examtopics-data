This is because the buffer is designed to compensate for jitter by holding packets for a short period of time before forwarding them. However, if the buffer size is too large, it can cause packets to be delayed for too long, leading to quality issues.","poster":"re_j0hn","timestamp":"1719548160.0","comment_id":"936066"},{"poster":"J_W","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1717468860.0","comment_id":"914062","content":"Selected Answer: C\nJitter compensation buffers are used to mitigate the effects of network jitter, which is the variation in packet arrival times. By increasing the size of the jitter compensation buffer, the system is able to store and hold incoming packets for a longer period, allowing for greater flexibility in handling variations in packet arrival times.\n\nHowever, increasing the buffer size introduces additional delay in the system. Packets are held in the buffer for a longer duration before being forwarded, resulting in increased overall transport delay. This increased delay can lead to quality issues, especially in real-time applications such as voice or video, where timely delivery of packets is crucial.\n\nTherefore, increasing the jitter compensation buffer may help in smoothing out variations in packet arrival times, but it can also introduce increased delay and potentially impact the quality of the transmitted data."}],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1685846460},{"id":"pz2zVvRLXRs23eRa978h","isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_text":"What is the most important operational driver in building a resilient and secure modular network design?","question_id":192,"choices":{"D":"Dependencies on hardware or software that is difficult to scale","C":"Increase time spent on developing new features","A":"Minimize app downtime","B":"Reduce the frequency of failures requiring human intervention"},"exam_id":331,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1665374280,"timestamp":"2022-10-10 05:58:00","answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/84947-exam-400-007-topic-1-question-31-discussion/","answer":"B","discussion":[{"poster":"ningchn","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"819326","timestamp":"1708700280.0","content":"it should be B https://www.testpreptraining.com/tutorial/developing-procedures-to-ensure-the-resilience-of-solution-in-production/"},{"poster":"Rim007","timestamp":"1727923500.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOperational driver , it should be B.

This reduces the potential for downtime, improves the overall user experience, and increases the productivity of IT teams who can focus on strategic tasks rather than constantly firefighting issues.\n\nWhile minimizing application downtime (option A) and reducing dependencies on difficult-to-scale hardware or software (option D) are important considerations in network design, they are often outcomes or results of achieving the primary goal of reducing the frequency of failures requiring human intervention. Option C, increasing time spent on developing new features, is not directly related to building a resilient and secure modular network design, although it may be an important consideration in other aspects of network management and innovation.","timestamp":"1717469280.0"},{"comment_id":"895019","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe key here is OPERATIONAL driver\nhttps://www.testpreptraining.com/tutorial/developing-procedures-to-ensure-the-resilience-of-solution-in-production/","poster":"bdp123","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1715428320.0"},{"content":"It should be B","comments":[{"poster":"ying162","comment_id":"727720","timestamp":"1701020400.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"this is questionable but I stick with A as the answer.
