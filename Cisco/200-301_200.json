It's not that you want it and you can have it.\n \nPort-based authentication means implementing 802.1x using a RADIUS or TACACS server. It really depends on your existing infrastructure and budget. Applying 802.1x for every endpoint in an organisation requires enormous work, and reduces flexibility in everyday operation. If a network already has port-based authentication, very good, keep using it. If it doesn't have yet, no need to force yourself use it. You would need to set up an AAA server, install certificates on endpoints, configure the switch, and every time when a device is moved or changed you have to reconfigure it.\n \nB can effectively stop most unauthorised devices connecting to the network.
