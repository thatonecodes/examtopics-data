This is a weird one. You cant have 'aaa authentication' strings in the config unless 'aaa new-model' was defined first. \n\nYou cannot remove 'aaa new-model' from a config ether. Once it is enabled, it's enabled for life unless you configured it and didnt save the config and rebooted the device.\n\nAs others here pointed out saying aaa new-model was omitted from the output doesnt mean its gone, we have to assume it's there. \n\nThe 'aaa authentication login' strings are throwing off the entire question. If those were omitted too then there is no way to actually tell aaa new-model was turned on and we can safely assume aaa is not active on this device\n\nHowever, On one hand, line con 0 is calling for group1 which will read from radius first and if not, it will take the line password. \n\nIt's a catch 22. If it does use 'line' then we interpret that aaa new-model as turned on. but then because aaa new-model is turned on, your username and password should authenticate you into the console. \n\nIn a lab, i have created this exact scenario and the answer is indeed B. but with aaa new-model turned on.","comment_id":"1004391","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1694395560.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"bendarkel","timestamp":"1677428400.0","comment_id":"822671","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer."},{"timestamp":"1676877180.0","comment_id":"814919","content":"Selected Answer: B\nconsole password, no username.","poster":"well123","upvote_count":"3"},{"comments":[{"poster":"StefanOT2","content":"Sorry typo.
