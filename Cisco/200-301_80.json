Avoid using an NVI configuration. Verify reachability by sending a ping to 192.168.100.1 from R3.\n2. Configure R3 to dynamically receive an IP address on Ethernet0/2 from the DHCP server.\n3. Configure R1 as an NTP server and R2 as a client, not as a peer, using the IP address 10.1.2.1.\n4. Configure SSH access from R1 to R3, while excluding access via other remote connection protocols using the user root and password s3cret on router R3 using RSA.
