Different systems may use incompatible protocols, data formats, or security standards, making it difficult to correlate and analyze security events across the entire network. This can hinder the ability to detect and respond to threats in a timely manner.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Doobiedoo"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"a network security skills shortage","B":"too many overlapping controls","C":"too many disparate solutions and technology silos","A":"an overabundance of manual processes"},"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which issue poses a challenge for security architects who want end-to-end visibility of their networks?"},{"id":"xxOJEt4B41EyBaeRLHNH","unix_timestamp":1713285660,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"Enterprise XYZ wants to implement fast convergence on their network and optimize timers for OSPF.
