When multiple paths to the root bridge have the same cost, the port priority is the tiebreaker.\nIn this scenario, we want SW2 to use interface Gi 0/1 as its root port and interface Gi 0/0 as its alternate port. To achieve this, we must configure the port priority of Gi 0/1 on SW1 to 32, which is lower than the default priority of '128' on Gi 0/0. By doing so, interface Gi 0/1 on SW1 will advertise BPDUs with a higher priority than those advertised from interface Gi 0/0.
