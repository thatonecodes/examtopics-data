All the BGP Route Reflectors are Server and the other iBGP peers are Client in this topology. BGP Route Reflectors are connected to all iBGP Peers and they learn the BGP routes form iBGP Peers, then they send this routes to orther iBGP Peers. Here, full mesh requirement is bypassed, all iBGP peers do not need to be connected eachother. So, the iBGP connections in a BGP topology is reduced.\n\nB.
