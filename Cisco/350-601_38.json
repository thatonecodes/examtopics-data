HSRP version 2 supports group numbers from 0 to 4095.\n✑ For IPv4, uses the IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.102 or the IPv6 multicast address FF02::66 to send hello packets instead of the multicast address of\n224.0.0.2, which is used by HSRP version 1.\n✑ Uses the MAC address range from 0000.0C9F.F000 to 0000.0C9F.FFFF for IPv4 and 0005.73A0.0000 through 0005.73A0.0FFF for IPv6 addresses.
