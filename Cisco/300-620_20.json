This ensures that traffic marked with specific DSCP values (e.g., AF31 and CS6 in this case) is handled with the appropriate priority across the entire network path, preventing delays or packet drops.","comment_id":"1352279","poster":"prospio971"},{"comment_id":"840770","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTranslate policy has to be enabled.\n\nIn order to preserve the proper QoS Level of the packet and avoid high priority packets from being delayed or dropped, you can use a DSCP translation policy for traffic that goes between multiple PODs connected by an IPN.\n\nAlso Note \nFor traffic passing through the IPN, do not map any DSCP values to CS6.\n\nWhich leaves only C as viable answer.

By default, EPGs in ACI cannot communicate with each other unless a contract is explicitly defined or the VRF is set to \"unenforced\" mode.

If this feature is not enabled, the subnets configured under the bridge domain are not pushed down to leaf switches, and routing will not occur. In addition, a bridge domain with Unicast Routing disabled will not learn any IP address as an endpoint. Thus, that bridge domain will be used only for Layer 2 communications, and endpoints in that bridge domain should have their default gateways outside Cisco ACI.\n\nUnicast Routing enabled without subnet is not a recommended approach. If Unicast Routing is enabled without any bridge domain subnets configured, IP information in the bridge domain can still be learned through ARP in the data plane, but no routing will occur because there will be no SVI to perform routing on the bridge domain.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-739989.html","timestamp":"1723731300.0","comment_id":"981752","poster":"Mr_Certifiable","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/118185-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-187-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-08-15 16:15:00","answer":"C","question_images":[],"exam_id":312,"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"proxy ARP","A":"unknown unicast flooding","B":"ARP flooding","C":"unicast routing"},"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1692108900,"question_id":98,"question_text":"Which feature should be disabled on a bridge domain when a default gateway for endpoints is on an external device instead of a Cisco ACI bridge domain SVI?","answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"rcORwuwCrLc3xZB2n7LG","exam_id":312,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"Where are STP BPDUSs flooded in Cisco ACI fabric?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/102791-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-188-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2023-03-16 10:29:00","question_images":[],"question_id":99,"answer":"D","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732980480.0","content":"D - \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-apic/211236-ACI-operation-with-L2-switches-and-Spann.pdf","poster":"Mr_Certifiable","comment_id":"910278"},{"content":"FD vlan = Front Pannel vlan https://community.cisco.com/t5/application-centric-infrastructure/internal-vlan-vs-front-panel-fd-vlan-what-s-the-difference/td-p/3824539","poster":"imanus","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"900083","timestamp":"1731851520.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nACI floods STP Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to the VXLAN network identifier (VNID)\nassigned to the FD VLAN (VNID is assigned through the VLAN pool so encapsulation has to be\npart of same VLAN pool to be in part of same STP domain).
