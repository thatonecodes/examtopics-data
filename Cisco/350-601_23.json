With this support the same physical Ethernet port can carry both Ethernet traffic and Fibre Channel traffic.\n\nFCoE uplink ports connect to upstream Ethernet switches using the FCoE protocol for Fibre Channel traffic. This allows both the Fibre Channel traffic and Ethernet traffic to flow on the same physical Ethernet link.\nYou can configure the same Ethernet port as any of the following:\n\nFCoE uplink port—As an FCoE uplink port for only Fibre Channel traffic.\n\nUplink port—As an Ethernet port for only Ethernet traffic.\n\nUnified uplink port—As a unified uplink port to carry both Ethernet and Fibre Channel traffic.","poster":"benguela","timestamp":"1690356240.0"},{"comment_id":"679954","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1664209620.0","poster":"GuyThatTakesDumps","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFCoE uplink"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"674845","timestamp":"1663741080.0","content":"All right but the figure illustrates an FC SAN then I think that we can assume FC and/or FCoE protocols are in use.

It's a bit of a trick question and I think everyone is assuming FC and/or FCoE protocols are in use. Had the question specifically stated that FCoE protocol or that FC switches were in use, D would have been a good choice. Since only \"storage server traffic\" was mentioned, this leaves it ambiguous. What if the the storage server traffic is using iSCSI or NFS protocols (like NetApp)? Also, the N5K1 and N5K2 switches are presumably the old Nexus 5000 series switches, which had unified ports you can configure as Ethernet, FCoE or native FC. Again, the question doesn't specifically state the protocol in use or mention FC or FCoE. Choice B is the best answer in my opinion.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"621865","timestamp":"1656104640.0","poster":"lex2021"},{"comment_id":"608930","poster":"Havoc5280","timestamp":"1653859740.0","content":"Since you will need to map the interface you create to a VSAN, FCoE Uplink would need to be used.","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"I think D is correct\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/GUI-User-Guides/Network-Mgmt/4-1/b_UCSM_Network_Mgmt_Guide_4_1/b_UCSM_Network_Mgmt_Guide_4_1_chapter_0100.html#concept_D71DD6D9521543B6AF88365C560623B0\nYou can configure the same Ethernet port as any of the following:\nFCoE uplink port—As an FCoE uplink port for only Fibre Channel traffic.\nUplink port—As an Ethernet port for only Ethernet traffic.\nUnified uplink port—As a unified uplink port to carry both Ethernet and Fibre Channel traffic.\n\nAccording to question I understand you need FC traffic only in these ports","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"601667","timestamp":"1652543400.0","poster":"Cevel"},{"content":"Why not D?","comments":[{"comment_id":"601911","poster":"JCGO","content":"Agree on D.
