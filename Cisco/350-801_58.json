CBWFQ is a congestion management method to guarantee bandwidth to each class of traffic, but it does not deliver priority to voice and video as LLQ method do.\nTraffic Policy and Shaping are congestion avoidance methods, they just support QoS in saturated links.\nAnd DiffServ is a QoS model that offer special treatment to the different class of traffic using marking, classification, congestion avoidance, congestion management (LLQ in this case for voice and video priority).
