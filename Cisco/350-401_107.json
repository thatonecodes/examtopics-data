The idea of a sequence number is to put the interesting traffic where you want it to be on the ACE. For example, if you have already permitted all traffic for a subnet and now wants to deny a single host from that subnet, then you will use sequence number to place it above the earlier permit statement, because ACL is processed from top-to-bottom. If you put the deny statement without a sequence number, it will append the ace at the bottom of the list, and it won't be effective for the purpose that you want to achieve.\n\nTherefore A is the correct answer because 172.20.10.1 is not overlapping with 172.16.0.0, and the list will be appended below. \n\nChuckzero#sh ip access-lists \nExtended IP access list 100\n 10 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 any\n 20 permit ip 172.16.0.0 0.0.15.255 any\n 30 deny ip host 172.20.10.1 any\n\nChuckzero#","comment_id":"995424"}],"poster":"AbandonedDonner","content":"Correct is answer C\n\nAnswer A cannot be correct, as if the entry is added without sequence number is placed at the end, so its processed last.
