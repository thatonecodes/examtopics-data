You can use CEF mode when line cards are not available for CEF switching, or when you need to use features not compatible with distributed CEF switching.\n\nDistributed CEF (dCEF) mode - When dCEF is enabled, line cards maintain identical copies of the FIB and adjacency tables. The line cards can perform the express forwarding by themselves, and this relieves the main processor - Gigabit Route Processor (GRP) - of involvement in the switching operation. This is the only switching method available on the Cisco 12000 Series Router.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/12000-series-routers/47321-ciscoef.html","comments":[{"comment_id":"1068383","poster":"ConqiD","content":"Excellent explanation, thank you!","timestamp":"1715497320.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"1684951980.0","upvote_count":"22","comment_id":"726164"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1732459260.0","comment_id":"1217447","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D are correct"}]},{"id":"cMP6IpMgTJ8ThUpmn0sh","timestamp":"2022-11-24 21:15:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/88578-exam-350-401-topic-1-question-616-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1669320900,"exam_id":324,"question_id":642,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"AE","answer_description":"","answers_community":["AE (100%)"],"topic":"1","question_text":"You need to weigh the pros and cons of deploying a premise-based data center versus using a cloud-based data center deployment.
