The distribution algorithm determines the order in which the phones in the hunt list will ring. The four distribution algorithms available in Cisco UCM are:\n\nTop down: The first phone in the hunt list will ring first, followed by the second phone, and so on.\nCircular: The phones in the hunt list will ring in a circular order. The first phone in the list will ring first, followed by the last phone, then the second to last, and so on.\nLongest idle time: The phone in the hunt list that has been idle the longest will ring first.\nBroadcast: All of the phones in the hunt list will ring at the same time.\nTo configure a distribution algorithm, you must create a hunt list and then specify the distribution algorithm in the hunt list configuration.","timestamp":"1712009400.0","poster":"Testme1235","upvote_count":"1"}]}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99352-exam-300-815-topic-1-question-122-discussion/","exam_id":320,"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1"},{"id":"RVpddYcvasYBUwUaRdol","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-18 15:37:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/120918-exam-300-815-topic-1-question-123-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
