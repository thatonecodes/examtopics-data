Their characteristic is a continuous signal\nwith a high duty cycle across the entire affected band. They may operate in 2.4GHz\nor 5GHz. The presence of a jammer signal is reflective of an attack against your network. Many jammers operate in the 2.4GHz band because this band is categorized as\nIndustrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) and can be used by any transmitter (under\nsome relaxed regulatory conditions). Most of the 5GHz band is not ISM, which makes\nit less susceptible to interferences from non-802.11 devices. However, different countries have different rules, and you may see in non-ISM 5GHz channels devices that\nwere designed for a country where such operation is allowed.","poster":"skh"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer":"B"},{"id":"7sTicw3IbiRfAjAaDgQd","unix_timestamp":1626801720,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1645390140.0","comment_id":"552276","poster":"rrahim","upvote_count":"8","content":"Perform rping on both controllers to check if the peer is reachable. \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-8/config-guide/b_cg88/high_availability.html"},{"content":"right command is rping , so A is correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1298077","timestamp":"1728978300.0","poster":"Farhad123"},{"timestamp":"1689967320.0","poster":"Cleytonsc","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A like other comments","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"958860"},{"timestamp":"1677052680.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nExplanation:\nrping - Check IPsec status on both controllers to check which link is broken RP or RMI.
