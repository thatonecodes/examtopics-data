Cisco Intersight\n\nExplanation:\n\nCisco Intersight is a cloud-based SaaS and on-premises hybrid management platform designed for data center infrastructure management. It supports third-party integrations with tools such as VMware, ServiceNow, Ansible, Terraform, and other automation/orchestration platforms. Intersight provides intelligent automation, monitoring, and analytics for modern data centers.\n\nWhy not the other options?\n • A. Cisco DNA Center → Used for enterprise network automation, primarily for campus and branch networks, not data centers.\n • B. Cisco UCS Manager → Manages only Cisco UCS servers within a single domain and does not provide third-party integrations.\n • D. Cisco UCS Director → An older orchestration tool for UCS and HyperFlex, but Intersight has replaced it as the modern solution for managing data center infrastructure with third-party integrations."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nProvided answer is correct","comment_id":"1152547","poster":"Muste","timestamp":"1723892580.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"working_on_hcip","timestamp":"1712263020.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI´d selected C based on Woonesuf and Cisco comment:\n\n\"Cisco Intersight infrastructure services include the deployment, monitoring, management, and support of your physical and virtual infrastructure...In addition, Cisco provides integrations to third-party operations tools, starting with ServiceNow, to allow customers to use their existing solutions more efficiently.\"\n\nReference: https://intersight.com/help/saas/getting_started/overview","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1025154"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nCisco UCS Manager for simple infrastructure management\nCisco Intersight for cloud-based management of Cisco UCS and Cisco HyperFlex","upvote_count":"1","poster":"tcp69","timestamp":"1697184060.0","comment_id":"869211","comments":[{"timestamp":"1701373020.0","poster":"tcp69","comment_id":"910486","upvote_count":"1","content":"UCS Director is right answer."}]},{"comment_id":"818704","timestamp":"1692751680.0","poster":"Woonesuf","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"Cisco Intersight infrastructure services include the deployment, monitoring, management, and support of your physical and virtual infrastructure...In addition, Cisco provides integrations to third-party operations tools, starting with ServiceNow, to allow customers to use their existing solutions more efficiently.\"\n\nReference: https://intersight.com/help/saas/getting_started/overview"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (64%)","D (27%)","9%"],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_id":217,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1677120480,"exam_id":291,"timestamp":"2023-02-23 03:48:00","question_text":"Which Cisco platform is used to manage data center infrastructure through third-party tools and system integrations?","choices":{"A":"Cisco DNA Center","C":"Cisco Intersight","B":"Cisco UCS Manager","D":"Cisco UCS Director"}},{"id":"bJuJYCJVaicsWWK84Gqq","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (70%)","D (30%)"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-901/image19.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/101328-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-295-discussion/","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"herrmann69","comment_id":"1150008","timestamp":"1707904560.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-put\nIf the target resource does not have a current representation and the PUT successfully creates one, then the origin server MUST inform the user agent by sending a 201 (Created) response.\n\nC is also referencing the dogbreed with example-jukebox:dogbreed\nD is using only example:dogbreed"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1725613020.0","poster":"727b8c8","comment_id":"1279494","content":"due to syntax mismatch it cannot be D, it has to be example-jukebox, which is only present in C"},{"timestamp":"1708175820.0","poster":"Muste","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1152552","content":"Selected Answer: D\nwhile put request can also result 201 but mostly it's POST request that results the 201"},{"timestamp":"1702489500.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"peterbuza","comment_id":"1095710","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think it is C.
