It is calculated from the router advertising the route to the network.\nFor example in the topology below, suppose router A & B are exchanging their routing tables for the first time. Router B says ג€Hey, the best metric (cost) from me to IOWA is 50 and the metric from you to IOWA is 90ג€ and advertises it to router A. Router A considers the first metric (50) as the Advertised distance. The second metric (90), which is from NEVADA to IOWA (through IDAHO), is called the Feasible distance.\n\nThe reported distance is calculated in the same way of calculating the metric. By default (K1 = 1, K2 = 0, K3 = 1, K4 = 0, K5 = 0), the metric is calculated as follows:\n\nFeasible successor is the backup route. To be a feasible successor, the route must have an Advertised distance (AD) less than the Feasible distance (FD) of the current successor route.\nFeasible distance (FD): The sum of the AD plus the cost between the local router and the next-hop router. The router must calculate the FD of all paths to choose the best path to put into the routing table.\nNote: Although the new CCNA exam does not have EIGRP topic but you should learn the basic knowledge of this routing protocol.","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04300/0028900001.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04300/0029000001.png"]},{"id":"i60usQQW3NkqNkDt3hsr","timestamp":"2021-01-25 18:43:00","question_id":695,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/43265-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-368-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1611596580,"exam_id":288,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
