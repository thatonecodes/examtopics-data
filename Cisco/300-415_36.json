This is referred to as grey list action at Umbrella Cloud.\nOne potential limitation in using intelligent proxy unicast IP addresses is the probability of the datacenter going down when the client is trying to send the traffic to the intelligent proxy unicast IP address. This is a scenario where a client has completed DNS resolution for a domain which falls under grey-listed domain and client’s HTTP/(S) traffic is being sent to one of the obtained intelligent proxy unicast IP address.
