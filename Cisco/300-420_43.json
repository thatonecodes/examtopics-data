This ensures that the control plane can manage the mapping database efficiently, avoiding potential performance issues that might arise if control plane functionality were distributed across fabric edge nodes.\n\nOption D (in a design where fabric edge nodes are unable to provide control plane functionality) could also seem relevant, but the best answer for scalability and optimal performance, especially for endpoint mobility, is B.","comment_id":"1313065","poster":"PicoOstrava","timestamp":"1731764940.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"muffedtrims","timestamp":"1730220600.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B after reading Swiz005 source","comment_id":"1304594"},{"timestamp":"1729371780.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B\nSource - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Campus/cisco-sda-design-guide.html#:~:text=One%20other%20consideration,should%20be%20used.","comment_id":"1300173","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Swiz005"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/149806-exam-300-420-topic-1-question-329-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1"},{"id":"3DSMmIzMvcIeUhdyPWs6","answer":"D","unix_timestamp":1648486920,"question_id":215,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
