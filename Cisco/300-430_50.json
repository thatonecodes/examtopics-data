This allows the AP to communicate directly with the FlexConnect controller without interference from other VLANs. Additionally, when configuring the switch port as an access port, ensure that the native VLAN on the switch port matches the VLAN assigned to the WLAN.\n\nIt is also important to configure the AP with the appropriate VLAN and SSID settings to ensure that it can communicate with the FlexConnect controller and provide wireless access to clients.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"859371","poster":"JimDiGriz"},{"comment_id":"783944","timestamp":"1689998040.0","poster":"itapase0314","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAccess port works but Trunk port on configuration guide, as other SSIDs potentially requires local-switching.\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/7-2/configuration/guide/cg/cg_flexconnect.html"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAP is in local mode.
