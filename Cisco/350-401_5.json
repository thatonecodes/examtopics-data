The vSwitch then forwards the traffic to the destination virtual machine. The vSwitch can also be configured to provide network connectivity between virtual machines on different hosts in a cluster.\n\nThe hypervisor, on the other hand, is responsible for managing the virtual machines and providing access to physical resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking.
