It's closely related to data localization, which is the practice of storing data within the physical boundaries of a country or region where it originated. \nData sovereignty is important because it ensures that user data is regulated by the legal framework in place where those users are citizens. It also gives countries control of data created and stored within their borders. \nSome examples of data sovereignty include: \nThe General Data Protection Order (GDPR): From the European Union (EU), which defines how the data of EU citizens is protected","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1725367320.0","comment_id":"1277576","poster":"noxkrugger","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOK i agreed with C"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
