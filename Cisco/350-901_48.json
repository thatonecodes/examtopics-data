An external password manager is a good solution for Secret B, which requires per-user access control.

Move from synchronous to asynchronous interactions with the service and implement a message queue**¹²³⁴⁵. This is because synchronous communication creates a **chain** of requests between microservices that can cause **delays** and **bottlenecks**¹²⁴. Asynchronous communication allows microservices to use **messages** or **polling** to communicate with other microservices without waiting for a response¹²³⁴.
