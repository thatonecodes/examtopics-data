SSH is a secure protocol that allows Ansible to remotely configure and manage devices or systems without the need for an agent on the target machine.\n\nOther Options:\nB. Python: Python itself is a programming language and does not inherently use a specific port like TCP 22 for configuration management or communication.\n\nC. Puppet: Puppet typically uses a custom agent-server architecture and communicates over TCP port 8140 by default, not port 22.\n\nD. Chef: Chef uses a client-server model where the clients (nodes) communicate with the Chef server over TCP port 443 (HTTPS) by default.","timestamp":"1729626960.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1711514460.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1183859","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works","comment_id":"885306","poster":"DavidCisco","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1682863800.0"}],"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_images":[]},{"id":"MjrgdzT6OMzzMiVdAkhk","answers_community":["C (92%)","8%"],"timestamp":"2021-10-12 15:46:00","choices":{"A":"UDP is used when low latency is optimal, and TCP is used when latency is tolerable.","C":"TCP is used when data reliability is critical, and UDP is used when missing packets are acceptable.","B":"TCP is used when dropped data is more acceptable, and UDP is used when data is accepted out-of-order.","D":"UDP is used when data is highly interactive, and TCP is used when data is time-sensitive."},"answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_text":"Under which condition is TCP preferred over UDP?","exam_id":288,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"poster":"i_am_confused","timestamp":"1655918640.0","upvote_count":"22","comment_id":"620529","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC explains why you would pick TCP over UDP.
