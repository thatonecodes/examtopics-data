A prefix list consists of an IP address and a bit mask. The IP address can be a classful network, a subnet, or a single host route. The bit mask is entered as a number from 1 to 32.\nPrefix lists are configured to match an exact prefix length or a prefix range. The ge and le keywords are used to specify a range of the prefix lengths to match, providing more flexible configuration than can be configured with just the network/length argument. The prefix list is processed using an exact match when neither ge nor le keyword is entered.\nTherefore in this case the exact 172.16.1.0/26 network is permitted while other networks are denied.\n(Reference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/ip_route/command/reference/ip2_i2gt.html)","exam_id":296},{"id":"bJzUGOXpTG1esPqI3Mq9","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/n18854500000.png"],"exam_id":296,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14555-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-536-discussion/","choices":{"E":"172.17.3.128/25","D":"172.17.3.0/25","A":"172.17.0.0/30","C":"172.17.2.0/24","B":"172.17.1.0/24"},"unix_timestamp":1582234200,"answer_ET":"F. 10.140.0.0/24","discussion":[{"comment_id":"53171","upvote_count":"1","content":"A. 172.17.0.0/30\nF. 10.140.0.0/24","timestamp":"1582234200.0","poster":"diegonamaste"}],"isMC":true,"question_id":353,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/n18854500001.png"],"answer":"F. 10.140.0.0/24","timestamp":"2020-02-20 22:30:00","answer_description":"Explanation -\nTo understand the output of the show ip eigrp topology all-links command command, let`s analyze an entry (we choose the second entry because it is better for demonstration than the first one)\n\nThe first line tells us there is only 1 successor for the path to 10.140.0.0/24 network but there are 2 lines below. So we can deduce that one line is used for successor and the other is used for another route to that network. Each of these two lines has 2 parameters: the first one (156160 or 157720) is the Feasible\nDistance (FD) and the second (128256 or 155160) is the Advertised Distance (AD) of that route.\nThe next thing we want to know is: if the route via 172.17.10.2 (the last line) would become the feasible successor for the 10.140.0.0/24 network. To figure out, we have to compare the Advertised Distance of that route with the Feasible Distance of the successor`s route, if AD < FD then it will become the feasible successor.\nIn this case, because AD (155160) < FD (156160) so it will become the feasible successor. Therefore we can conclude the network 10.140.0.0/24 has 1 feasible successor.\nBecause the question asks about feasible successor so we just need to focus on entries which have more paths than the number of successor. In this case, we find 3 entries that are in blue boxes because they have only 1 successor but has 2 paths, so the last path can be the feasible successor.\nBy comparing the value of AD (of that route) with the FD (of successor`s route) we figure out there are 2 entries will have the feasible successor: the first and the second entry. The third entry has AD = FD (30720) so we eliminate it.","answers_community":[],"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nBigBids Incorporated is a worldwide auction provider.
