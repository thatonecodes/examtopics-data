It is used to differentiate between different wireless networks within range of each other. When a device wants to connect to a specific wireless network, it needs to know the SSID of that network. The SSID is used during the process of associating a device with a wireless access point or router.\n\nThe other options are not characteristics of an SSID:\n\nA. File sharing between endpoints is not a function of the SSID. File sharing is typically related to network sharing settings and protocols.\n\nB. Protection against spyware is not a function of the SSID. Security measures against spyware typically involve antivirus software, firewalls, and other security mechanisms.\n\nD. Eliminating network piggybacking is not a direct function of the SSID. Security measures such as encryption (e.g., WPA2 or WPA3) and proper authentication mechanisms help prevent unauthorized access and network piggybacking.","poster":"16BitRun"}],"question_id":321,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-12-28 05:52:00","isMC":true,"answer":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/129522-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1287-discussion/","topic":"1"},{"id":"8p1ChYjo7luC2G5GU7HP","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":288,"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/129520-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1288-discussion/","question_id":322,"timestamp":"2023-12-28 05:51:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"key word is authentication, ABD is about accss control.

AAA Override and the IP address of the server\n\nExplanation:\n\nAAA Override: This feature on a WLC allows the WLC to override the user roles based on the RADIUS attributes received from the RADIUS server. This is important for dynamic role assignment and other policy-related decisions.\n\nThe IP address of the server: This is crucial for the WLC to know where the RADIUS server is located so that it can send authentication requests to it.\n\nThe other options (A, B, and D) are not directly related to RADIUS server configuration for wireless authentication on a WLC:\n\nA. Client Exclusion and SSH: Client exclusion is related to disconnecting clients based on certain criteria, and SSH is a secure shell for accessing the WLC.\n\nB. Network Access Control State and SSH: Network Access Control State is not directly related to RADIUS server configuration, and SSH is for secure shell access to the WLC.\n\nD. 802.1x and the MAC address of the server: 802.1x is an IEEE standard for port-based network access control, and specifying the MAC address of the RADIUS server is not a common configuration for RADIUS on a WLC.
