It uses a shared tree architecture to support interdomain multicast communication.\n\nMSDP (Option D): MSDP (Multicast Source Discovery Protocol) is used to exchange information between domains about multicast sources. MSDP allows routers in one domain to learn about multicast sources in other domains and to forward traffic to those sources. MSDP operates at the edge of each domain and is used in conjunction with BIDIR-PIM.\n\nIn summary, BIDIR-PIM and MSDP are two protocols that are deployed to achieve interdomain multicast communication between multicast sources and receivers.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Clauster","content":"You are incorrect, i just asked bard and it gave me B and C as the correct answers","comment_id":"969422","timestamp":"1722547140.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Clauster","timestamp":"1722547140.0","comment_id":"969423","content":"Sorry C and D"}]}]},{"timestamp":"1690874760.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nMSDP (Multicast interdomain discovery protocol) should exchange routing information using BGP (Student learning guide v1.4. p 274)","upvote_count":"2","poster":"namibdigger","comment_id":"640429","comments":[{"content":"BGP itself differs from MP-BGP operation.
