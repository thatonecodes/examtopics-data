This mode allows for the separation of management on a shared appliance by creating multiple virtual firewalls, each with its own security policies, interfaces, and administrators. This allows for a more granular control of network access and security, as well as logical separation of different security zones on the same physical appliance.\nThis deployment mode is typically used in large enterprises or service providers to provide secure multitenancy, segregating different customers or departments on the same device while keeping their security policies separate.","upvote_count":"4"}]},{"id":"b7s5zkpduQp4se3kFwfl","topic":"1","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
