Proper configuration of transmit power is important for ensuring a wireless network is operating at its highest capacity.\n\nReference: https://documentation.meraki.com/MR/Radio_Settings/Transmit_Power_and_Antenna_Configuration\n\nAP coverage area or the cell size, according to this Cisco link, there are two ways to reduce the AP coverage area:\n+ Tuning Cell Size with Transmit Power\n+ Tuning Cell Size with Data Rates\n\nSetting the transmit power level is a simplistic approach to defining the cell size, but that is not the only variable involved. The cell size of an AP is actually a compromise between its transmit power and the data rates that it offers.\n\nTo design a wireless LAN for best performance, you would most likely need to disable some of the lower data rates. For example, you could disable the 1, 2, and 5.5 Mbps rates to force clients to use higher rates and better modulation and coding schemes. That would improve throughput for individual clients and would also benefit the BSS as a whole by eliminating the slower rates that use more time on a channel."}],"upvote_count":"9","content":"B,D and E are right answers, it suppose to chosse 3 not 2 only","poster":"jacop","timestamp":"1623325260.0","comment_id":"378984"},{"content":"B & E are the correct answers","timestamp":"1620294420.0","upvote_count":"11","poster":"amgue","comment_id":"350891"},{"poster":"PureInertiaCopy","content":"This confused me but then I realised. \nIf you're using the 2.4GHz then it has a different coverage area to 5GHz anyways.
