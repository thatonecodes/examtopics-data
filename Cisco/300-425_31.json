This management must allow subnets to be assigned consistently with the physical location of users within the organization.\n\nThe correct choice, D. Interface groups, directly focuses on the administration of subnets and their logical assignment within a larger network, which is the primary goal in this scenario. Interface groups allow for the grouping of multiple network interfaces on the controller, where each group can be associated with a different subnet. This makes it much easier to assign specific subnets to users in different locations, ensuring that the network structure is organized and that access and security policies are appropriately applied based on where the user is connecting.","timestamp":"1717503420.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\ntricky question !\nYou may solve the case with an AP group or with an interface group\nIt depends if an anchor / foreign situation is involved :\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-2/config-guide/b_cg82/b_cg82_chapter_010101110.html\nIn most cases, a mapping WLAN<->interface in each AP group per location is the solution.

Now consider a scenario where 25 users are associated to each AP. That would result in 2500 users who share a single VLAN. Some customer designs can require substantially smaller subnet sizes. One way to deal with this is to break up the WLAN into multiple segments. The AP grouping feature of the WLC allows a single WLAN to be supported across multiple dynamic interfaces (VLANs) on the controller. This is done when a group of APs is mapped to a specific dynamic interface. APs can be grouped logically by employee workgroup or physically by location. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-vlan/71477-ap-group-vlans-wlc.html","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"568610"},{"comment_id":"529526","timestamp":"1642816860.0","content":"Provided answer is correct","poster":"kthekillerc","upvote_count":"3"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/64575-exam-300-425-topic-1-question-43-discussion/","choices":{"D":"interface groups","A":"WLC port groups","B":"RF groups","C":"AP groups"},"answer_images":[],"question_id":155}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"id":306,"provider":"Cisco","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"300-425","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":216,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":31},"__N_SSP":true}
