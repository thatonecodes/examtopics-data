In an FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) environment, PFC is used to prevent packet loss during congestion by pausing transmission on a specific priority class, but it requires proper Quality of Service (QoS) configuration to ensure that the correct traffic (in this case, FCoE traffic) is handled appropriately.\n\nEnabling the FCoE class in QoS on the Cisco Nexus 5672UP switches ensures that FCoE traffic is prioritized and that PFC frames are processed properly. This avoids congestion by managing the flow of FCoE traffic more effectively, preventing bottlenecks when high traffic load occurs.","poster":"lurker8000","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1063139","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIf the egress FC port is congested, the switch sends PFC frames to the servers (storage array).
