Wi-Fi channels are defined by a specific frequency range, and adjacent channels overlap with each other. If two access points are using channels that overlap, they will cause interference and reduce the quality of the Wi-Fi network.\n\nTo avoid interference, it's necessary to choose Wi-Fi channels that don't overlap. The most common Wi-Fi channels in use are 1, 6, and 11, and they don't overlap with each other. This means that if you have multiple access points in the same area, you can assign each access point a different channel from this set of channels to avoid interference.\n\nDifferent security settings, unique SSIDs, and different transmission speeds are not requirements for non-overlapping Wi-Fi channels, but they are important considerations for setting up a secure and efficient Wi-Fi network."},{"timestamp":"1728389940.0","comment_id":"1294704","upvote_count":"1","content":"B is correct","poster":"amroalbarham"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1713237300.0","comment_id":"1196303"},{"comment_id":"1141303","content":"Discontinuous is just an overly flowery way of saying non-overlapping.\nSo B.","poster":"Rando121","timestamp":"1707153720.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1699701360.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. Discontinuous frequency ranges\n\nIn the context of Wi-Fi, channels are specific frequency ranges within the radio spectrum that wireless networks use for communication. Nonoverlapping channels are those that do not interfere with each other. To achieve this, they must have discontinuous frequency ranges to avoid overlapping and causing interference.\n\nFor example, in the 2.4 GHz band commonly used by Wi-Fi networks, the nonoverlapping channels are typically 1, 6, and 11. Using these channels helps reduce interference between adjacent access points and improves overall network performance.","comment_id":"1067788","poster":"Cyber15"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1682516040.0","comment_id":"881662","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","poster":"StingVN"},{"timestamp":"1672509960.0","content":"can a guru explain the answer?","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"762801","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"poster":"laurvy36","content":"you have 1, 6 and 11 as channels, as nonoverlapping ones, not 123 or 456 etc","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1672740240.0","content":"those channels are discontinuous","comment_id":"764383","upvote_count":"1","poster":"laurvy36"}],"timestamp":"1672689360.0","comment_id":"763950"}]}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/93383-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-114-discussion/","question_text":"What is a requirement for nonoverlapping Wi-Fi channels?","exam_id":288,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-12-31 19:06:00","answer":"B","question_id":158,"choices":{"B":"discontinuous frequency ranges","A":"different security settings","C":"unique SSIDs","D":"different transmission speeds"},"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1672509960,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"QWXt4IkJq7xTINl4Rrxf","question_id":159,"timestamp":"2023-10-09 10:40:00","answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","exam_id":288,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"transport","B":"main","D":"tunnel","C":"aggressive"},"unix_timestamp":1696840800,"question_text":"Which IPsec encryption mode is appropriate when the destination of a packet differs from the security termination point?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/122949-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1140-discussion/","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1712652000.0","content":"correct answer\nsame network = transport\ndiffrent network = tunnel","comment_id":"1028648","upvote_count":"23"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1728344760.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1191259"}],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"BkV2hThEBo6LKU0G10tB","discussion":[{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1025891","timestamp":"1712340480.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nIt must be BE because of codes"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1191260","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB & E are correct","timestamp":"1728345120.0"},{"poster":"lmmujsi","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1185077","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nTo provide adequate protection against ARP spoofing attacks, the network administrator should configure the following on the access-layer switch:\n\nB. ip dhcp snooping vlan 1-4094 ip dhcp snooping ! interface Port-channel1 ip dhcp snooping trust\n\nThis configuration enables DHCP snooping for all VLANs and trusts DHCP messages on the uplink interface, which helps prevent attackers from using ARP spoofing to send false DHCP responses.\n\nE. ip arp inspection vlan 1-4094 ! interface Port-channel1 ip arp inspection trust\n\nThis configuration enables ARP inspection for all VLANs and trusts ARP packets on the uplink interface, which helps prevent ARP spoofing by verifying ARP requests and responses against a trusted database1.","timestamp":"1727556300.0"},{"poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1718138460.0","content":"Selected Answer: BE\nA.
