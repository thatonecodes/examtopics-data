The FlexVPN tunnels will terminate on encrypted traffic on an interface configured with an IP MTU of 1500, and the company has a security policy to drop fragmented traffic coming into or leaving the network. The tunnel will be used to transfer TFTP data between users and internal servers. When the TFTP traffic is not traversing a VPN, it can have a maximum IP packet size of 1500.
