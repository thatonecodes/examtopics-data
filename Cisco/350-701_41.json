NetFlow is a network protocol that provides visibility into network traffic flows.\n\nOption B, deploying a Cisco Stealthwatch Cloud sensor on the network to send data to Cisco Stealthwatch Cloud, is not the appropriate action to resolve this issue. Cisco Stealthwatch Cloud sensors are not deployed on the network itself but rely on data received from network devices, such as routers or switches, through protocols like NetFlow.","comments":[{"poster":"Stevens0103","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1699170000.0","content":"The answer is B.

It works by deploying a lightweight appliance, referred to as the Stealthwatch Cloud Sensor, in a virtual machine or server that can consume a variety of native sources of telemetry or extract metadata from network packet flow. It encrypts this metadata and sends it to the Stealthwatch Cloud analytics platform for analysis. Stealthwatch Cloud consumes metadata only.
