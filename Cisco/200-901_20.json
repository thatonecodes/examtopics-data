Containers\n\nExplanation:\n\nContainers provide a lightweight, portable, and isolated environment for running applications. Each containerized application runs in its own isolated environment, with its dependencies encapsulated. This allows for independent operating systems for each application, efficient resource allocation, and easy deployment on servers with other applications installed.\n\nVirtual machines (option B) could also be used, but they are typically heavier in terms of resource usage compared to containers. Virtual machines provide a full operating system virtualization, which might be overkill if the goal is to have independent OS instances for each application.\n\nTherefore, based on the described requirements, containers (option C) are the most suitable deployment type."},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nQuestion says OS for each application -> Virtual machine","timestamp":"1679067300.0","comment_id":"671559","poster":"aplicacion101"},{"timestamp":"1671488460.0","comment_id":"618843","poster":"macxsz","content":"Selected Answer: B\nVirtual machine obviously","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/76934-exam-200-901-topic-1-question-187-discussion/","answer":"B","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04301/0016200001.png"],"choices":{"B":"virtual machines","D":"bare metal","A":"hybrid","C":"containers"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"DGSGvPe8wsmOGigq36E1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1189948","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI vote for C","poster":"kymoni","timestamp":"1728135900.0"},{"poster":"moha413","comments":[{"timestamp":"1693210560.0","poster":"evilgoat","comment_id":"824614","upvote_count":"1","content":"i think we get the technical aspects of the solution, it's another question about semantics. does \"but an internet connection is still required to push or pull updates\" rule out c or not?"}],"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1689958680.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDistributed version control systems, explained\nDistributed version control systems let you check in, branch, and merge without connecting to the main server.

While it is true that DVCS allow developers to work on the codebase even when not connected to the Internet, this is not a unique benefit of DVCS. Other version control systems, such as centralized version control systems, also allow users to work on the codebase while offline.\n\nIn contrast, option A, \"encourages users to commit small places of work to the system more frequently,\" is a benefit specific to DVCS. Because each developer has a local copy of the codebase on their own machine, they can commit their work more frequently without the need to connect to a central server.

With a hybrid cloud deployment, you could use specialist encryption tools to secure the sensitive data in the private cloud, and then take advantage of the scalability and flexibility of the public cloud to handle the large volumes of log data.
