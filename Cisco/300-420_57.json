Use static routes tied to an IP SLA to prefer the primary path while a floating static route points to the backup connection.\n\nUsing static routes with IP SLA tracking allows you to prefer the primary L3VPN MPLS connection when it is available and automatically failover to the backup IPSEC VPN tunnel when the primary connection goes down. IP SLA tracking monitors the primary path's availability and adjusts the routing table accordingly. The floating static route, with a higher administrative distance, serves as a backup route that only becomes active when the primary route is unavailable.
