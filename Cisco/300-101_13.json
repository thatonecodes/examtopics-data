The only time a DR and BDR changes is if one of them is out of service. If the DR is out of service, the BDR becomes the DR, and a new BDR is selected. If the BDR is out of service, a new BDR is elected. In a multi- access network, the router that is powered on first will generally become the DR, since the DR/BDR process is not pre-emptive.\nCCNP Self-Study Second Edition P.243","choices":{"C":"RTA will take the place of DR only if both RTB and RTC fail.","B":"RTA will take the place of DR only if RTB fails.","D":"A new election will take place establishing an all new DR and BDR based on configured priority levels and MAC addresses.
