NBAR works with quality of services (QoS) features to help ensure that the network bandwidth is best used to fulfill its main primary objectives. The benefits of combining these features include the ability to guarantee bandwidth to critical applications, limit bandwidth to other applications, drop selective packets to avoid congestion, and mark packets appropriately so that the network and the service provider’s network can provide QoS from end to end.\nCisco CyberOps Associate CBROPS 200-201 Official Cert Guide\nBy Omar Santos"},{"poster":"Faio","comment_id":"1027245","upvote_count":"1","content":"The correct answer is A. total throughput on the interface of the router and NetFlow records.","timestamp":"1728296520.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"975848","timestamp":"1723134720.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThroughput - tells you how much data was transferred from a source at any given time\nBandwidth - tells you how much data could theoretically be transferred from a source at any given time.\n\nhttps://www.dnsstuff.com/network-throughput-bandwidth\n\nWe're talking about \"high availability and responsiveness\" which is inclined on the networking side.\nFrom a Network Engineer's perspective, you'll \"need to check first\" how much throughput you have to determine if an interface have enough bandwidth to handle the throughput?","poster":"SecurityGuy"},{"timestamp":"1720519740.0","comment_id":"947088","poster":"Topsecret","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A. total throughput on the interface of the router and NetFlow records.\n\nTo analyze the network and identify ways to improve traffic movement to minimize delays, the engineer must obtain information related to the total throughput on the interface of the router and NetFlow records."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct ANS = C","poster":"slippery31","comment_id":"904420","timestamp":"1716421200.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\ni think \"A\".\nThe engineer needs to obtain the total throughput on the interface of the router and NetFlow records to analyze the network and identify ways to improve traffic movement to minimize delays.
