The earlier EAP exchange or WPA2-PSK configuration has provided the shared secret key PMK (Pairwise Master Key). To derive the\nPMK from the WPA-PSK, the PSK is put through PBKDF2-SHA1 as the cryptographic hash function. This key is, however, designed to last the entire session and should be exposed as little as possible. Therefore the four-way handshake is used to establish another key called the PTK (Pairwise Transient Key). The PTK is generated by concatenating the following attributes: PMK, AP nonce (ANonce), STA nonce (SNonce), AP MAC address, and STA MAC address. The product is then put through a pseudo random function. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004","choices":{"E":"Pairwise Transverse Key","A":"Pairwise Master Key","C":"Pairwise Session Key","D":"Pairwise Transient Key","B":"Pairwise Multiple Key"},"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which key is established using the four-way handshake during the WPA authentication process?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/35-exam-200-355-topic-1-question-205-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_id":41,"exam_id":290},{"id":"dbElvDnewYmm3wxodzTD","answer_description":"Regardless of whether WPA or WPA2 is used during the initial connection between the station and the AP, the two agree on common security requirements.","question_text":"When the enterprise-based authentication method is used for WPA2, a bidirectional handshake exchange occurs between the client and the authenticator.
