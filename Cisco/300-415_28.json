With graceful restart, if the Cisco vSmart controller in the network goes down, or if multiple Cisco vSmart controllers go down simultaneously, Cisco vEdge device can continue forwarding data traffic. They do this using the last known good information that they received from the Cisco vSmart controller. When a Cisco vSmart controller is again available, its DTLS connection to the device is re-established, and the device then receives updated, current network information from the Cisco vSmart controller.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/routing/vEdge-20-x/routing-book/m-unicast-routing.html#concept_rjl_sc2_b3b","comment_id":"870491"}],"unix_timestamp":1681508760,"answers_community":[],"choices":{"B":"advertisement interval","A":"graceful restart timer","D":"hold time","C":"EOR timer"},"answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/106210-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-225-discussion/","question_id":136,"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true},{"id":"Cby56ZKQ7ZKk0v1Z3ROF","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/102818-exam-300-415-topic-1-question-226-discussion/","question_id":137,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1678969680,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-03-16 13:28:00","question_text":"Which type of certificate is installed on vManage for a user to access vManage via a web browser?","choices":{"D":"WAN Edge Certificate","C":"SD-AVC Certificate","B":"Web Server Certificate","A":"Controller Certificate"},"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"B","exam_id":304,"discussion":[{"poster":"Hasi123","comment_id":"840947","timestamp":"1694860080.0","content":"Answer B - Web Certificate\nUsed for web access to the vManage.
