The output of the \"show interface\" command indicates that the interface is operating at full duplex with a speed of 10000Mbps, which rules out speed conflict and duplex incompatibility as potential causes. The input and output rates shown in the command output are both relatively high, indicating that there is a significant amount of traffic flowing through the interface. Additionally, there are no indications of queuing drops or other errors that could suggest a different cause. Therefore, it is most likely that the slow transfer speeds are due to congestion on the interface.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Simon_1103","comment_id":"877407","comments":[{"content":"heavy traffic is shown by tx rx load","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"898869","poster":"ac89l","timestamp":"1700115900.0"}],"timestamp":"1697989380.0"}],"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-03-06 17:21:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/101665-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1037-discussion/","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/200-301/image105.png"],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["C (90%)","10%"],"exam_id":288},{"id":"3MF0BmRuJHY3dQmnz2bM","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":45,"choices":{"B":"12.17.1.20","C":"172.15.2.250","E":"192.169.32.10","D":"172.31.255.100","A":"10.172.76.200"},"timestamp":"2023-02-14 12:51:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99145-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-1038-discussion/","answer_ET":"AD","answer":"AD","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which two host addresses are reserved for private use within an enterprise network?
