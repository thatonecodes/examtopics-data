Configure a trust policy for the CEO.\n\nA trust policy is a special type of access control policy that identifies trusted hosts and networks that are exempt from certain intrusion policies. By creating a trust policy for the CEO, the engineer can ensure that traffic coming from the CEO is always allowed, regardless of any other rules or policies that may be in place. This is a more targeted and specific solution than simply changing the intrusion policy or creating a general firewall bypass. NAT policies, while useful for translating IP addresses, do not provide the same level of control over traffic as access control policies.","comment_id":"835961","timestamp":"1726049640.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"381227","content":"Answer B is still the most appropriate.
