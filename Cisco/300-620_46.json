Detecting silent endpoints in a Layer 3 Bridge Domain (BD) requires specific configurations to ensure that these endpoints are discovered and learned by the fabric.","comment_id":"1354381","timestamp":"1739180640.0","poster":"prospio971"},{"timestamp":"1733194020.0","comment_id":"1321198","poster":"designated","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTo detect all silent endpoints for the Layer 3 bridge domain in a Cisco ACI fabric, Option A is the correct answer:\n\nExplanation:\n\n 1. Enable Unicast Routing:\n • Enabling unicast routing ensures that the bridge domain is treated as a Layer 3 domain, allowing endpoint discovery using ARP requests and routing functionalities.\n 2. Disable ARP Flooding:\n • Disabling ARP flooding ensures that ARP requests are not broadcasted indiscriminately across the fabric. Instead, Cisco ACI leverages ARP Gleaning and hardware proxy to manage ARP requests efficiently, which is required for silent endpoint detection.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Disabling ARP flooding will not detect silent IP that moved from one location to another without notifying an ACI leaf.\nAns is C","comment_id":"1353874","poster":"samfab","timestamp":"1739099460.0"}]},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Rollizo","timestamp":"1731008100.0","comment_id":"1308522","content":"Selected Answer: A\nShould be A"}],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/150978-exam-300-620-topic-1-question-304-discussion/"},{"id":"R1vd2iPlGUII9mGy1p7N","answer":"CE","timestamp":"2025-02-10 10:46:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"CE","question_id":227,"exam_id":312,"unix_timestamp":1739180760,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which two hardware models are supported as fixed spine in Cisco ACI fabrics?

Security Domain in Cisco ACI:\n • A security domain restricts access to specific parts of the fabric (tenants, application profiles, etc.) for a user or group.\n • In this case, the user should only access the common tenant and the PROD tenant.\n 2. Action Breakdown:\n • By adding the “common” security domain to the user, you limit their access to only common-associated resources.\n • Associating the “common” domain with the PROD tenant ensures access to the relevant parts of the PROD tenant without unnecessarily broadening access (e.g., using “all” security domains).","poster":"designated"}],"topic":"1","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/300-620/image92.png"],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","exam_id":312,"question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
