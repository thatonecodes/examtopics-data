Something is configured incorrectly, without a doubt."},{"timestamp":"1731552660.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct, Farming needs to be fixed, \nSlips are the result of B.","poster":"decdca7","comment_id":"1311696","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1311695","content":"Selected Answer: B\nD is the answer, B would be right if you had slips","comments":[{"content":"Changed my mind it is D","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731552720.0","poster":"decdca7","comment_id":"1311697"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731552600.0","poster":"decdca7"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nRead MeowthL's comment and go to the link, in there read about the TEI_ASSIGNED state in the Layer 2 status and it talks about BAD FRAMES","upvote_count":"2","poster":"JoeC716","comment_id":"1207363","timestamp":"1715004540.0"},{"poster":"dbayt","timestamp":"1698052680.0","comment_id":"1051649","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wan/t1-e1-t3-e3/8131-T1-pri.html"},{"comment_id":"970637","poster":"kitty73","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/ip-telephony-and-phones/isdn-layer-2-stays-on-quot-tei-assigned-quot-state/td-p/2928002","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1691023860.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer should be B.","comment_id":"647735","timestamp":"1660664520.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Piji"}],"answer":"D","question_id":39,"answers_community":["D (69%)","B (31%)"],"timestamp":"2022-08-16 17:42:00","exam_id":328,"answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1660664520,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"The cable is unplugged.","C":"The controller shut down.","D":"The framing is configured incorrectly.","B":"The clock source is incorrect."},"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/78064-exam-350-801-topic-1-question-136-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
