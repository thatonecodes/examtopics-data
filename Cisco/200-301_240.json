Reduce the size of the forwarding table on network routers.\n\nImplementing IPv4 private addressing, also known as Network Address Translation (NAT), can help reduce the size of the forwarding table on network routers. NAT allows multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address for communication with external networks. This conserves public IP addresses and reduces the size of the routing table, as routers only need to manage the translation of private IP addresses to the single public IP address.","comments":[{"content":"This is not a cause but an effect.","timestamp":"1695912420.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1020010","upvote_count":"1"}]}],"question_id":1196,"exam_id":288,"question_text":"Which is a reason to implement IPv4 private addressing?","unix_timestamp":1691736420,"answer":"C","question_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"IgRQG3zAvcO8DYhgmU71","exam_id":288,"unix_timestamp":1669752360,"answer_description":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04300/0005400001.jpg"],"timestamp":"2022-11-29 21:06:00","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"content":"given answers are correct","comment_id":"1195478","upvote_count":"7","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1728907080.0"},{"timestamp":"1713685440.0","poster":"gnaix","comment_id":"1049327","upvote_count":"2","content":"Given answer is correct"},{"timestamp":"1710349320.0","content":"more cost effective than other option -> This is not totally true because of wiring cost","upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1006740"},{"poster":"ELHAZ","timestamp":"1695064860.0","comment_id":"843175","upvote_count":"2","content":"Collapsed core :\nSingle device handles the core and the distribution layer\nmore cost-effective than other opton\nmost appropriate for small network designs\n\nTree-Thier:\n\nenhances network availability\nseparate devices handles the core and the distribution layer"},{"content":"Correct","comment_id":"823723","timestamp":"1693135320.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"harkindeylee"}],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04300/0005300001.png"],"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nDrag and drop the characteristics of network architectures from the left onto the type of architecture on the right.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","answer":"","answer_ET":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/89308-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-82-discussion/","question_id":1197,"isMC":false},{"id":"pPVNZxugjkaOek0H1pSO","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/99477-exam-200-301-topic-1-question-820-discussion/","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-02-16 23:19:00","answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":"1 GHz signal","A":"1 Hz signal","D":"60 GHz signal","C":"60 Hz signal"},"answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (83%)","C (17%)"],"question_id":1198,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"13","timestamp":"1711697040.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nKnowing that:\n\nfrequency = #cycle/#seconds [hz]\n\nConversion:\n\nfrequency = 60 cycles / 1 minute = 60 cycles / 60 seconds = 1 hz\n\nSo, the answer is A.","poster":"Elmasquentona963","comment_id":"1020488"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct\n\n(Which) signal frequency (appears) 60 times per minute?

Therefore, 1 Hz means that one cycle of a wave occurs in one second.\n\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, if a signal has a frequency of 60 Hz, it means that there are 60 cycles of the wave in one second, and hence there will be 60 x 1 = 60 cycles or appearances of the signal in one minute.\n\nOption A (1 Hz signal) appears only once per second, Option B (1 GHz signal) appears one billion times per second, and Option D (60 GHz signal) appears 60 billion times per second, which are much higher frequencies than the frequency required to appear 60 times per minute.","comment_id":"834639"},{"poster":"Zortex","comment_id":"832961","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFrequency is defined as the number of cycles of a periodic waveform that occur in one second.
