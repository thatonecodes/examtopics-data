Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an enhanced distance-vector protocol based on the diffusing update algorithm (DUAL). It is capable of (conservatively) finding all loop-free paths to any given destination based on route advertisements from neighbors. The neighbor (or neighbors) with the best path to a destination is called the successor. The remaining neighbors with loop-free paths to the destination are called feasible successors. To reduce traffic load on the network, EIGRP maintains neighbor relationships and exchanges routing information only as needed, using a query process to find alternate paths when all loop-free paths to a destination have failed.","question_id":277,"unix_timestamp":1582273740,"answers_community":[]},{"id":"IAKIFPTmEK6JJylNBPk8","unix_timestamp":1582273740,"question_text":"Refer to the output.\n//IMG//\n\nWhat IOS command produces this output?\n\nSelect the best response -","answer":"D. show ipv6 ospf","question_id":278,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"D. show ipv6 ospf","topic":"2","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1582273740.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"53340","poster":"diegonamaste","content":"D. show ipv6 ospf"}],"choices":{"C":"show ipv6 ospf interface","A":"show ip ospf","B":"show ip ospf interface"},"answers_community":[],"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipv6/command/reference/ipv6_15.html#wp2439467","exam_id":296,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02670/n18843600000.png"],"timestamp":"2020-02-21 09:29:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14602-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-455-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"tk2APDdeW19g5cbiG7zt","answer_description":"Explanation -\nThe ASBR accepts RFC 1918 addresses and set these networks to tag 255 but when advertising into Area 0, the ABR Area 0 filters out these networks because they match tag 255 so the OSPF backbone will not learn any RFC 1918 addresses.\nNote that if you use an ACL in a route-map deny clause, routes that are permitted by the ACL are not redistributed.\nAll the networks with tag 255 are blocked by the clause 10 while all other networks are permitted by the clause 20 of the route-map (if a match command is not present, all routes match the clause).\nNote:\nRFC 1918 addresses include:\n+ Class A: 10.0.0.0 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)\n+ Class B: 172.16.0.0 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) + Class C: 192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/14506-exam-300-101-topic-2-question-456-discussion/","timestamp":"2020-02-20 13:03:00","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nThe partial configuration for an OSPF ASBR and an Area 0 ABR is shown.
