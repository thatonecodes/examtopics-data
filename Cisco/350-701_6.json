Which feature should be used to accomplish this?\n\nAs in the question says we want to know what apps are being used on the network. However they throw you off by saying \"but does not want the network devices to send metadata to Cisco Firepower.\". Ask your self, Why do we care about Cisco FirePower in this question? We don't as we want to know what apps are on the network. By using netflow you have the network devices including firepower sending flow data out to be analyzed to other devices to analyze, but not sending data to the firepower device. They never said firepower could not be used as a sensor. The key word here is not \"send\" to firepower, but nothing about sending from firepower"},{"comment_id":"1063107","upvote_count":"1","poster":"xziomal9","timestamp":"1699201200.0","content":"Answer A"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1680121680.0","comment_id":"854924","poster":"KPzee","content":"It cannot be D as Netflow is concerned with metadata."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"740285","poster":"Emlia1","timestamp":"1670605800.0","content":"I prefer A"},{"poster":"sis_net_sec","comment_id":"690226","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1665322380.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/60/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v60/Network_Discovery_Policies.html\nThe network discovery policy has a single default rule in place, configured to discover applications from all observed traffic.

As Netflow used metedata to analysise the flow.\nRather than always relying on full packet capture, protocols like NetFlow and IPFIX can generate valuable metadata for less-intensive network monitoring.
