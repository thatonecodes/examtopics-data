This is very useful when a router connects a trusted network to an untrusted network such as the Internet. MPP applies to all management protocols, such as SSH, HTTPS, and SNMP. This feature is configured using the management-interface command in the control pane. This command can be repeated to enable the same or a different set of protocols on other interfaces. One key restriction of this feature is that it cannot be applied to an out-of-band management interface (also called a dedicated management interface), if the device has one. Example 2-12 shows the usage of this command.\nhttps://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2928193&seqNum=2#:~:text=The%20Management%20Plane%20Protection%20(MPP,SSH%2C%20HTTPS%2C%20and%20SNMP.","comment_id":"954512","timestamp":"1705522680.0","poster":"Marinheiro","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"sebtiny","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\n--> restrict access to management interfaces","timestamp":"1701252360.0","comment_id":"909171"},{"timestamp":"1698535320.0","comment_id":"883930","poster":"SpicyMochi","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. out-of-band\n\nThe engineer should choose an out-of-band management network solution to meet the customer's requirements. Out-of-band management involves using a separate, dedicated network for managing devices, separate from the production network. This approach provides the ability to grant and revoke access privileges, restrict access to management interfaces, and limit the allowed protocols to SSH, NTP, FTP, and SNMP. It also enhances security and control, as management traffic is isolated from the production traffic.","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1697474040.0","poster":"ted_ba","content":"correct !\nout band is when no metter if the network will outage \nI still have manage to device .","comment_id":"871937","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nrestrict access to management interfaces\nSeems like C to me","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1697430060.0","comment_id":"871452","poster":"cerifyme85"}],"unix_timestamp":1681618860,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":123,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/106320-exam-300-420-topic-1-question-212-discussion/","answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-04-16 06:21:00","exam_id":305,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1"},{"id":"o2u6TqtgXsMprCGueRx4","answer":"B","exam_id":305,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/118569-exam-300-420-topic-1-question-213-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_id":124,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"They send PIM prune message toward multicast sources.","D":"They notify the upstream router of multicast traffic.","C":"They eliminate overlapping multicast addresses.","B":"They prevent loops and duplicate packets."},"unix_timestamp":1692573300,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Which function do reverse path forwarding mechanisms perform in a multicast deployment?","timestamp":"2023-08-21 01:15:00","discussion":[{"poster":"Lungful","timestamp":"1724195700.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"986114","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct. https://www.routeprotocol.com/reverse-path-forwarding-rpf/"}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"Bu4HBi9VuaxdlB8sRy3A","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"How does a model-driven telemetry dial-out approach function?","topic":"1","choices":{"B":"The collector initiates a session to the device and subscribes to data to be streamed.","C":"The collector initiates a session to the device and gets the data of a previously defined subscription.","A":"The device initiates a session to the collector based on the subscription.","D":"The device initiates a session to the collector and negotiates a subscription."},"exam_id":305,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-08-21 14:29:00","answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct. \"With the TCP Dial-Out method, the router initiates a TCP session to the\ncollector and sends whatever data is specified by the sensor-group in the\nsubscription.\"\n\nReference: https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/netdevops-live/site/files/s01t11.pdf","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724243340.0","comment_id":"986488","poster":"Lungful"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":125,"unix_timestamp":1692620940,"answer_description":"","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/cisco/view/118601-exam-300-420-topic-1-question-214-discussion/"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":299,"isBeta":false,"name":"300-420","id":305,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Cisco"},"currentPage":25},"__N_SSP":true}
