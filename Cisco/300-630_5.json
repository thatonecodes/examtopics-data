This approach allows existing network architecture and flows to remain the same, henceforth allowing IT resources considerable amount of time to get acclimatized with the new terminologies of ACI fabric.\nOn the other hand, Application Centric approach is comparatively a new approach model where application tiers are defined by EPGs . In this setup, Application Profiles are created for each application with EPGs based on the application architecture tiers. The notion is to give the network administrator a view of the application, its connectivity & security requirement from the ACI fabric.\n\nhttps://ipwithease.com/cisco-aci-network-centric-vs-application-centric-approach/","comment_id":"1199131","poster":"kamkol","timestamp":"1713612900.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"timestamp":"2024-04-20 13:35:00","question_text":"//IMG//\nRefer to the exhibit.
