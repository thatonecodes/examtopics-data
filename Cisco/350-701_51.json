OpenIOC, OpenC2, CybOX, STIX\n\nThe open standard that creates a framework for sharing threat intelligence in a machine-digestible format is STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression).\nSTIX is a JSON-based schema that defines a common format for representing and sharing threat intelligence information. This includes information about adversaries, malware, vulnerabilities, intrusions, and other cyberthreats. STIX is designed to be machine-readable, so that it can be easily shared and processed by computers.
