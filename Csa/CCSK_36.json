Lack of visibility.\n\nWhen organizations rely on a third-party service provider for security services, they may have limited visibility into the inner workings of the security infrastructure and operations. This lack of visibility can make it challenging to assess the effectiveness of the security measures, monitor for potential vulnerabilities or threats, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Organizations may have to rely on the service provider's reporting and assurance mechanisms to gain insights into the security posture of their systems and data.","poster":"moten","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1717871640.0","comment_id":"918578"},{"comment_id":"907319","timestamp":"1716723840.0","comments":[{"poster":"Yahealborini","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1720709640.0","content":"no not correct check the guide page 140","comment_id":"949059"}],"content":"A potential concern of using Security-as-a-Service (SecaaS) is:\n\nC. Scaling and costs\n\nSecaaS typically operates on a subscription-based model where organizations pay for the security services provided. As the organization's needs grow and more resources are required, scaling the services can lead to increased costs.

Management plane\n\nIn traditional infrastructure, organizations have direct control over the entire management plane, including physical servers, network devices, and security configurations. They are responsible for managing and securing the infrastructure themselves. On the other hand, in cloud computing, the management plane is abstracted and provided by the cloud service provider (CSP). The CSP manages the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and network, while the organization focuses on managing their applications and data.\n\nThis shift in responsibility for the management plane introduces a significant security difference. In traditional infrastructure, organizations have granular control over security configurations, whereas in cloud computing, they rely on the CSP's management and security practices.
