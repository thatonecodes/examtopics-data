It includes the management plane components, which are network enabled and remotely accessible\n\nThe metastructure layer of cloud computing is different from traditional computing in that it includes the management plane components that are network-enabled and remotely accessible. The management plane in cloud computing allows users to control and manage cloud resources and services through remote interfaces. This level of remote access and management is a distinctive feature of the metastructure layer in cloud computing compared to traditional computing.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the main difference between the metastructure layer of cloud computing and traditional computing.","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_text":"What makes the metastructure layer of cloud computing so different from traditional computing?","choices":{"C":"It includes the data and information components","D":"It includes the underlying application services","E":"It eliminates the need for the Infostructure layer","B":"It is automatically patch and scalable","A":"It includes the management plane components, which are network enabled and remotely accessible"},"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-08-10 05:13:00","answer":"A","question_id":61,"unix_timestamp":1691637180,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":433,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/117722-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-158-discussion/"},{"id":"WgevWXRkiz2Tpzcpsc7C","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":"False","A":"True"},"exam_id":433,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/117724-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-159-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":62,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-08-10 05:15:00","unix_timestamp":1691637300,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719939000.0","poster":"ChewyBananas","comment_id":"1240904","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPage 85 - Containers: Containers are code execution environments that run within an operating system (for now), sharing and leveraging resources of that operating system.

True\n\nThe statement is true. A virtual machine (VM) is a full abstraction of an operating system, where each VM includes its own complete operating system instance along with virtualized hardware. On the other hand, a container is a more lightweight form of virtualization that provides a constrained environment to run segregated processes while sharing the same kernel and OS capabilities. This enables containers to be more efficient in terms of resource usage compared to full virtual machines.","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_text":"While a virtual machine is a full abstraction of an operating system, a container is a constrained place to run segregated processes while still using the kernel and other OS capabilities."},{"id":"b2ESGPKyTeHwIf0esRSX","question_id":63,"question_text":"Which layer is the most important for securing because it is considered to be the foundation for secure cloud operations?","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":433,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"I disagree with this answer.

This is because the physical infrastructure is what everything else is built on.\n\nImagine if you will that the CSP is in a collocated facility and many people who are not part of the CSP can walk around the building.
