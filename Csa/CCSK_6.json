While a VM is a full abstraction of an operating system, a container is a constrained place to run segregated processes while still utilizing the kernel and other capabilities of the base OS. Multiple containers can run on the same virtual machine or be implemented without the use of VMs at all and run directly on hardware. The container provides code running inside a restricted environment with only access to the processes and capabilities defined in the container configuration. This allows containers to launch incredibly rapidly, since they don’t need to boot an operating system or launch many (sometimes any) new services; the container only needs access to already-running services in the host OS and some can launch in milliseconds.","poster":"Brainiac"}],"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-31 14:33:00","topic":"1","exam_id":433,"choices":{"C":"An automated controller.","B":"Workload tools","D":"The execution environment","A":"Operating system","E":"A client"},"unix_timestamp":1685536380,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which component is a key part of software container systems?"},{"id":"YNTqOl1f8LpBu4A6sSzK","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"It describes the applicability of the overall domain","A":"It show which architectural elements are related to a given control","C":"It maps the existing industry standards to the controls in the domains","D":"It describes the applicability of the controls in the domains","E":"None of the above"},"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/128211-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-124-discussion/","answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-12-10 14:56:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","question_text":"CCM: What is the role of the Scope Applicability column in the CCM?","exam_id":433,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1702216560,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1730637240.0","comment_id":"1306507","poster":"CollabGuy","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt is C.

Software-defined infrastructure allows you to quickly rebuild from scratch in a clean environment, and, for more isolated attacks, inherent cloud characteristics—such as auto-scale groups, API calls for changing virtual network or machine configurations, and snapshots—can speed quarantine, eradication, and recovery processes. For example, on many platforms you can instantly quarantine virtual machines by moving the instance out of the auto-scale group, isolating it with virtual firewalls, and replacing it.","poster":"JAMBER","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1733692800.0"}],"answer_ET":"E","exam_id":433,"question_text":"What factor(s), if any, allows for more efficient and effective containment and recovery in a cloud environment than in a non-cloud environment.","question_id":29,"timestamp":"2023-12-08 22:20:00","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/128102-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-126-discussion/","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1702070400,"answer":"E","answers_community":["E (100%)"],"topic":"1","choices":{"E":"Virtualization technologies, and the elasticity inherent in cloud computing platforms","B":"no part of incident response is easier in a cloud environment","C":"frequent backup routines","A":"encrypted data files","D":"multitenancy and software as a service models"},"answer_description":""},{"id":"x2aoHf0sABK2F2AB8czP","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-05-31 14:44:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"What is true of cloud built-in firewalls?","discussion":[{"poster":"Brainiac","comment_id":"911267","content":"D.
