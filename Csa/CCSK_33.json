Lack of completeness and transparency in terms of use.\n\nLock-in refers to the situation where a customer becomes dependent on a particular cloud service provider and faces challenges or barriers in migrating to another provider or bringing the services back in-house. ENISA research identifies lock-in as a high-risk factor in cloud computing.\n\nOne of the key vulnerabilities that contribute to lock-in is the lack of completeness and transparency in terms of use. This means that the terms and conditions, contractual agreements, and service-level agreements provided by the cloud service provider may not adequately disclose all the relevant information and restrictions that could impact the customer's ability to migrate or switch providers. Without a clear understanding of the terms of use and potential limitations, customers may unintentionally become locked into the services of a specific provider.","poster":"Brainiac","timestamp":"1732544520.0","comment_id":"906642"},{"poster":"FATWENTYSIX","comment_id":"889756","content":"All in One Study Guide\nUser Provisioning Vulnerability\nMultiple vulnerabilities are associated with user provisioning in the ENISA document.\nLack of completeness and transparency in terms of use This occurs when the provider's usage policy is unclear or lacks detail.\nR.1: Lock-in: Lack of completeness and transparency in Terms of Use","timestamp":"1730783640.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1729055460.0","poster":"JoAsiaGje","comment_id":"871476","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\n(page 25) \nVulnerabilities\nV13.

Arbitrary contract termination by acquiring company.\n\nWhen a cloud provider is acquired by another company, there is a risk that the acquiring company may arbitrarily terminate existing contracts with customers. This can lead to service disruptions, loss of data, and potential legal and financial implications for the affected customers. The acquiring company may have different priorities, business strategies, or may not want to continue providing the same level of service to existing customers, resulting in contract termination.\n\nWhile the other options listed can also be potential concerns during a cloud provider acquisition, ENISA specifically highlights the arbitrary contract termination by the acquiring company as a risk concern.
