The cloud consumer's administrators\n\nIn the case of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS), the responsibility to effectively manage the security of the application running in the cloud primarily belongs to the cloud consumer's administrators. While the cloud provider is responsible for the security of the underlying infrastructure and platform, the cloud consumer is responsible for securing the applications, data, and configurations that they deploy on top of that infrastructure or platform. This is known as the shared responsibility model in cloud computing.","timestamp":"1723261560.0","poster":"byfener","comment_id":"977245"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"The software as a service (SaaS) provider","B":"The internet service provider (ISP)","C":"The government","E":"The provider's system administrators","A":"The cloud consumer's administrators"},"unix_timestamp":1691639160,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/117741-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-168-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":71,"timestamp":"2023-08-10 05:46:00","exam_id":433,"question_images":[]},{"id":"OAG4hrhQr68srizToTX9","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-08-10 05:48:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/117743-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-169-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1691639280,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":433,"answer_ET":"E","question_id":72,"question_text":"At a minimum, how often should incident response testing occur?","choices":{"B":"Quarterly","E":"Annually and whenever a significant change occurs","A":"Monthly","D":"Semi-annually","C":"Whenever an event occurs"},"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1021756","content":"Security Guideance:9.2 Recommendations - Testing will be conducted at least annually or whenever there are significant changes to the \napplication architecture.

Isolating it on different hardware allows for better control and management of resources dedicated to that particular network. By separating it from other networks, it becomes easier to allocate resources, optimize performance, and apply specific configurations or settings tailored to the unique requirements of that network.
