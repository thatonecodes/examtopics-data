True\n\nInstalling security software designed for physical servers onto a virtualized server can result in severe degradation in performance. Security software that is not optimized for virtual environments may consume excessive resources, such as CPU and memory, leading to reduced performance and potentially impacting the overall efficiency and scalability of the virtualized environment. It's important to use security solutions that are specifically designed for virtualized environments to avoid such performance issues.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"977266","poster":"byfener"}],"exam_id":433,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Installing security software designed for physical servers onto a virtualized server can result in severe degradation in performance.","timestamp":"2023-08-10 06:06:00","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1691640360,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"gwAWaNFupYWiAqTY65ON","timestamp":"2023-08-10 06:09:00","question_images":[],"exam_id":433,"answer":"E","topic":"1","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/117757-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-178-discussion/","answers_community":["E (100%)"],"question_id":82,"unix_timestamp":1691640540,"answer_description":"","question_text":"CCM: A hypothetical company called \"lnfrastructure4Sure\" provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to its clients.
