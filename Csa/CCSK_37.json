True\n\nA security failure at the root network of a cloud provider will generally not compromise the security of all customers due to the multitenancy configuration. In a multitenancy environment, multiple customers or tenants share the same physical infrastructure, but their resources and data are logically separated and isolated from each other.\n\nThe cloud provider implements various security measures to ensure the isolation and protection of customer data. This includes network segmentation, virtualization, access controls, and security mechanisms at various levels. These measures are designed to prevent cross-customer data breaches and limit the impact of any security failures to the affected tenant only.\n\nWhile no system is completely immune to security breaches, the multitenancy configuration in cloud computing helps mitigate the risk of widespread security compromises across different customers in the event of a security failure at the root network of the cloud provider.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1716889920.0","poster":"Brainiac"}],"answers_community":["A (90%)","10%"],"question_id":181},{"id":"p8B0ykaR4eIVc4eoeEeh","timestamp":"2023-05-28 11:54:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"908477","content":"When investigating an incident in an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, the user can investigate:\n\nE.

True\n\nIn the incident response lifecycle, the containment phase involves taking systems offline as a measure to prevent further damage or spread of the incident. By isolating affected systems or network segments, organizations can limit the impact and reduce the risk of additional compromise or data loss.\n\nTaking systems offline during the containment phase allows security teams to assess the situation, investigate the incident, and implement necessary remediation measures without the interference of ongoing malicious activity. It also helps to prevent the incident from spreading to other parts of the infrastructure or affecting additional systems or users.\n\nWhile the specific actions taken during the containment phase may vary depending on the nature of the incident and organizational policies, temporarily taking systems offline is a common and effective step to contain and control the situation.","comment_id":"908480","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Brainiac","timestamp":"1732795140.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nfrom security guidance page 102: Containment: Taking systems offline.

Enforce isolation and maintain a secure virtualization infrastructure.\n\nCloud providers are responsible for ensuring that virtualized resources are isolated from each other, providing strong segregation between tenants. They must implement robust virtualization technologies and mechanisms to enforce this isolation, preventing unauthorized access or interference between different workloads.\n\nAdditionally, cloud providers have the responsibility to maintain a secure virtualization infrastructure. This includes regularly patching and updating the underlying hypervisors, managing the host environment's security configurations, and implementing security measures to protect against vulnerabilities or attacks targeting the virtualization layer.\n\nWhile customers have their own security responsibilities within their virtual instances, the cloud provider's role primarily involves enforcing isolation and maintaining a secure virtualization infrastructure.

It is how we separate different tenants, even when they are running processes on the same physical hardware.\n• The cloud provider is also responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure and the virtualization technology from external attack or internal misuse.
