In a hybrid cloud, organizations utilize a combination of public and private cloud infrastructure to meet their specific needs. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and the ability to leverage the benefits of both public and private cloud environments. By integrating multiple clouds, organizations can optimize their workload placement, resource allocation, and data management strategies.\n\nA community cloud is a cloud deployment model where infrastructure and resources are shared by a specific community or group of organizations with common interests or requirements. It is designed to meet the specific needs of a particular community and can be managed by the organizations themselves or a third-party provider. This type of cloud deployment allows for collaboration, data sharing, and resource pooling within the community while maintaining a certain level of control and security."},{"content":"A cloud deployment of two or more unique clouds is known as:\n\nD. A Hybrid Cloud.\n\nA hybrid cloud refers to a cloud computing environment that combines two or more distinct cloud infrastructures, which can be private, public, or community clouds. In a hybrid cloud deployment, organizations can leverage the benefits of multiple cloud models to meet their specific needs. They can utilize the private cloud for sensitive or critical data and applications while leveraging the scalability and cost-effectiveness of public clouds for other workloads. The hybrid cloud allows for seamless integration and data sharing between the different cloud environments, providing flexibility and versatility to organizations.\n\nTherefore, option D, a Hybrid Cloud, is the correct answer for a cloud deployment consisting of two or more unique clouds.","timestamp":"1716640380.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"906650","poster":"Brainiac"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716236580.0","poster":"ZakySama","comment_id":"902753","content":"Thank you"}],"poster":"FATWENTYSIX","timestamp":"1714942680.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"890326","content":"CSA Security Guidance v4 pg 11"},{"poster":"Brainiac","comment_id":"800915","timestamp":"1707311700.0","content":"I think C is correct because the term \"unique\" was used.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"DrTee","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"791900","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree with Petza, Documentation states hybrid is the composition of two or more clouds","timestamp":"1706550420.0"}],"exam_id":433,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"A cloud deployment of two or more unique clouds is known as:","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-09-17 00:51:00","unix_timestamp":1663368660,"question_id":166,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/82465-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-61-discussion/","answer_description":"","choices":{"E":"Jericho Cloud Cube Model","A":"Infrastructures as a Service","B":"A Private Cloud","C":"A Community Cloud","D":"A Hybrid Cloud"},"isMC":true,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"1"},{"id":"vpnK9YcwszXENe10u4mw","question_id":167,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1021575","timestamp":"1727706900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nENISA page 97:\nFive key legal issues have been identified which are common across all the scenarios:\n1. data protection\na. availability and integrity\nb. minimum standard or guarantee\n2. confidentiality\n3. intellectual property\n4. professional negligence\n5. outsourcing services and changes in control.","poster":"Crotofroto"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Globalization is not one of the five key legal issues common across all scenarios identified by ENISA.
