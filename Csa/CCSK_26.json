Application logic\n\nIaaS providers primarily focus on providing the foundational infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. They offer a platform for customers to build and deploy their own applications. The responsibility for application logic, including the design, development, and implementation of specific functionalities, typically lies with the customer or the software/application owner. While IaaS providers may offer some basic security measures at the infrastructure level, they are not responsible for the application logic itself. That aspect is typically the responsibility of the customer or the application owner utilizing the IaaS infrastructure.","poster":"Brainiac","comment_id":"905826","timestamp":"1732456020.0","upvote_count":"7"}],"exam_id":433,"topic":"1"},{"id":"Gx65UODDeRq6phXiGO9F","discussion":[{"content":"A: Security Guidance pg 97: \"Most virtualized storage is durable and keeps multiple copies of data in different locations so that drive failures are less likely to result in data loss.\"","poster":"ElenaCyber","timestamp":"1731771960.0","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"899251"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731205680.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1348666","upvote_count":"1","poster":"sfsc91","timestamp":"1738170960.0","content":"While this might sound like a good practice, it doesn't accurately describe how virtualized storage typically handles redundancy.
