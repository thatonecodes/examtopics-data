Clients need to do business continuity planning due diligence in case they suddenly need to switch providers.\n\nCloud computing has indeed shifted the focus of business continuity management to vendor management, and clients need to carefully plan and consider their contracts and agreements with their cloud vendors to ensure continuity of business operations. This includes planning for potential outages, vendor discontinuance, or scenarios where they may have to switch providers. It's not just about technicalities - legal, contractual, and business aspects also play a significant role in cloud continuity management.","timestamp":"1711456980.0","poster":"_jpsrob_","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"BigG83","comment_id":"1154768","timestamp":"1708438140.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nbeside the below mentioned references, you should consider that despite there can more AZ in a region, it doesn't mean your application is disaster resistant if you don't implement it in that way to work on Multi AZ.

Clients need to do business continuity planning due diligence in case they suddenly need to switch providers.\n\nCloud computing introduces new considerations for business continuity management. While cloud services can provide advantages such as scalability and redundancy, organizations must still ensure they have proper business continuity plans in place. This includes conducting due diligence in terms of understanding the provider's service-level agreements (SLAs), data backup and recovery processes, and the potential need to switch providers in case of service disruptions or other unforeseen events. Organizations need to have plans in place to handle such scenarios and ensure the continuity of their operations.

True\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) involves testing the security of an application by simulating attacks and analyzing its response. In a cloud environment, DAST may have limitations or require pre-testing permission from the cloud service provider.\n\nCloud service providers typically have policies and security measures in place to protect their infrastructure and the applications hosted on it. As a result, they may impose restrictions on conducting security testing, including DAST, without prior permission. This is done to prevent any potential impact on the stability, performance, or security of the cloud environment.\n\nTherefore, it is true that DAST might be limited or require pre-testing permission from the provider in a cloud environment.
