X.509 (a standard for public key infrastructure)\n\nProminent recommended standards to enable federation of identity in cloud environments include SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and X.509.

SAML facilitates single sign-on (SSO) and identity federation, while X.509 defines the format for public key certificates used in various security applications, including authentication and digital signatures.\n\nFIDO (Fast Identity Online), Kerberos, and SSO (Single Sign-On) are also relevant to identity and authentication but are not specifically highlighted as recommended standards for enabling federation of identity in cloud environments in the context of the given options.","comment_id":"977152","poster":"byfener","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723253160.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/117711-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-153-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-08-10 03:26:00","topic":"1","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Kerberos","A":"FIDO","D":"SAML","E":"X.509","C":"SSO"},"unix_timestamp":1691630760,"question_images":[],"exam_id":433,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Prominent recommended standards to enable federation of identity in cloud environments include:","answers_community":[]},{"id":"UTojTMuMoHmTDaSEEzTy","question_id":57,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/113439-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-154-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"poster":"BratBuzz","comment_id":"1072867","timestamp":"1731797940.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSecurity Guidance, page 82\nA common, practical example leveraging this capability is running most, if not all, applications on their own virtual network and only connecting those networks as needed.

One way is to encrypt before sending to the cloud (client-side encryption). Network encryption (TLS/SFTP/etc.) is another option. Most cloud provider APIs use Transport Layer Security (TLS) by default; if not, pick a different provider, since this is an essential security capability. Proxy-based encryption may be a third option, where you place an encryption proxy in a trusted area between the cloud user and the cloud provider and the proxy manages the encryption before transferring the data to the provider.","timestamp":"1699931580.0","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"717664","poster":"Petza"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Client/Application Encryption, Link/Network Encryption, Proxy-Based Encryption\n\nThe three valid options for protecting data as it moves to and within the cloud are:\n\nClient/Application Encryption: Encrypting the data at the client or application level before it is transmitted to the cloud. This ensures that the data remains encrypted during its entire journey to the cloud.\n\nLink/Network Encryption: Encrypting the data as it travels over networks, including the Internet, to prevent unauthorized interception and access. This involves using secure communication protocols such as TLS/SSL.\n\nProxy-Based Encryption: Using a proxy or intermediary to encrypt and decrypt data as it enters and leaves the cloud environment. This can provide an additional layer of security and control over data flows.","comment_id":"977182","timestamp":"1723257240.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"byfener"},{"comment_id":"847865","content":"A is the right answer","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711174200.0","poster":"NJALPHA"},{"comment_id":"719395","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","timestamp":"1700117460.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"tralala2"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"t0xpbNgVNONM037s1Ute","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1668395940,"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1282676","poster":"d750a02","content":"I think it is answer D.
