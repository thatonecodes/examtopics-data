True\n\nVirtualization is a fundamental technology that underlies cloud computing. It enables the abstraction and virtualization of computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networks, allowing for the efficient allocation and utilization of these resources across multiple users or tenants. Cloud computing relies on virtualization to provide the flexibility, scalability, and isolation required to deliver on-demand services over the internet.\n\nWithout virtualization, the key characteristics of cloud computing, such as resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and multi-tenancy, would not be possible. Virtualization enables the creation of virtual machines (VMs) or containers that can run multiple instances of operating systems and applications on a single physical server.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true. Without virtualization, there would be no cloud computing as we understand it today.","poster":"Brainiac"}],"answers_community":[]},{"id":"afCoUXqUDLSFWOEHko2N","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"False","B":"True"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/86686-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-104-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_text":"All assets require the same continuity in the cloud.","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1667157480,"question_id":7,"timestamp":"2022-10-30 20:18:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728737700.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\n6.0.1.1 - \"Overall, a risk-based approach is key: Not all assets need equal continuity.\"","comment_id":"1194345","poster":"overarch384"},{"content":"6.0.1.1","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1682875080.0","poster":"cjkuga","comment_id":"707987"}],"exam_id":433},{"id":"yoLsmUsJYzQU7F5F2QRp","topic":"1","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1685274240,"question_text":"Which type of application security testing tests running applications and includes tests such as web vulnerability testing and fuzzing?","answer_ET":"E","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-28 13:44:00","answer":"E","question_id":8,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"choices":{"E":"Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)","B":"Static Application Security Testing (SAST)","D":"Functional Testing","C":"Unit Testing","A":"Code Review"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/110444-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-105-discussion/","answer_images":[],"exam_id":433,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"908605","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732801440.0","content":"E. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a type of application security testing that involves testing running applications to identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. It simulates real-world attacks on the application and examines how it responds to those attacks. DAST typically includes tests such as web vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and fuzzing.\n\nDAST tools send various inputs and payloads to the application, analyze the responses, and identify potential vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure configurations. Unlike Static Application Security Testing (SAST), which analyzes the application's source code, DAST focuses on the application in its deployed state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.
