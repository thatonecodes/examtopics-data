More efficient and timely system updates.\n\nCloud computing can provide more efficient and timely system updates compared to traditional on-premises environments. Cloud service providers are responsible for managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure, including software and hardware updates. They often have dedicated teams and automated processes in place to ensure that security patches, bug fixes, and system updates are promptly applied across their infrastructure. This helps in reducing the window of vulnerability and mitigating security risks associated with outdated software or known vulnerabilities.\n\nRegular and timely system updates play a crucial role in enhancing security by addressing vulnerabilities, improving system resilience, and incorporating the latest security measures. Cloud providers, through their centralized management and update processes, can offer more efficient and timely system updates to their customers, enabling them to benefit from the latest security enhancements without the need for individual patch management.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"906662","timestamp":"1716640920.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\n(enisa page 8) MORE TIMELY, EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT UPDATES AND DEFAULTS: default virtual machine images and software modules used by customers can be pre-hardened and updated with the latest patches and security settings according to fine-tuned processes; IaaS cloud service APIs also allow snapshots of virtual infrastructure to be taken regularly and compared with a baseline.
