The devices used to access data use a variety of applications or clients and may have different security characteristics.\n\nUnderstanding how data is being accessed is crucial because the devices used to access data can vary in terms of the applications or clients they use and the security characteristics they possess. Different devices may have different software installed, operating systems, and security configurations. This diversity can impact the security and integrity of the data being accessed.\n\nBy knowing how data is being accessed, organizations can identify potential vulnerabilities or risks associated with specific devices or applications. They can then implement appropriate security measures and controls to protect the data from unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security incidents. Understanding the device landscape helps ensure that appropriate security policies, authentication mechanisms, and encryption methods are in place to safeguard sensitive data.","poster":"Brainiac","timestamp":"1716638700.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which statement best describes why it is important to know how data is being accessed?","isMC":true,"question_id":156},{"id":"uhYouPC5BCqdqic2rzNg","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"exam_id":433,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"Brainiac","timestamp":"1732543620.0","comment_id":"906630","content":"Resource pooling refers to:\n\nA. The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers.\n\nResource pooling in cloud computing refers to the practice of aggregating and sharing computing resources among multiple consumers or clients. The cloud service provider combines its computing resources, including servers, storage, and networking infrastructure, into a shared pool. These resources can then be dynamically allocated and reallocated based on the demands and needs of different consumers or applications.\n\nBy pooling resources, the cloud provider can achieve higher utilization rates and optimize resource allocation, leading to improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Consumers benefit from this pooling by gaining access to scalable and on-demand computing resources without the need to manage and maintain their own dedicated infrastructure.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly describes resource pooling in cloud computing."}],"timestamp":"2023-05-25 14:07:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"What is resource pooling?","answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","choices":{"B":"Internet-based CPUs are pooled to enable multi-threading.","A":"The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers.","E":"None of the above.","C":"The dedicated computing resources of each client are pooled together in a colocation facility.","D":"Placing Internet (ג€cloudג€) data centers near multiple sources of energy, such as hydroelectric dams."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/110220-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-53-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1685016420,"question_id":157},{"id":"3pAir7m68TjF2V9rNN4F","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer":"A","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722212880.0","poster":"Kneebee","comment_id":"1134602","upvote_count":"3","content":"False (Option A): SLAs typically provide a specified level of service.

True\n\nThe statement is true: Your SLA (Service Level Agreement) with your cloud provider ensures continuity for all services.\n\nA Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contractual agreement between a service provider and a customer that defines the level of service and performance guarantees. In the context of cloud computing, an SLA typically outlines the availability, reliability, and continuity of the services provided by the cloud provider.\n\nA well-drafted SLA ensures that the cloud provider commits to maintaining continuity for all the services they offer. This includes measures to minimize downtime, ensure data redundancy and backup, implement disaster recovery plans, and address any disruptions or incidents promptly.\n\nBy signing an SLA, customers can have the assurance that their cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the continuity of the services as specified in the agreement. This helps establish a level of trust and accountability between the provider and the customer.\n\nTherefore, it is true that your SLA with your cloud provider ensures continuity for all services.","comment_id":"906632","timestamp":"1700921280.0","poster":"Brainiac","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"871455","content":"Selected Answer: B\nLAs and Governance: Any incident using a public cloud or hosted provider requires an understanding of service level agreements (SLAs), and likely coordination with the cloud provider.
