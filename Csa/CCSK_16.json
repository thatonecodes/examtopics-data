Opening connections\n\nWhen configuring Software-Defined Network (SDN) firewalls, after adding all assets, the first configuration that is typically addressed is opening connections. This involves configuring the necessary rules to allow desired traffic to flow between different assets or components within the network. This step is crucial to ensure that legitimate communication can occur while still enforcing security policies and access controls.","comment_id":"977261","timestamp":"1707544740.0","poster":"byfener"}]},{"id":"Muurk147U0NZ2pGI6wIE","unix_timestamp":1667085180,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/86650-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-173-discussion/","exam_id":433,"question_id":77,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-10-30 01:13:00","question_text":"Identified issues, risks, and recommended remediations are included when determining compliance.","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer":"A","choices":{"B":"False","A":"True"},"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719539820.0","comment_id":"1107376","poster":"JaXick","content":"Selected Answer: A\npg57, Audits and assessments are mechanisms to document compliance with internal or external requirements (or identify deficiencies).

True\n\nTo increase network isolation, you should indeed use Software-Defined Networking (SDN) capabilities for multiple networks and cloud accounts or segments. SDN allows you to create and manage virtual networks with specific segmentation and isolation, enhancing security and control by logically separating different parts of your infrastructure and preventing unauthorized access between them.
