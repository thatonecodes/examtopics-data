This is because the premise of the question is intentionally misleading. It wants you to concentrate on \"Health\", hence A and B appear like they would be right.\n\nBut they are not concentrating on just health compliance. They want to be a CSP and in such, have the widest range of compliance against as many frameworks/standards as possible. This is so they can present the results of the CCM to their clients, and their clients can use it as a pass-thru. \n\nNow obviously in the real world the CCM in itself would not be given to a client by a CSP. The CSP would go thru the certification processes such as FedRAMP/ISO/HITRUST etc, and of course a SOC2 Type 2.\n\nWhen you go thru these sorts of long paragraph scenarios, a good trick is to break each sentence down until you get to the core topic of it.
