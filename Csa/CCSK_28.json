VM communications may use a virtual network on the same hardware host.\n\nVirtual machine communications within a virtual network on the same hardware host can bypass network security controls. Since the communication occurs within the virtualized environment of the host, it may not traverse the physical network where network security controls, such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems, are implemented. This intra-host communication can occur at the virtualization layer, enabling VMs to communicate with each other without being subject to the same network security controls and monitoring as traffic that flows through the physical network.","comment_id":"905849","poster":"Brainiac","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1716551820.0"}],"exam_id":433,"isMC":true,"question_text":"How can virtual machine communications bypass network security controls?","question_images":[],"question_id":136,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/110134-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-34-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-05-24 13:57:00","choices":{"B":"The guest OS can invoke stealth mode","E":"Most network security systems do not recognize encrypted VM traffic","D":"VM images can contain rootkits programmed to bypass firewalls","C":"Hypervisors depend upon multiple network interfaces","A":"VM communications may use a virtual network on the same hardware host"},"answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1684929420,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"TsZYPMdvog0Aq7g0ni8d","timestamp":"2022-11-05 18:11:00","isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"E":"Instability in VM patch management causing VM routing errors.","A":"Improper management of VM instances, causing customer VMs to be commingled with other customer systems.","D":"Using a compromised VM to exploit a hypervisor, used to take control of other VMs.","C":"Lack of vulnerability management standards.","B":"Looping within virtualized routing systems."},"answer_images":[],"exam_id":433,"question_id":137,"answer":"D","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1727611980.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nENISA page 54: Another scenario is ‘VM hopping’: in which an attacker hacks a VM using some standard method and then – exploiting some hypervisor vulnerability – takes control of other VMs running on the same hypervisor.","poster":"Crotofroto","comment_id":"1020750"},{"content":"The closest answer is B - looping within the same hypervisor/physical host.

Using a compromised VM to exploit a hypervisor, used to take control of other VMs.\n\nVM hopping refers to a scenario where a compromised virtual machine (VM) is used as a stepping stone to exploit vulnerabilities in the hypervisor or virtualization layer. The attacker aims to gain control over the hypervisor, which manages and oversees the execution of multiple VMs, and subsequently take control of other VMs hosted on the same hypervisor. By compromising one VM, the attacker attempts to \"hop\" from that initial foothold to gain unauthorized access to other VMs or critical resources within the virtualized environment. This type of attack can have severe consequences as it allows the attacker to move laterally across VMs and potentially compromise the entire virtualized infrastructure."},{"timestamp":"1713237000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nENISA (page 54) \"‘VM hopping’: in which an attacker hacks a VM using some standard method and then – exploiting some hypervisor vulnerability – takes control of other VMs running on the same hypervisor\"","upvote_count":"4","poster":"JoAsiaGje","comment_id":"871425"},{"poster":"Azo_4952","content":"Virtual machine hyper jumping (VM jumping) is an attack method that exploits the hypervisor’s weakness that allows a virtual machine (VM) to be accessed from another.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"711895","timestamp":"1699204260.0"}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"ENISA: `VM hopping` is:","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/87023-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-35-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1667668260},{"id":"0A0qlsirSV3zm8IzChH4","unix_timestamp":1681615620,"timestamp":"2023-04-16 05:27:00","question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","exam_id":433,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/106313-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-36-discussion/","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_text":"Which concept is a mapping of an identity, including roles, personas, and attributes, to an authorization?","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Access control","B":"Federated Identity Management","E":"Authentication","D":"Entitlement","C":"Authoritative source"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"10","content":"Selected Answer: D\n- Access control: restricting access to a resource.

Virtualization\n\nVirtualization is the concept that provides the abstraction needed for resource pools in cloud computing environments. It involves creating virtual representations of physical resources such as servers, storage, and network devices. With virtualization, physical resources are abstracted and can be divided or combined to create virtual resource pools. These virtualized resources can be allocated and managed dynamically, allowing for efficient utilization and allocation of resources based on demand.
