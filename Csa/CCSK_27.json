It aims to streamline the application development and deployment process by breaking down silos, automating workflows, and fostering a culture of continuous integration and delivery. DevOps practices involve using automation tools and technologies to enable faster and more efficient software development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

A common, practical example leveraging this capability is running most, if not all, applications on their own virtual network and only connecting those networks as needed.

It reduces the blast radius of a compromised system.\n\nBy running applications on separate virtual networks and connecting networks as needed, the impact of a compromised system or a security breach is contained and limited. If a system or network within a virtual network is compromised, the isolation between networks helps prevent the lateral spread of the attack to other networks or systems. This containment reduces the \"blast radius\" of a compromised system, minimizing the potential damage and limiting the scope of the security incident. This approach enhances the overall security posture and resilience of the cloud environment by isolating and segregating different components and applications.","poster":"Brainiac","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"905847"}],"choices":{"A":"It reduces hardware costs","D":"It reduces the blast radius of a compromised system","E":"It enables you to configure applications around business groups","C":"It locks down access and provides stronger data security","B":"It provides dynamic and granular policies with less management overhead"},"answer":"D"}],"exam":{"provider":"Csa","isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":433,"numberOfQuestions":207,"name":"CCSK"},"currentPage":27},"__N_SSP":true}
