IMPOSSIBILITY OF PROCESSING DATA IN ENCRYPTED FORM\nEncrypting data at rest is not difficult, but despite recent advances in homomorphic encryption (27), there is little prospect of any commercial system being able to maintain this encryption during processing. In one article, Bruce Schneier estimates that performing a web search with encrypted keywords -- a perfectly reasonable simple application of this algorithm -- would increase the amount of computing time by about a trillion (28). This means that for a long time to come, cloud customers doing anything other than storing data in the cloud must trust the cloud provider.","poster":"cloud_guru_1909","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"857773"},{"timestamp":"1723315800.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Provider must be highly trustworthy and have compensating controls to protect customer data when it is in plaintext form\n\nAccording to ENISA (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity), customers should expect cloud providers to be highly trustworthy and to have compensating controls in place to protect customer data when it is in plaintext form. This recognition of the cloud provider's trustworthiness and their ability to implement strong compensating controls is crucial when data processing requires temporary decryption, even though encryption is the primary security measure. This expectation helps ensure the security and privacy of the customer's data while it is being processed by the cloud provider.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"978001","poster":"byfener"},{"content":"D is the most logical answer.

PaaS is very diverse and may include client/application, database, and proxy encryption as well as other options.\n\nPaaS (Platform as a Service) is a cloud computing service model that provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. PaaS offerings can be diverse, and the encryption options available within a PaaS environment can vary. It can include various encryption measures such as client/application, database, and proxy encryption, along with other security features. The range of encryption options depends on the specific PaaS provider and the services they offer.","poster":"byfener"}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_id":88,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1691694420,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-08-10 21:07:00","answer":"A","topic":"1","exam_id":433},{"id":"cWeGKdP1DRX82Qtc6tgw","exam_id":433,"unix_timestamp":1687706160,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","question_text":"What can be implemented to help with account granularity and limit blast radius with IaaS an PaaS?","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/113257-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-185-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Configuring secondary authentication","C":"Implementing least privilege accounts","E":"Configuring role-based authentication","A":"Maintaining tight control of the primary account holder credentials","D":"Establishing multiple accounts"},"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"question_id":89,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1723318440.0","poster":"byfener","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. Establishing multiple accounts\n\nTo help with account granularity and limit the blast radius in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) environments, one effective strategy is to establish multiple accounts. This practice is commonly referred to as account isolation or account segmentation.\n\nBy creating separate accounts based on specific roles, projects, or application environments, organizations can achieve finer granularity in access control and resource allocation. This approach reduces the potential blast radius of security incidents by isolating resources and minimizing the impact of any security issues that might occur within a specific account.\n\nThe other options (A, B, C, and E) are also important security measures, but establishing multiple accounts is specifically focused on account granularity and reducing the potential blast radius, which aligns with the question's context.","comment_id":"978029","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"933715","content":"Selected Answer: D\nEstablishing multiple accounts with your provider will help with account granularity \nand to limit blast radius (with IaaS and PaaS).","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719328560.0","poster":"ScottUrbina"}],"timestamp":"2023-06-25 17:16:00"},{"id":"GGmNvDq0OtAwT0azCQOg","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/110726-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-186-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1685560860,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following statements best defines the \"authentication\" component of identity, entitlement, and access management (IdEA).","timestamp":"2023-05-31 21:21:00","exam_id":433,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"E":"None of the above","C":"Establishing/asserting the identity to the application","B":"Updating security protocols to the latest version","D":"The process of specifying and maintaining access policies","A":"A guarantee that data in a repository is 100% unregulated"},"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"The correct answer is:\n\nC.
