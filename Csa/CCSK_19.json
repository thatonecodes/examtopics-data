Such knowledge is a prerequisite to implementing the required measures to ensure compliance with local laws that restrict the cross-border flow of data.\n\nKnowing where the cloud service provider will host the data is crucial for ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations regarding the cross-border transfer of data. Many countries have specific requirements and restrictions on the transfer of personal or sensitive data outside their borders. By knowing the location of the data hosting, the data controller can take appropriate measures to comply with these laws, such as implementing data protection safeguards or obtaining necessary permissions or agreements. It allows the organization to ensure that the data is handled in accordance with applicable legal requirements and helps mitigate the risk of non-compliance and potential legal consequences.","upvote_count":"4"}],"exam_id":433,"question_id":94,"answer":"A","topic":"1","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-05-31 21:37:00","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[]},{"id":"oHswgzL8SpfQrDsQb57k","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-04-01 11:35:00","answer":"A","choices":{"E":"Presentation modality, APIs, Applications, and Hardware","B":"Integration & Middleware, APIS, and Data","D":"Presentation modality, APIs, Applications, and Data","C":"Hardware, APIs, and Data","A":"Hardware, APIs, and Core Connectivity & Delivery"},"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1680341700,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThus IaaS consists of a facility, hardware, an abstraction layer, an orchestration (core connectivity and delivery) layer to tie together the abstracted resources, and APIs to remotely manage the resources and deliver them to consumers.","comment_id":"857790","poster":"cloud_guru_1909","timestamp":"1727775300.0"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":433,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/104712-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-191-discussion/","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"Which components typically comprise Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers?","question_id":95,"topic":"1"}],"exam":{"id":433,"numberOfQuestions":207,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Csa","isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"CCSK","isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":19},"__N_SSP":true}
