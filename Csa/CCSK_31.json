That's why the answer can still be \"The answer could be A, B, or C depending on the provider,\" because in reality, encryption management can vary widely across different providers.

The management of encryption keys can vary from using a single key for all data owners (option A) to assigning one key per data owner (option B) or even allowing multiple keys per data owner (option C). The chosen approach depends on the provider's security architecture, data isolation mechanisms, and the level of encryption granularity required by their customers.\n\nIt's important to note that cloud service providers often offer encryption-related features and options, allowing customers to select their desired level of encryption and key management.
