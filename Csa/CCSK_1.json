False\n\nWhile virtualization is a common technology used in many cloud services, not all cloud services rely on virtualization. There are different types of cloud services, and some may not utilize virtualization technologies.\n\nFor example, in a serverless computing model, the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and runs the code on-demand without the need for the user to provision or manage virtual machines. Serverless computing abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and allows users to focus solely on their application logic without dealing with virtualization directly.\n\nSimilarly, in a container-based cloud service, containers are used to package and run applications with lightweight virtualization, but it may not involve the use of traditional virtual machines.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to say that all cloud services utilize virtualization technologies.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Brainiac"},{"comment_id":"868544","poster":"JoAsiaGje","content":"Selected Answer: B\nagreed","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1712939160.0"},{"comment_id":"843106","timestamp":"1710790620.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\n> As mentioned in the introduction, cloud computing is fundamentally based on virtualization: It’s how we abstract resources to create pools.

On-premise through a software or appliance installation: Alternatively, the cloud consumer can deploy web security as a service on their own premises by installing dedicated software or appliances provided by a third-party vendor. This software or appliance acts as a gateway or intermediary between the cloud consumer's network and the internet, intercepting and inspecting web traffic for security threats.\nBy combining these approaches, the cloud consumer can leverage both the cloud provider's web security service and deploy their own on-premise solution to enhance their web security posture.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1701178680.0","poster":"Brainiac"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"anon_vzla007","timestamp":"1701050340.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWeb Security involves real-time protection, offered either on-premises through software and/or\nappliance installation, or via the Cloud by proxying or redirecting web traffic to the cloud provider\n(or a hybrid of both","comment_id":"907647"},{"comment_id":"846896","upvote_count":"1","content":"D- Explanation :Web Security involves real-time protection, offered either on-premises through software and/or appliance installation, or via the Cloud by proxying or redirecting web traffic to the cloud provider (or a hybrid of both).","timestamp":"1695368520.0","poster":"NJALPHA"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI go for D.\n\nFrom 13.1.2.3:\n> ...via the Cloud by proxying or redirecting web traffic to the cloud provider (or a hybrid of both)","timestamp":"1695076860.0","comment_id":"843311","poster":"moota"},{"upvote_count":"4","comments":[{"comment_id":"793512","timestamp":"1690757940.0","content":"Questions asks about Web Sec as a Service, the answer should only be A","upvote_count":"2","poster":"DrTee","comments":[{"poster":"wakandakindom","timestamp":"1723486260.0","content":"That's true.
