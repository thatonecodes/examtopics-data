Containers provide a lightweight and isolated runtime environment that encapsulates an application and its dependencies. This allows the containerized application to run consistently and reliably across different computing environments, such as development machines, testing environments, and production servers.\n\nContainers achieve portability by bundling the application code, runtime dependencies, libraries, and configuration files into a single package. This package, known as a container image, can be easily distributed and deployed on various host systems that have a compatible container runtime, such as Docker or Kubernetes. Containers abstract away the underlying infrastructure and operating system differences, making it possible to run the same containerized application consistently across different environments.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1716895020.0","comment_id":"908572"}],"topic":"1","choices":{"B":"True","A":"False"},"question_id":202,"timestamp":"2023-05-28 13:17:00","unix_timestamp":1685272620,"answer":"B","answer_description":""},{"id":"MSQY5PPCdfuLrHwbuZoA","question_images":[],"question_id":203,"choices":{"D":"The Data Security Lifecycle has six stages, can be non-linear, and is distinct in that data must always pass through all phases.","A":"The Data Security Lifecycle has six stages, is strictly linear, and never varies.","B":"The Data Security Lifecycle has six stages, can be non-linear, and varies in that some data may never pass through all stages.","E":"The Data Security Lifecycle has five stages, can be non-linear, and is distinct in that data must always pass through all phases.","C":"The Data Security Lifecycle has five stages, is circular, and varies in that some data may never pass through all stages."},"question_text":"Which statement best describes the Data Security Lifecycle?","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1681635420,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1713257820.0","poster":"JoAsiaGje","content":"from Security Guidance, page 63: \nThe lifecycle includes six phases from creation to destruction.

It ensures that each object is encrypted before being stored and can only be decrypted by authorized users or applications with the appropriate encryption keys.\nObject encryption provides granular control over the encryption of data at rest, making it suitable for securing data stored in object storage. It helps protect the confidentiality and integrity of the stored objects, even if the underlying storage infrastructure is compromised.\nThe other encryption methods mentioned are not specifically tailored for object storage scenarios:\nA. Database encryption typically refers to encrypting data within a database management system, which is different from object storage.\nB.
