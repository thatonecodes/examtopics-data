False\n\nVulnerability assessments can be integrated into CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines, and it is not accurate to say that they cannot be easily integrated due to provider restrictions.\n\nIn fact, integrating vulnerability assessments into CI/CD pipelines is a recommended practice to ensure the security of software applications throughout the development lifecycle. By incorporating vulnerability scanning and testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline, organizations can automate the process of identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities early on.\n\nCloud service providers typically offer APIs, SDKs, and tools that allow developers to integrate security testing and vulnerability assessments into their CI/CD pipelines. These tools can scan the application code, dependencies, and container images for known vulnerabilities, configuration weaknesses, and common security issues."}],"topic":"1","question_text":"Vulnerability assessments cannot be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines because of provider restrictions.","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"True","A":"False"},"exam_id":433,"unix_timestamp":1685270760,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/110435-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-89-discussion/","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2023-05-28 12:46:00","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":196},{"id":"poz2Vets1dyMyzpxfzMD","unix_timestamp":1684235100,"answers_community":[],"answer":"B","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/109392-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-9-discussion/","question_text":"APIs and web services require extensive hardening and must assume attacks from authenticated and unauthenticated adversaries.","discussion":[{"poster":"ElenaCyber","timestamp":"1731762300.0","content":"It's B: CCSK Security Guide pg 117: APIs and web services need to be extensively hardened and assume attacks from both authenticated and unauthenticated adversaries.

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a framework that provides a structured set of controls that can be used by customers to assess the security posture of their cloud providers. It's designed for customers to use when evaluating potential cloud service providers (CSPs) and their offerings.\nSubmitting the CCM on behalf of the CSP to the CSA STAR registry would involve the cloud customer submitting information about the CSP's security controls and practices. However, the CCM is typically intended for customers to evaluate the CSP's security, rather than for the CSP to submit their own information. The responsibility for submitting accurate and up-to-date security information to the STAR registry lies with the CSP themselves.
