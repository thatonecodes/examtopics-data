You can instrument the technology stack with your own logging.\n\nIf there are gaps in network logging data provided by the cloud provider, one option is to instrument your own technology stack with additional logging capabilities. This involves implementing logging mechanisms within your applications, systems, or network infrastructure to capture the desired data.\n\nBy instrumenting your technology stack with your own logging, you can collect the specific information you need for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security purposes. This gives you more control over the logging process and allows you to fill in any gaps in the network logging data provided by the cloud provider.\n\nIt's important to note that the cloud provider may have limitations or restrictions on certain aspects of logging due to security or privacy considerations. In such cases, you may need to work with the cloud provider to find an acceptable solution that meets your logging requirements while adhering to their policies."},{"comment_id":"843108","upvote_count":"1","poster":"moota","content":"Selected Answer: C\n> Where there are gaps you can sometimes instrument the technology stack with your own logging. This can work within instances, containers, and application code in order to gain telemetry important for the investigation.

On-demand self-service\n\nOn-demand self-service is one of the essential characteristics of cloud services. It refers to the capability for consumers to independently and automatically provision computing resources without the need for human interaction with the cloud service provider. Users can access and allocate resources, such as server instances, storage, and network bandwidth, as per their requirements, typically through a self-service portal or API. This characteristic enables users to scale resources up or down on-demand, in a flexible and automated manner, based on their immediate needs, without relying on manual intervention from the cloud service provider.","timestamp":"1732455420.0"}],"exam_id":433,"answer_description":"","question_id":103,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-05-24 13:37:00","question_text":"Cloud services exhibit five essential characteristics that demonstrate their relation to, and differences from, traditional computing approaches.

In case of an IaaS the mentioned references can be valid, so the cloud consumer is responsible to manage the virtual or abstracted infrastructure if those are consumer managed, but still in case of IaaS the Managed Services or the Serverless services run on virutal or abstracted infrastructure and those are managed by the Cloud provider.
