B and C\n\nTo monitor and filter data in a virtual network when traffic might not cross the physical network, you can use the following methods:\n\nB. Route traffic to a virtual appliance on the same virtual network: You can direct the network traffic within the virtual environment to a virtual appliance, which could be a dedicated monitoring or filtering tool. This appliance can analyze and filter the traffic within the virtual network itself.\n\nC. Route traffic to a virtual network monitoring or filtering tool on the same hardware: Virtual network monitoring or filtering tools can run on the same hardware as the virtual machines and monitor the traffic directly within the virtual environment.\n\nOption D (A and B) suggests routing traffic to the physical network, which might not be feasible or efficient in virtualized environments where traffic often stays within the virtual network.","timestamp":"1723231620.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-08-09 21:27:00","exam_id":433,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":""},{"id":"PfsI1oJVJQAn78fXJJwO","unix_timestamp":1666985100,"answer":"E","choices":{"C":"Attribute","E":"Identity","D":"Identifier","B":"Role","A":"Persona"},"answer_description":"","question_text":"Which concept is defined as the unique expression of an entity within a given namespace?","exam_id":433,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/86609-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-134-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["E (100%)"],"timestamp":"2022-10-28 21:25:00","question_id":37,"answer_ET":"E","discussion":[{"poster":"Azo_4952","timestamp":"1698521100.0","upvote_count":"8","content":"Identity: the unique expression of an entity within a given namespace.
