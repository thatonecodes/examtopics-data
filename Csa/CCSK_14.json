Isolated environments\n\nA benefit of application security in a cloud environment is the concept of isolated environments. Cloud environments can provide the ability to isolate applications and their associated resources from each other. This isolation helps prevent the impact of security incidents or breaches in one application from affecting others. It adds a layer of protection and containment, contributing to overall security and reducing the potential for cross-application vulnerabilities or exploits.\n\nThe other options (A, B, C, D) do not accurately describe benefits of application security in a cloud environment.","comment_id":"977222","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723264080.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1691638020,"timestamp":"2023-08-10 05:27:00","choices":{"B":"Limited detailed visibility","D":"Non-unified interface","A":"Increased application scope","C":"Reduced transparency","E":"Isolated environments"},"answers_community":["E (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"What is a benefit of application security in a cloud environment?","question_id":66,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_images":[]},{"id":"ar4dJCoSVYm1bQQ3us8y","answer":"B","exam_id":433,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-08-10 05:30:00","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1691638200,"topic":"1","question_text":"You have a business relationship with a cloud provider for all sales management functionality.

Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)\n\nIn the described scenario, where you have a business relationship with a cloud provider and you are customizing the interface and functionality through APIs and SDKs while relying on the cloud provider's back-end service, the service model is Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). In a PaaS model, the cloud provider offers a platform that allows you to develop, deploy, and manage applications while handling the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking. You are responsible for customizing the applications and their functionality, while the cloud provider takes care of the platform and infrastructure.","timestamp":"1723260600.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/117730-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-164-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)","D":"Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)","A":"Software-as-a-service (SaaS)","C":"Desktop-as-a-service (DaaS)","E":"Identity-as-a-service (IDaaS)"},"question_id":67},{"id":"t6esT5l0z94dqxcENOFN","question_images":[],"question_text":"Absent other evidence, such as tampering or hacking, documents should not be considered more or less admissible or credible because they were created or stored in the cloud.","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\npg 52; 3.1.3.9 Authentication","poster":"JAMBER","timestamp":"1718218380.0","comment_id":"1094954","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1707543120.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

It is recommended to use per-customer keys when possible, in order to better enforce multitenancy isolation.

False\n\nWhen the application components communicate directly with the cloud service, the management plane and metastructure would typically not fall within the application security scope. Application security primarily focuses on securing the application's code, logic, and data. The management plane and metastructure refer to higher-level layers of cloud architecture that involve the management and orchestration of resources and services within the cloud environment.
