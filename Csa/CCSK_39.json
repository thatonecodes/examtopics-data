Scope of the assessment and the exact included features and services for the assessment.\n\nWhen it comes to third-party audits or attestations, the scope of the assessment is of utmost importance. Providers should clearly publish the scope of the assessment, specifying the exact features, services, and components included in the assessment. This helps customers understand which aspects of the provider's offering have been evaluated for security, compliance, or other relevant factors.\n\nBy evaluating the scope, customers can assess if the assessed components align with their specific requirements, regulatory obligations, or industry standards. It provides transparency and allows customers to make informed decisions regarding the security and compliance of the provider's offerings.","timestamp":"1716891960.0","poster":"Brainiac","comment_id":"908528","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1707475620.0","comment_id":"803099","poster":"SKUNK1","upvote_count":"1","content":"Agree with beazzlebub too"},{"comment_id":"730138","timestamp":"1701248580.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt is A","upvote_count":"2","poster":"A_Nevermind"},{"timestamp":"1698691800.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"707975","poster":"cjkuga","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAgree with beazzlebub's answer"}],"question_id":191,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/csa/view/84785-exam-ccsk-topic-1-question-84-discussion/","topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Scope of the assessment and the exact included features and services for the assessment","E":"Full API access to all required services","D":"Service-level agreements between all parties","B":"Provider infrastructure information including maintenance windows and contracts","C":"Network or architecture diagrams including all end point security devices in use"},"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_images":[]},{"id":"h25imbWeAld8s1L9G5LN","answer":"C","timestamp":"2022-11-15 00:59:00","question_text":"When mapping functions to lifecycle phases, which functions are required to successfully process data?","question_id":192,"exam_id":433,"answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"6","poster":"CloudSecurityMan","comment_id":"1002887","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn CSA's Cloud Security Guidance v4.0, find to page 65, Section 5.1.2.2.

True\n\nWhen designing an encryption system, it is highly recommended to start with a threat model.\n\nA threat model helps identify potential risks, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors that the encryption system may face. It involves analyzing the system's assets, potential adversaries, and the potential impact of successful attacks. By understanding the threats and risks, designers can make informed decisions about the appropriate encryption algorithms, key management practices, and overall system architecture.\n\nThreat modeling allows designers to identify potential weaknesses in the encryption system and make proactive decisions to mitigate those risks. It helps ensure that the encryption system is designed to effectively protect sensitive data and withstand potential attacks.\n\nTherefore, starting the design process with a threat model is an important step in developing a robust and secure encryption system."},{"content":"From Security Guidance v4.
