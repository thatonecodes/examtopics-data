Encryption. Data fragmentation alone may not provide sufficient security measures to protect data. However, when encryption is combined with data fragmentation, it can significantly enhance security. Encryption ensures that even if an unauthorized entity gains access to fragmented data, the encrypted pieces are unintelligible without the corresponding encryption keys. This adds an additional layer of protection to the fragmented data and helps safeguard its confidentiality.","poster":"moten","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Brainiac","timestamp":"1732800540.0","comment_id":"908593","upvote_count":"1","content":"A. Encryption\nData fragmentation involves dividing data into smaller pieces or fragments and distributing them across different locations or systems. This technique can help mitigate the impact of a data breach by making it more difficult for an attacker to access and reconstruct the complete data set.\nHowever, data fragmentation alone does not provide confidentiality for the individual data fragments. To ensure the confidentiality of each fragment, encryption can be used.\nBy applying encryption to the fragmented data, even if an attacker gains access to one or more fragments, they would not be able to decipher the sensitive information without the encryption key. This provides an additional layer of security and confidentiality to the fragmented data."},{"content":"Definitely not E. CCSK Study Guide pg 141: Insulation of clients.

The process of specifying and maintaining access policies\n\nAuthorization, as a component of identity, entitlement, and access management, refers to the process of specifying and maintaining access policies. It involves defining rules and permissions that determine what actions and resources a user or entity is allowed to access based on their identity and assigned roles or attributes. Authorization ensures that individuals and entities can only access the resources and perform the actions that they have been granted permission for, following established policies.","timestamp":"1723172700.0"},{"comment_id":"919842","timestamp":"1718000220.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: E\nThe correct answer is E. Enforcing the rules by which access is granted to the resources. Authorization, as a component of identity, entitlement, and access management (IAM), refers to the process of determining and enforcing the rules or policies that dictate access to resources. It involves verifying whether an authenticated user or entity has the necessary permissions or privileges to perform specific actions or access certain resources within a system or application. Authorization ensures that users are granted appropriate access based on their roles, permissions, and the established security policies.","poster":"moten"},{"timestamp":"1716895860.0","comment_id":"908595","upvote_count":"2","content":"E. Enforcing the rules by which access is granted to the resources\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining and enforcing the rules or permissions by which access is granted to specific resources or functionalities within a system. It involves evaluating the privileges and entitlements associated with an identity or user and deciding whether they have the necessary permissions to perform a requested action or access a particular resource.\n\nAuthorization typically works in conjunction with authentication, which verifies the identity of the user or entity requesting access. Once the authentication is successful, the authorization component determines the level of access rights and permissions associated with that identity and enforces them.\n\nBy enforcing access control rules and permissions, authorization ensures that users are only granted access to the resources they are entitled to, based on their role, privileges, or other defined criteria. This helps protect sensitive data, maintain system integrity, and prevent unauthorized access or misuse of resources.","poster":"Brainiac"}],"exam_id":433,"answer_ET":"E","answer_description":"","topic":"1"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":207,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":433,"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Csa","name":"CCSK","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":42},"__N_SSP":true}
