The full syntax is \"terraform apply -replace=[ADDRESS]\"\n\nInstructs Terraform to plan to replace the resource instance with the given address. This is helpful when one or more remote objects have become degraded, and you can use replacement objects with the same configuration to align with immutable infrastructure patterns. You cannot use -replace with the -destroy option, and it is only available from Terraform v0.15.2 onwards. For earlier versions, use terraform taint to achieve a similar result.\n\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/plan#planning-options","comment_id":"1208462","timestamp":"1731089340.0","poster":"SilentH","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1715184540,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-05-08 18:09:00"},{"id":"9KzVw6Y1oSBG1OaUXqwH","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/134462-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-326-discussion/","exam_id":169,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nTF_LOG_PATH is used instead\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/debugging","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1724429640.0","poster":"J_boy","comment_id":"1157373"},{"poster":"6957dbd","comment_id":"1170303","content":"This is a badly worded question...\n\nTerraform has detailed logs that you can enable by setting the TF_LOG environment variable to any value.
