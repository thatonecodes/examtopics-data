With a Sentinel policy, which runs before every apply.\n\nTerraform Enterprise can enforce security controls through the use of Sentinel policies. Sentinel is a policy as code framework that integrates with Terraform Enterprise and can be used to enforce specific security controls. In this case, the Sentinel policy could check that all new S3 buckets are set to be private and encrypted at rest and prevent the Terraform apply from proceeding if the buckets do not meet this requirement. This ensures that the security control is automatically and proactively enforced every time Terraform makes changes to the infrastructure."},{"poster":"selvaraj133ece","timestamp":"1722575400.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"969700","content":"Answer, B only.
