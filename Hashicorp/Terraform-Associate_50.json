All provisioner configurations must be part of a resource definition because their execution context is tightly coupled with resources.\n\nAlternatives to Provisioners: For scenarios where you might think about using provisioners in a more decoupled or independent manner, Terraform suggests other mechanisms. For instance, if the goal is to manage configuration or orchestration that seems beyond the scope of what should be tightly coupled to a single resource's lifecycle, tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or Terraform itself (through resource dependencies and proper module design) are recommended to handle such configurations. These tools can be used in conjunction with Terraform but managed through their mechanisms for orchestration or configuration management, rather than through Terraform provisioners.","poster":"ravk2321","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709930400.0","comment_id":"1169094"},{"poster":"samimshaikh","comment_id":"1108456","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTrue provisioner should only placed under the resource block \n\nPS E:\\Terraform> terraform.exe validate\n╷\n│ Error: Unsupported block type\n│\n│ on main.tf line 34:\n│ 34: provisioner \"local-exec\" {\n│\n│ Blocks of type \"provisioner\" are not expected here.\n╵","timestamp":"1703836440.0"},{"timestamp":"1703798040.0","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1108112","poster":"gold4otas","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhile it's common to place provisioners inside the resource block for clarity and organization, they can also be defined outside of the block at the same level.
