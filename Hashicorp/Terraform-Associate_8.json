A request must be submitted for infrastructure changes\nC. As additional resources are required, more tickets are submitted\n\nExplanation:\n\nB. A request must be submitted for infrastructure changes: In a ticket-based system, users often need to raise a request or a ticket for any infrastructure changes. This process can introduce delays, especially when changes are needed urgently or frequently. It can slow down the provisioning process as it adds an additional layer of approval and manual intervention.\n\nC. As additional resources are required, more tickets are submitted: In a ticket-based system, when scaling is required, users may need to submit additional tickets for each resource or instance they need. This manual process can become a bottleneck as the number of tickets increases, making it less efficient for scaling rapidly or handling dynamic workloads."},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1102958","timestamp":"1718995200.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nB and C"},{"comment_id":"1098022","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1718521620.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nB and C. increase amount of C","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"805181","poster":"kennynelcon","timestamp":"1691747880.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nB and C \nlets populate C"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"775342","timestamp":"1689329340.0","poster":"Edileimig","content":"Selected Answer: C\nB and C"},{"content":"B and C","comment_id":"766403","poster":"robertninho","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1688539380.0"},{"comment_id":"751969","poster":"DawidB","timestamp":"1687325100.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nB and C indeed."},{"content":"B and C are correct","comment_id":"682759","poster":"legendary7","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1680098820.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nB and C","poster":"dani88ge","timestamp":"1679256360.0","comment_id":"673538","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"668044","timestamp":"1678720380.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"B and C","poster":"Pinky0289"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"dinesh198728","timestamp":"1678447620.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB and C both ticket based","comment_id":"665267"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"kprod","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is BC","comment_id":"660535","timestamp":"1678055460.0"}],"answers_community":["C (67%)","B (33%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/80427-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-131-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-09-05 22:31:00","question_id":37,"topic":"1","answer":"C","choices":{"B":"A request must be submitted for infrastructure changes","A":"A full audit trail of the request and fulfillment process is generated","D":"A catalog of approved resources can be accessed from drop down lists in a request form","C":"As additional resources are required, more tickets are submitted"},"exam_id":169},{"id":"8kKmoJiVhbdv2PjS9OEc","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-09-01 12:30:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/79027-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-132-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1662028200,"question_id":38,"question_text":"Which of the following statements about Terraform modules is not true?","answer":"A","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA: In addition to modules from the local filesystem, Terraform can load modules from a public or private registry.
