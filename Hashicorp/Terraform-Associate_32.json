When you want Terraform to ignore a resource on the next apply.\n\nThe terraform taint command is used to mark a resource managed by Terraform as \"tainted,\" which means that it needs to be recreated on the next apply. This is useful when a resource is in an inconsistent state or needs to be recreated for some other reason.\n\nHowever, the taint command does not destroy or force Terraform to destroy a resource on the next apply (option A and B). Instead, it marks the resource as tainted, indicating that it needs to be recreated. When you run terraform apply after marking a resource as tainted, Terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the terraform taint command only marks a single resource as tainted and does not destroy all the infrastructure in your workspace.","comment_id":"838715","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bilalglg93350","timestamp":"1694678760.0"},{"comment_id":"805550","upvote_count":"2","poster":"SilentMilli","timestamp":"1691773380.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe \"terraform taint\" command is used to mark a resource as \"tainted,\" indicating to Terraform that the resource should be destroyed and recreated on the next \"terraform apply\" command.
