Terraform uses this persisted state data to keep track of the resources it manages. Since it needs the state in order to know which real-world infrastructure objects correspond to the resources in a configuration, everyone working with a given collection of infrastructure resources must be able to access the same state data.\n\nBy default, Terraform implicitly uses a backend called local to store state as a local file on disk. Every other backend stores state in a remote service of some kind, which allows multiple people to access it. Accessing state in a remote service generally requires some kind of access credentials, since state data contains extremely sensitive information.\n\nSome backends act like plain \"remote disks\" for state files; others support locking the state while operations are being performed, which helps prevent conflicts and inconsistencies.","poster":"HDDH"},{"timestamp":"1670482800.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"stalk98","content":"answer is B","comment_id":"613076"},{"poster":"bigboi23","comment_id":"603065","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSome backends act like plain \"remote disks\" for state files; others support locking the state while operations are being performed, which helps prevent conflicts and inconsistencies.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1668733440.0"},{"poster":"Sunrayk","comment_id":"600389","timestamp":"1668221100.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer should be B False\nhttps://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/75508-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-66-discussion/","question_id":311,"choices":{"A":"True","B":"False"},"answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1652316300,"timestamp":"2022-05-12 02:45:00","answers_community":["B (92%)","8%"],"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"topic":"1"},{"id":"Zp09khFMsCXeALjwliri","choices":{"A":"Validates your expectations against the execution plan without permanently modifying state","B":"Initializes your working directory containing your Terraform configuration files","D":"Reconciles Terraform's state against deployed resources and permanently modifies state using the current status of deployed resources","C":"Formats your Terraform configuration files"},"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (86%)","14%"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/76915-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-67-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer":"A","exam_id":169,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_text":"How can terraform plan aid in the development process?","unix_timestamp":1655618280,"topic":"1","question_id":312,"timestamp":"2022-06-19 07:58:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1672216080.0","upvote_count":"8","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct answer : Validates your expectations against the execution plan without permanently modifying state\n\n\"The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure.

Validates your expectations against the execution plan without permanently modifying state\n\nTerraform's plan command is used to create an execution plan that outlines the steps that Terraform will take to reach your desired infrastructure state. It allows you to preview and validate the changes that will be made to your infrastructure before actually making those changes. This can be helpful in the development process because it allows you to see exactly what will be changed and ensure that it aligns with your expectations before you apply those changes.","poster":"chimons"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"834541","upvote_count":"2","content":"D.
