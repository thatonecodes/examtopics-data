Answer should be AD only.\nLOL I hope you didn't look up Q19.\n\nOkay, reasons I'm not sure about A:\n- you change a Terraform-managed resource via the Azure Cloud Console, \n- when you run Terraform plan or apply, Terraform will first do a refresh and update the metadata to what you've changed in cloud console. BUT Terraform will subsequently start applying what's in the config file and revert the change you've made via cloud console. Finally it updates the state file with what's in terraform config.","timestamp":"1716078300.0"}],"timestamp":"1714151460.0","content":"Refer to an earlier question #98. Answer should be A and D.

It is not correct, terraform plan doesn't reflect the changes, it only shows the changes to you when you run terraform apply it reflects the change.\nB. When you do manual change in resource, Terraform doesn't imply changes automatically\nC. Terraform never creates a new state file for the new changes and it uses the existing one unless you don't specify a different backend.\nD. Correct. You can only update tfstate file with either terraform apply (suggested) or terraform apply -refresh-only (not suggested though).\n\nOption A has probably typo issue, terraform plan shouldn't be in there."},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1687786500.0","poster":"DevoteamAnalytix","comment_id":"934510","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nFor me B and C is wrong, so it's A and D"}]},{"id":"sRbjsvWwQbhVluW20WR3","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2023-06-27 03:02:00","question_text":"Which statement describes a goal of infrastructure as code?","unix_timestamp":1687827720,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"wora refers to the principle of reusability of code in the software development field, not iac\nthe answer whould be D. programmatic config or resources","comment_id":"1252414","timestamp":"1721562540.0","poster":"enklau"},{"comment_id":"967614","poster":"ShakDaddy","timestamp":"1690762800.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nRepeat question but answer is D","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1687827720.0","comment_id":"934934","content":"D This means that the infrastructure is defined in code, and the code is used to create and manage the infrastructure.","poster":"Jlee7","comments":[{"poster":"DevoteamAnalytix","timestamp":"1688975040.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Same question like #097 and there the majority votes for D (programmatic config of resources)","comment_id":"947870"}],"upvote_count":"1"}],"choices":{"D":"The programmatic configuration of resources","C":"Write once, run anywhere","A":"A pipeline process to test and deliver software","B":"Defining a vendor-agnostic API"},"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/113366-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-273-discussion/","question_id":194,"exam_id":169,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_description":""},{"id":"ayLyVNdd9UEdlXCkrFz5","choices":{"A":"True","B":"False"},"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/117993-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-274-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-08-13 00:30:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":169,"answer":"A","question_text":"terraform validate confirms the syntax of Terraform files.","question_id":195,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1691879400,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/validate\nThe terraform validate command validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.\nso option A : true is correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722674160.0","comment_id":"1260182","poster":"090200f"},{"poster":"inkedia3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. True\n\nCorrect, terraform validate is used to confirm the syntax and structure of Terraform files. It checks whether your configuration files are correctly written and can be successfully parsed by Terraform.
