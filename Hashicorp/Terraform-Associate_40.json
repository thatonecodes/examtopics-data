False\n\nThe statement is not accurate. terraform validate is a command in Terraform that checks whether the configuration files are syntactically and structurally correct. It validates the configuration syntax and structure but does not confirm that your infrastructure matches the Terraform state file.\n\nTo confirm that your infrastructure matches the Terraform state file, you would typically use commands like terraform plan to compare the current state of your configuration with the state recorded in the Terraform state file.

Rebuild only the instances that were deleted\n\nWhen you run terraform apply after some instances have been accidentally deleted by a senior admin, Terraform will detect the differences between your desired configuration (defined in your Terraform files) and the actual state of your cloud infrastructure (as recorded in the Terraform state file). It will then take the necessary actions to reconcile the two.\n\nIn this case, Terraform will identify that the instances were deleted and no longer exist in the state file. It will then create new instances to match the desired configuration, effectively rebuilding only the instances that were deleted. This approach is one of the key benefits of using Terraform: it helps maintain the desired infrastructure state even when changes occur outside of Terraform's control.","poster":"Pete987","comment_id":"988561","timestamp":"1724435940.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"choices":{"B":"Tear down the entire workspace infrastructure and rebuild it","D":"Stop and generate an error message about the missing instances","C":"Rebuild only the instances that were deleted","A":"Build a completely brand new set of infrastructure"},"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/118907-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-279-discussion/","question_images":[],"exam_id":169,"answer_description":"","isMC":true}],"exam":{"provider":"Hashicorp","isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":169,"numberOfQuestions":347,"name":"Terraform Associate","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":40},"__N_SSP":true}
