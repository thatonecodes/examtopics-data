While it's common to have a one-to-one mapping between configurations and workspaces, it's not a strict requirement.\n\nIn practice, you can have multiple remote workspaces associated with a single Terraform configuration. Each workspace can have its own state, variables, and environment. This allows you to manage different instances or environments of your infrastructure using the same configuration. For example, you might have separate workspaces for development, staging, and production environments, all using the same Terraform configuration.\n\nTo summarize, while it's typical to have a one-to-one mapping between a Terraform configuration and a remote workspace, it's not a strict limitation, and you can use multiple workspaces with a single configuration if it suits your organizational or project needs.","timestamp":"1702489200.0","comment_id":"1095702","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB- False","comment_id":"1080024","poster":"Ramdi1","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1700919480.0"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/127157-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-288-discussion/","answer":"B","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1700919480,"question_id":210}],"exam":{"provider":"Hashicorp","id":169,"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":347,"isBeta":false,"name":"Terraform Associate","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":42},"__N_SSP":true}
