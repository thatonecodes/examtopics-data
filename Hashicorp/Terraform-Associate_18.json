The Terraform code is copied to the target resources to be applied locally and could expose secrets if a target resource is compromised.\n\nStoring secrets, such as passwords or API keys, directly in Terraform code is a bad practice for several reasons. Firstly, Terraform code is typically stored in version control, and it may be copied to multiple systems from which it's run, such as a developer's machine, a CI/CD pipeline, or a Terraform cloud workspace. Any of those systems may not have robust security mechanisms, and exposing secrets in code leaves them vulnerable to potential attacks. Secondly, the Terraform code is copied to the target resources to be applied locally, so any secrets in the code could be exposed if a target resource is compromised. Therefore, it is recommended to use a secrets management system, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to store and manage secrets outside of Terraform code.","timestamp":"1680264060.0","comments":[{"poster":"090200f","timestamp":"1721754120.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"agreed","comment_id":"1253793"}],"comment_id":"857021","upvote_count":"1","poster":"camps"},{"comment_id":"835100","timestamp":"1678458120.0","poster":"khaled_razouk","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB&C is the correct answer"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"788092","poster":"Daro_","content":"BC\nin my opinion","timestamp":"1674676620.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"779071","poster":"kounilasco","timestamp":"1673970060.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\ni choose A and B"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"kounilasco","comment_id":"777520","timestamp":"1673862780.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nA and B are good answers"},{"comment_id":"776533","poster":"resnef","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nanswer is AB\nC is wrong, as yaza said, terraform code will not be copied to target resource, if you deploy a VM the code will not copied to the VM","timestamp":"1673785680.0"},{"poster":"gekkehenk","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1673440440.0","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nA, because \"hard coding\" in general makes code less re-usable.\nB, VCS is also true, this might expose the password","comment_id":"772478"},{"timestamp":"1671916680.0","comment_id":"755158","poster":"AShahine21","upvote_count":"4","content":"What the hell some people are voting for A!!!!"},{"poster":"sejar","timestamp":"1669736460.0","comment_id":"730570","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nCode will not be copied to target location","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1664277180.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"The code will not be copied to Resources hence C is wron\nA is correct because if a secret to connect to a DB or backed is used in code and if the code is executed where they use a diffrent DB/backend the code cannot run.
