It ensures that Terraform has the latest information about the existing resources in the cloud, but it doesn't involve credentials or make any modifications to the resources. Credentials are typically required during resource provisioning or modifications, not during a refresh operation.","timestamp":"1714819440.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1707136560.0","content":"A. Credentials\n\nWhen running terraform apply -refresh-only, Terraform does not reference credentials. The -refresh-only flag is used to perform a refresh of the state without making any changes to the actual resources in the cloud provider. During this operation, Terraform retrieves the current state of the resources from the cloud provider, updates the state file with the latest information, but it does not perform any actions that require credentials (e.g., creating, modifying, or deleting resources).\n\nThe -refresh-only flag is useful when you want to synchronize Terraform's understanding of the resources with the real state in the cloud provider without performing any destructive actions. It allows you to update the state file with the latest resource information without making any changes to the infrastructure.","comment_id":"972910","poster":"Paul_white"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/refresh","comment_id":"890593","timestamp":"1699266840.0","poster":"Oleg_gol","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1683362040,"answer_description":"","answer":"C"},{"id":"60ma0dy2u9cH5tfjKOMB","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1683361800,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/108619-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-253-discussion/","question_id":172,"answer":"A","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nBy running terraform fmt during the code linting phase of your CI/CD process, you can automatically ensure that all Terraform files are formatted according to the standard conventions before any code is merged into the main branch.
