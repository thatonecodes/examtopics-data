Destroy all infrastructure in the Terraform state file.\n\nTerraform destroy is a command used to destroy all the infrastructure resources that are defined in the Terraform configuration file. This command removes all resources created by the Terraform configuration and deletes them from the infrastructure provider, effectively tearing down the entire infrastructure that was created using Terraform. The command operates on the Terraform state file, which is used to track the current state of the infrastructure. When the command is executed, it removes all resources in the state file and makes the infrastructure match the desired state of having no resources."},{"timestamp":"1726988700.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"phidelics","content":"Selected Answer: A\ndestroy all infrastructure","comment_id":"846843"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"782259","timestamp":"1721473860.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
