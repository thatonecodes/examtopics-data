The Free tier includes everything needed to use Terraform in a team setting, including remote state, remote runs, private registry, secure variables, dynamic provider credentials, and additional security features for a robust security posture from the start. It also includes unlimited users and applies, so organizations can onboard any team member to collaborate, provision, and manage their own resources.\n\nFor larger teams with additional collaboration and governance features, there are paid plans.

The ability to reuse best practice configurations and settings.\n\nAn operations team that uses infrastructure as code has the advantage of being able to reuse best practice configurations and settings across their infrastructure. This enables the team to quickly and easily provision new resources, and ensures that resources are configured consistently across the infrastructure. By defining infrastructure as code, the team can also automate the provisioning and configuration of resources, which helps reduce the risk of manual errors and frees up time for more important tasks.","poster":"camps","timestamp":"1696077000.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"779307","content":"C is the right one","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689617940.0","poster":"ruganesh"},{"poster":"RVivek","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the answer","timestamp":"1679833500.0","comment_id":"679723","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[],"question_id":43,"topic":"1","answer":"C","choices":{"B":"The ability to update existing infrastructure","A":"The ability to delete infrastructure","C":"The ability to reuse best practice configurations and settings","D":"The ability to autoscale a group of servers"},"timestamp":"2022-09-01 21:47:00","answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/79167-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-137-discussion/","exam_id":169,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1662061620},{"id":"1i6bikT22rs21ZU7E9C0","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1662061860,"timestamp":"2022-09-01 21:51:00","choices":{"C":"terraform refresh","A":"terraform mv aws_security_group.htp aws_security_group.http","B":"terraform apply"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/79169-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-138-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"exam_id":169,"question_text":"You have modified your Terraform configuration to fix a typo in the Terraform ID of a resource from aws_security_group.http to aws_security_group.http\n//IMG//\n\nWhich of the following commands would you run to update the ID in state without destroying the resource?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"13","comment_id":"656633","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI guess it had to be terraform state mv .....\nThe terraform state mv command changes which resource address in your configuration is associated with a particular real-world object.
