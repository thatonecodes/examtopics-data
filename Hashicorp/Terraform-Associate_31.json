True\n\nAny user can publish modules to the public Terraform Module Registry. By publishing a module to the public registry, users can share their infrastructure code with the community and contribute to best practices. The public Terraform Module Registry contains a wide range of modules created by the community and HashiCorp, which can be used to simplify Terraform configurations and promote code reusability."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA, yes you can","poster":"hahano","timestamp":"1727740740.0","comment_id":"857485"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/104671-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-234-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-04-01 01:59:00","question_id":151,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":"False","A":"True"},"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"Any user can publish modules to the public Terraform Module Registry.","answer":"A","isMC":true,"exam_id":169},{"id":"1x6R2MallkYiq6ct6G7G","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/108526-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-235-discussion/","answers_community":["D (90%)","10%"],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2023-05-05 08:30:00","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"D":"terraform fmt","A":"terraform validate","B":"terraform output","C":"terraform plan"},"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"090200f","comment_id":"1258449","content":"Selected Answer: D\nkey word is 'human readable' so terraform fmt is correct answer","timestamp":"1722380700.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1695875400.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Pikopo","content":"D is the correct answer","comment_id":"1019416"},{"poster":"Jhaggar","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is D. terraform fmt is used to format the Terraform configuration files, making them more human-readable and consistent.
