As long as the person applying the plan has appropriate permissions to modify the resources in question, they should be able to apply the plan. This means that multiple team members can collaborate on Terraform configurations and one person's plan can be applied by someone else.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that good practices might involve controlling who has the necessary permissions to apply changes, especially in production environments, to ensure that changes are reviewed and approved before being applied.","poster":"tfdestroy","timestamp":"1690555500.0"},{"poster":"junk4share","content":"Selected Answer: B\nb is the answer","timestamp":"1688741220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"945772"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\naws_instance.example[*].id\nis a valid","comment_id":"897351","timestamp":"1684049220.0","poster":"kiran15789"},{"timestamp":"1682899380.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"885720","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer","poster":"Ni33"},{"content":"B is correct","comment_id":"856087","poster":"Power123","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1680201300.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1676463960.0","comment_id":"809484","poster":"sahara99"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"wimarsha","comment_id":"792370","timestamp":"1675051440.0","content":"Someone can run an apply without plan also. \nSo B is the correct answer."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
