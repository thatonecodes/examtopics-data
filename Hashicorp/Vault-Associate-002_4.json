This design choice allows the cached tokens and lease information to persist across agent restarts. If the cache were only kept in memory (option D), any restart of the agent would result in losing that data, forcing a reauthentication. Storing the cache in an unencrypted file (by default) provides persistence and continuity, even though it means the data is stored in plaintext on disk unless additional measures are taken."},{"comment_id":"1129016","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721673660.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/caching#caching-and-renewals","poster":"daz_rekka"}],"exam_id":170,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/131829-exam-vault-associate-002-topic-1-question-26-discussion/","choices":{"A":"In a file encrypted using the Vault transit secret engine","C":"In an unencrypted file","B":"In the Vault key/value store","D":"In memory"},"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_id":19,"answer_description":"","question_text":"Where does the Vault Agent store its cache?","question_images":[],"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (50%)","C (50%)"],"unix_timestamp":1705956060,"timestamp":"2024-01-22 21:41:00"},{"id":"3xhNGvUXyKf40EFSHZJR","question_text":"Your organization has an initiative to reduce and ultimately remove the use of long lived X.509 certificates.
