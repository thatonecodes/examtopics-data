State file.\n\nThe default \"local\" Terraform backend stores the state file on the local disk of the machine running Terraform. The state file contains information about the resources managed by Terraform, such as their current state and any dependencies between them. When running Terraform commands, such as terraform plan or terraform apply, Terraform reads the state file to determine the current state of the resources and what changes need to be made to reach the desired state.","poster":"camps","timestamp":"1727707620.0","comment_id":"857219","upvote_count":"5"},{"comment_id":"792548","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722319860.0","poster":"vyhak","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the answer"},{"comment_id":"766664","poster":"asat_chil","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720179300.0","content":"Answer: D"},{"poster":"Bere","timestamp":"1718883240.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state\n\nTerraform must store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration.
