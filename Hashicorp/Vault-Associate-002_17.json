When Vault is configured as a cluster with multiple servers (nodes), it is generally required to perform the unsealing process on each of the nodes.\n\nThe main reason for this is to provide an additional layer of security and resilience. In a clustered environment, Vault divides and distributes the unsealing keys among the nodes. Therefore, each node in the cluster must be independently unsealed in order for the system as a whole to access the encrypted data.\n\nIn summary, in a HashiCorp Vault cluster, unsealing must generally be performed on all nodes to ensure proper access to encrypted secrets. This helps ensure availability and redundancy in case of failures on some nodes in the cluster"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nEach server needs to be individually unsealed.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"daz_rekka","comment_id":"1126255","timestamp":"1721334060.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-01-18 23:21:00","exam_id":170,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"Y75XofkIAOUOus6a6tfo","timestamp":"2024-01-22 20:53:00","question_id":82,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"C":"/secrets/kv","D":"/auth/token/accessors","B":"/auth/token/list","A":"/kv/secrets"},"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1141005","upvote_count":"1","content":"D\n\nAgree with dad_rekka","poster":"Mark1000","timestamp":"1722849120.0"},{"timestamp":"1721670780.0","poster":"daz_rekka","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD sort of, vault list auth/token/accessors will list all Token Accessors there is no way to list all tokens directly.","comment_id":"1128983"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"D","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/131822-exam-vault-associate-002-topic-1-question-83-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1705953180,"question_text":"Which endpoint can be used to list all tokens?","exam_id":170,"topic":"1"},{"id":"cbQ7zHMR7rrYykGEcxTV","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1705617000,"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-01-18 23:30:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/131583-exam-vault-associate-002-topic-1-question-84-discussion/","answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"Mark1000","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1722849240.0","content":"C\n\nOf course","comment_id":"1141008"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"daz_rekka","content":"Selected Answer: C\nPolicy is used do this association between Auth Method and permissions.","timestamp":"1721334600.0","comment_id":"1126261"}],"question_text":"The mechanism to associate an authentication method with access to specific secrets is by specifying a/an:","question_id":83,"choices":{"D":"Secret","B":"Token","A":"Accessor","C":"Policy"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":170},{"id":"gRYR397HNHmQoqQl28ng","timestamp":"2024-01-22 20:38:00","exam_id":170,"unix_timestamp":1705952280,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/vault-associate-002/image28.png"],"question_id":84,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/131821-exam-vault-associate-002-topic-1-question-85-discussion/","choices":{"B":"vault lease revoke v-token-dba_acccss-tr2t4x9pxvqlz8878s9s-1513446795","A":"vault delete azuresql/creds/dba_access","D":"vault lease revoke azuresql/creds/dba_access/2e5b1e0b-a081-c7el-5622-39f58e79a719","C":"vault delete azuresql/creds/dba_access/2e5b1e0b-a081-c7el-5622-39f58e79a7l9"},"answer":"D","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1241121","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nLease Id and revoke.
