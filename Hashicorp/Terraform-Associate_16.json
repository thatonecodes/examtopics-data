Submit a pull request and wait for an approved merge of the proposed changes.\n\nAs a member of an operations team that uses infrastructure as code (IaC) practices, the best practice for making a change to an infrastructure stack running in a public cloud is to submit a pull request (PR) and wait for an approved merge of the proposed changes. This approach follows the best practice of using version control for infrastructure code and collaborating through pull requests to review and approve changes. By following this process, changes to the infrastructure stack are tracked, reviewed, and approved in a controlled and auditable way.","poster":"camps","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1720579920.0","content":"Selected Answer: E\nFollowing IaC best practices, the recommended pattern for making a change to an infrastructure stack running in a public cloud would be to submit a pull request and wait for an approved merge of the proposed changes.\n\n\nThis approach allows you to use version control and review processes to ensure that changes to the infrastructure are carefully reviewed and tested before being applied. It also allows you to track changes over time and roll back any problematic changes if necessary.\n\n\nOption A (cloning the repository and running the code) is a good first step, but it does not address the need for review and approval of the changes. Option B (using the public cloud console) is generally not recommended, as it bypasses the version control and review processes that are central to IaC best practices. Options C (making the change programmatically via the public cloud CLI) and D (making the change via the public cloud API endpoint) are both more in line with IaC best practices, as they allow you to automate the process of making changes, but they still do not address the need for review and approval of the changes.","comment_id":"771063","poster":"fedeX"},{"comment_id":"760685","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: E\nWe should follow CI/CD best practices, the answer is E.","timestamp":"1719636300.0","poster":"InformationOverload"},{"poster":"dani88ge","timestamp":"1712862600.0","comment_id":"692353","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: E\nIt's E"},{"timestamp":"1709793480.0","poster":"depal_dhir","content":"Selected Answer: E\nThe best practice is PR (Pull Request)","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"661986"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"661156","poster":"keiffo2","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709731380.0","content":"So Answer E"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"keiffo2","comment_id":"661155","timestamp":"1709731380.0","content":"CI-CD best practices recommend pull requests i.e. merge the branch to main, in order to run a pipeline request - which kicks off a terraform deploy"}],"choices":{"B":"Use the public cloud console to make the change after a database record has been approved","A":"Clone the repository containing your infrastructure code and then run the code","C":"Make the change programmatically via the public cloud CLI","E":"Submit a pull request and wait for an approved merge of the proposed changes","D":"Make the change via the public cloud API endpoint"},"answer_images":[],"answer":"E","answers_community":["E (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/80593-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-169-discussion/","exam_id":169,"question_id":78,"question_text":"As a member of an operations team that uses infrastructure as code (IaC) practices, you are tasked with making a change to an infrastructure stack running in a public cloud.\nWhich pattern would follow IaC best practices for making a change?","unix_timestamp":1662463380,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-09-06 13:23:00","question_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"jeGcY9Gvvv9XuI5xa464","timestamp":"2022-09-09 15:41:00","answer_ET":"A","question_id":79,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"965504","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCode example:\n\nvariable \"input\" {\n description = \"An input variable\"\n default = \"Hello\"\n}\n\nlocals {\n local_value = \"${var.input}, World!\"\n}\n\noutput \"greeting\" {\n description = \"A greeting message\"\n value = local.local_value\n}\n\nOutputs:\n\ngreeting = \"Hello, World!\"","timestamp":"1690541400.0","upvote_count":"13","poster":"Bere"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nIf a module uses local values, those values can be exposed using the \"terraform output\" directive.
