The \"for_each\" block allows you to define reusable code that can be applied to multiple resources, similar to a loop in a programming language.

With four spaces\n\nWhen writing Terraform code that adheres to the Terraform style conventions, each nesting level should be indented four spaces compared to the level above it. This helps to visually distinguish between different levels of nesting and improves readability of the code.\n\nIn Terraform, a common use case for nested blocks is to define resources that depend on other resources. For example, you might have a resource that creates a network security group, and then another resource that creates a virtual machine that references the network security group. In this case, the virtual machine resource would be indented four spaces compared to the network security group resource.\n\nUsing four spaces for indentation is a widely accepted standard in the software development community, and it is recommended to use four spaces for indentation in Terraform code as well."},{"timestamp":"1687446000.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer D for sure","poster":"vadeemkaa","comment_id":"753506"}],"answers_community":["D (93%)","7%"],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/hashicorp/view/77340-exam-terraform-associate-topic-1-question-92-discussion/","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1657131780,"question_text":"If writing Terraform code that adheres to the Terraform style conventions, how would you properly indent each nesting level compared to the one above it?","timestamp":"2022-07-06 20:23:00","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"C":"With three spaces","B":"With a tab","A":"With four spaces","D":"With two spaces"},"isMC":true,"exam_id":169,"question_images":[],"question_id":340,"answer":"D","answer_description":""}],"exam":{"name":"Terraform Associate","numberOfQuestions":347,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"id":169,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Hashicorp"},"currentPage":68},"__N_SSP":true}
