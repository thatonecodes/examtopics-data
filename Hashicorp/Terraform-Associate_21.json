If a module has optional input variables, you can also provide values for those, but they will have default values if not specified.\n\nB) The module's source address:\nThe source address tells Terraform where to find the module's source code. For modules hosted on the Terraform Module Registry, the source address is usually in the format <NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>.\n\nThe version of the module is an optional attribute. If not specified, Terraform will use the most recent version of the module that is compatible with your Terraform version. However, it is a good practice to specify a version to ensure consistent behavior across different environments and Terraform runs.","timestamp":"1680263400.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"camps","comment_id":"857001"},{"timestamp":"1677570780.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer is A & B\nversion is not a required attribute, if you do not specify version it will get the latest version by default","comment_id":"824529","poster":"mamoon_malta2022"},{"comment_id":"791513","upvote_count":"1","content":"A.
