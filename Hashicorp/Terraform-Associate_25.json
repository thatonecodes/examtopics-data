Tainting a resource indicates that it has a problem and should be destroyed and recreated during the next terraform apply.

Implement a provisioning pipeline that deploys infrastructure configurations committed to your version control system following code reviews.\n\nTo solve this problem, you should consider implementing infrastructure as code (IaC) using a provisioning pipeline.

With IAC, you can define your infrastructure as code, commit it to version control, and then use a provisioning pipeline to automatically deploy and configure the infrastructure based on the code in version control. This ensures that every compute instance is deployed and configured consistently, eliminating the risk of manual configuration errors. Additionally, implementing a provisioning pipeline with code reviews can help catch any potential issues before they are deployed, further reducing the risk of outages during peak shopping time.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"805542"},{"content":"Thats Annoying... why do they provide wrong answers...","comment_id":"803641","upvote_count":"3","poster":"R248","timestamp":"1675973880.0"},{"poster":"wimarsha","content":"Why this system suggesting wrong answers for questions? any idea ?","timestamp":"1674967380.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"791393"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"D is the option","poster":"kartikjena31","timestamp":"1673935920.0","comment_id":"778620"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nROFL, how can A be the answer?
