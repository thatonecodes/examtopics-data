Tags are a great way to organize and categorize your resources based on different attributes like environment, department, or project. When you apply tags, you can filter and group resources in Azure Cost Management reports to get a clear picture of costs associated with specific tags.\nCoPilot:Yes, you can use budgets in Azure Cost Management to track and manage the costs of your Azure resources. Budgets help you monitor your spending by setting cost thresholds, so you get alerts when you're approaching or exceeding your budget limits. This keeps you on top of your cloud expenses and ensures you stay within your financial plans.\nI would go with \"Budgets\" since it is related to cost tracking as opposed to resource tracking.","timestamp":"1729876500.0","poster":"PN60","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1288011","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBudgets","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727073480.0","poster":"pb187"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1272275","content":"Selected Answer: C\nbudgets","timestamp":"1724614020.0","poster":"Nathan12345"},{"timestamp":"1723322880.0","comment_id":"1263623","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. budgets\n\nExplanation:\nAzure Budgets allow you to set limits on how much you want to spend on Azure resources and track your spending against that limit.\nTags can help organize and categorize resources, making it easier to analyze costs based on specific criteria, but they do not directly track costs.\nAzure Quickstart templates are used for deploying resources and do not track costs.\nUsage and quotas provide information on resource consumption but are not specifically designed for tracking costs.\nThus, for effective cost management, budgets are the primary tool used in Azure.","poster":"Raja96","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721969460.0","comment_id":"1255427","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect answer is budgets\nthere area a tool \"budgets alert\" to alert by tracking the costs.\n\nother options is not for \"track the costs\" but categorize, organize,","poster":"jambroba"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1720549980.0","poster":"68a524f","comment_id":"1245050","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBudgets, second paragraph last sentence \n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets"},{"timestamp":"1720466940.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1244534","poster":"Christian_garcia_martin","content":"i love how ppl says GPT gave them 4 differents answers, so before you go GPT 2 possible options were in your head after GPT are 4"},{"timestamp":"1716441300.0","poster":"MIA33","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTags: Tags are metadata elements you can apply to Azure resources.

You can use budgets to track costs and usage throughout a billing period and alert you when costs or usage exceed thresholds that you set. You can also use budgets to track spending trends over time and forecast future spending. On the other hand, you can use tags to categorize resources and resource groups to help you organize resources and manage costs.
