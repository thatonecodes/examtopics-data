The outbound firewall rule is, by default, allowed on all network profile types. 99% of the time, the problem is with the inbound rule, which is NOT allowed on any profiles by default. The only time the outbound rule changes behavior is when it's set to a block rule and enabled. \n\nSo for the answers, it will depend upon if (1) the firewall rules match the network type of the device and (2) whether there are any explicit deny output ICMPv4 request block rules. We aren't told of any block rules and, given the firewall rules, it would SEEM to be safe to assume that the Inbound rules match the network type. If we do that, since computer one only accepts ICMPv4 requests from its private network and computer 2 accepts them from its public network, computer 3 can be pinged from both of them. So the answer should be, \n\nFirst box: Computer 2 and Computer 3\nSecond Box: Computer 1 and Computer 3\n\nThe problem with the question is that we aren't given enough information to make a decent informative decision.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ChrisC21","timestamp":"1678405800.0","comment_id":"834512"},{"timestamp":"1638391980.0","comment_id":"491938","upvote_count":"2","poster":"rockhound","content":"Computer2 can ping only Computer3 because the ICMPv4 rule is Allow in ALL\nComputer1 has ICMPv4 for Private only"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"answer and explanation is really weird and wrong.","poster":"MR_Eliot","comment_id":"478175","comments":[{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"Paille","content":"I've seen quite some weird and wrong answers, but this one seems to be correct.\nComputer 1 and computer 2 are domain-joined, so the domain firewall profile applies on these computers.","comment_id":"504282","timestamp":"1639839960.0"}],"timestamp":"1636901640.0"}],"topic":"13","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/66022-exam-md-100-topic-13-question-2-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04292/0028600001.jpg"],"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nWhich Windows 10 computers can you ping successfully from Computer1 and Computer2?
