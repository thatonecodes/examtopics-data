A select forUpdate in a transaction forces reading from the database and replaces the record in the cache.\nAn example of FoundAndEmpty record caching is in the Discount table in the Microsoft Dynamics AX standard application. By default, the Discount table has no records. By using a FoundAndEmpty cache on this table, the keys that are queried for but not found are stored in the cache. Subsequent queries for these same non-existent records can be answered from the cache without a round trip to the database.\n\nBox 2: NotInTTS -\nAll successful caching key selects are cached.\nWhen in a transaction (after ttsBegin), no caches made outside the transaction are used. When inside a transaction, the record is read once from the database and subsequently from the cache. The record is select-locked when reading in a transaction, which ensures that the record cached is not updated while the transaction is active.\nA typical example of the NotInTTS property is on the CustTable in the Microsoft Dynamics AX application. It is acceptable to read outdated data from the cache outside a transaction, but when data is used for validation or creating references, it is ensured that the data is real-time.\n\nBox 3: EntireTable -\nCreates a set-based cache on the server. The entire table is cached as soon as at least one record is selected from the table. An EntireTable cahce is flushed whenever an insert, update or delete is made to the table. So first select read all records from DB for the selected company and all the further selects will take data from the cache instead of DB calls.\n\nBox 4: Found -\nAll successful caching key selects are cached. All caching key selects are returned from the cache if the record exists there. A select forUpdate in a transaction forces reading from the database and replaces the record in the cache.\nThis is typically used for static (lookup) tables, such as Unit, where the record usually exists.\nReference:\nhttp://gautamax.blogspot.com/2017/01/cache-lookup-property-of-table-in-ax.html","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"","isMC":false,"topic":"7"},{"id":"J5vNgbcd9ZYoJOULzgGV","discussion":[{"comment_id":"173254","poster":"sadoki9311","content":"Step 1 should be: Add the menu item for the form to the entry point node of a new privilege: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/developer/security-permissions-properties-for-a-form","upvote_count":"49","comments":[{"content":"correct","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"386874","timestamp":"1703150760.0","poster":"axdev1"},{"comment_id":"314694","timestamp":"1695107040.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"Yes step 1, 2 & 3 : first choice","poster":"tonrep"}],"timestamp":"1677926700.0"},{"content":"1 - 1 - 1 is correct","timestamp":"1744110540.0","poster":"DANNYEXAMMB500","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1558897"},{"timestamp":"1733668080.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"613256","content":"should be 1st option for all","poster":"Ihsan_khan"},{"comment_id":"569226","content":"Add the menu item for the form to the entry point node of a new privilege\nAdd the privilege to a new duty\nAdd the duty to the security role for sales managers","poster":"trize","timestamp":"1726501920.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"559352","upvote_count":"1","content":"You create form → Create menu item for this form → Add menu item to Entry points of privilege → Add privilege to duty (or directly to role - not best practice) → Add duty to Role, so 1-1-1 for this question.","poster":"Prollyx","timestamp":"1725268560.0"},{"comment_id":"506492","poster":"Viking2050","content":"1.
