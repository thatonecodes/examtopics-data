The company plans to implement Business Central as its new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\n\nThe company sells to two types of customers: wholesale and retail. Retail customers order at special events and online. Wholesale customers send in orders by email.\n\n\nCurrent Environment\n-\n\n\nOrder processing\n-\n\n• The company uses a purchase order (PO) workflow for any PO over $500.\n• The system has been fully configured for sales order prepayments and will check for a prepayment invoice at posting.\n• Customers can special order products with a prepayment that is due on receipt.\n\n\nInvoicing\n-\n\n• Wholesale customer payment terms are net 30, with a 2% discount if paid within 10 days.\n• Retail customer payment terms are payable on receipt or shipment.\n\n\nReporting\n-\n\n• The company uses headcount (number of employees) and square footage for statistical accounts.\n\n\nIntegrations\n-\n\nThe company currently uses Outlook, Excel, Word, and Teams to communicate internally and externally with customers and vendors.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nOrder processing\n-\n\n• The company must be able to combine multiple purchase receipts into one vendor invoice.\n• Posted vendor invoices must be reverted when damages are reported or a product is returned to the vendor.\n• Fully invoiced POs must not appear on the PO list page.\n• Customer prepayments vary based on customer relationship. Special orders from new customers have a 25% prepayment. Established customers have only a 15% prepayment.\n• The company must be able to approve POs by email without opening Business Central.\n• Customers often reorder the same items with similar quantities. The system must be configured to ask the user if recurring lines should be added to sales orders.\n\n\nInvoicing\n-\n\n• Customer revenue must be posted to separate general ledger (G/L) accounts based on customer type. The G/L account must have subcategories for wholesale and retail revenue.\n• Accounts receivable must be posted to separate G/L accounts based on customer type. The G/L account must have subcategories for wholesale and retail accounts receivable.\n• Currently, inventory is sold at a cost based on purchase and sales over a period.\n\n\nReporting\n-\n\n• Financial reports must include statistical accounts.\n• The financial report structure must map to account categories.\n\n\nIntegrations\n-\n\nThe company requires the following integration capabilities:\n\n• Create sales orders while collaborating with customers by email.\n• Edit customer information while messaging the sales team in a group chat.\n• Communicate a brochure to all customers at once about a sales campaign.\n\nGeneral ledger posting accounts\n\nThe company requires the following G/L posting accounts:\n\n• Retail Receivables = 13100\n• Wholesale Receivables = 13200\n• Payment Discount = 54800\n• Retail Sales = 44100\n• Wholesale Sales = 44200\n• Sales Prepayments = 22160\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n• Order entry takes too long for wholesale customers.\n• Vendors ship partial orders but send one monthly invoice. The company is unable to associate one invoice with multiple POs in the current environment.\n• Inventory reconciliation was difficult in the company's old system because it allowed users to sell more inventory than was physically available.\n• Users must log in to the system to provide workflow approvals.\n\n\nYou need to select the values for the customer payment terms.\n\nWhich values should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","question_id":126,"answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-800/image104.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/143298-exam-mb-800-topic-2-question-55-discussion/","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-800/image103.png"],"isMC":false,"topic":"2","answer_description":"","answer":"","exam_id":89,"timestamp":"2024-07-04 19:19:00","unix_timestamp":1720113540,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1720113540.0","poster":"70e8a4b","comment_id":"1242205","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct"}]},{"id":"kUXTAyFWoNSc6iBigIEL","timestamp":"2025-01-17 05:35:00","topic":"2","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/154770-exam-mb-800-topic-2-question-57-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1737088500.0","content":"Correct","poster":"python123","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1342005"}],"isMC":false,"question_id":127,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-800/image121.png"],"answers_community":[],"question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nYou are implementing Dynamics 365 Business Central for a company.
