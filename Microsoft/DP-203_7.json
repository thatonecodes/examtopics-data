Hash-Distributed on PurchaseKey\n\n💡 Explanation:\nAzure Synapse Analytics supports three table distribution methods: Replicated, Hash-Distributed, and Round-Robin. The best choice depends on the workload and query patterns.\n\n1️⃣ Why Use Hash Distribution?\nThe FactPurchase table will have 1 million rows added daily and contain three years of data → This results in over 1 billion rows, making hash distribution the best option for efficient querying.\nQueries GROUP BY SupplierKey, StockItemKey, and IsOrderFinalized → A hash-distributed table will ensure these columns are evenly distributed across compute nodes, reducing data movement and improving query performance.\n2️⃣ Why Hash on PurchaseKey?\nPurchaseKey is the primary key (unique for each purchase).\nIdeal for distributing data evenly across compute nodes, avoiding data skew.\nImproves aggregation queries where GROUP BY is used on multiple dimensions."},{"poster":"RAG11","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD, Since the query doesn't reference PurchaseKey for filtering or grouping, hash distribution on PurchaseKey doesn't help with optimizing the query and would not be the best choice.","timestamp":"1740008700.0","comment_id":"1359006"},{"poster":"thanglai","content":"Hash-Distributed: For large fact tables where joins or aggregations are common","timestamp":"1736132460.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1336942"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect Answer: B","comment_id":"1318451","timestamp":"1732686780.0","poster":"EmnCours","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1720255980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOptimal Distribution\nGiven that the query performs a GROUP BY on SupplierKey, StockItemKey, and IsOrderFinalized, the most balanced approach is to use Round-robin distribution.

The fact that the PurchaseKey is not used in the query also made me think this for a sec. So even when using the hash the situation becomes like a round-robin distribution in terms of data access in this specific query. But generally hash will be more efficient because of the predictable hash distribution structure, which is better than a completely random approach.
