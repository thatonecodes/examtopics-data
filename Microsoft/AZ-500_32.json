Managed identity\n2. db_datareader and db_datawriter\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview\nA common challenge for developers is the management of secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys used to secure communication between services. Managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage these credentials.\n\nWhile developers can securely store the secrets in Azure Key Vault, services need a way to access Azure Key Vault. Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.","poster":"zellck","comments":[{"comment_id":"890572","timestamp":"1683359700.0","poster":"zellck","upvote_count":"5","content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles?view=sql-server-ver16#fixed-database-roles\n- db_datawriter\nMembers of the db_datawriter fixed database role can add, delete, or change data in all user tables.

However, when granting read and write access to a SQL database, it is generally safer to use Managed Identities when the application is running on a virtual machine or an Azure service. Managed Identities are an easier and more secure way to grant access to Azure resources because they don't require you to manually manage secrets or credentials.\n\nService Principals are typically used when you need to grant access to external applications or services that are not hosted in Azure. When it comes to internal Azure applications and services, Managed Identities are a more direct and secure option. Therefore, using a Managed Identity would be the most appropriate option to meet the criteria of not storing passwords, using the principle of least privilege, and minimizing administrative effort in the context of internal Azure resources.","upvote_count":"11","timestamp":"1699298520.0"},{"comment_id":"1558394","poster":"Sabr_","timestamp":"1743973560.0","content":"Exam question 6th April 2025","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1721195460.0","poster":"xRiot007","upvote_count":"3","content":"FYI, managed identity is a type of service principal used when we don't want to pass credentials around, so question 1 is MI.","comment_id":"1249401"}],"timestamp":"1718722440.0","poster":"subrat10","content":"The answer of question 1 should be \"Service principal\" as the question explicitly says Minimize administrative effort.","comment_id":"1232479","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"On exam 1/2/24","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"1114907","timestamp":"1704509280.0","poster":"brooklyn510"},{"upvote_count":"8","poster":"Troublemaker","content":"In Exam - 28/7/2023","comment_id":"961704","timestamp":"1690208580.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Johnvic","timestamp":"1682121060.0","content":"Exam.6 case studies. 3 true/false questions. 47 multiple questions and no simulations.
