Azure Instance Metadata (IMDS) endpoint\n\nManaged identity: This type of service principal represents a managed identity, which eliminates the need to manage credentials. Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. When a managed identity is enabled, the service principal that represents that managed identity is created in your tenant. \nCommon terms for managed identities and service principals: \n\nClient ID: The unique ID that's linked to the app and service principal created when you provisioned the identity. \n\nObject ID: The service principal object of the managed identity. \n\nAzure Instance Metadata Service: The REST API that's enabled when Azure Resource Manager creates a VM. The endpoint is accessible only from within the VM.","timestamp":"1714348800.0","comment_id":"1203736"},{"timestamp":"1711848180.0","comment_id":"1186510","content":"Final Answer:\n1.
