Converting file systems usually requires reformatting the disk, which would result in data loss. However, you can copy the data from the exFAT disk to another location, reformat the disk as ReFS, and then copy the data back.","poster":"NazerRazer","comment_id":"1056961","timestamp":"1730218860.0"}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-800/image257.png"],"question_text":"You have a server named Server1 that runs Windows Server.
