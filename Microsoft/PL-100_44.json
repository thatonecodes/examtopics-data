Charts on an interactive dashboard serve as a simple filtering source. You can select different data points on a chart to filter data based on the filter criteria.\nInteractive dashboards come in two forms: multi-stream and single-stream. In addition, multi-stream dashboards can be home page or table-specific dashboards.\nThe multi-stream dashboards display data in real time over multiple data streams.\nThe single-stream dashboards display real-time data over one stream based on a table view.\n\nNote: Timeframe Filter -\nThe Timeframe filter refers to the ability to filter based on period of time in the upper right of the dashboard, as shown below:\nFilter columns must be configured to appear in the global filter and allow for sorting in the interactive dashboard experience.\n\nBox 2: standard -\nThe filters in a Power Apps view define the records that a user will be able to see when selecting the view for the current table. You can add or edit a filter for the columns that you include in a view by selecting the column and selecting Filter by. You can also use the expression builder in the view designer. Use the expression builder to add or edit filters for any columns of the table in the current view or any columns in a related table.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/user/interactive-dashboards https://www.c5insight.com/Resources/Blog/tabid/148/entryid/1948/feature-review-dynamics-365-interactive-dashboards.aspx https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-view-filters","answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04323/0022800001.jpg"],"topic":"3","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04323/0022900001.jpg"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1702471860.0","poster":"MeHungarian","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1095460","content":"Interactive\nStandard"},{"timestamp":"1673120940.0","comment_id":"768882","poster":"W2S3","upvote_count":"2","content":"Correct!"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Interactive\nStandard","timestamp":"1668178260.0","comment_id":"716145","poster":"AnitaR"}],"answer":"","question_id":218,"exam_id":114,"answer_ET":"","isMC":false,"unix_timestamp":1668178260,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou are designing a dashboard for a model-driven app. Users are licensed to use Dynamics 365 Sales Professional.\nUsers must be able to filter the dashboard.\nYou need to determine how to apply the filters.\nWhich type of dashboard should you use?
