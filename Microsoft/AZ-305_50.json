Azure Cache for Redis\n\nExplanation:\n\nAzure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on open-source software Redis. It can be used to cache the most frequently accessed data, thus significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput for the application data requests. By storing data that's accessed often in a cache, you can improve app performance by reducing the load on your main database and make the app more responsive even during high traffic.\n\nAzure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is more for delivering static content to users, and not designed for database queries.","timestamp":"1688486400.0","comment_id":"942967","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","upvote_count":"7"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1731515100.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","comment_id":"1311451"},{"timestamp":"1713844380.0","poster":"Lazylinux","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGiven Answer A is correct \nDistributed, in-memory, scalable solution providing super-fast data access.

DS.\n\nExplanation: The DS series Azure Virtual Machines are designed for applications that require high storage performance and are ideal for SQL Server instances. The DSv3 and Dsv4-series, for instance, support Azure's premium SSDs and offer good I/O throughput, making them suitable for SQL Server workloads.
