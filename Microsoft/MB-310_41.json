Defining a budget model and setting an active forecasting process to the current year forecast allows for the tracking of expenses over budget and revenue under budget. By defining a budget model, you establish the structure and parameters for budgeting and forecasting. Setting an active forecasting process to the current year ensures that the system is constantly updating and reflecting the most recent financial data, enabling near real-time reporting on budget versus actual expenses and revenues.
