It collects telemetry and provides visibility into SAP-specific metrics, enabling you to diagnose issues and maintain optimal performance.\n\nHowever, it is not primarily focused on analyzing the sizing of virtual machines to optimize resource utilization. For this task, Azure Advisor is a more suitable choice, as it provides specific recommendations for resizing virtual machines based on usage patterns, aiming to maximize efficiency while minimizing administrative effort.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"1cf90ef"},{"poster":"stevethai","timestamp":"1718138100.0","content":"correct C","comment_id":"1228649","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1718138100,"exam_id":45,"answer_description":"","question_id":222,"timestamp":"2024-06-11 22:35:00","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Azure Monitor for SAP solutions","B":"SAP Quick Sizer","A":"Azure Advisor","D":"VM insights"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/142358-exam-az-120-topic-5-question-38-discussion/"},{"id":"8aZvB1nCdevzXjMepe0x","exam_id":45,"unix_timestamp":1592909940,"answers_community":[],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03992/0013800001.jpg"],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03992/0013700001.jpg"],"answer":"","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/23815-exam-az-120-topic-5-question-4-discussion/","answer_ET":"","question_id":223,"timestamp":"2020-06-23 12:59:00","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou have an on-premises SAP environment.
