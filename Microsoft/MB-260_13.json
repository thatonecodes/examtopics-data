Overview -\n\nBlue Yonder Airlines created a new division named BY Excursions (BYE). BYE operates site-seeing tours and other excursions in vacation destinations across North America.\n\nBYE is the product of the acquisition of three regional tour and excursion companies.\n\n• Each of these regional operations have updated their branding.\n• The three operations continue to maintain separate CRM systems for sales and customer service in their respective territories (East West and Central).\n• Each regional operator offers different types of tours and excursions. For example, the East region currently offers boat tours, but the Central region does not\n\nGeneral information. Technology footprint\n\nBYE uses a single instance of Dynamics 365 Marketing for marketing automation, and it recently implemented Dynamics 365 Customer Insights as its CDP. Dynamics 365 Marketing and Customer Insights are not currently connected.\n\nA corporate data lake is built on Azure Data Lake Gen 2. This data lake has two containers named “imports” and “exports.” The BYE data science team uses Azure Machine Learning Studio to build predictive models.\n\n\nCRM data extracts. Overview -\n\nAn Azure Data Factory pipeline produces flat-file extracts of all customers, events, and survey response data from every regional CRM system, and copies them to the corporate data lake imports container daily. These extracts are produced in pipe-delimited text format and each type of extract file has the same schema. The pipeline runs at 1 a.m. US Eastern Standard Time (UTC -5). Each regional system extract has the same format.\n\n\nCRM data extracts. Customers -\n\nCustomer data is represented as records in the Customer extract file. This file contains customer address and contact information. Because customers can make purchases in more than one region, the same customer may be represented in multiple regional extract files. Regional extracts may also contain multiple records corresponding to the same individual customer.\n\nEach record in a single regional extract will have a unique customer number value. The customer number value is not guaranteed to be unique across all regional extracts. Each customer file contains fewer than 50,000 records.\n\nCRM data extracts. Event tickets\n\nCustomer event ticket purchases are represented as records in the event tickets extract file. This file contains a unique ID value for every ticket purchase along with details such as event type, event date, purchase date and ticket cost.\n\nCRM data extracts. Survey responses\n\nEach customer is also sent a customer satisfaction survey after the conclusion of every event. The survey includes numeric rating of 1-5 (1 being least satisfied and 5 being most satisfied) and a free-text response field for the customers to share their impressions of the event.\n\nThe schema for the three files in each extract is shown below:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Data sources\n\nYour team is responsible for the configuration of Customer Insights. You are an Administrator in the environment.\n\nYour team has configured a separate data source corresponding to the customer file extracts from each regional operation. Each data source uses a Microsoft Power Query text file connector to ingest the extract files. The Microsoft Enhanced Addresses enrichment has been enabled for each regional data source. The enrichment name for each region is the region name (East, West or Central) followed by \"addresses.\"\n\nYour team has also configured a fourth data source using Power Query to create consolidated files containing all event tickets and survey response records. These two new files have the same layout as the regional files. Customer email addresses are included in these files because customer numbers are not unique across regions.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Customer profiles\n\nYour team has defined a Unified Customer Profile based on the three different customer extract files. The East and West regional customer extracts have deduplication rules configured with the default merge preferences and the following criteria:\n\n1. Exact matches on LastName, HomeAddress, City and PostalCode.\n2. Exact matches on FirstName, LastName, EmailAddress and normalized PhoneNumber.\n\nThe Central regional customer extract does not have any deduplication rules configured.\n\nYour team has configured matching to start with the East region customer extract as the primary entity, then the Central region, then the West region. Each regional entity is configured to include all records, and subsequent entities match the previous entity using the following conditions:\n\n1. Exact matches on LastName and normalized PhoneNumber.\n2. Exact matches on normalized PhoneNumber, EmailAddress and Country.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Activities\n\nYour team has added activities based on the event ticket and survey response extracts. Survey responses have been semantically mapped to the Feedback activity type, and event tickets have been semantically mapped to the SalesOrder activity type.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Measures and segments\n\nYour team has not created any measures or segments.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Data exports\n\nYour team has configured an export of the ConflationMatchPairs entity and attached it to a connection to the corporate data lake “exports” container.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Enrichments\n\nIn addition to the Enhanced Addresses enrichment mentioned previously, your team has configured a custom import enrichment that reads a file from a third-party vendor’s SFTP server.\n\n\nOutbound email campaigns -\n\nBYE uses Dynamics 365 Marketing's outbound marketing campaigns to send two types of commercial emails:\n\n1. Post-purchase follow-up email - This email is sent the day after a customer purchases an event ticket. It contains generic information about upcoming events for the region. BYE leadership wants to replace the generic content with a personalized set of recommended event types the customer might want to consider. There are no restrictions on the types of events that can be recommended.\n2. Post-event email - This email is sent the day after an event concludes, and it includes a link to the customer survey.\n\n\nData issues -\n\n1. A significant number of BYE customers are duplicated in the regional file extracts. Manual review of a random sampling of duplicates returned the following findings: a. Duplicate records frequently have different values for street address such as inconsistencies in spelling and abbreviations for common words like “street,” “avenue,” “drive,” etc. b. Duplicate records typically share the same values for last name, email address, city, state or province, postal code, and country. c. Duplicate records typically do not share the same values for first name.\n2. An automated process in the East regional CRM system recently updated the state or province component of several thousand customers’ addresses with incorrect values. All other components of these customers’ addresses are still presumed correct.\n3. An automated process in the Central regional CRM system recently deleted the first name values for several hundred customers.\n\n\nPredictive models -\n\nThe data science team has built inference pipelines in three different workspaces.\n\nYour user account has the following access:\n\n• Owner access to BYAEAML01\n• Reader access to BYAEAML02\n• User Access Administrator access to BYAEAML03\n\nThe table below shows the published pipelines in each workspace.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nFuture enhancements -\n\nThe marketing team requests your team plan for two updates to BYE’s Customer Insights instance:\n\n1. Stop using the Enhanced Addresses enrichment and start using the Azure Maps enrichment.\n2. Start sending an export of customer data to the same data broker that currently provides the custom enrichment. This would use the same SFTP server as the existing enrichment.\n\n\nYou need to configure the out-of-the-box sentiment analysis model to run on survey response data.\n\nWhich two fields contain data that must be mapped to model input parameters?
