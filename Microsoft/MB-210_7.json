The company uses First Up Consultants, an external sales company, to manage opportunities in areas where they do not have salespeople. The First Up Consultants personnel do not have Dynamics 365 Sales licenses. The internal sales team generates about 500 tradeshow leads per month.\n\nContoso, Ltd. uses Dynamics 365 Sales with no additional features enabled. The company currently uses only custom forms and the Sales Hub app.\n\nThe company recently hired a sales manager. The sales manager plans to improve processes and must keep costs as low as possible. A hands-off approach means the sales manager will view information in Dynamics 365 Sales but will not add entries. The sales manager identified the following areas that require major improvement:\n\n• Leads process\n• Opportunity process\n• Marketing process\n• General company collaboration and communication\n\n\nLead Process -\n\n• Leads created at the head office must be automatically distributed to salespeople in a cyclical order. Tradeshow leads are created by salespeople and do not need to be redistributed.\n• Lead assignments are often delayed because other tasks become a priority.\n• To help prioritize tasks, the salespeople require the Up Next widget for the Lead form.\n• The salespeople require a task that reminds them to call the lead one week after the tradeshow.\n• The salespeople are excellent at meeting leads at tradeshows. One day after the tradeshow, they manually send a follow up email, but that is often where the communication stops.\n• Salespeople often forget to track customer emails to their leads when they are in Microsoft Outlook.\n\n\nOpportunity Process -\n\n• The contracts team must review all contracts uploaded in Dynamics 365 Sales for opportunities, but they do not have access to Dynamics 365 Sales.\n• Opportunities are often transferred to different child or parent accounts, so contracts should not be filed by account.\n• First Up Consultants must track the progress of the opportunity in Dynamics 365 Sales.\n\n\nMarketing Process -\n\n• Pop-up sale\no A sales administrator must offer a one-time pop-up sale to local customers to remove damaged appliances from inventory. o Pop-up sale emails must only go to a manually selected group of contacts. No reporting is required. Minimal set up is required.\n• Tradeshow\no The sales administrator must send marketing materials to specific leads collected from the tradeshow when the tradeshow ends. The sales administrator must manually select the leads from all the leads collected.\n• Flyers\no The sales administrator must send a quarterly sales flyer to leads in the local area. These leads are collected from the website. The leads must be automatically added or removed throughout the quarter.\n\n\nGeneral Issues -\n\n• Salespeople often travel to visit customers. Currently, the salespeople connect to Dynamics 365 Sales through a browser on their phones. The Dynamics 365 Sales forms are often small and difficult to use.\n• The salespeople require availability of the following features on their phone: o Receive an alert that notifies them of a new lead assignment even when they are not using Dynamics 365 Sales. o View all meetings and appointments from Outlook and Dynamics 365 Sales in one view. o Generate a SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) quote for a customer.\n• Salespeople require emails to appear on Dynamics 365 Sales records so they can associate the email to the record without needing to navigate to another app.\n• A new salesperson can open records but cannot access the app. The salesperson has been granted the same app access as all other salespeople.\n\n\nYou need to recommend to the sales manager which license to use for salespeople who work on tradeshow leads.\n\nWhat should you recommend?","question_id":31,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/135294-exam-mb-210-topic-1-question-126-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-03-06 10:56:00"},{"id":"uJ9aC4QYOfKP1MTm7JlH","topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-12-29 01:33:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1108214","poster":"itc7","timestamp":"1719613980.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
