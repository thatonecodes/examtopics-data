Cloud App Security anomaly detection policies\nD. the Cloud Discovery settings in Cloud App Security\n\n\nTo restrict cloud apps running on CLIENT1, you need to modify Cloud App Security anomaly detection policies and the Cloud Discovery settings in Cloud App Security. Cloud App Security allows you to create policies that can be used to identify and restrict cloud apps that are not sanctioned by your organization. You can also use Cloud Discovery to identify cloud apps that are being used in your organization and take action to restrict or block them. By configuring these settings, you can ensure that only sanctioned cloud apps are used on CLIENT1, meeting the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint requirements. Option A and C are not relevant to this scenario.","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"839866","timestamp":"1710505320.0"},{"content":"Answer B & D","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"612977","comments":[{"upvote_count":"23","content":"Nope - the given answers are correct.
