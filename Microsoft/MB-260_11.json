They operate in the cities (and surrounding metropolitan areas) of Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Houston, and Seattle.\n\nThese grooming services are offered as packages at multiple price points, such as \"basic bath\" for $50 and \"premium bath with nail trim\" for $75.\n\nContoso also sells branded merchandise (hats, shirts, etc.) and dog accessories (toys, leashes, collars, etc.) through its own eCommerce website.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Customer Service\n\nContoso maintains a single contact center from which its customer service agents book appointments and handle customer complaints for each geographic market Contoso serves.\n\nCustomer service agents use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service to document inbound customer booking inquiries and complaints that are received via phone call, text message and web chat.\n\nCustomer service agents schedule grooming appointments using a third-party, web-based scheduling application.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Marketing\n\nThe marketing team manages an informational website and is responsible for running campaigns through web advertising platforms and social media channels. The marketing team also produces a weekly email newsletter that contains educational content relevant to dog owners as well as promotions for Contoso’s services and products.\n\nContoso uses a third-party marketing automation platform to send email and SMS messages to customers. These communications currently include:\n\n1. All unique email addresses from the booking system, ecommerce system and Dynamics 365 Customer Service receive the weekly email newsletter described above. The same customer will receive multiple emails if the customer is associated with different email addresses in different systems.\n2. Customers receive SMS reminders the day before a scheduled grooming appointment.\n3. Each customer who purchases grooming services is sent an email with a link to a satisfaction survey on the first Tuesday following the grooming appointment. The survey link is the same for all customers, and the survey requires customers to enter their names, phone numbers and (optionally) email addresses as part of the submission.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Challenges\n\nCurrently, the customer service team does not have any way to relate survey responses back to individual customer records in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service.\n\nThe marketing team cannot access customer feedback data collected by the customer service team. Both the customer service team and marketing team cannot access any data from the ecommerce system.\n\n\nBusiness Objectives -\n\nContoso business leadership identifies three major objectives to address by the end of the current fiscal year:\n\n1. Improve customer retention - Current customer attrition rates exceed 40 percent each month.\n2. Maximize customer value for services - The leadership team believes customer service agents should be upselling more customers on premium grooming packages. The leadership team is also considering partnering with other organizations to offer related services like dog training and dog walking to its existing customers.\n3. Maximize customer value for merchandise and accessory sales - Fewer than five percent of grooming customers have ever made a purchase from the ecommerce site. The leadership team believes there are significant opportunities for new revenue by increasing ecommerce sales.\n\n\nProject Overview. Overview -\n\nThe customer service and marketing leaders believes a Microsoft Customer Data Platform will help achieve Contoso’s business objectives.\n\nThe information technology (IT) team starts a pilot implementation of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.\n\n\nProject Overview. Pilot Project -\n\nThe pilot implementation will use the following sources of data from Contoso's operational systems:\n\n• Bookings - Customer demographic data and completed grooming appointments\n• Web purchases - Customer demographic data and ecommerce purchases totals summarized by customer, type (branded merchandise or accessories) and date\n• Survey responses - Respondent demographic data and response data\n• Customer interactions - Customer demographic data, interaction history (phone calls, emails, web chat), customer feedback, and inquiries\n\nThere is no common customer key across the different data sources, and none of the customer tables store customer keys from the other sources. Every table in a specific data source can be associated back to a customer record from the same data source using the corresponding customer's primary key.\n\nWhen managing system refreshes, Contoso requires data refreshes to begin within one hour of the scheduled arrival time for flat-file sources.\n\nNo Microsoft Azure storage services have been provisioned in support of the project, but the Customer Data Platform specialist may request the provisioning of any Azure services necessary to achieve the stated business objectives.\n\nThe goal of the pilot project is to demonstrate that Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights will provide marketing and customer service users with relevant data and insights. These data and insights will allow users to reduce churn, increase services revenue, and increase eCommerce spend.\n\n\nData Sources. Bookings -\n\nThis data source consists of two Parquet files that are uploaded to a secure file transport protocol (SFTP) site at noon (12 PM) and midnight (12 AM) every day.\n\n1. Customers.parquet - customer id (primary key), name, customer physical address, city, state, postal code, phone number, residence type (“house”, “apartment”, etc.), email address\n2. Appointments.parquet - appointment id (primary key), customer id, dog name, dog breed, appointment datetime, appointment price, grooming package name (“basic bath”, “premium bath”, etc.)\n\n\nData Sources. Web Purchases -\n\nThis data source consists of two CSV files that are programmatically uploaded to a SFTP site at midnight every day.\n\n1. WebCustomers.csv - customer id (primary key), name, customer address, city, state, postal code, phone number, email address\n2. TransactionTotals.csv - transaction id (primary key), customer id, merchandise total price, accessories total price, transaction datetime\n\n\nData Sources. Survey Responses -\n\nThis data source consists of two JSON files that are programmatically uploaded to a Microsoft SharePoint folder container at 6 PM every Friday.\n\n1. Respondents.json - customer id (primary key), name, phone number, email address\n2. Responses.json - response id (primary key), customer id, satisfaction score (1-5), comments, response date\n\nNote: The satisfaction survey asks for a single satisfaction score on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 meaning extremely dissatisfied and 5 meaning extremely satisfied. Respondents may optionally include comments.\n\nData Sources. Customer Interactions\n\nThis data source consists of a connection to data from the Contoso Dynamics 365 Customer Service application through a Microsoft Dataverse managed data lake. The relevant tables are all system tables.\n\n1. Contacts - all system attributes are available\n2. Activities - all system attributes are available\n3. Cases (Incidents) - all system attributes are available\n\nNote: Customer inquiries and feedback are stored as case (incident) records in the customer service application. Inquiries are tracked using the standard “question” case type value, and feedback are tracked using the standard “problem” case type value.\n\n\nYou configured a merge of Contoso's data sources using automatic matching based on semantic types.

Overview\n-\n\nBlue Yonder Airlines created a new division named BY Excursions (BYE). BYE operates site-seeing tours and other excursions in vacation destinations across North America.\n\nBYE is the product of the acquisition of three regional tour and excursion companies.\n\n• Each of these regional operations have updated their branding.\n• The three operations continue to maintain separate CRM systems for sales and customer service in their respective territories (East West and Central).\n• Each regional operator offers different types of tours and excursions. For example, the East region currently offers boat tours, but the Central region does not\n\nGeneral information. Technology footprint\n\nBYE uses a single instance of Dynamics 365 Marketing for marketing automation, and it recently implemented Dynamics 365 Customer Insights as its CDP. Dynamics 365 Marketing and Customer Insights are not currently connected.\n\nA corporate data lake is built on Azure Data Lake Gen 2. This data lake has two containers named “imports” and “exports.” The BYE data science team uses Azure Machine Learning Studio to build predictive models.\n\n\nCRM data extracts. Overview\n-\n\nAn Azure Data Factory pipeline produces flat-file extracts of all customers, events, and survey response data from every regional CRM system, and copies them to the corporate data lake imports container daily. These extracts are produced in pipe-delimited text format and each type of extract file has the same schema. The pipeline runs at 1 a.m. US Eastern Standard Time (UTC -5). Each regional system extract has the same format.\n\n\nCRM data extracts. Customers\n-\n\nCustomer data is represented as records in the Customer extract file. This file contains customer address and contact information. Because customers can make purchases in more than one region, the same customer may be represented in multiple regional extract files. Regional extracts may also contain multiple records corresponding to the same individual customer.\n\nEach record in a single regional extract will have a unique customer number value. The customer number value is not guaranteed to be unique across all regional extracts. Each customer file contains fewer than 50,000 records.\n\nCRM data extracts. Event tickets\n\nCustomer event ticket purchases are represented as records in the event tickets extract file. This file contains a unique ID value for every ticket purchase along with details such as event type, event date, purchase date and ticket cost.\n\nCRM data extracts. Survey responses\n\nEach customer is also sent a customer satisfaction survey after the conclusion of every event. The survey includes numeric rating of 1-5 (1 being least satisfied and 5 being most satisfied) and a free-text response field for the customers to share their impressions of the event.\n\nThe schema for the three files in each extract is shown below:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Data sources\n\nYour team is responsible for the configuration of Customer Insights. You are an Administrator in the environment.\n\nYour team has configured a separate data source corresponding to the customer file extracts from each regional operation. Each data source uses a Microsoft Power Query text file connector to ingest the extract files. The Microsoft Enhanced Addresses enrichment has been enabled for each regional data source. The enrichment name for each region is the region name (East, West or Central) followed by \"addresses.\"\n\nYour team has also configured a fourth data source using Power Query to create consolidated files containing all event tickets and survey response records. These two new files have the same layout as the regional files. Customer email addresses are included in these files because customer numbers are not unique across regions.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Customer profiles\n\nYour team has defined a Unified Customer Profile based on the three different customer extract files. The East and West regional customer extracts have deduplication rules configured with the default merge preferences and the following criteria:\n\n1. Exact matches on LastName, HomeAddress, City and PostalCode.\n2. Exact matches on FirstName, LastName, EmailAddress and normalized PhoneNumber.\n\nThe Central regional customer extract does not have any deduplication rules configured.\n\nYour team has configured matching to start with the East region customer extract as the primary entity, then the Central region, then the West region. Each regional entity is configured to include all records, and subsequent entities match the previous entity using the following conditions:\n\n1. Exact matches on LastName and normalized PhoneNumber.\n2. Exact matches on normalized PhoneNumber, EmailAddress and Country.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Activities\n\nYour team has added activities based on the event ticket and survey response extracts. Survey responses have been semantically mapped to the Feedback activity type, and event tickets have been semantically mapped to the SalesOrder activity type.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Measures and segments\n\nYour team has not created any measures or segments.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Data exports\n\nYour team has configured an export of the ConflationMatchPairs entity and attached it to a connection to the corporate data lake “exports” container.\n\nCustomer Insights configuration. Enrichments\n\nIn addition to the Enhanced Addresses enrichment mentioned previously, your team has configured a custom import enrichment that reads a file from a third-party vendor’s SFTP server.\n\n\nOutbound email campaigns\n-\n\nBYE uses Dynamics 365 Marketing's outbound marketing campaigns to send two types of commercial emails:\n\n1. Post-purchase follow-up email - This email is sent the day after a customer purchases an event ticket. It contains generic information about upcoming events for the region. BYE leadership wants to replace the generic content with a personalized set of recommended event types the customer might want to consider. There are no restrictions on the types of events that can be recommended.\n2. Post-event email - This email is sent the day after an event concludes, and it includes a link to the customer survey.\n\n\nData issues\n-\n\n1. A significant number of BYE customers are duplicated in the regional file extracts. Manual review of a random sampling of duplicates returned the following findings:\na. Duplicate records frequently have different values for street address such as inconsistencies in spelling and abbreviations for common words like “street,” “avenue,” “drive,” etc.\nb. Duplicate records typically share the same values for last name, email address, city, state or province, postal code, and country.\nc. Duplicate records typically do not share the same values for first name.\n2. An automated process in the East regional CRM system recently updated the state or province component of several thousand customers’ addresses with incorrect values. All other components of these customers’ addresses are still presumed correct.\n3. An automated process in the Central regional CRM system recently deleted the first name values for several hundred customers.\n\n\nPredictive models\n-\n\nThe data science team has built inference pipelines in three different workspaces.\n\nYour user account has the following access:\n\n• Owner access to BYAEAML01\n• Reader access to BYAEAML02\n• User Access Administrator access to BYAEAML03\n\nThe table below shows the published pipelines in each workspace.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nFuture enhancements\n-\n\nThe marketing team requests your team plan for two updates to BYE’s Customer Insights instance:\n\n1. Stop using the Enhanced Addresses enrichment and start using the Azure Maps enrichment.\n2. Start sending an export of customer data to the same data broker that currently provides the custom enrichment. This would use the same SFTP server as the existing enrichment.\n\n\nYour manager asks you to delete all custom deduplication rules and create new ones for each regional data source.\n\nCustomer records are considered duplicates if they contain:\n\n1. Close match on first name,\n2. Same last name,\n3. Same street address, and\n4. Same postal code\n\nYou need to complete the configuration of the deduplication matching conditions.\n\nWhich attribute name corresponds to each empty parameter? To answer, drag the appropriate attribute name to the correct empty parameters in the answer area. Each attribute name or attribute value may be used once, more than once, or not at all.\n\nNOTE: Each correct match is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","timestamp":"2024-04-22 09:38:00","answer":"","question_id":53,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-260/image33.png"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-260/image24.png","https://img.examtopics.com/mb-260/image25.png","https://img.examtopics.com/mb-260/image32.png"],"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"","exam_id":79,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/139348-exam-mb-260-topic-3-question-41-discussion/","isMC":false,"unix_timestamp":1713771480,"topic":"3","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1304941","timestamp":"1730284260.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ana20","content":"Correct answer:\nfirstname\nlastname\neastaddresses_Street1\neastaddresses_ZipOrPostalCode"}]},{"id":"edmrBjbUibnwcroUSLq6","question_id":54,"question_images":[],"topic":"3","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
