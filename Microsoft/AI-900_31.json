Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It involves the ability of a computer program to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.\n\nKnowledge mining is a process that involves extracting useful information from unstructured data sources such as text documents, images, and videos1. Computer vision refers to the field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos1. Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify patterns or data points that deviate significantly from the normal behavior or expected values1.","comment_id":"1018560","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1711610640.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/121534-exam-ai-900-topic-1-question-238-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"id":41,"numberOfQuestions":246,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Microsoft","isImplemented":true,"name":"AI-900","isBeta":false},"currentPage":31},"__N_SSP":true}
