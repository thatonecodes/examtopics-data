This policy is critical to making sure that your certificates stored in key vault are being monitored. It is recommended that you apply this policy multiple times with different expiration thresholds, for example, at 180, 90, 60, and 30-day thresholds. This policy can be used to monitor and triage certificate expiration in your organization.","comment_id":"778860","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Ajdlfasudfo0","timestamp":"1721209920.0"}],"question_id":246,"topic":"3","choices":{"C":"Azure Blueprints","A":"Azure Purview","B":"Key Vault properties","D":"Azure Policy"},"isMC":true,"question_text":"You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure key vault.\n\nYou need to configure the maximum number of days for which new keys are valid.
