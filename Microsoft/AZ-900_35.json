The Owner role is a built-in role in Azure that provides full access to all resources in a resource group, including the ability to create, modify, and delete resources. \n\nWhen you assign the Owner role to a user or group, it grants them full access to all resources within the resource group. Multiple users or groups can be assigned the Owner role for a resource group, which allows for collaboration and delegation of responsibilities among different teams or individuals.\n\nIt's important to note that assigning the Owner role to multiple users or groups can increase the risk of accidental or intentional changes to resources within the resource group.
