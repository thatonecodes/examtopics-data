Additionally, they separate into morning and afternoon time groups of 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00PM to 5:00 PM, with a one-hour lunch in between. Therefore, both intervals and time groups are useful for this business.\nReset Interval per Time Group Detail = No, the appointments would be: 8:00 AM, 9:30 AM, 11:00 AM (not 12:30 PM because this is blocked for lunch), 2:00 PM, and 3:30 PM.\nReset Interval per Time Group Detail = Yes, the appointments would be: 8:00 AM, 9:30 AM, 11:00 AM (not 12:30 PM because this is blocked for lunch), 1:00 PM (resetting for the next time group detail), 2:30 PM, and 4:00 PM.","comment_id":"1291767"}],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/119011-exam-mb-240-topic-1-question-97-discussion/","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.

However, the issue lies in the start time and end time duration for the entire day. The system needs to break down the day into multiple 30-minute slots, and the correct way to achieve this would be to specify intervals or time group details with the desired frequency, rather than setting a single start and end time for the entire day.\n\nGiven this, the solution as described does not fully meet the goal because the method of specifying the 30-minute slots needs to be structured more effectively.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nB.
