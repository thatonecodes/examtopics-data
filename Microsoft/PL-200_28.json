But Answer A is the correct choice. According to the documentation (Microsoft Docs on Gallery Control):\n\nReset() works with a Gallery control by iterating through all the child controls inside the Gallery and resetting them to their default values.\nThis means you can reset all checkboxes within the Gallery by simply passing the Gallery control to the Reset() function. You just need to ensure the 'Default property of the checkbox is set to false. D is definitely not correct as it only pertains to a collection. If anyone has been creating apps for years they will discover this. For those that said nothing happened, more than likely there was a problem with your code, not the formula function.

In this case, you want to clear all product selections in the gallery control when the user clicks a button. By passing the gallery control as a parameter to the Reset function, you can achieve this. The Reset function will reset all controls within the gallery, including the checkboxes, effectively clearing all product selections.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate for this scenario:\n\nB. The Reload function does not exist in Power Apps.\nC. The ForAll function could be used to iterate through each item in the gallery, but it would be more complex and less efficient than using the Reset function.\nD.
