The container includes all the code, its dependencies and even the operating system itself. This enables applications to run almost anywhere — a desktop computer, a traditional IT infrastructure or the cloud.\n\nContainers use a form of operating system (OS) virtualization. Put simply, they leverage features of the host operating system to isolate processes and control the processes’ access to CPUs, memory and desk space.\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/containers-vs-vms"},{"content":"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-container/\nWhat's a container: Standardized, portable packaging for your applications\nSo the answer is correct","comment_id":"481941","timestamp":"1637340720.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"liulenoir"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1636783440.0","content":"what is the correct answer?","comment_id":"477310","poster":"Johagmg"},{"comment_id":"477280","poster":"Johagmg","timestamp":"1636779960.0","content":"So what is the correct answer?","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"477099","timestamp":"1636739880.0","upvote_count":"11","poster":"Algasibiur","content":"Guys, my aswers with source:\n\nEasy way to differentiate Vm's and Container: \n* VM'S virtualize the HARDWARE\n* CONTAINERS virtualize the OPERATING SYSTEM and his advantages are portabilty , performance and management capabilities.\nBox 1 - Azure Cointainers Instances.\nBox 2 - Azure Containers Instaces.\nBox 3 - Azure App Services\nBox 4 - Azure Functions\n\n\nSource: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE2yuaq?postJsllMsg=true\nVideo in 1:54.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1637933460.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"487392","poster":"Harry28731","content":"Yes, ** Each option can be used MORE than once or none at all.\nIndeed everyone (including me) forgot about that.
