It then reduces the log volume by aggregating flows that have a common source IP address, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol.\n\nAn example might involve Host 1 at IP address 10.10.10.10 and Host 2 at IP address 10.10.20.10. Suppose these two hosts communicate 100 times over a period of one hour. The raw flow log has 100 entries in this case. If these hosts use the HTTP protocol on port 80 for each of those 100 interactions, the reduced log has one entry. That entry states that Host 1 and Host 2 communicated 100 times over a period of one hour by using the HTTP protocol on port 80."},{"timestamp":"1734339480.0","comment_id":"1327238","upvote_count":"3","poster":"flejur","content":"Selected Answer: C\nBased on the information provided in the image and the analysis of the NSG flow logs, Traffic Analytics in Azure Network Watcher will identify 5 aggregated flow entries.\nTo break this down:\nRDP Sessions:\nTwo RDP sessions from VM1 to VM2\nEach initiated from a different TCP port\nTotal RDP flow entries: 2\nSSH Sessions:\nThree SSH sessions from VM2 to VM1\nEach initiated from a different TCP port\nTotal SSH flow entries: 3\nThe total number of aggregated flow entries is the sum of RDP and SSH sessions: 2 + 3 = 5."}],"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"topic":"4","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image514.png","https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image515.png"],"exam_id":58,"answer_description":"","question_text":"You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nNSG1 is associated to the NIC of VM1 and contains the rules shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nYou collect NSG flow logs for five minutes for the following activities:\n\n• Two RDP sessions from VM1 to VM2, each initiated from a different TCP port\n• Three SSH sessions from VM2 to VM1, each initiated from a different TCP port\n\nYou analyze the logs by using Traffic Analytics in Azure Network Watcher.\n\nHow many aggregated flow entries will Traffic Analytics identify?","choices":{"D":"10","C":"5","A":"1","B":"2"},"unix_timestamp":1732798200,"answer":"C","question_id":281,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/152257-exam-az-700-topic-4-question-56-discussion/","answer_images":[]},{"id":"WkcQPruPbdAzeFNOFdNp","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image516.png"],"isMC":false,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image517.png"],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/154131-exam-az-700-topic-4-question-57-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-01-08 18:07:00","topic":"4","answer":"","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"manhattan","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nit's correct \nAzureNetworkAnalytics_CL\n| where SubType_s == \"FlowLog\" and FlowStartTime_t >= ago(30d) and FlowType_s == \"ExternalPublic\" | project Subnet1_s, Subnet2_s\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics-schema?tabs=nsg#data-aggregation","timestamp":"1736356020.0","comment_id":"1338027"}],"question_id":282,"exam_id":58,"unix_timestamp":1736356020,"answer_ET":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have an Azure subscription that contains 1,000 virtual machines.\n\nYou collect network security group (NSG) flow logs.\n\nYou need to identify all the virtual machines that have interacted with non-Azure public IP addresses during the last 30 days.\n\nHow should you complete the query?
