Licensing -\n\nLitware, Inc. has a total of 10 Dynamics 365 Marketing licenses, one of which is the functional consultant license.\n\nAs the functional consultant of the account, you will be responsible for ensuring your company does not exceed the limits of your current subscriptions / licenses.\n\nLitware, Inc. does not want to add any new licenses or purchase any more storage.\n\nNo Marketing Emails have been sent yet, and there are no Contacts in your Marketing database.\n\nSeveral social media accounts have been configured and authenticated.
