It works by monitoring user activities and authentication events in your organization's Active Directory environment. It does not provide information on the cloud apps accessed from the computers.\n\nTo discover which cloud apps are accessed from the computers, you should use Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) which is part of Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. MCAS provides visibility into the cloud apps accessed from your network and allows you to control access to those apps. You can use MCAS to discover cloud apps that are used in your organization and identify potential risks associated with those apps. To do this, you need to configure MCAS to collect logs from the firewall that utilizes syslog and analyze those logs to identify the cloud apps accessed from the computers.","comment_id":"848736","poster":"abrub","timestamp":"1679611620.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1671607920.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"skycrap","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI don't think A.
