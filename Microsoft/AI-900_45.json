Image classification applies one or more labels to an image. Object detection is similar, but it also returns the coordinates in the image where the applied label(s) can be found.\n\nBox 2: Yes -\nThe Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze images. You, the developer, submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then, the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images.\n\nBox 3: No -\nCustom Vision service can be used only on graphic files.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Custom-Vision-Service/overview","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"15","timestamp":"1667411700.0","comment_id":"471759","poster":"Marskmen","content":"Y/Y/N is correct"},{"timestamp":"1677551280.0","content":"technically analyzing video is possible. but we can't use only the Custom Vision Service to achieve that. so the answer I think Y/Y/N is correct","comment_id":"557780","poster":"aarestu","upvote_count":"7"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"fabras","content":"CORRET ANSWERS","timestamp":"1726300860.0","comment_id":"1007340"},{"comment_id":"981872","timestamp":"1723742580.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"GHOSTGIRL101","content":"Its YYN i call me mbalz wheknow this you see me"},{"poster":"zellck","content":"Gotten this in Jun 2023 exam.","comment_id":"935523","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1719500940.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1717131540.0","poster":"rdemontis","comment_id":"910805","content":"correct"},{"content":"Answer is correct","upvote_count":"3","poster":"ydu7312","timestamp":"1684193940.0","comment_id":"602334"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"The custom vision service can be used to detect objects in an image","comment_id":"583110","timestamp":"1681005720.0","poster":"cormorant"},{"poster":"Phemmy86","content":"ans is correct","comment_id":"469625","timestamp":"1667026920.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1664487900.0","comment_id":"454514","content":"very true","upvote_count":"2","poster":"YKBABA"}]},{"id":"PRz38ewJjyvzUuT4OCGb","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":41,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/102306-exam-ai-900-topic-1-question-77-discussion/","choices":{"A":"facial recognition","C":"image classification","B":"optical character recognition (OCR)","D":"object detection"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":222,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"898401","timestamp":"1715783700.0","poster":"alexein74","upvote_count":"7","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOCR is the answer"},{"comment_id":"935520","timestamp":"1719500880.0","poster":"zellck","content":"Gotten this in Jun 2023 exam.","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1717131600.0","comment_id":"910806","poster":"rdemontis","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect"},{"content":"B is correct (OCR)","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"850985","poster":"AdrienBnhm","timestamp":"1711463040.0"},{"content":"Answer is correct","comment_id":"836033","timestamp":"1710163920.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"mustafaalhnuty"}],"question_text":"You are processing photos of runners in a race.\nYou need to read the numbers on the runners' shirts to identity the runners in the photos.\nWhich type of computer vision should you use?","timestamp":"2023-03-11 14:32:00","unix_timestamp":1678541520,"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"answer":"B","topic":"1"},{"id":"ImMoEwpWdUKzml2VzFKX","timestamp":"2021-10-29 11:57:00","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0008800002.png"],"answer_ET":"","unix_timestamp":1635501420,"discussion":[{"content":"Answers are correct","timestamp":"1667411820.0","poster":"Marskmen","comment_id":"471761","upvote_count":"9"},{"comment_id":"602337","content":"Answer is correct","timestamp":"1684194000.0","poster":"ydu7312","upvote_count":"5"},{"comments":[{"poster":"nct1326","content":"Thanks","comment_id":"1039080","timestamp":"1728523620.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"Sylph","timestamp":"1724059740.0","content":"Clear explanation of the correct answers. \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-ai-fundamentals/4-understand-computer-vision","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"985083"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"rdemontis","content":"answer is correct","timestamp":"1717132440.0","comment_id":"910815"},{"timestamp":"1692429360.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"RajDguru","comment_id":"648787","content":"what is the difference between detection and recognition -
