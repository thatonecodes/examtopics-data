Restricted\n\nWhen you need to ensure that only a specific set of resources are allowed to be scheduled to perform certain work orders, the \"Restricted\" type should be selected when creating a resource requirement preference. This type of requirement preference explicitly restricts the assignment of the work order to only the resources that are specified in the requirement. It ensures that the scheduling system does not consider resources outside of this specified set for the particular work order.","comment_id":"1136461"}]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"name":"MB-240","provider":"Microsoft","isMCOnly":false,"id":78,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":228},"currentPage":15},"__N_SSP":true}
