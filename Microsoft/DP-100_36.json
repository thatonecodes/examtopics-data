Azure Blob storage: Identity-based access (Azure AD authentication) allows you to use Azure AD credentials to authenticate and access Azure Blob storage. This is the recommended and more secure method for accessing Blob storage, as it avoids exposing account keys directly. \n\n2. Azure File Storage: Shared access signature (SAS) is used to provide temporary access to resources in Azure File Storage. When using SAS, you can generate a token with specific permissions and expiration time, which can be used to access the Azure File share. This approach allows you to control the access to the file share for a specified time period without exposing the storage account key. \n\nSaM"}],"timestamp":"1690356180.0"},{"poster":"abuluxury","timestamp":"1689861060.0","content":"Don't see why you can't use sas for both or account key","comments":[{"content":"because it said \"Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication must be used for access to storage when possible\"","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1310995","poster":"jl420","timestamp":"1731454800.0"}],"comment_id":"957658","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Batman160591","content":"seems correct","comment_id":"928768","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1687291740.0"}],"topic":"2","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-100/image488.png"],"exam_id":64,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/112721-exam-dp-100-topic-2-question-97-discussion/","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nYou manage an Azure Machine Learning workspace named workspace1 by using the Python SDK v2.\n\nYou must register datastores in workspace1 for Azure Blob storage and Azure Files storage to meet the following requirements:\n\n• Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication must be used for access to storage when possible.\n• Credentials and secrets stored in workspace1 must be valid for a specified time period when accessing Azure Files storage.\n\nYou need to configure a security access method used to register the Azure Blob and Azure Files storage in workspace1.\n\nWhich security access method should you configure?
