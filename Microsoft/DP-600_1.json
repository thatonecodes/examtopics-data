The tenant contains two groups named ResearchReviewersGroup1 and ResearchReviewersGroup2.\n\nData Environment -\nContoso has the following data environment:\nThe Sales division uses a Microsoft Power BI Premium capacity.\nThe semantic model of the Online Sales department includes a fact table named Orders that uses Import made. In the system of origin, the OrderID value represents the sequence in which orders are created.\nThe Research department uses an on-premises, third-party data warehousing product.\nFabric is enabled for contoso.com.\nAn Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account named storage1 contains Research division data for a product line named Productline1. The data is in the delta format.\nA Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account named storage2 contains Research division data for a product line named Productline2. The data is in the CSV format.\n\nRequirements -\n\nPlanned Changes -\nContoso plans to make the following changes:\nEnable support for Fabric in the Power BI Premium capacity used by the Sales division.\nMake all the data for the Sales division and the Research division available in Fabric.\nFor the Research division, create two Fabric workspaces named Productline1ws and Productine2ws.\nIn Productline1ws, create a lakehouse named Lakehouse1.\nIn Lakehouse1, create a shortcut to storage1 named ResearchProduct.\n\nData Analytics Requirements -\nContoso identifies the following data analytics requirements:\nAll the workspaces for the Sales division and the Research division must support all Fabric experiences.\nThe Research division workspaces must use a dedicated, on-demand capacity that has per-minute billing.\nThe Research division workspaces must be grouped together logically to support OneLake data hub filtering based on the department name.\nFor the Research division workspaces, the members of ResearchReviewersGroup1 must be able to read lakehouse and warehouse data and shortcuts by using SQL endpoints.\nFor the Research division workspaces, the members of ResearchReviewersGroup2 must be able to read lakehouse data by using Lakehouse explorer.\nAll the semantic models and reports for the Research division must use version control that supports branching.\n\nData Preparation Requirements -\nContoso identifies the following data preparation requirements:\nThe Research division data for Productline1 must be retrieved from Lakehouse1 by using Fabric notebooks.\nAll the Research division data in the lakehouses must be presented as managed tables in Lakehouse explorer.\n\nSemantic Model Requirements -\nContoso identifies the following requirements for implementing and managing semantic models:\nThe number of rows added to the Orders table during refreshes must be minimized.\nThe semantic models in the Research division workspaces must use Direct Lake mode.\n\nGeneral Requirements -\nContoso identifies the following high-level requirements that must be considered for all solutions:\nFollow the principle of least privilege when applicable.\nMinimize implementation and maintenance effort when possible.\nYou need to ensure that Contoso can use version control to meet the data analytics requirements and the general requirements.\nWhat should you do?","answer_ET":"C","question_images":[],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1148171","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"Currently, only Git in Azure Repos is supported.\" https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration#considerations-and-limitations","upvote_count":"16","timestamp":"1726778280.0","poster":"Nicofr"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nIMHO, the Azure Repos is the answer.\n\nIt is directly mentioned here:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration\nConsiderations and limitations\nCurrently, only Git in Azure Repos with the same tenant as the Fabric tenant is supported.\nIf the workspace and Git repo are in two different geographical regions, the tenant admin must enable cross-geo exports.\nAzure DevOps on-prem isn't supported.\nSovereign clouds aren't supported.","timestamp":"1726974720.0","comment_id":"1207923","upvote_count":"9","poster":"stilferx"},{"comment_id":"1401819","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"Currently, only Git in Azure Repos is supported.\" https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oNH9i2ssNi9gISG3JGuxUoUhmAA4xCaGahEKv2dRN6Y/edit?usp=sharing","timestamp":"1742631180.0","poster":"Nityaanantha_Raman"},{"poster":"goldy29","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1738111560.0","comment_id":"1348262","content":"Selected Answer: C\nYou can use both Git and Azure as Repos for version control but if you read the question properly it clearly says that Research Division Workspace.
