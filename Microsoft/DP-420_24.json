This property is used to specify the Azure AD identities (service principals) that are allowed to access the account.\n\nBy assigning a user-assigned identity to the userAssignedIdentities property, you can configure the apps to authenticate using that identity, which will enable them to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account. This ensures that only the specified Azure AD identities are allowed to access the account, providing a more secure authentication mechanism compared to using the secondary key.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. userAssignedIdentities.","comment_id":"939630","poster":"azuredemo2022three"}],"timestamp":"2023-07-01 07:57:00","unix_timestamp":1688191020,"isMC":true,"exam_id":69,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/113798-exam-dp-420-topic-5-question-22-discussion/","answer_images":[],"topic":"5","answers_community":["B (89%)","11%"],"choices":{"B":"disableLocalAuth","A":"disableKeyBasedMetadataWriteAccess","D":"allowedOrigins","C":"userAssignedIdentities"},"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"You have an Azure Cosmos DB account named account1.\n\nYou have several apps that connect to account1 by using the account's secondary key.\n\nYou then configure the apps to authenticate by using service principals.\n\nYou need to ensure that account1 will only allow apps to connect by using an Azure AD identity.\n\nWhich account property should you modify?"},{"id":"8ZtHJHzRuOlIToXAIgPy","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/113801-exam-dp-420-topic-5-question-23-discussion/","answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-07-01 08:12:00","question_id":119,"unix_timestamp":1688191920,"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container.
