Here's why:\n1. Azure AD DS provides a managed domain service that is compatible with traditional Active Directory Domain Services\n2. It enables one-way synchronization from Azure AD to the managed domain, allowing access to a central set of users, groups, and credentials\n3. For hybrid environments with on-premises AD, Azure AD Connect can be used to synchronize identity information with Azure AD, which then synchronizes with Azure AD DS\n4.
