In no case it should fallback to Server 1 but it seams that it is a two node cluster with no witness mentioned, so there's a 50% chance the whole cluster will go down if Server 1 is the voting one and it goes down since no quorum. When the cluster is up again it could fallback if the prevent fallback option isn't on or Server2 is not on top of the list and ticked as in the other question of this series.","comment_id":"826285","poster":"Kurko","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Lu5ck","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1674137220.0","comment_id":"781208","content":"Selected Answer: A\nServer 1 is the preferred owner, as shown in the list.
