The company sells tropical fruit varieties, such as mangos and papayas. The demand for organic foods increased quickly.\n\nThe company began to import fruit from other areas to meet the increased demand year-round. Best For You Organics Company opened a site in Florida, and a second site in Texas. The company also imports organic fruits from Mexico and Peru when the fruits are out of season locally. Dried fruit products and fruit baskets are available to order online.\n\nThe company has no brick-and-mortar retail stores.\n\n\nCurrent Environment\n-\n\n• Best For You Organics Company uses Dynamics 565 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. The company is in the process of optimizing its current implementation.\n• The company operates as a single legal entity. The company plans to move to a new legal entity.\n• Inventory is valued at FIFO per site.\n• The controller accrues for inventory in the following ways;\no at the time of receipt for national purchase orders\no at the time of shipment for international shipments\n• Local Florida vendors are boutique shops that do not have technology platforms. Agreements are emailed to the vendors.\n• The IT department manages the online store.\n• Requests for quotes (RFQs) are sent to vendors for items sold online.\n• Frequently, online sales orders are same-day deliveries.\n• The Texas site has two warehouse zones:\no ZoneA is refrigerated.\no ZoneB is not refrigerated.\n• The Florida site has two warehouse zones:\no ZoneC is refrigerated.\no ZoneD is not refrigerated.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nFinance\n-\n• The accounts receivable (AR) manager is concerned about customer data moving to the new legal entity at cutover. The AR manager has two key requirements:\no AR requirement 1: The company must be able to extract customer data from its existing legal entity.\no AR requirement 2: The terms of payment must be moved to the new legal entity at the same time as customer data.\n• The CFO reports that the inventory values are incorrect. The CFO has the following requirements:\no CFO requirement 1: Manually account for the difference in inventory value before month-end until the valuation is corrected next month,\no CFO requirement 2: Value inventory at FIFO per warehouse, not per site.\n\nInventory\n-\n• Inventory in the Texas site is sourced only from Mexico imports. The imports must be planned year-round.\n• Inventory in the Florida facility is sourced from local Florida organic growers first, followed by seasonal buying from Peru.\n• The company has two buyers:\no Buyer1 is based in Texas. The buyer requires the master planning job to run while the buyer is on their lunch break.\no Buyer2 is based in Florida. The buyer must be able to identify trends of local Florida vendors. Slower product delivery lead times are an early indicator of seasonal change.\n• Inventory in transit from Mexico is included in the on-hand count in Texas. This practice creates demand and sales order fulfillment issues.\n• The legal entity must provide purchasing suggestions by evaluating on-hand inventory, delivery lead times, and sales demand.\n\nVendors and purchasing\n-\n• The legal entity must have the ability to send emails for purchase order confirmations to the local Florida boutique vendors.\n• RFQs must have the ability to be communicated and tracked with existing vendors online.\n• Organic certificates must be uploaded by vendors as an attachment when RFQ responses are received.\n\nOnline sales orders\n-\n• The online store must be able to handle multiple languages to support customers in Mexico, Peru, and the United States.\n• The customer service manager requires an alert or report when online sales orders have a same-day delivery date.\n\nWarehousing\n-\n• The warehouse manager requires the customer service team to print to the warehouse zones that have refrigeration when the team confirms fruit basket orders. All other orders must print to the non-refrigerated zones.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n\nFinance\n-\n• The controller cannot accrue for inventory without adding on-hand quantities to inventory. The process is manual and should be automatic.\n• The company has customer terms of payment that are entered inconsistently. The AR manager is cleaning this up so that bad data, such as N10 or Net10, is streamlined into a reportable format.\n\nVendors and purchasing\n-\n• Buyer1 reports that the master planning job runs in the Florida time zone, an hour before the buyer s lunch.\n• The local Florida boutique vendors often state that they have not received emails. Occasionally, the email system does not send emails due to weather and power outages.\n\nOnline sales orders\n-\n• A customer reports that they did not receive a same-day shipment. The customer service manager received a notification after the sales order was due.\n• The IT manager is concerned that the IT team can manage only a single online store. The IT manager does not want multiple stores.\n\n\nYou need to ensure that the issues identified by the customer service manager are resolved.\n\nWhat should you configure?
