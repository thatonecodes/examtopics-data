If the upstream source becomes unavailable, the cached packages remain accessible. This reduces downtime and dependency issues for projects relying on those packages.\nWhy it matters: Ensures consistent access to dependencies even if the original source is temporarily unavailable.\n2. Minimizes latency when accessing the package\nExplanation: By caching packages locally in the MyGet feed, proxying reduces the need to repeatedly fetch them from the upstream feed, which might be slower due to network distance or other factors.\nWhy it matters: Improves build times and developer productivity by reducing delays in accessing dependencies.","poster":"yaguitoEC","timestamp":"1733233800.0"},{"poster":"UrbanRellik","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nhttps://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/upstream-sources","timestamp":"1719402360.0","comment_id":"1237424"},{"poster":"FeriAZ","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1711540320.0","comment_id":"1184035","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nResilience against Upstream Outages (A): When proxying, your MyGet feed acts as a cache for the upstream feed.

Minimizes the impact of upstream source availability issues.\nC. Provides automatic authentication.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Proxying a private upstream MyGet package feed to your MyGet feed helps minimize the impact of upstream source availability issues. If the upstream source experiences downtime or availability issues, your local proxy can still serve packages from its cache, ensuring continuous availability to your team.\n\nC. Proxying provides automatic authentication. When you set up a proxy, it handles authentication with the upstream source on your behalf. This means you don't have to manage authentication separately for every user or system accessing packages from the upstream source, simplifying the authentication process.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1056669"},{"poster":"peekingpicker","content":"Benefits:\n\nupstream packages do not count against your MyGet storage quota\nauthentication against upstream, private MyGet feeds happens automatically \n\nhttps://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/upstream-sources#Proxy_packages_from_an_upstream_source","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1695375300.0","comment_id":"1013917"},{"timestamp":"1694243940.0","content":"I choose A,D\nProxying is a way of adding packages from an upstream source to your MyGet feed without copying the package itself.
