No\n\nThe solution does not meet the goal. While you can use an X.509 certificate to authenticate a service principal in Azure AD, this is not the recommended way to grant a VM access to specific resource groups in Azure Resource Manager.\n\nInstead, you should use Managed Identities for Azure resources. A managed identity is an identity registered in Azure Active Directory that is automatically managed by Azure. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Azure Resource Manager, without any credentials in your code.","poster":"Vichu_1607","comment_id":"1294018","timestamp":"1728276540.0"},{"poster":"Razvan_C","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1700155200.0","comment_id":"1072594","content":"Is this still a valid question for the exam?

This API is used to manage resources in Azure, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases.\n\nWhen you make a request to the Azure Resource Manager API, you need to include an access token in the Authorization header of your HTTP request. This token proves that you are who you say you are and that you have permission to perform the requested operation.\n\nYou can obtain an access token by authenticating with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). There are several ways to do this, including using a client secret, a certificate, or a managed identity.\n\nOnce you have an access token, you can use it to authenticate requests to the Azure Resource Manager API. This allows you to manage resources in Azure programmatically, without needing to manually log in through the Azure portal.","comment_id":"1099497","poster":"130nk3r5"}],"upvote_count":"2"}],"content":"Yes, because a certificate can be used to authenticate...
