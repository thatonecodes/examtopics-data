IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied the communication, so that you can resolve the problem.\nC: The NSG flow log capability allows you to log the source and destination IP address, port, protocol, and whether traffic was allowed or denied by an NSG.\nD: The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview"},{"id":"icuJHqbPTtQMwXQIlk0F","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":43,"discussion":[{"comments":[{"poster":"TinyTrexArmz","timestamp":"1596916020.0","comment_id":"153195","upvote_count":"1","content":"My question is, can you have a VPN without a Local Network Gateway?
