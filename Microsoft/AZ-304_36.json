Batch works well with intrinsically parallel (also known as \"embarrassingly parallel\") workloads. Intrinsically parallel workloads are those where the applications can run independently, and each instance completes part of the work. When the applications are executing, they might access some common data, but they do not communicate with other instances of the application.
