This structure allows operations, such as directory renames and deletes, to be performed in a single atomic operation. Flat namespaces, by contrast, require several operations proportionate to the number of objects in the structure. Hierarchical namespaces keep the data organized, which yields better storage and retrieval performance for an analytical use case and lowers the cost of analysis.\n\nSOURCE: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-data-lake-storage/4-azure-data-lake-and-blob-storage","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1161010","timestamp":"1709070360.0"},{"timestamp":"1701873300.0","comment_id":"1089440","upvote_count":"4","content":"Account -> Container\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-data-lake-storage/4-azure-data-lake-and-blob-storage","poster":"Sayuri1313"},{"timestamp":"1698324900.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Azure Resource Group --> Azure Storage account --> File share --> Folders --> Files.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share?tabs=azure-portal#change-the-tier-of-an-azure-file-shareare","comments":[{"comment_id":"1151075","content":"The question was on context of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
