However, it does not configure routing rules to direct traffic to the service endpoint.\nTo meet the goal, you need to perform the following:\n1. Install the Azure CLI on the Ubuntu VM\n2. Install Docker on the VM\n3. Restart the Docker service to pick up the environment variables\n4. Add routing rules to direct traffic from containers to the subnet's service endpoint\n5. Deploy containers and test access to Storage/SQL DB.\nSo in summary, installing the CNI plug-in alone will not configure the network routing needed for the containers to utilize the service endpoint. Additional configuration using the Azure CLI is required.\nTherefore, the solution does not meet the goal.
