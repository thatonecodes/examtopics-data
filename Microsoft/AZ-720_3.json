Configure the hashing algorithm to be the same on both gateways. - For a successful VPN tunnel, both ends of the tunnel should have the same settings including the hashing algorithm.

Configure the pre-shared key to be the same on the Azure VPN gateway and the on-premises VPN gateways. - The pre-shared key is used to authenticate the two ends of the VPN tunnel. If the keys don't match, it will cause connectivity problems.\n\nE. Reset the VPN connection. - Resetting the VPN connection can help clear any transient issues that might be causing connectivity problems. It is a non-disruptive action as it does not affect the underlying gateway and hence the other services using the gateway. This should be done after confirming correct configurations (i.e., pre-shared key and hashing algorithm).\n\nOption F, Reset the VPN gateway, should be avoided unless absolutely necessary as it can cause a temporary outage and affect all services using the gateway, not just the one experiencing issues.","timestamp":"1689930240.0","poster":"terawatt","comment_id":"958253"},{"poster":"cris_exam","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1681732920.0","content":"I would go with ABE if I want to have NO downtime to the other services.
