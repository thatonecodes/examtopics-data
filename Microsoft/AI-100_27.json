Shared Access Signature (SAS)\n\nTo provide temporary and time-limited access to the video files while ensuring authentication, the recommended solution is to use.\n\nShared Access Signature (SAS) is a secure way to grant limited access to resources in Azure storage. It allows you to specify permissions, validity duration, and access constraints for a specific resource. In this case, you can generate a SAS token with a five-minute validity period for each video file.\n\nBy using SAS, you can generate unique URLs for each video file that include the SAS token. These URLs can be provided to authorized users, including temporary employees who may not have user accounts in Azure AD. When a user accesses the URL within the specified time limit, the SAS token allows them to access the video file. After the token expires, the access is automatically revoked, ensuring the temporary and time-limited nature of access.","comment_id":"928730","poster":"rveney","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1687288440.0"},{"comment_id":"300708","upvote_count":"2","content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview","poster":"renuka1234","timestamp":"1614505860.0"}],"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"D":"Azure Active Directory","C":"Shared Access Signature","A":"Secondary Storage Key","B":"Primary Storage Key"},"topic":"4","exam_id":39,"answer":"C","answer_description":"References:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1","isMC":true},{"id":"eKWy4nf1gfZR2uF4r6KU","discussion":[{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"8","content":"I think \"Pull image\" must be executed first, as the image represents an input parameter for the \"az container create\" command\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/container?view=azure-cli-latest#az-container-create","timestamp":"1590158880.0","comments":[{"poster":"zzxl","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1614296040.0","content":"No you pull image to the instance. but you need the instance to be created in the first place.
