Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\n\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\n\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.\n\n\nTo start the case study -\nTo display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. is a growing landscaping company. In addition to providing regular maintenance for the properties of its clients, the company also offers manufacturing and installation of concrete landscaping blocks and edging.\n\nEmployees are divided into three areas:\n\n• Salespeople who primarily work remotely.\n• Office staff who are responsible for administrative tasks like accounting and estimating.\n• Service staff who take part in landscaping projects or the manufacturing process.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. uses Dynamics 365 Sales to manage accounts, contacts, and leads. The company estimates landscaping and concrete jobs by using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The spreadsheets contain calculations for labour and materials costs.\n\n\nCurrent estimation process -\n\n1. Salespeople go onsite to visit potential clients and initiate estimates by using a paper form to capture details of the work needed.\n2. When salespeople return home at the end of the day, they add any needed notes and drawings to the forms of the clients they visited. When the forms are complete, the salespeople email the forms to a designated member of the office staff.\n3. An office staff member enters the information into an Excel spreadsheet.\n4. The office manager assigns the jobs to one of two office staff responsible for creating estimates.\n5. The estimators work through the jobs from the oldest job to the newest.\n6. If an estimate is greater than $50,000, it must be reviewed by the office manager before work can begin.\n7. After a job is estimated and approved, it is sent to the service staff to implement.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. plans to continue its processes by using Microsoft Power Platform tools to allow users to work more efficiently.\n\n• Office workers and the office manager must be able to do the following: o Use a model-driven app. o Use email as their primary method of communication. o Be contacted automatically when they have been assigned an estimate to complete or review.\n• Salespeople must be able to do the following on their mobile device and while offline: o Calculate the cost of concrete. o Record notes and area measurements to calculate material costs. o Capture multiple pictures and drawings.\n• Both salespeople and office workers must be able to calculate the cost of the concrete portion of a job by using the same tool.\n• All data must be stored in Microsoft Dataverse.\no Quotes must be used to create estimates.\n A new column must be added to track approval status.\no A custom table must be used to store data collected by salespeople. o A Microsoft Power Automate flow must be used to convert the data captured by the salespeople into a quote. o Area measurements must be converted to the quantity of units required to cover the area. The unit conversion must round up for quote lines. o Quotes must only display lines that have values greater than 0.\n• Customizations must be done by using out-of-the-box tools.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• Salespeople are unable to save data to the custom table.\n• The Power Automate flow that creates quotes returns an error when a math function is used for measurements that contain no value.\n\n\nYou need to ensure that the salespeople can save measurements.\n\nWhat should you do?","unix_timestamp":1717653000,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/141997-exam-pl-100-topic-3-question-120-discussion/","question_id":161},{"id":"hje90JWMPjq7ziDkr3ii","question_id":162,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04323/0014900002.png"],"isMC":false,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"AP2020","timestamp":"1608467100.0","comment_id":"248611","upvote_count":"29","content":"Yes it is correct."},{"timestamp":"1672426020.0","poster":"lillypath869","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"762233","content":"Correct"},{"poster":"JackJohn","comment_id":"761171","timestamp":"1672326360.0","content":"Correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Brombeerbaer","content":"correct","comment_id":"564816","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1646918520.0"},{"content":"Hint: Because we are opening the Business Account Table and select the Relationship there, you have to choose the BusinessContracts Entity, if you open the BusinessContracts, then you have to select the BusinessAccounts","timestamp":"1638528660.0","comment_id":"493081","upvote_count":"3","poster":"DiegosPizza"},{"content":"Correct","comment_id":"344423","timestamp":"1619588220.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SmileOS"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/40405-exam-pl-100-topic-3-question-13-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04323/0015000001.png"],"exam_id":114,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou have the following Common Data Service entities: BusinessContracts and BusinessAccounts.\nYou need to configure an N:N relationship between the two entities.\nWhich three actions should you perform in sequence?
