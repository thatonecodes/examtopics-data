The question present a a case that we have to deal with, note that the question is not about listing the appropriate step per theory, but per the situation at hand here. Per your answer you have not yet registered the nodes, you have not yet assigned node configuration to the nodes. Which compliance are you checking then? So per the case in the question after Step 1 and 2, you have to register the VMs ( according to Azure steps). This is the case is not a single VM, so to easily locate and register the VMs you need to assign tags to them in order to carry on the next step easily.","timestamp":"1678786020.0","comment_id":"838686","upvote_count":"4"}],"poster":"mlantonis","comment_id":"360146","upvote_count":"252","timestamp":"1621318800.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1279549","content":"WRONG\n\n1.

Under heavy load, one container might starve the other of resources, leading to instability and degraded performance for both. \nThis is not what we want to achieve in the question.\nFair Resource Allocation: Setting resource limits ensures that each container gets a fair share of resources. This is particularly important in environments where resource usage needs to be predictable and stable.","comments":[],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Josh219"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nit´s C","comment_id":"1287722","timestamp":"1727011200.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]"},{"content":"chatGPT\nD. Decrease the resource limit of container2 to two CPUs.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nIn this scenario, container2 has a resource request of 3 CPUs and a resource limit of 4 CPUs, while container1 has both a request and a limit of 2 CPUs.\nSince container2 has a higher resource request (3 CPUs) than container1 (2 CPUs), it could potentially starve container1 of the CPU resources it needs, especially if the CPU load increases.\nBy decreasing the resource limit of container2 to 2 CPUs, you ensure that both containers have equal access to CPU resources (i.e., 2 CPUs each), preventing container2 from consuming more resources than necessary and negatively impacting container1.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726234140.0","poster":"117b84e","comment_id":"1283192"},{"poster":"Milad","comment_id":"1272966","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724695800.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC should be the right answer"},{"poster":"FatFatSam","comment_id":"1270867","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nI think the Answer is C.\nThe resources allocated to Group1 is 5 CPUs \nOption D must be wrong.

The resource limit of container 2 must be 3 or greater.\nOption B is wrong as well. The maximum resource limit you can set for a container instance is the total resources allocated to the group. Thus, maximum request limit of container2 is 5. Also, Resource limit of container2 is 4. Container2 could use up to 4 CPUs that will negatively impact container1.

No\n\nExplanation: Assigning the AcrPull role to a service principal or identity is a necessary step to allow pulling container images from an Azure Container Registry (ACR). However, in the scenario described, the role is assigned to ACR-Tasks-Network, which might not be the correct identity involved in deploying the container instance.\n\nTo deploy a container instance using an image from ACR, the identity or resource attempting the deployment (such as an Azure Container Instance or a user) needs the AcrPull role on the registry (in this case, Registry1).
