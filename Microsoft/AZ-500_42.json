Any existing open TCP connections to the service are closed during this switch. Ensure that no critical tasks are running when enabling or disabling a service endpoint to a service for a subnet. Also, ensure that your applications can automatically connect to Azure services after the IP address switch.\nThe IP address switch only impacts service traffic from your virtual network. There's no impact to any other traffic addressed to or from the public IPv4 addresses assigned to your virtual machines. *** For Azure services, if you have existing firewall rules using Azure public IP addresses, these rules stop working with the switch to virtual network private addresses. ***\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview","comment_id":"422118","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1628511660.0","poster":"researched_answer_boi"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"As per my observation, the answers are correct.
