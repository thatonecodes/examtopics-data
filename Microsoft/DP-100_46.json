The value of epsilon is used to control the amount of noise added to the data to maintain privacy.\n\nWhen you perform multiple queries against the dataset, each one \"uses\" a part of this privacy budget. In order to maintain an appropriate level of overall privacy, you should consider that each separate query could potentially leak some information. Therefore, the cumulative privacy loss or total epsilon should be the sum of the epsilons for each query, not the smallest or largest single value.\nIf you were to set the total epsilon to the smallest of the two values, you would be assuming that only one of the queries contributes to privacy loss, which is not the case.","poster":"phdykd","timestamp":"1721994360.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"from chat gtp: \nTo minimize the risk of re-identification and ensure full plausible deniability when implementing a differential privacy solution using Azure Machine Learning and the SmartNoise Python libraries, you should configure the privacy budget.\n\nIn this scenario, the appropriate action to take is:\n\nAction:\n3) Set the epsilon value to the smaller of the epsilon values assigned to the mean and variance queries.","timestamp":"1719464700.0","comment_id":"935031","poster":"barb4ever2002"}],"answer":"","answer_ET":"","timestamp":"2023-06-27 07:05:00","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-100/image467.png"],"unix_timestamp":1687842300,"answer_description":"","exam_id":64,"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou use Azure Machine Learning and SmartNoise Python libraries to implement a differential privacy solution to protect a dataset containing citizen demographics for the city of Seattle in the United States.\n\nThe solution has the following requirements:\n\n• Allow for multiple queries targeting the mean and variance of the citizen’s age.\n• Ensure full plausible deniability.\n\nYou need to define the query rate limit to minimize the risk of re-identification.\n\nWhat should you configure?
