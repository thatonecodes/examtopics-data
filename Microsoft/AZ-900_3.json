In a pay-as-you-go model, you pay for what you use, which aligns with the nature of operational expenses.

Explanation:\nAzure Files is Microsoft's easy-to-use cloud file system. Azure file shares can be seamlessly used in Windows and Windows Server.\nTo use an Azure file share with Windows, you must either mount it, which means assigning it a drive letter or mount point path, or access it via its UNC path.\n\nUnlike other SMB shares you may have interacted with, such as those hosted on a Windows Server, Linux Samba server, or NAS device, Azure file shares do not currently support Kerberos authentication with your Active Directory (AD) or Azure Active Directory (AAD) identity, although this is a feature we are working on. Instead, you must access your Azure file share with the storage account key for the storage account containing your Azure file share. A storage account key is an administrator key for a storage account, including administrator permissions to all files and folders within the file share you're accessing, and for all file shares and other storage resources (blobs, queues, tables, etc) contained within your storage account.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-windows"},{"content":"that totally depend on data as structured or unstructured","comment_id":"161712","poster":"shiva99","timestamp":"1613763240.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Files stored on a network share are accessible to anyone who has permissions to the share","poster":"Gabaky","comment_id":"135480","timestamp":"1610698680.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"I thought files have to be SMB3, the question does not make any reference to this.
