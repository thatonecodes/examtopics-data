Nobody would use their product if we had to re-auth with our 2FA after every 30 min period of inactivity. The PIN alone is sufficient, why else would that be the only thing passed along over to FaceID or other biometric methods? Users in our environment are definitely not prompted to enter their \"Work or school account\" password when this occurs. FaceID/PIN alone lets you back in and resets the timer. I use corp teams on my MAM enrolled device and I can tell you if I was prompted for a password after using FaceID or entering the Teams PIN manually after 30 mins of inactivity, I would get very annoyed and would consider uninstalling the product altogether. PIN only is indeed the correct answer.\n\nFor those of you thinking you are resetting the PIN for the app itself you may be correct on that particular point but as for where that is controlled from, well that is from the device level. From the Intune management portal, you can only \"Reset passcode\" at the device level which effectively resets the PIN. There is not even anything anywhere else that says \"Reset PIN\" or even \"Reset App Pin\" as one would expect it to. After all this is Microsoft we are talking about here.
