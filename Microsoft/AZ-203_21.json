All system properties must be prefixed with sys. in the conditional expression. The SQL-language subset for filter conditions tests for the existence of properties (EXISTS), as well as for null-values (IS NULL), logical NOT/AND/OR, relational operators, simple numeric arithmetic, and simple text pattern matching with LIKE.\nCorrelation Filters - A CorrelationFilter holds a set of conditions that are matched against one or more of an arriving message's user and system properties. A common use is to match against the CorrelationId property, but the application can also choose to match against ContentType, Label, MessageId, ReplyTo,\nReplyToSessionId, SessionId, To, and any user-defined properties. A match exists when an arriving message's value for a property is equal to the value specified in the correlation filter. For string expressions, the comparison is case-sensitive. When specifying multiple match properties, the filter combines them as a logical\nAND condition, meaning for the filter to match, all conditions must match.\nBoolean filters - The TrueFilter and FalseFilter either cause all arriving messages (true) or none of the arriving messages (false) to be selected for the subscription.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/topic-filters","exam_id":47,"unix_timestamp":1576087080},{"id":"RbjNANBU43ebp0HKgPdJ","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/11518-exam-az-203-topic-3-question-8-discussion/","answer_ET":"Explanation","question_id":105,"answer_description":"Step 1: A user requests the image..\nA user requests a file (also called an asset) by using a URL with a special domain name, such as <endpoint name>.azureedge.net.
