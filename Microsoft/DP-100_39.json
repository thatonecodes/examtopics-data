As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.\nAn IT department creates the following Azure resource groups and resources:\n//IMG//\n\nThe IT department creates an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)-based inference compute target named aks-cluster in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.\nYou have a Microsoft Surface Book computer with a GPU. Python 3.6 and Visual Studio Code are installed.\nYou need to run a script that trains a deep neural network (DNN) model and logs the loss and accuracy metrics.\nSolution: Install the Azure ML SDK on the Surface Book. Run Python code to connect to the workspace.
