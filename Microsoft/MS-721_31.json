They are a key component of voice routing policies and help in determining the routing of outbound calls based on the user's location or other criteria.\n- **Voice Routing Policies (D)**:\n - **Voice routing policies** determine how calls are routed from Microsoft Teams to the PSTN. These policies include PSTN usages and ensure that calls are directed to the appropriate SBCs based on the defined rules. For redundancy, voice routing policies should include multiple SBCs to ensure that if one fails, calls can still be routed through another.\n- **Highly Available Session Border Controllers (SBCs) (E)**:\n - **Highly available SBCs** are critical for redundancy. By deploying redundant SBCs, you ensure that if one SBC fails, the other can take over, allowing outbound calls to continue without interruption.","poster":"734acc2"},{"timestamp":"1702375500.0","poster":"banderas","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is correct","comment_id":"1094342"}],"question_images":[],"exam_id":111,"question_text":"You have a Microsoft Teams deployment and an existing telephony solution that provides PSTN capability to on-premises third-party PBX systems in two separate locations.\n\nYou need to implement a redundant PSTN solution for Microsoft Teams Phone.
