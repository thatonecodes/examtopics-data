ChatGPT said, \"The direction is set to âInboundâ because the rule is being applied to traffic that is coming into the network security group (NSG) from VM1 to VM2.\n\nIn the context of Azure Network Security Groups, âInboundâ refers to traffic that is entering the NSG from another source, while âOutboundâ refers to traffic that is leaving the NSG to go to another destination.\n\nIn this case, since VM1 is initiating the ping to VM2, the traffic is entering the NSG from VM1 (hence, âInboundâ) and going to VM2. This is why the direction of the rule is set to âInboundâ.\n\nRemember, the direction of the rule is always from the perspective of the network security group.
