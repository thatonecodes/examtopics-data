When you create a custom table the ownership options are User or team or Organization owned. Once a table is created, the ownership type can't be changed.\nOrganization - Data belongs to the organization. Access to the data is controlled at the organization level.\nUser or team - Data belongs to a user or a team. Actions that can be performed on these rows can be controlled on a user level.\nNote: Tables appear in Power Apps as one of three different types, which indicate how the table came into the environment, whether the table is managed or unmanaged, and whether it can be customized.\n* Standard: Several standard tables, also known as out-of-box tables, are included with a Power Platform environment, that includes Microsoft Dataverse.\nAccount, business unit, contact, task, and user tables are examples of standard tables in Dataverse. Most of the standard tables included with Dataverse can be customized. Tables that are imported as part of a managed solution and set as customizable also appear as standard tables. Any user with appropriate privileges can customize these tables where the table property has customizable set to true.\n* Managed: Are tables that aren't customizable and have been imported into the environment as part of a managed solution.\n* Custom: Custom tables are unmanaged tables that are either imported from an unmanaged solution or are new tables created directly in the environment. Any user with appropriate privileges can fully customize these tables.\nBox 2: Activity table with User or Team ownership\n\nActivity tables -\nAn activity can be thought of as any action for which an entry can be made on a calendar. An activity has time dimensions (start time, stop time, due date, and duration) that help determine when the action occurred or will occur. Activities also contain data that helps determine what action the activity represents, for example, subject and description. An activity can be opened, canceled, or completed. The completed status of an activity will have several sub-status values associated with it to clarify the way that the activity was completed.\nActivity tables are a special kind of table that can only be owned by a user or team, but can't be owned by an organization. When you create a table, you can specify it as a standard or activity table.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/types-of-entities","isMC":false,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0012200001.jpg"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"At09","comment_id":"1022360","content":"Correct","timestamp":"1727793300.0"},{"timestamp":"1725980580.0","content":"A and C","comment_id":"1004075","upvote_count":"1","poster":"yasir24"},{"poster":"jkaur","upvote_count":"3","content":"correct","comment_id":"977821","timestamp":"1723303380.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1721441820.0","poster":"stalee","comments":[{"timestamp":"1736686380.0","poster":"osx","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1339496","content":"\"An activity can be thought of as any action for which an entry can be made on a calendar.
