The ambiguity in the question is really annoying though. In this case we know the user was removed, and with dynamic groups than can only have two causes - the user changed, or the group filter changed. 'Remove user from group' would tell us that the user was removed because of a filter change, but would it tell us who made the change or what the change was? If the user change shows no results, you already know it was a filter change, so an audit telling you only that it was a filter change and not what kind of change is not very helpful.
