Endpoints are used to enable communication with your storage account from different sources, such as an application or a client tool.\n\nIf you have two storage accounts, you can create two separate endpoints, one for each storage account. Each endpoint will have a unique URL that you can use to access the storage account.\n\nHowever, it's also possible to use a single endpoint for multiple storage accounts by using a virtual network and a virtual network service endpoint. This approach allows you to access multiple storage accounts through a single endpoint, which can simplify management and reduce costs.","comment_id":"897530","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"889194","timestamp":"1699085520.0","poster":"_fkucuk","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is 2.\n\nOne service endpoint is required for Azure Storage, which allows virtual machines connected to VNET1 to access storage1 and storage2 over the Microsoft backbone.\n\nAnother service endpoint is required for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which allows virtual machines connected to VNET1 to access Azure AD resources, such as user accounts and security groups, over the Microsoft backbone.\n\nSince the requirement also includes communication between VNET1 and VNET2 using the Microsoft backbone, no additional service endpoints are needed for this purpose, as Microsoft automatically routes traffic between virtual networks over the Microsoft backbone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 2.","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"RDIO","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think it's 2, but am I missing something? \n\nThe requirement regarding service endpoints is \"The virtual machines connected to VNET1 must be able to access storage1, storage2, and Azure AD by using the Microsoft backbone.\" Where is key vault requested?\n\nAnd when you are choosing service endpoints through the list \"storage\" is there and \"Azure AD\" is also there. \"KeyVault\" also exists but it's not requested in this question.","timestamp":"1698235140.0","comment_id":"880322"},{"poster":"5864619","comment_id":"878162","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1698054900.0","content":"You have an Azure subscription that contains eight virtual machines and the resources shown in the following table."},{"comment_id":"862910","poster":"matt65","timestamp":"1696592580.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\n1 service endpoint for storage service","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1696433340.0","content":"It seems answer is A - 1 service endpoint.
