Throttling can occur during queries or indexing. From the client side, an API call results in a 503 HTTP response when it has been throttled. During indexing, there's also the possibility of receiving a 207 HTTP response, which indicates that one or more items failed to index. This error is an indicator that the search service is getting close to capacity.\n\nA simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing-based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it's important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all. Investigating the conditions that cause throttling will be explained in the next several sections.","poster":"zellck","comment_id":"935304"},{"poster":"massnonn","comment_id":"1402224","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nfor me is B, because add partition is the correct solution","timestamp":"1742726280.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct because adding replicas in Azure AI Search increases the query throughput capacity.

However, you can allocate up to 12 replicas in a Standard search service and 3 replicas in a Basic search service.

No.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nAdding replicas does not directly address the issue of query throttling in Azure Cognitive Search.\nQuery throttling occurs when the service limits the number of requests it can handle within a given time frame. It is typically related to the service’s capacity, rate limits, and resource availability.\nTo reduce the likelihood of query throttling, consider other factors such as:\nService capacity: Ensure that your service tier (including replicas and partitions) can handle the query volume.\nOptimize query design: Efficiently structure your queries to minimize resource usage.\nIndex composition: Smaller indexes tend to perform better, but also consider schema complexity and field attribution.\nTherefore, adding replicas alone does not meet the goal of reducing query throttling.
