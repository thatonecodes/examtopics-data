If your storage account has GRS enabled, then your data is durable even in the case of a complete regional outage or a disaster in which the primary region isn't recoverable.\nIf you opt for GRS, you have two related options to choose from:\n✑ GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, but that data is available to be read only if Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region.\n✑ Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) is based on GRS. RA-GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, and also provides you with the option to read from the secondary region. With RA-GRS, you can read from the secondary region regardless of whether Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/bs-cyrl-ba/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03872/0012600001.jpg"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/8912-exam-dp-200-topic-7-question-2-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1574457300.0","poster":"STH","content":"We do not have to read data from the secondary region : only GRS is needed (with smallest cost than RA-GRS)","comment_id":"23729","comments":[{"upvote_count":"15","timestamp":"1593105240.0","content":"It also states that the solution must be resilient.

It is mentioned in the question that \"All services and processes must be resilient to a regional Azure outage.\"\nHowever, referred from the Microsoft docs: Geo-redundant storage carries a risk of data loss. Data is copied to the secondary region asynchronously, meaning there is a delay between when data written to the primary region is written to the secondary region. In the event of an outage, write operations to the primary endpoint that have not yet been copied to the secondary endpoint will be lost. \nThis concludes that RA-GRS is the correct answer as per Microsoft docs \"If an outage occurs in the primary endpoint, applications configured for read access to the secondary and designed for high availability can continue to read from the secondary endpoint.

If the primary region suffers an outage, then the secondary region serves as a redundant source for your data. You can initiate a failover to transform the secondary endpoint into the primary endpoint.\n\nRead-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) provides geo-redundant storage with the additional benefit of read access to the secondary endpoint. If an outage occurs in the primary endpoint, applications configured for read access to the secondary and designed for high availability can continue to read from the secondary endpoint.
