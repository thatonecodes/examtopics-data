Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\n\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear.

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. is a global office supply company. The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.\n\n\nCurrent environment -\n\n\nCorporate website -\n\nThe company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.\n\n\nRetail Store Locations -\n\nThe company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\nThe application components must meet the following requirements:\n\n\nCorporate website -\n\n• Secure the website by using SSL.\n• Minimize costs for data storage and hosting.\n• Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).\n• Distribute the website content globally for local use.\n• Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification.\n• The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.\n\n\nRetail store locations -\n\n• Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.\n• Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.\n\n\nDelivery services -\n\n• Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.\n• Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.\n\n\nInventory services -\n\nThe company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.\n\n\nSecurity -\n\n• All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key.\n• Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n\nRetail Store Locations -\n\n• You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data.\n• Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.\n\n\nYou need to implement the delivery service telemetry data.\n\nHow should you configure the solution? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","topic":"3","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/117537-exam-az-204-topic-3-question-46-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"980584","timestamp":"1691999580.0","upvote_count":"31","poster":"devex","comments":[{"comment_id":"1238454","poster":"Jobalos009","timestamp":"1719541200.0","content":"Great explanation !
