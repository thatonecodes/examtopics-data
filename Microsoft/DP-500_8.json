The company sells goods both online and its stores located in six countries.\n\n\nAzure Resources\n-\n\nLitware has the following Azure resources:\n\n• An Azure Synapse Analytics workspace named synapseworkspace1\n• An Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account named datalake1 that is associated with synapseworkspace1\n• A Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool named SQLDW\n\n\nDedicated SQL Pool\n-\n\nSQLDW contains a dimensional model that contains the following tables.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nSQLDW contains the following additional tables.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nSQLDW contains a view named dbo.CustomerPurchases that creates a distinct list of values from dbo.Customer [customerID], dbo.Customer [CustomerEmail], dbo.Product [ProductID] and dbo.Product [ProductName].\n\nThe sales data in SQLDW is updated every 30 minutes. Records in dbo.SalesTransactions are updated in SQLDW up to three days after being created. The records do NOT change after three days.\n\n\nPower BI\n-\n\nLitware has a new Power BI tenant that contains an empty workspace named Sales Analytics.\n\nAll users have Power BI Premium per user licenses.\n\nIT data analytics are workspace administrators. The IT data analysts will create datasets and reports.\n\nA single imported dataset will be created to support the company’s sales analytics goals. The dataset will be refreshed every 30 minutes.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nAnalytics Goals\n-\n\nLitware identifies the following analytics goals:\n\n• Provide historical reporting of sales by product and channel over time.\n• Allow sales managers to perform ad hoc sales reporting with minimal effort.\n• Perform market basket analysis to understand which products are commonly purchased in the same transaction.\n• Identify which customers should receive promotional emails based on their likelihood of purchasing promoted products.\n\nLitware plans to monitor the adoption of Power BI reports over time. The company wants custom Power BI usage reporting that includes the percent change of users that view reports in the Sales Analytics workspace each month.\n\n\nSecurity Requirements\n-\n\nLitware identifies the following security requirements for the analytics environment:\n\n• All the users in the sales department and the marketing department must be able to see Power BI reports that contain market basket analysis and data about which customers are likely to purchase a product.\n• Customer contact data in SQLDW and the Power BI dataset must be labeled as Sensitive. Records must be kept of any users that use the sensitive data.\n• Sales associates must be prevented from seeing the CustomerEmail column in Power BI reports.\n• Sales managers must be prevented from modifying reports created by other users.\n\nDevelopment Process Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following development process requirements:\n\n• SQLDW and datalake1 will act as the development environment. Once feature development is complete, all entities in synapseworkspace1 will be promoted to a test workspace, and then to a production workspace.\n• Power BI content must be deployed to test and production by using deployment pipelines.\n• All SQL scripts must be stored in Azure Repos.\n\nThe IT data analysts prefer to build Power BI reports in Synapse Studio.\n\n\nYou have an Azure Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool.\n\nYou need to return a list of files and the number of rows in each file.\n\nHow should you complete the Transact-SQL statement? To answer, drag the appropriate values to the targets. Each value may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","isMC":false,"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/126110-exam-dp-500-topic-1-question-136-discussion/","answer_ET":"","question_id":39,"answer":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-500/image149.png","https://img.examtopics.com/dp-500/image150.png","https://img.examtopics.com/dp-500/image153.png"],"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-500/image154.png"]},{"id":"HRcqC9iafu8CG9iotONy","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"summary","C":"cov","D":"corr","B":"explain"},"answer":"A","exam_id":70,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/128173-exam-dp-500-topic-1-question-137-discussion/","question_text":"You are using a Python notebook in an Apache Spark pool in Azure Synapse Analytics.\n\nYou need to present the data distribution statistics from a DataFrame in a tabular view.\n\nWhich method should you invoke on the DataFrame?","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"question_id":40,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1702189440,"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Question is same as Q62 and Q101 see answers there too","timestamp":"1702189440.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1092299","poster":"Qordata"}],"timestamp":"2023-12-10 07:24:00","answer_description":"","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"provider":"Microsoft","numberOfQuestions":183,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"id":70,"isBeta":false,"name":"DP-500"},"currentPage":8},"__N_SSP":true}
