Publish the app is NOT the correct choice:\n\nPublishing a Power Apps canvas app is a necessary step, but it alone does not grant your coworkers access to run the app. Publishing means that the latest changes you made to the app are saved and made available to users who already have access to it.\n\nHowever, in order for your coworkers to run the app, you must explicitly share it with them. Sharing the app allows you to assign permissions to specific individuals or groups, enabling them to access and use the app. Simply publishing the app without sharing it will not give your coworkers the necessary permissions to run it.\n\nSo, while publishing is important to make the app updates available, the critical step to ensure your coworkers can run the app is to share the app with them.","poster":"Panicz"},{"poster":"edzio","timestamp":"1730746980.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nSharing the app allows you to grant permissions to coworkers","comment_id":"1307067","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1285220","poster":"COOKIE1901","timestamp":"1726576560.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"A.
