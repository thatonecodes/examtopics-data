It also helps you monitor network connectivity to service and application endpoints and monitor the performance of\nAzure ExpressRoute.\nNote:\nIP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen,\nIP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.\nIP flow verify looks at the rules for all Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to the network interface, such as a subnet or virtual machine NIC. Traffic flow is then verified based on the configured settings to or from that network interface. IP flow verify is useful in confirming if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview","unix_timestamp":1594307220,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"Note: This question is part of series of questions that present the same scenario.
