This backup will be the yearly backup, and it will be retained for 10 years.\nNote: Long-term backup retention (LTR) leverages the full database backups that are automatically created to enable point in time restore (PITR). If an LTR policy is configured, these backups are copied to different blobs for long-term storage. The copy is a background job that has no performance impact on the database workload. The LTR policy for each database in SQL Database can also specify how frequently the LTR backups are created.\nTo enable LTR, you can define a policy using a combination of four parameters: weekly backup retention (W), monthly backup retention (M), yearly backup retention (Y), and week of year (WeekOfYear). If you specify W, one backup every week will be copied to the long-term storage. If you specify M, the first backup of each month will be copied to the long-term storage. If you specify Y, one backup during the week specified by WeekOfYear will be copied to the long-term storage. If the specified WeekOfYear is in the past when the policy is configured, the first LTR backup will be created in the following year. Each backup will be kept in the long-term storage according to the policy parameters that are configured when the LTR backup is created.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/long-term-retention-overview?view=azuresql","discussion":[{"comment_id":"991836","content":"Answer is correct","upvote_count":"2","poster":"yooshua","timestamp":"1724825040.0"},{"poster":"amazonalex","comment_id":"870362","timestamp":"1713116040.0","content":"looks correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1682975760.0","poster":"eric0718","content":"Answer is correct","comment_id":"595727"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/75026-exam-dp-300-topic-6-question-18-discussion/","question_id":282,"timestamp":"2022-05-01 23:16:00","topic":"6","unix_timestamp":1651439760,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04275/0028300001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04275/0028400011.jpg"],"answer_ET":"","answer":"","answers_community":[],"isMC":false,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04275/0028500001.jpg"],"exam_id":68},{"id":"MIqQiBbApMvKcmVx7zJE","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1682517240,"topic":"6","exam_id":68,"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"From the properties of Server1, configure retention for DB1.","A":"From the properties of DB1, configure geo-replication.","E":"Create a new Azure SQL Database instance named DB2.","C":"Create a new Azure SQL Database server named Server2.","B":"From the properties of Server1, add a failover group."},"answer":"BC","discussion":[{"poster":"Ajgb","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nConfigure rep then create fog","comment_id":"1559650","timestamp":"1744304220.0"},{"timestamp":"1728706500.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"2f5c7cd","comment_id":"1296331","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nBC"},{"comment_id":"881698","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nSeems correct.
