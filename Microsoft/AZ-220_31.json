If an IoT solution already has a custom identity registry and/or authentication scheme, consider creating a token service to integrate this infrastructure with IoT Hub. In this way, you can use other IoT features in your solution.\n\nA token service is a custom cloud service. It uses an IoT Hub shared access policy with the DeviceConnect permission to create device-scoped or module-scoped tokens. These tokens enable a device and module to connect to your IoT hub.","comment_id":"910388","poster":"j_c_000","timestamp":"1685461020.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1688018040.0","content":"Should be D then...","poster":"Tyrel","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"937584"}],"upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":49,"answer":"C","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1685461020,"question_images":[],"question_text":"You have an Azure IoT solution.\n\nYou need to implement multi-factor device authentication by using custom device authentication.\n\nWhat should you do first?","choices":{"D":"Deploy a security token service.","A":"Create an Azure Policy definition for Azure IoT Hub.","B":"Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of Microsoft Entra.","C":"Create a service endpoint policy."},"answer_ET":"B","question_id":153,"topic":"6","timestamp":"2023-05-30 17:37:00"},{"id":"MIOY6zQg55ddTV7laIpc","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1684513680,"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"question_id":154,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/109734-exam-az-220-topic-6-question-29-discussion/","choices":{"B":"No","A":"Yes"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"6","timestamp":"2023-05-19 18:28:00","exam_id":49,"discussion":[{"poster":"j_c_000","timestamp":"1685461320.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"910391","content":"Selected Answer: A\nRight, why not?
