It is also a computationally efficient method, which can handle high-dimensional data sets.\n\nOn the other hand, Mood's median test, Kendall correlation, and Permutation Feature Importance are not feature extraction methods, but rather statistical tests or feature importance measures that can be used in the context of feature selection.
