This is because the custom unifying parser will use the built-in parser version that you specify, and not the latest version that is available in the Microsoft Sentinel repository.\nOption D: Redeploying the built-in parser and specifying a CallerContext parameter of Built-in will also prevent the built-in parser from being updated automatically. This is because the CallerContext parameter specifies that the parser should only be used for built-in sources. If the parser is updated, it will no longer be considered a built-in source, and the CallerContext parameter will prevent it from being used.","upvote_count":"2"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/97121-exam-sc-200-topic-3-question-60-discussion/","topic":"3"},{"id":"w5H8lhRCS53L8TtauXBm","topic":"3","answers_community":["A (87%)","13%"],"answer":"A","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"exam_id":122,"choices":{"A":"In the grid query, include the take operator.","C":"In the query editor interface, configure Settings.","B":"In the grid query, include the project operator.","D":"In the query editor interface, select Advanced Editor."},"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1674305040,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"22","comments":[{"content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/takeoperator","poster":"prino","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"788416","timestamp":"1674711780.0"}],"poster":"eddz25","comment_id":"783274","timestamp":"1674305040.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
