Remove the contacts from the marketing list by using Advanced Find is not the correct answer because it would modify the original marketing list. If you remove contacts directly from the original marketing list, you lose the ability to track which contacts were originally included before the credit hold filter was applied. This could be problematic if you want to analyze the original list in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, option A. Copy the original marketing list to static and remove the contacts by using Advanced Find allows you to preserve the original marketing list while creating a new, updated list that excludes contacts with a credit hold. This way, you can track both the original and updated lists, which can be useful for comparison and analysis.","comment_id":"1153794","poster":"MitarbeiterKC","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1723970880.0","poster":"Ilknurcos","content":"Which one is right?","comment_id":"1153197","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Sri2020","timestamp":"1715965320.0","comment_id":"1073561","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect!!"},{"poster":"NA1926","timestamp":"1715606940.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorretto","comment_id":"1069452"},{"timestamp":"1714483500.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorretto","poster":"NA1926","comment_id":"1057965"},{"comment_id":"1051941","timestamp":"1713881400.0","poster":"NA1926","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorretto","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"NA1926","comment_id":"1020050","timestamp":"1711646220.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"B. https://www.inogic.com/blog/2019/10/add-remove-members-from-marketing-list-in-dynamics-365-ce-uci-using-advanced-find-query/","comment_id":"989805","poster":"chloaus","timestamp":"1708855560.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"989580","timestamp":"1708828080.0","content":"I think it should be A as it has asked to just filter out the contact not to exclude from marketing list","poster":"HassanSiddiqui"},{"timestamp":"1699024380.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think B should be the correct answer as it makes no sense to include the incorrect list in the campaign.","poster":"TamrynK","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"888547"}],"exam_id":75,"topic":"2","answers_community":["B (80%)","A (20%)"],"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","choices":{"A":"Copy the original marketing list to static and remove the contacts by using Advanced Find.
