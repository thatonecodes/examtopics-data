This connector acts as a bridge between Intune and AD DS, allowing devices to be Hybrid Azure AD joined (joined to both Azure AD and AD DS) regardless of the device's location.\n\nThe marketing department users must have an LOB app installed during the deployment: Create a Microsoft Intune app deployment.\n- To install an LOB app for a specific group, you should create an Intune app deployment. Intune allows you to target app deployment to specific user groups (e.g., the marketing department) during Autopilot provisioning. This approach ensures that the app is deployed as part of the provisioning process with minimal administrative overhead.","timestamp":"1733064480.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Tr619899"}],"content":"Install the Intune Connector for Active Directory: This ensures that devices can join your on-premises AD DS domain during the Autopilot deployment process, regardless of their location.\nModify the Autopilot deployment profile: Within the Autopilot deployment profile, you can specify that the LOB app should be installed.

Conditional Access policies can ensure secure access while respecting their personal device ownership.\n Personal account sign-in: Users can only sign in to their devices using their personal accounts, as Azure AD registered devices don't join the domain and don't require work or school credentials.\n\nAzure AD joined and hybrid Azure AD join wouldn't be suitable choices in this case:\n\n Azure AD joined devices are domain-joined, requiring users to sign in with work or school credentials, violating your requirement for personal accounts.\n Hybrid Azure AD join combines on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD, adding complexity and not aligning with your need for purely personal device management.","comment_id":"1150709","timestamp":"1707964200.0"},{"poster":"Pasado","timestamp":"1707032820.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"ChatGPT answer is A.
