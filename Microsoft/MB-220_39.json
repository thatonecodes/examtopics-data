Each room booking links an event-registration record (and its associated contact) to a hotel room allocation set up in Dynamics 365 Marketing. Each room allocation represents a block of rooms of a specific type (single, double, or suite) at a specific hotel during a specific event. After all the rooms in an allocation are booked, that allocation is considered sold out unless you can request more from that hotel.

General overview -\n\nYou are working at the non-profit foundation as one of the Microsoft Power Platform consultants in their Global and European Area Office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nThe foundation's vision is to “Engage in a digital habi-verse.” Their idea is to reach out to the public, in particular the younger generation, by immersing animals and habitats in the digital metaverse.\n\nTheir goal is to connect and create awareness of actual non-digital wildlife.\n\n\nOverview. Organization -\n\nHeadquartered in Amsterdam, the foundation has national offices all around the world.\n\nAll the national offices are responsible for fundraising, as well as establishing a local donor, ambassador, and volunteer community. The foundation s headquarters (HQ) supports the national offices with IT platforms and templates. HQ also provides services around finance, customer service, and marketing.\n\nFunds are allocated to metaverse initiatives selected by HQ or donated to other supporting programs and causes.\n\nExamples of recently supported programs:\n\n• Funded an initiative from a fitness app to introduce animals to their in-app fitness challenges. Runners could compare their times to different animals or do a “live\" sprint or activity against them.\n• Supported a Roblox gaming project where a wildlife sanctuary was digitally duplicated. With actual animals being tracked, gamers can see their digital avatars move around the digital sanctuary in real -time, and make donations through the Robux digital currency.\n\n\nOverview. IT environment -\n\nThe foundation relies on Microsoft technologies throughout their organization. The foundation uses Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit, that is predominantly based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform.\n\nAlthough the foundation limits customizations and relies on standard functionality, there are some relevant configurations:\n• Dynamics 365 is extended with the Microsoft Common Data Model for Nonprofits.\n• Unless otherwise stated, no customizations have been made to forms or views.\n• The foundation prefers to not create new workflows or additional automated processes.\n• There is an integration with their finance solution. For this, many entities require a mandatory Cost Center allocation field. These entities include events, campaigns, and donor commitments.\n• All countries/regions and offices work within the same Dynamics 365 tenant and environment. To secure and segregate data, business unit hierarchies and security roles are configured.\n\nThe Dynamics 365 Marketing module is used for journey orchestration and engagement to send email, SMS, and push messages.\n• Microsoft Power Pages is used for the foundation's online volunteer and event portals.\n• For SMS messaging, Twilio has been configured as a SMS provider in Dynamics 365 Marketing.\n• Business Process flows are used for events, campaigns, opportunities and leads. To ensure a good user experience, mandatory fields for creation should be part of the first process step.\n• There are numerous processes automated through Power Automate. For example: o All new users are created as contacts. o Submitted form information is copied and registered on master entities. o Task activities can be created from real-time campaigns for employees.\n\nNew initiative and scenario. Background information\n\nThe foundation has set up a basic event template and configuration to support national initiatives. As part of the event process, each event uses individual segment-based journeys for inviting audiences. Common actions such as registrations and check-ins use a single journey per default Marketing trigger.\n\nThe foundation s newest initiative is to use outdoor music festivals to create awareness and attract new donors and volunteers. For these large complex events, the management and coordination of the events will initially be done by a dedicated HQ team.\n\nThe goal is to have a large presence in public spaces where people are engaged with examples of supported projects, compelling speaker sessions, and silent virtual reality (VR) disco. The music from the stages can be heard and experienced in a virtual, wildlife-packed rainforest. At the physical event location, visitors can use Microsoft Power Apps to donate and join the community.\n\nYou need to support the new event scrum team as a scrum developer. The foundation recently completed its first pilot event at a large outdoor music festival in Amsterdam.\n\nTogether with the team, you are reviewing the results as you prepare for the next festival in Buenos Aires, Brazil.\n\nNew initiative and scenario. Event design principles\n\nSet up and design principles for new events are as follows:\n• Event management and engagement is conducted through the real-time marketing module in Dynamics 365 Marketing.\n• Event locations have a public area, as well as several spaces for event sessions and the silent VR disco.\n• To further promote the foundation and the event, VIPs are invited with the request to share and create social content. The invited VIPs are already linked ambassadors (constituents), but the foundation wants to expand their ambassador base through these events. VIPs will receive special event passes.\n• The event team consists of the foundation's employees, as well as volunteers. Their role is to facilitate the event, supply information, convert donations, and check people in during the sessions.\n• All national constituents of the event location are invited through an initial segment-based journey.\n• The content of all touchpoints must be engaging and include its own branding. A creative agency supported the foundation with custom HTML designs for templates according to the Dynamics 365 Marketing design principles.\n• Senior marketeers want to be included in the invitation journeys, but segments that include them have yet to be created.\n• Leads should be created from the event registrations.\n• Post-event surveys are sent out to registered and checked-in constituents that gave permission during the registration.\n\n\nIssues and requests -\n\nDuring the Amsterdam event retrospective, the team received the following feedback:\n• Content designers were unable to use the drag and drop editor of the imported emails.\n• Senior marketeers did not receive event invitations.\n• All registered contacts received a post-event experience survey invitation, even if they were not checked in at the event.\n• Registered contacts received two different confirmation emails.\n• When creating the event(s). the cost center field is mandatory, but difficult to find on the event form.\n\nFor the Buenos Aires event, the foundation decided to add some new design principles:\n• To raise funds, a contribution will be charged for session packages and the silent VR disco.\n• National ambassadors should receive a special SMS invitation to receive free VIP access to the sessions and silent VR disco.\n• Event team members must be onboarded through a Dynamics 365 Marketing journey.\n\n\nA new volunteer is joining the Buenos Aires event team as an onsite event coordinator.\n\nYou need to add this volunteer to the event team.\n\nWhat do you do?","timestamp":"2024-04-08 23:11:00","answer_images":[],"topic":"7","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Associate the User record with the event through the Event Team N:N relationship.","B":"Create a Team Member Record for a User record and associate this to the event","C":"Create a Team Member Record for a Contact record and associate this to the event.","D":"Associate the Contact record with the event through the Event Team N:N relationship."},"question_id":192,"exam_id":76,"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1191840","timestamp":"1728421860.0","content":"\"• The event team consists of the foundation's employees, as well as volunteers.\" volunteers are not on the payroll, no employees.\nC.
