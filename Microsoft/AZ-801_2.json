NTLMv2: NTLMv2 is an authentication protocol that is used for authentication between client and server, but it does not provide encryption. Additionally, NTLMv2 is susceptible to various attacks and has known vulnerabilities.\n\nB. Pre-shared key: Pre-shared key authentication involves sharing a secret key between two devices. While this method provides some level of authentication and encryption, it has some disadvantages such as the difficulty of managing and distributing keys in large environments.\n\nC.
