Your Brother has tested this in the lab for all of you. The correct Answer is Y,N,N. \n\nDoes the policy 'Append a tag and its value to resources' enforces the tags to Resource Groups ?The answer is No. But it does apply the Tags through policies to resources when you create or update (e.g. applying another tag directly ) the resource. But not Resource Groups, even after creating or updating the Resource group.\n\nMS document also supports this. \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-policies\nAppend a tag and its value to resources Appends the specified tag and value when any resource which is missing this tag is created or updated. Does not modify the tags of resources created before this policy was applied until those resources are changed. Does not apply to resource groups. New 'modify' effect policies are available that support remediation of tags on existing resources (see https://aka.ms/modifydoc).","poster":"Babustest","upvote_count":"13","comment_id":"1025830","comments":[{"content":"Thanks I was so convinced answer to Q1 should be Yes, so good to have confirmation","timestamp":"1702748460.0","poster":"Indy429","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1098360"}]},{"poster":"Babustest","content":"Y, N, N \nIn the case of resource groups, if you enforce a policy that requires a specific tag and value on resource groups, existing resource groups will be evaluated for compliance.
