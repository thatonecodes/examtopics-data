The range index type is used for:\nEquality queries:\nSELECT * FROM container c WHERE c.property = 'value'\nSELECT * FROM c WHERE c.property IN (\"value1\", \"value2\", \"value3\")\nNote:\nThe con-product container stores the company's product catalog data. Each document in con-product includes a con-productvendor value. Most queries targeting the data in con-product are in the following format.\nSELECT * FROM con-product p WHERE p.con-productVendor - 'name'\nBox 2: Composite in creditRating and yearFounded\nComposite indexes increase the efficiency when you are performing operations on multiple fields. The composite index type is used for:\nORDER BY queries on multiple properties:\nSELECT * FROM container c ORDER BY c.property1, c.property2\nNote: Most queries targeting the data in the con-productVendor container are in the following format\nSELECT * FROM con-productVendor pv\nORDER BY pv.creditRating, pv.yearFounded\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/index-overview","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/113428-exam-dp-420-topic-8-question-3-discussion/","answer":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04276/0009600001.png"],"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-06-27 20:15:00"}],"exam":{"id":69,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":147,"name":"DP-420","isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Microsoft"},"currentPage":30},"__N_SSP":true}
