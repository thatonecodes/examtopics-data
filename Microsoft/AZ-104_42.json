Based on that, in order for rule1 to apply to any given blob, the blob would need to have a prefix of Dep1/. The first blob does not have said prefix, it's just that it's name starts with Dep1 which is different from the Dep1/ prefix that creates the folder. For the first question to be NO as everyone says, Dep1File1.txt blob would need to have a prefix of Dep1/ meaning, Dep1/Dep1File1.txt.
