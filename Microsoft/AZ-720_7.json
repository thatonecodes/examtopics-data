Deploy a private endpoint for SQL1.\n\nA private endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link.

Each environment is located in a different virtual network (VNet).\nThe company has a perimeter network that supports connections to the internet. The perimeter network is also hosted in a separate VNet. All of the VNets are connected by using virtual network peering.\n//IMG//\n\n\nVirtual machines -\nThe company's subscription contains the following Azure virtual machines (VMs):\n//IMG//\n\nThe Web Server (IIS) role is installed on VM4. The operating system firewall for each VM allows inbound ping requests.\n\nNetwork security groups -\nThe company's subscription includes the following network security groups (NSGs):\n//IMG//\n\n\nSecurity rules -\nNSG1, NSG2, NSGS, and NSG5 use the default inbound security rules. NSG4, NSG5, and NSG10 use the default outbound security rules.\nNSG4 has the following inbound security rule:\n//IMG//\n\nNSG10 has the following inbound security rules:\n//IMG//\n\n\nVirtual network peering -\nThe virtual network peering connections are in the following table:\n//IMG//\n\n\nVirtual network gateway -\nA virtual network gateway named VNetGW is provisioned in the perimeter network.
