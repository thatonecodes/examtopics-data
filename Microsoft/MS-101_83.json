You would not catch SSN instances. It's unclear if this is desirable.\nIf you change the AND to and OR you would get positives for both instances. So catch instances with either SSN or medical information.\nTo reduce the possibility or a false positive for medical information, you would increase the min match possibility. This would increase the criteria for matching information identified as medical terms and information. Lower it and you would catch more but it would be a less accurate match.
