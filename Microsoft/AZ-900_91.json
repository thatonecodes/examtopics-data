No\nThe solution does not meet the goal. Creating several Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directories would separate the Azure resources into different environments, but it would also increase administrative effort and complexity. Each Azure AD directory would require separate management and administration, leading to duplication of efforts and potential challenges in maintaining consistency across divisions.\nA more appropriate solution to meet the goal of segmenting Azure for divisions while minimizing administrative effort would be to use Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and resource groups. By leveraging Azure RBAC, you can assign division-specific administrators with appropriate access permissions to manage the Azure resources within their respective resource groups.

No\n\nCreating multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directories for each division is not the most suitable solution for achieving segmentation of Azure resources for divisions. While it's technically possible to have separate Azure AD directories for different divisions, this approach can lead to increased administrative complexity and additional management overhead. Managing multiple directories could require more effort and potentially result in a less cohesive and efficient setup.\n\nA more suitable solution would involve using Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate permissions to administrators within a single Azure AD directory.

This enables you to have a standby environment in Azure, ready to take over in case your primary site or infrastructure experiences a failure.

Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.\n\nBox 2:\nSoftware as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools\n(such as Microsoft Office 365).\nSaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located in the service provider's data center.
