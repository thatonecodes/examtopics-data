It highlights gaps in the testing and quality assurance phases, resulting in defects being discovered externally by customers.\nThis metric is specifically used to evaluate the effectiveness of internal quality control.

A high defect escape rate indicates that many bugs are slipping through the testing phase and being found by customers.\nScenario 2: It takes a long time to detect failures\n\nMean time to detection (MTTD): This metric measures the average time it takes from when a failure occurs to when it is detected by the team.
