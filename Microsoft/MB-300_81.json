The company is known for its customer-friendly policies.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n• Alpine Ski House currently has an outdated accounting system that is not connected to the New York warehouse.\n• The warehouse system contains inventory quantities, but does not have costing, therefore the FIFO principles are applied through spreadsheet calculations at month end.\n• Alpine Ski House has worked to create a future state roadmap as a foundation for growth.

They are expecting to implement required devices for warehouse applications to support WMS only.\n• The customer service center places phone orders on behalf of wholesalers and retailers.\n• The customer service team provides concierge services to the top 20 largest customers. Each customer service team member is assigned to 5 customers as the customer's dedicated customer service representative.\n• The call center has a phone system that records calls and stores the call duration.\n• Data is a combination of systems that are disconnected to include warehouse and accounting. Customer records and consumer records are stored in the call center third-party system. Excel spreadsheets are used for consolidated reporting from these systems.\n• Alpine Ski House must enable business partners to place their own B2B orders on the web as well as manage their own users.\n• The company has decided to expand distribution to Banff, Alberta and create a new operating legal entity in Canada.

All current and future orders must be migrated to the new system.\n• Master data for customers must be migrated from both the call center third-party system as well as the accounting system. You identify the following requirements:\no The mapping fields for customer records in both systems are the same, except the accounting system which has three additional fields that must be mapped.\no Duplicate records must not be imported.\n• Cutover plan\no User1 reports that sales orders will be open and not shipped at the time of cutover to production. There are 20 orders expected to be open.\n\n\nCustomer service\n-\n\n\nGeneral\n-\n\n• Concierge customer service reps must be able to access customer records for all customers in their customer group.\n• Customer service reps must be able organize how information is presented when they sign into the new system.\n• Security must be applied to the customer service reps as a group and must not be applied at the individual level.\n\n\nReturn policies\n-\n\n• Sporting equipment is warranted by the manufacturer and must not be returned to Alpine Ski House warehouse. Alpine Ski House does not strictly enforce this policy. Exceptions to the policy are allowed with manager approval.\n• Customer service must track reported issues with sporting equipment to identify trends.\n• Customers can exchange apparel, but refunds must not be permitted. Any consumer exchanges must occur directly through Alpine's call center and cannot be returned to a physical store.\n\n\nExchange policies\n-\n\n• All consumer calls must be logged for tracking purposes. The customer service representative will determine if there is an exchange, or if the consumer should be redirected to the manufacturer. Digital content is final sale only. All complaints must still be tracked.\n• Returns and replacement orders must be processed through the warehouse. Consumer information for returns and replacement orders does not need to be stored.\n• A record of the location where the consumer purchased the product must be stored for tracking purpose\n• The customer service reps must be able to view the order status for delayed shipments or orders that have been shipped but not invoiced. They need to have shortcuts to view this information.\n• Returns or credits for a concierge customer that are not from a consumer do not require notifications to the concierge representative.\n• Web orders must be limited to B2B, and consumers web access must not be required for order placement.\n• The call center must track the call minutes in the phone system by customer number.\n• The system must send the following notifications:\no Dedicated concierge representative must be automatically notified when an exchanged product has shipped. The concierge representative must set up the alert.\no External customers must be notified of the new consumer exchanges. The notification must integrate into the customer's third party dashboard and must not be sent as an email notification.\n\n\nCustomer Service\n-\n\n• The customer service center is overloaded with frequently asked questions (FAQ's) that are consuming resources and creating issues with customer service levels.\n• Alpine Ski House has decided to deploy an automated FAQ website because they do not have sufficient staff resources to manage customer interactions. All automated interactions must be stored for 30 days.\n• The company has decided to extend its concierge program to the top 25 customers. A new representative has been hired and requires the same screen layout as other team members.\n• When new customers are created in the system, the customer number must automatically pass to the call center phone system.\n\n\nImplementation\n-\n\n• The implementation is expected to take 12 months. Alpine Ski House wants to ensure that when they go live, they are on the most current available update of Dynamics 365. Testing must occur in the various stages of the implementation. You identify the following testing requirements:\no Platform updates will be applied, and business processes will be verified to perform as expected, either manual or automated where possible against stored task recordings.\no Development must be completed by the 10th month. Developers must perform initial testing code that they create.\no When development is completed, all processes in the system must be tested by the user group.\n• Due to competing demands for the project team, the company wants to automate as much of the testing as possible.\n• The project manager is concerned that a critical field must have validation scripts run against it during automated testing. The developers will be required to write the custom validation scrip. The user creating the test script must document the step in the test script that the specific validation script must be run for the developers.\n• The project manager wants to put a control in place to ensure that once the automated testing is established the test scripts are not modified or overwritten.\n\n\nYou need to determine the testing types required for implementation activities.\n\nWhich testing type should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","question_id":401,"exam_id":80,"topic":"5","answer_description":"","isMC":false,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-300/image36.png"],"answer_ET":"","answer":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/131225-exam-mb-300-topic-5-question-93-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-01-15 05:16:00","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-300/image37.png"]},{"id":"sEk5p9ckD191zm9uR3Mi","answer":"","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-12-17 11:09:00","answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04278/0010700001.png"],"isMC":false,"discussion":[{"content":"Will get it Notification as well right?","comment_id":"246362","timestamp":"1608199740.0","upvote_count":"8","poster":"gettysangeeth"},{"poster":"Backoffice","content":"Search for any of the following:\n- A hotfix KB number\n- A word or phrase.
