As a budget plan moves through its workflow, automated tasks can invoke an allocation at a specified budget planning stage.\n\nTo set up automated allocation, you must first create an allocation schedule on the Budget planning configuration page. The allocation schedule defines the allocation method that will be used when the automated allocation is run, and the values of the various allocation options (see the previous section for descriptions).\n\nNext, you create a stage allocation on the Budget planning configuration page. The stage allocation assigns an allocation schedule to the budget planning workflow and stage.\n\nFinally, add an automated task for budget planning stage allocation at the desired workflow stage. In the following example, two budget planning stage allocations (outlined in red) have been inserted into the workflow.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1722436080.0"},{"timestamp":"1711106940.0","comment_id":"846996","content":"Correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bisera"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"575530","timestamp":"1679826540.0","content":"Correct \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/budgeting/budget-planning-data-allocation","poster":"cebaud"},{"comment_id":"280487","content":"CORRECT","poster":"sadiq_d365","timestamp":"1643626260.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_ET":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou are creating a budget for an organization.\nThe organization requires that allocations be performed automatically as part of budget planning.\nYou need to invoke allocations at a specific budget planning stage.\nWhich three actions should you perform in sequence?
