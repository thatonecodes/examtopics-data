By installing the app and subscribing to the desired events, you can receive notifications directly in your Teams channel without the need for additional development effort.\n\nB and D may work as well, but they would require additional development effort to implement a custom solution.

Also, there is nothing in the requirements to make sure to create a resource group if it doesn't exist.\n\nThe only difference between the top two is exactly that creation part:\n\"Create or Update Resource Group\": Creates the resource group if it doesn't already exist.\n\"Select Resource Group\": Assumes the resource group already exists and will fail if it doesn't.\n\nThat's the only difference!
