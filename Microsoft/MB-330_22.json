Set the customer default to Warehouse2 and the item default order settings to Warehouse1 is the best choice. Here’s why:\nItem Default (Warehouse1): Reflects where the item is \"usually stocked,\" setting Warehouse1 as the default for inventory and procurement. This aligns with the company’s standard practice.\nCustomer Default (Warehouse2): Overrides the item default for this customer’s sales orders, ensuring shipments come from Warehouse2 as requested.

Set up customer default warehouse to 2, that makes sense.\n2. However, \"item default order settings to warehouse 1\" is trickier.\n3. This is a single legal entity so there will be no intercompany POs / SOs.\n4. On the item's default order settings, you can specify they default warehouse as 1, but all that will do is, for your purchase order / production order, generate 1 as the default warehouse.\n5. The real solution, I think, would be to set up item coverage for the item, at warehouse 2, to have a default planned order type of transfer with the \"main warehouse\" (the transfer warehouse). \n6. This would, upon creation of the customer sales order at wh 2, trigger a planned transfer order from wh 1 to wh 2. \n\nOn reflection, my ideal answer would be \"Set the customer default to Warehouse2 and the item planned order type at warehouse2, to be transfer order from main warehouse, warehouse1.\" Given that that's not an option, I would probably choose (E).","timestamp":"1728828120.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"H_Incandenza","timestamp":"1727970240.0"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/122271-exam-mb-330-topic-2-question-40-discussion/"},{"id":"choSNf1tVMoaPNbPLozb","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1362466","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFinancial negative inventory – If this option is selected the system will allow financial inventory to go negative.
