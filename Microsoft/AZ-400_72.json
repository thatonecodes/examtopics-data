You can configure the File System Agent plug-in to scan only the Package.json files of your Node.js projects, and ignore the Package-lock.json and Npm-shrinkwrap.json files. This way, you will minimize the number of libraries reported by WhiteSource to only the libraries that you explicitly reference in the Package.json files.\n\nB. Adding a devDependencies section to Package-lock.json will not work, because the Package-lock.json file is automatically generated by npm and should not be manually edited. The devDependencies section in Package-lock.json reflects the devDependencies from the Package.json file of the dependency, not the project.\n\n\nSource: Bing AI :)","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"GPT: Adding a devDependencies section to the package.json file in order to run npm install --omit-dev is a valid approach for reducing the size of the installed packages and the time it takes to install them, but it is not the correct solution for minimizing the number of libraries reports by WhiteSource to only the libraries that you explicitly reference.\n\nThe devDependencies section in package.json is used to specify the packages that are only required for development and testing, and not for the production use of the project. By default, the npm install command installs all dependencies, including those specified in devDependencies.\n\nHowever, by running npm install --omit-dev, you can exclude the packages listed in devDependencies from being installed.
