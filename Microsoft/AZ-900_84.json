Internal network is your on-premise network (switches, routers etc..) which is connecting server. By offloading some compute to cloud it does nothing to capacity your network actually does nothign to your network at all. Your network has fixed capacity whether is used or not. So first logical answer is NO, cloud cannot affect capacity of your local network in any way.\n\nBut it's getting tricky when taking in account EexpresRoutes and VPN connections. Those basically connects your inmternal network with Cloud. And now one needs to define whether Cloud netowork will become your internal netowrk or not. It's matter of wording.

The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud.\n\nIn a public cloud, you share the same hardware, storage and network devices with other organisations or cloud “tenants”, and you access services and manage your account using a web browser.
