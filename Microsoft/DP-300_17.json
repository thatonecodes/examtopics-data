Plus, if you're just getting started with Azure SQL Database, the DTU model offers more options at the lower end of performance, so you can get started at a lower price point than with vCore.\nBox 2: An Azure SQL database elastic pool\nAzure SQL Database elastic pools are a simple, cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases that have varying and unpredictable usage demands.

The table will be approximately 5 GB.\nA round-robin table is the most straightforward table to create and delivers fast performance when used as a staging table for loads.
