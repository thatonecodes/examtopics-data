Conditional Access is designed exactly for “only let these users sign in from these networks” with minimal overhead.","comment_id":"1344747"},{"timestamp":"1731011340.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Correct answer is B. They have a site to site VPN configured, first point. Therefore we need to restrict access via private IP range.
