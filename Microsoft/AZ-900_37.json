The Azure Active Directory Connect synchronization services (Azure AD Connect sync) is a main component of Azure AD Connect. It takes care of all the operations that are related to synchronize identity data between your on-premises environment and\nAzure AD.\n\nBox 2: Yes -\nAs described above, third-party cloud services and on-premises Active Directory can be used to access Azure resources. This is known as 'federation'.\nFederation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. A typical federation might include a number of organizations that have established trust for shared access to a set of resources.\n\nBox 3: Yes -\nAzure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a centralized identity provider in the cloud. This is the primary built-in authentication and authorization service to provide secure access to Azure resources.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-fed https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nFor each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true.
