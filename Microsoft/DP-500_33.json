Configure a scheduled refresh.\nTo refresh data from the source every 15 minutes, you need to configure a scheduled refresh for your Power BI data model. The scheduled refresh setting allows you to define how often the data should be refreshed from the source, and you can set the frequency to as low as 15 minutes.\nOption B, changing the storage mode of the dataset, is not relevant to the issue of refreshing the data from the source every 15 minutes.\nOption C, enabling the XMLA endpoint, is not necessary to refresh the data from the source every 15 minutes.\nOption D, defining an incremental refresh policy, is not necessary to refresh the data from the source every 15 minutes.

Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam.

Currently, the customers can access all the data.\nContoso has one Power BI workspace named FinData that contains a single dataset. The dataset contains financial data from around the world. The workspace is used by 10 internal users and one external customer. The dataset has the following two data sources: the data warehouse and the Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool.\nUsers frequently query the Synapse Analytics workspace by using Transact-SQL.\n\nUser Problems -\nContoso identifies the following user issues:\nSome users indicate that the visuals in Power BI reports are slow to render when making filter selections.\nUsers indicate that queries against the serverless SQL pool fail occasionally because the size of tempdb has been exceeded.\nUsers indicate that the data in Power BI reports is stale. You discover that the refresh process of the Power BI model occasionally times out.\n\nPlanned Changes -\nContoso plans to implement the following changes:\nInto the existing Power BI dataset, integrate an external data source in JSON that is accessible by using the REST API.\nBuild a new dataset in the FinData workspace by using data from the Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool.\nProvide all the customers with their own Power BI workspace to create their own reports. Each workspace will use the new dataset in the FinData workspace.\nImplement subscription levels for the customers. Each subscription level will provide access to specific rows of financial data.\nDeploy prebuilt datasets to Power BI to simplify the query experience of the customers.\nProvide internal users with the ability to incorporate machine learning models loaded to the dedicated SQL pool.\nYou need to build a Transact-SQL query to implement the planned changes for the internal users.\nHow should you complete the Transact-SQL query?
