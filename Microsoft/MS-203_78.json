Alex Wilber is in Group1.\n\nBox 2: No -\nMegan Bowen is in Group2. The Safe Attachments 2 policy applies to Group2. The Safe Attachments 2 policy will block the email rather then remove the attachment and deliver the email.\n\nBox 3: No -\nLynne Robbins is in the Sales department which means she is a member of Group3. She is also a member of Group2 and Group4.\nThe Safe Attachments 2 policy blocks emails and applies to Group2. There are no other Safe Attachments policies that apply to Group3 or Group4. Therefore,\nSafe Attachments 2 is the only policy that applies to Lynne Robbins so you do not need to increase the priority of the policy to block the emails.","answers_community":[],"topic":"6","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04329/0048400001.png"],"isMC":false},{"id":"sLJGKLQTm2OZDsQ9xWpf","exam_id":103,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","topic":"7","unix_timestamp":1697433480,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/123734-exam-ms-203-topic-7-question-1-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which contacts can sign in to and access resources in the adatum.com tenant?","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1733515020.0","comment_id":"1089727","content":"D is correct","poster":"Amir1909","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1729055880.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1044678","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect.
