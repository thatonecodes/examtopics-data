A\nSometimes your model logic is complex and there are several source files that your model loads on inference time. This would be the case when you have a Python library for your model for instance. In this scenario, you want to package the library all along with your model so it can move as a single piece.\n\nUse this method when:\n\n Your model can't be serialized in Pickle format or there is a better format available for that.\n Your model artifacts can be stored in a folder where all the requiered artifacts are placed.\n Your model source code is complex and it requires multiple Python files. Potentially, there is a library that supports your model.\n You want to customize the way the model is loaded and how the predict function works.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-log-mlflow-models?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=loader"}]}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":512,"provider":"Microsoft","id":64,"name":"DP-100","isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":84},"__N_SSP":true}
