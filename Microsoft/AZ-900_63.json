This is achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms. If a component fails, the system can automatically switch to a backup component. This provides a continuous user experience, which is what the question is asking for.\n\nDisaster Recovery, on the other hand, is about restoring a system after a major incident or disaster that causes a significant system outage. This could involve restoring from backups, switching to a disaster recovery site, etc. This process may not be immediate and could result in some downtime.\n\nSo, in the context of providing a continuous user experience in the event of a resource failure, High Availability is the correct answer.","comment_id":"1246616"},{"content":"answer is correct \nkeyword is provide continu so thats HA \ndisaster recovery is by failure recovering data, vm etc..","comment_id":"769512","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1673187900.0","poster":"azirila"},{"comment_id":"769074","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"comment_id":"773605","upvote_count":"2","poster":"zellck","timestamp":"1673535300.0","content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-benefits-use-cloud-services/2-high-availability-scalability-cloud\n\nHigh availability\nWhen youâ€™re deploying an application, a service, or any IT resources, itâ€™s important the resources are available when needed.
