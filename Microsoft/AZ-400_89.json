Once the application is signed off for release, only a few users are routed to it. This minimizes any impact.\nWith no errors reported, the new version can gradually roll out to the rest of the infrastructure.\nApp2: Rolling deployment:\nIn a rolling deployment, an application's new version gradually replaces the old one. The actual deployment happens over a period of time. During that time, new and old versions will coexist without affecting functionality or user experience. This process makes it easier to roll back any new component incompatible with the old components.\nIncorrect Answers:\n\nBlue/Green deployment -\nA blue/green deployment is a change management strategy for releasing software code. Blue/green deployments, which may also be referred to as A/B deployments require two identical hardware environments that are configured exactly the same way. While one environment is active and serving end users, the other environment remains idle.\nBlue/green deployments are often used for consumer-facing applications and applications with critical uptime requirements. New code is released to the inactive environment, where it is thoroughly tested. Once the code has been vetted, the team makes the idle environment active, typically by adjusting a router configuration to redirect application program traffic. The process reverses when the next software iteration is ready for release.\nReference:\nhttps://dev.to/mostlyjason/intro-to-deployment-strategies-blue-green-canary-and-more-3a3","discussion":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"576604","content":"agree with you","timestamp":"1664338200.0","poster":"rdemontis","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"89879","timestamp":"1605530280.0","content":"I think it should be this like Tos0 said, can anyone please confirm \nApp 1 - Canary\nApp 2 - Blue/Green","poster":"Yogothegreat","upvote_count":"6"},{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"69191","upvote_count":"4","content":"The answer is Canary and Rolling upgrade since rolling upgrade allows faster release .
