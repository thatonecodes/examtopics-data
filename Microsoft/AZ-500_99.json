Explanation below.\n\n\"If you create a private endpoint for the Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage resource, then you should also create one for the Blob Storage resource. That's because operations that target the Data Lake Storage Gen2 endpoint might be redirected to the Blob endpoint. Similarly, if you add a private endpoint for Blob Storage only, and not for Data Lake Storage Gen2, some operations (such as Manage ACL, Create Directory, Delete Directory, etc.) will fail since the Gen2 APIs require a DFS private endpoint. By creating a private endpoint for both resources, you ensure that all operations can complete successfully.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-private-endpoints"},{"timestamp":"1738772400.0","comment_id":"1351964","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. 1\n\nExplanation:\nAzure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) is built on Azure Blob Storage, and when configuring private endpoints for secure access, you only need one private endpoint per storage service type (Blob or DFS).\nSince App1 needs access to Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen2) to perform Read, List, Create Directory, and Delete Directory operations, it will use the Azure Data Lake Storage hierarchical namespace (HNS), which operates over the Azure Data Lake Storage (DFS) endpoint\nThe minimum requirement for private access to an ADLS Gen2 storage account is one private endpoint for the DFS endpoint (<storage_account>.dfs.core.windows.net).\nThis endpoint allows access to both Blob Storage and Data Lake Storage Gen2 APIs.","poster":"golitech"}],"answer":"B","exam_id":56,"question_id":491,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (79%)","A (21%)"],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1711894680,"timestamp":"2024-03-31 16:18:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/137600-exam-az-500-topic-7-question-12-discussion/","question_text":"You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure Data Lake Storage account named sa1.\n\nYou plan to deploy an app named App1 that will access sa1 and perform operations, including Read, List, Create Directory, and Delete Directory.\n\nYou need to ensure that App1 can connect securely to sa1 by using a private endpoint.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of private endpoints required for sa1?","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"3","D":"4","E":"5","B":"2","A":"1"},"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","topic":"7"},{"id":"JYqYTlax54BRbzobG9Dg","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-09-07 09:24:00","isMC":true,"exam_id":56,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ITFranz","comment_id":"1364076","timestamp":"1740939780.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTo support the answer:\nuse Microsoft Defender for open-source relational databases to ensure that an email alert is triggered when a suspected brute force attack on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance is detected.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for open-source relational databases is designed to detect anomalous activities, including brute force attacks, on databases such as PostgreSQL5.
