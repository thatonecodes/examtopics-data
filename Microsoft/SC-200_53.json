So containment is a general term that can include different actions. The most obvious one would be the 'isolation' mode from Defender. This said you can isolate onboarded and non onboarded machines alike. One via the defender AV on the device blade and a couple of other places, the other one via the device inventory for non on-boarded devices. It cause a GPO to be sent to every onboarded machines that pushes a firewall run blocking incoming & outgoing access to the compromise not onboarded device, even if it changes its IP.
