Azure Key Vault\n\nExplanation:\nAzure Key Vault is designed to securely store and manage sensitive information such as secrets, keys, and certificates. By integrating Azure Key Vault with an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template:\n\nCredentials and connection strings can be stored securely in Key Vault.\nThe ARM template can reference the secrets stored in Key Vault without exposing them to the user performing the deployment.\nThis approach adheres to security best practices by keeping sensitive data out of templates or parameter files.","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"507101b","content":"Had this question in my exam today.
