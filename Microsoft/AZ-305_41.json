In this scenario, the client queries for the private endpoint IP address to the Azure-provided DNS service 168.63.129.16. Azure DNS will be responsible for DNS resolution of the private DNS zones.\nThe following screenshot illustrates the DNS resolution sequence from virtual network workloads using the private DNS zone:\n\nBox 2: Forward contoso.com to VM1\nForward to the DNS server VM1.\nNote: You can use the following options to configure your DNS settings for private endpoints:\n* Use the host file (only recommended for testing). You can use the host file on a virtual machine to override the DNS.\n* Use a private DNS zone. You can use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone can be linked to your virtual network to resolve specific domains.\n* Use your DNS forwarder (optional). You can use your DNS forwarder to override the DNS resolution for a private link resource.

The socket IP address is the address of the client that initiated the TCP connection to Front Door. Typically, the socket IP address is the IP address of the user, but it might also be the IP address of a proxy server or another device that sits between the user and Front Door. By using the web application firewall (WAF) with Azure Front Door, you can mitigate some types of denial of service attacks. Rate limiting also protects you against clients that have accidentally been misconfigured to send large volumes of requests in a short time period.\n\nRate limits are applied at the socket IP address level. If you have multiple clients accessing your Front Door from different socket IP addresses, they'll each have their own rate limits applied. The socket IP address is the source IP address WAF sees.
