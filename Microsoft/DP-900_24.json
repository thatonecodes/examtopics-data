For example, if you have a table for customers, a table for orders, and a table for order details, to get all the information for a single order, you need to read data from all three tables.\nWhen writing data to a fully normalized database, you may need to write data to multiple tables to ensure that the data is in a consistent state. For example, when inserting a new order, you need to insert the data in the order table, the order details table and the customers table.\n\nIn summary, in a fully normalized database, data is read from multiple tables and written to multiple tables for a single entity. This ensures that data is stored in a way that minimizes data redundancy and improves data integrity.","poster":"Stuurwiel1","comments":[{"poster":"_lene_","content":"I agree - if we want to add an entity, say a new order, we would need to update several tables","timestamp":"1676488020.0","comment_id":"809867","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"poster":"Zaiky","comment_id":"738064","upvote_count":"3","content":"In exam 07/12/22.

In a fully normalized database the number of the tables is significant and the down side here is that the performance deteriorates (both read and write performance). In other words: SELECTs require a lot of JOINs, and INSERTs involve a lot of tables. Therefore, for me the answer is A.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Minimize_redesign_when_extending_the_database_structure\nhttps://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-normalization","timestamp":"1666184340.0","comment_id":"699047","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1665661920.0","poster":"urielramoss","comment_id":"693858","content":"B makes more sense.\nFor sure you can read from multiple tables using JOIN but the part of the question that mentions \"single entity\" suggests that the answer is B.","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"JA2018","timestamp":"1665128820.0","comment_id":"688433","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD makes more sense for this question"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"memzo10","comment_id":"687021","timestamp":"1664986380.0","content":"If its a single entity, then doesn't that mean all the information for that entity would be one table?
