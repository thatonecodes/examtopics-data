Password hash synchronization and password protection in Azure AD are two different features that serve different purposes. Password hash synchronization allows users to sign in to Microsoft 365 services using the same password as their on-premises Active Directory account, but it does not provide any backup or failover mechanism if Active Directory becomes unavailable. Password protection helps to enforce strong passwords by blocking common or weak terms, but it does not affect the length of the passwords. To meet the goal, you need to implement a different solution, such as Azure AD Connect Health with AD FS or Pass-through Authentication, and configure a password policy in Active Directory that requires passwords to be 10 characters or more.","poster":"shubu2276","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1131990","timestamp":"1706210520.0"},{"poster":"Christianbrivio1991","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect Answer B","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1077478","timestamp":"1700666100.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1077170","timestamp":"1700645100.0","content":"Answer is YES!
