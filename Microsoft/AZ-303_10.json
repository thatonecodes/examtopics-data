Explanation: I think the wording could be better. You have to look at the availability of 1/2 together, 3/4 together, and 5/6 together. The SLA is saying that you will have connectivity to at least 1 of those instance - that's why they say VM1, VM3, VM5 is eligible. Look at it this way. Say it's two instances of a web server (1/2), two instances of an app server (3/4) and two instances of a db server (5/6). They don't have to be replicas or sync'd in anyway - they are independent but we're looking at the connectivity / availability to one or the other using probability. If 1/2 are in an AS - then it's 99.95% - so Yes for #1. If 3/4 are in the same AZ (same DC) and not part of an AS - then they would be 99.9 % - so No for #2. Finally 5/6 are actually split between AZ (different DC) so they would qualify for 99.99 % - So Yes for #3. The basic idea is that availability sets and splitting machine availability zones - spread machines across different fault domains and fault-isolated areas - thereby increasing the likelihood that that one VM is available.","timestamp":"1615347720.0","poster":"paulxyz90","comment_id":"306836","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1614440460.0","poster":"Ramkid","comment_id":"300331","upvote_count":"2","content":"Y/N/Y is the correct answer"},{"timestamp":"1614285780.0","content":"Please read,\n\nApart from VM1 and VM2 all other VM's are Stand Alone VM's so they're NOT eligible for a SLA of 99.99%\n\nFor all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed across two or more Availability Zones in the same Azure region, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity to at least one instance at least 99.99% of the time.\nFor all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed in the same Availability Set or in the same Dedicated Host Group, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity to at least one instance at least 99.95% of the time.\nFor any Single Instance Virtual Machine using Premium SSD or Ultra Disk for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity of at least 99.9%.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"6","poster":"awsazurelearner","content":"I agree.
