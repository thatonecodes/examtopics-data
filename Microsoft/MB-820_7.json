When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\nBackground -\nContoso, Ltd. is a sales company in the manufacturing industry. It has subsidiaries in multiple countries/regions, each with its own localization. The subsidiaries must be data-independent from each other. Contoso. Ltd. uses an external business partner to manage the subcontracting of some manufacturing items. Contoso, Ltd. has different sectors with data security between sectors required.\n\nCurrent environment -\nContoso, Ltd. uses Business Central online as the main ERP for financials, sales, purchase, warehouse, and manufacturing processes. It has employees that use the Business Central web application and external applications. The company has a custom external mobile app under development.\nThe IT department and its partners installed custom extensions to satisfy the company's requirements where the functionality is not available natively.\nContoso, Ltd. interacts with external services provided by customers and partners. Different applications interact with SOAP and OData endpoints exposed from Business Central.\nAn external business partner of Contoso, Ltd. exposed a REST API for receiving details about new subcontracting orders and for sending the planned release date of each subcontracting order received.\nContoso, Ltd. has not activated the monitoring of the tenant and has no internal telemetry for its apps.\nCustom reporting must be created to meet the requirements of the different departments.\n\nTenant management -\nContoso, Ltd. has the following tenant management considerations:\n\nIT department -\nThe IT department requires the ability to monitor the tenant to prevent performance problems and detect possible anomalies.\nThe IT department plans to use Azure Application Insights and Log Analytics to inspect the ingested telemetry signals.\nAll tenant upgrades are automatically handled by Microsoft. The IT department does not check for update availability or for tenant-related notifications.\nThe IT department has not configured the receipt of tenant-related notifications from the Business Central admin center.\n\nExternal business partner -\nThe external business partner must add custom telemetry to an application created for Contoso, Ltd. to monitor a business process.\nCustom telemetry signals for the application must be visible only on the partner's telemetry.\n\nSOAP -\nContoso, Ltd. plans to dismiss using the SOAP protocol for integrations.\nContoso, Ltd. must be able to detect if external applications are using its Business Central SOAP endpoints.\n\nIssue -\nThe Business Central tenant is upgraded by Microsoft to a new major version during the night.\nUsers report that one of the Contoso, Ltd. extensions disappeared from the tenant. The IT department confirms that the extension is still published.\nCustom mobile application requirements\nContoso, Ltd. plans to create a custom mobile application that has the following requirements:\nThe app must be used by employees to check item details from the ERP in real time and to report issues that occur during the manufacturing process.\nAn AL extension must be created for handling archived issues.\nBusiness Central development guidelines must be followed when implementing modules.\nA module must be implemented for the reporting and tracking of issues information. You plan to call this module Issue Management. The module must expose a method named PostIssue.\nCode modifications will be required over time.\nThe Issue Management process must be split into two extensions:\n\nISSUE BASE: main extension -\nISSUE EXT: second extension with dependency from ISSUE BASE\nIn the version 1.0.0.0 of the ISSUE BASE extension, you plan to create an Issue table that contains a global Decimal variable named IssueTotal.\nIn the version 1.0.0.0 of the ISSUE BASE extension, you plan to define a table named Issue Category with a Description field defined as follows:\n//IMG//\n\nThe Issue table defined in ISSUE BASE extension contains a Clone procedure defined as follows:\n//IMG//\n\nIn the ISSUE EXT extension, you create a tableextension object of the Issue table.\nThe tableextension object of the Issue table must access the IssueTotal: Decimal variable.\nAfter weeks of usage, you discover that you must remove the Description field and the Clone procedure because they are no longer required.\nIn a new version of the ISSUE BASE extension, you create a new Issue Type table. You must move data row by row from a previously obsolete Issue Category table to the new Issue Type table. Because a large amount of data must be moved, you must write an Upgrade codeunit by using the DataTransfer object.\nThe IT department creates a custom API for exposing the custom Issue table. The API provides an action for copying an issue to a new table. The action is defined as follows:\n//IMG//\n\nContoso, Ltd. must create an API in Business Central to expose item details to the mobile application.\nThe API must have the lowest possible impact on the production environment when used during working hours.\nThe API must only support Get operations.\n\nDebugging problems -\nA user of the ISSUE BASE extension in Business Central reports a problem.\nTo debug the problem, snapshot debugging with the following configuration was activated:\n//IMG//\n\nYou discover that the debugging is not triggering.\nIntegration with business partner for subcontracting\nContoso, Ltd. must connect Business Central to the external API provided by the business partner. This will be used for the partner to send the details of new subcontracting orders to fulfill the sales demand, and for receiving the planned release date of each order sent. The integration requirements are as follows:\nThe business partner will provide a REST API secured with basic authentication. Credentials to access the API will be shared with Contoso, Ltd.\nThe API for sending subcontracting orders must be called by sending an authenticated POST request to the given endpoint.\nThe API for retrieving the order no. and planned release date of each subcontracting order responds with the following JSON:\n//IMG//\n\nEach order no. must be retrieved.\nYou need to determine why the extension does not appear in the tenant.\nWhat are two possible reasons for the disappearance?
