API keys are a common method of authentication and authorization for accessing APIs or services without requiring direct user authentication.\n- For configuring a website login that does not need encryption, you would typically use Basic authentication.

To control access to data, you can modify existing security roles, create new security roles, or change which security roles are assigned to each user. Each user can have multiple security roles.\nSecurity role privileges are cumulative: having more than one security role gives a user every privilege available in every role.\nEach security role consists of record-level privileges and task-based privileges.\n\nBox 2: OAuth -\nOauth 2.0 is the most frequently used type, which uses the Oauth 2 authentication framework to authenticate with the service. Before using this authentication type, you'll need to register your application with the service so that it can receive access tokens for the users.\nFor example, Register the application in Azure AD shows how to register an application with the Azure Active Directory service.\nDuring the connection creation process, the user will be asked to enter the credentials for login to the service. These credentials will be used by the application to get an authorization token. For every request, this authorization token will be sent to your service through the Authorization header.\n\nBox 3: Basic Authentication -\nBasic Authentication is the simplest type of authentication, where the user just has to provide the username and password to create the connection.\nNote: Before using any connector in Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Power Automate, or Microsoft Power Apps, the user needs to create a connection by authenticating to the backend service.\n\nAuthentication types -\nThe different types of authentication that are currently supported are:\n\nNo authentication -\n\nBasic authentication -\n\nApi Key based authentication -\n\nOauth 2.0 -\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/admin/security-roles-privileges https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/connection-parameters","question_id":306,"topic":"6","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/58069-exam-pl-400-topic-6-question-3-discussion/","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2021-07-17 17:15:00","answer_ET":"","unix_timestamp":1626534900,"exam_id":117,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou are creating a PowerApps connector between Dynamics 365 Sales and Slack.\nYou must generate a Slack notification whenever a new product is added to Dynamics 365 Sales.

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground -\n\nProseware, Inc. is an industry leading software company with several thousand employees. The company has had some trouble recruiting talented employees. Top-level candidates interview with the company but go on to work for competitors.\n\nFeedback from candidates show that some offers were not accepted because the interview scheduling process was unpleasant. The company does not have a system to keep track of the candidates that were not selected.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nThe recruiting process starts when an individual applies for a position on the company website. The individual may have found the position on their own, they may have been officially referred by an employee, or in some cases were contacted directly by a hiring manager and encouraged to apply.\n\nRecruiters schedule an interview with a hiring manager and interviews with two senior team members. Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.\n\nThe recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.\n\nThe company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:\n\n• JobPosting\n- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser\n• Contact (Job Applicant)\n- Contact identifier\n- First name\n- Last name\n- Time-Zone Offset\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)\n• Application proapplication\n- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- pro_recruiterassignedid\n• Interview\n- Application - lookup to Application\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value\n• Referral\n- Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n• SystemUser\n- Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Time-Zone Offset\n• Recruiter\n- Recruiter identifier\n- Recruiter name\n\n\nApplications -\nThere may be multiple applications associated with each job posting. Applications are linked to an employee record if an employee referred the applicant for a position. The same individual can be an applicant for multiple job postings.\n\n\nInterviews -\nEach interview is performed by an employee and is related to a single application.\n\nThe interview scheduling process may force potential candidates to accept interviews at unusual times with the senior team members due to time-zone differences.\n\nRequirements. Interview Scheduling\n\nThe system must provide recruiters with a list of team members and their time-zone information. You must create a Microsoft Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control for the Job Application form to display a list of senior team members who report directly to a hiring manager.\n\n• The control must display the current time in each team member's local time.\n• The control must be bound so that it minimizes the amount of code that must be written.\n• You must display the list of team members and sort the list to show team members who reside in time zones closest to the applicant's time zone first.\n\nYou must develop a second PCF control that displays the time-zone name and current time on the Job Application form. You must display the data in the candidate’s local time.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Tracking\n\nYou must create a process to identify individuals as a person of interest that the company should consider hiring. You must assign each individual a score based on their past interactions.\n\n• You must be able to determine the following information about a candidate:\n- The number of interviews in the past two years and whether team members provided recommendations\n- The number of hiring manager referrals and employee referrals in the past two years\n- Whether the individual has any of the 12 designations or certifications that the company considers significant\n• Only a single referral can be made per job application. The system must be able to support multiple referrals for a candidate.\n• The system must track referrals even if an application is not completed.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Scoring\n\nThe automated process must run weekly to assess all candidates. The process must also run automatically when historical information is updated. You must be able to perform scoring by selecting a command button on the contact form.\n\n• This new command button must only be visible to employees who belong to a security role assigned named Recruiter. The command button must not be visible to anyone unless the contact form is in Update mode.\n• A person of interest is defined as having a score of 15 or more based on the following historical information criteria:\n- Each interview with a recommendation adds two to the score.\n- Each interview without a recommendation subtracts two from the score.\n- Each employee or manager referral adds one to the score.\n- Each designation or certification adds one to the score.\n• All scoring elements must be recalculated when changes occur. You must assign the score to the Person of interest field.\n• Values representing totals or scores must be stored in their own numeric fields.\n• Plug-ins must be used to keep the Person of Interest field on active interview records associated with the Contact.\n• Plug-ins registered on the update of the Person of interest field must send an email notification when the candidate named in the email is a person of interest. Recruiters must receive the message when the field is updated on the Contact record.\n• Interviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the interview record is successfully updated.\n\n\nRequirements. Design Guidelines -\n\nThe following design guidelines must be followed:\n\n• Schema changes must be made using the method requiring the least amount of storage to meet the requirement.\n• Out-of-the-box functionality must be used when possible.\n• Any code required to calculate scores must be able to be run from a single point.\n• Email notifications need to be kept to a minimum.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• Recruiters report that the command button to score a candidate is not working. You debug the code and observe that the context input parameter is null.\n• The system does not support associating designations and certifications with candidates.\n• The value for the field used by the PCF control to display local time is saved to Microsoft Dataverse each time an active application record is opened.\n• Interviewers report that they do not receive email notifications when interview records are created for an existing person of interest.\n\n\nYou need to determine the cause for the issue reported by the interviewers.\n\nWhat is the root cause of the issue?","question_id":307,"answers_community":["B (75%)","C (25%)"],"answer":"B","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1695972720,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-29 09:32:00","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741228320.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nFor me it is B.\n\n\"Plug-ins registered on the update of the Person of interest field must send an email notification when the candidate named in the email is a person of interest.\"\n\"Interviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the interview record is successfully updated\"\n\nIt is letting you know that everything was focused on checking the \"update\", but the scenario when a NEW interview record was created and the person of interest is populated at the same time.\n\nSo, as The plug-in is registered in the update event, there is no plug-in trigger by the create event.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Juan0414","comment_id":"1365673"},{"comment_id":"1357532","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC\n\" Interviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the interview record is successfully updated.\"","poster":"RavinBrissy","timestamp":"1739756160.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1025579","content":"So, B or C?","poster":"Net_IT","timestamp":"1728128160.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"C .","timestamp":"1727991720.0","comment_id":"1024246","upvote_count":"1","poster":"At09"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nInterviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the \"interview record\" is successfully updated.\nNothing mentioned over a contact record.","timestamp":"1727595120.0","poster":"dj74","comment_id":"1020575","upvote_count":"2"}],"topic":"6","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/121809-exam-pl-400-topic-6-question-30-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","exam_id":117},{"id":"RgiSsZmIjeijozgOjtK2","answer_ET":"","timestamp":"2023-12-17 15:49:00","answer":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pl-400/image438.png","https://img.examtopics.com/pl-400/image439.png"],"unix_timestamp":1702824540,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731829080.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"The first question should be No because It would only have been possible by registering an image, which I have not seen indicated in the statement or in the code. \n\nThe statement indicates the following: \nPlug-ins registered on the update of the Person of interest field (this field is in the contact entity) must send an email notification when the candidate named in the email is a person of interest.\n\nWith this in mind, the plug-in is triggered when the \"Person of Interest\" field has been updated.

The company has had some trouble recruiting talented employees. Top-level candidates interview with the company but go on to work for competitors.\n\nFeedback from candidates show that some offers were not accepted because the interview scheduling process was unpleasant. The company does not have a system to keep track of the candidates that were not selected.\n\n\nCurrent Environment\n-\n\nThe recruiting process starts when an individual applies for a position on the company website. The individual may have found the position on their own, they may have been officially referred by an employee, or in some cases were contacted directly by a hiring manager and encouraged to apply.\n\nRecruiters schedule an interview with a hiring manager and interviews with two senior team members. Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.\n\nThe recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.\n\nThe company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:\n\n• JobPosting\n- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser\n• Contact (Job Applicant)\n- Contact identifier\n- First name\n- Last name\n- Time-Zone Offset\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)\n• Application proapplication\n- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- pro_recruiterassignedid\n• Interview\n- Application - lookup to Application\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value\n• Referral\n- Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n• SystemUser\n- Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Time-Zone Offset\n• Recruiter\n- Recruiter identifier\n- Recruiter name\n\n\nApplications\n-\nThere may be multiple applications associated with each job posting. Applications are linked to an employee record if an employee referred the applicant for a position. The same individual can be an applicant for multiple job postings.\n\n\nInterviews\n-\nEach interview is performed by an employee and is related to a single application.\n\nThe interview scheduling process may force potential candidates to accept interviews at unusual times with the senior team members due to time-zone differences.\n\nRequirements. Interview Scheduling\n\nThe system must provide recruiters with a list of team members and their time-zone information. You must create a Microsoft Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control for the Job Application form to display a list of senior team members who report directly to a hiring manager.\n\n• The control must display the current time in each team member's local time.\n• The control must be bound so that it minimizes the amount of code that must be written.\n• You must display the list of team members and sort the list to show team members who reside in time zones closest to the applicant's time zone first.\n\nYou must develop a second PCF control that displays the time-zone name and current time on the Job Application form. You must display the data in the candidate’s local time.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Tracking\n\nYou must create a process to identify individuals as a person of interest that the company should consider hiring. You must assign each individual a score based on their past interactions.\n\n• You must be able to determine the following information about a candidate:\n- The number of interviews in the past two years and whether team members provided recommendations\n- The number of hiring manager referrals and employee referrals in the past two years\n- Whether the individual has any of the 12 designations or certifications that the company considers significant\n• Only a single referral can be made per job application. The system must be able to support multiple referrals for a candidate.\n• The system must track referrals even if an application is not completed.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Scoring\n\nThe automated process must run weekly to assess all candidates. The process must also run automatically when historical information is updated. You must be able to perform scoring by selecting a command button on the contact form.\n\n• This new command button must only be visible to employees who belong to a security role assigned named Recruiter. The command button must not be visible to anyone unless the contact form is in Update mode.\n• A person of interest is defined as having a score of 15 or more based on the following historical information criteria:\n- Each interview with a recommendation adds two to the score.\n- Each interview without a recommendation subtracts two from the score.\n- Each employee or manager referral adds one to the score.\n- Each designation or certification adds one to the score.\n• All scoring elements must be recalculated when changes occur. You must assign the score to the Person of interest field.\n• Values representing totals or scores must be stored in their own numeric fields.\n• Plug-ins must be used to keep the Person of Interest field on active interview records associated with the Contact.\n• Plug-ins registered on the update of the Person of interest field must send an email notification when the candidate named in the email is a person of interest. Recruiters must receive the message when the field is updated on the Contact record.\n• Interviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the interview record is successfully updated.\n\nRequirements. Design Guidelines\n\nThe following design guidelines must be followed:\n\n• Schema changes must be made using the method requiring the least amount of storage to meet the requirement.\n• Out-of-the-box functionality must be used when possible.\n• Any code required to calculate scores must be able to be run from a single point.\n• Email notifications need to be kept to a minimum.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n• Recruiters report that the command button to score a candidate is not working. You debug the code and observe that the context input parameter is null.\n• The system does not support associating designations and certifications with candidates.\n• The value for the field used by the PCF control to display local time is saved to Microsoft Dataverse each time an active application record is opened.\n• Interviewers report that they do not receive email notifications when interview records are created for an existing person of interest.\n\n\nYou need to implement scoring.\n\nWhich methods should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate methods to the correct actions. Each method may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","topic":"6","answer_ET":"","exam_id":117,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/121810-exam-pl-400-topic-6-question-32-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1695973440},{"id":"znGLKKqRQ2d0Lr9jJf1e","isMC":false,"question_id":310,"timestamp":"2023-10-03 22:57:00","exam_id":117,"answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pl-400/image444.png"],"answer":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1365698","poster":"Juan0414","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1741232700.0","content":"Function Key\nAPI Key\n\nThere is a very similar question in the practice test from Microsoft"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1721366280.0","poster":"LSgeek","content":"Function key\nAPI Key","comment_id":"1250859"},{"comment_id":"1188401","content":"Function Key and API Key IMO","poster":"hai297","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1712107440.0"},{"comment_id":"1024224","timestamp":"1696366620.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"1. function Key","poster":"At09"}],"unix_timestamp":1696366620,"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/122294-exam-pl-400-topic-6-question-33-discussion/","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\n\nCase study\n-\n\nThis is a case study.

To better understand its customers, Northwind Traders invests in a team of researchers who gather data from multiple sources. The company stores the data it collects in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nEnvironment\n-\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\nData\n-\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\nWeb API\n-\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nCustom connector\n-\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\nProcess\n-\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\n\nYou need to configure security for the Azure Function and custom connector.\n\nWhich security tool should you configure for each item? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","topic":"6","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pl-400/image443.png"]}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":382,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Microsoft","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"name":"PL-400","id":117,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":62},"__N_SSP":true}
