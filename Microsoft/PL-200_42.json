Display a system-defined error message: You can set up a system-defined error message that the bot displays when it doesn't understand the user's input. This error message can guide the user on how to rephrase or clarify their request.\n\nC. Use a fallback topic: You can create a fallback topic that the bot activates when it encounters unrecognized input. In the fallback topic, you can provide responses or instructions to help users navigate the conversation or specify what to do if their input isn't understood.\n\nThese approaches allow you to handle situations where the bot doesn't recognize or understand user input effectively.
