This can be done by creating multiple copies of the date table, one for each date foreign key in the sales table, and then creating a relationship between each copy of the date table and the corresponding date foreign key in the sales table."},{"timestamp":"1679774880.0","poster":"killershark","comment_id":"850430","content":"Selected Answer: B\nChat GPT says -\nNo, the solution does not meet the goal of supporting the analysis of sales over time based on all the date foreign keys.\n\nRenaming the date query as \"Due Date\" and referencing it twice does not create separate queries for \"Order Date\" and \"Delivery Date.\" Instead, it creates two identical queries that refer to the same \"Due Date\" query, which is not helpful for analyzing sales data based on all date foreign keys.\n\nTo support the analysis of sales over time based on all the date foreign keys, you should create separate queries for \"Order Date\" and \"Delivery Date\" in Power Query Editor and then merge these queries with the sales table on their respective foreign keys.
