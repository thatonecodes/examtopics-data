The Detect API detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. It also returns a unique ID that represents the stored face data. This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses.","upvote_count":"15","comment_id":"939223","poster":"zellck"},{"poster":"syupwsh","content":"From a learner’s video feed, verify whether the learner is present - Face is CORRECT because Azure AI Face API can be used to detect and recognize human faces in images and videos.

However, this question later comes with the option of increase the replicas: \nA simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing-based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it's important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all. Investigating the conditions that cause throttling will be explained in the next several sections."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe best answer is:\n• A. Yes\nReason for choosing this option: Azure Cognitive Search service tiers determine the resources available for that service. Higher tiers provide more resources such as increased document counts, indexing speed, and query capacity.
