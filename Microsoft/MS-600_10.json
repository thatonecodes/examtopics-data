Create an upload session\n2. Upload bytes to the upload session\nStep 2: Upload the first sequence of bytes.\nTo upload the file, or a portion of the file, your app makes a PUT request to the uploadUrl value received in the createUploadSession response.\nStep 3: Use the nextExpectedRanges field to continue the upload process.\nYour app can use the nextExpectedRanges value to determine where to start the next byte range.\nStep 4: Send the final byte sequence\nWhen the last byte range of a file is received the server will response with an HTTP 201 Created or HTTP 200 OK.
