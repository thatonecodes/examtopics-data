The company has a business process flow named BPFA that is associated with the Prospect entity to streamline the prospect management process.\nYou add a field named Category to the Prospect entity. You create additional business process flows. You apply the business process flows to Prospect records based on the selected category. Users can switch to any other newly configured business process flows but must not use BPFA.\nYou need to configure the solution.\nWhat are two possible ways to achieve this goal?

Deactivate BPFA:\nYou can deactivate the BPFA business process flow associated with the Prospect entity so that it is no longer available for use. This can be done by going to the entity settings, selecting Business Process Flows, and then deactivating the BPFA flow. This will prevent users from selecting it and force them to choose from the newly configured business process flows.\n\nD. Change the display order of the business process flows to move BPFA to the bottom of the list:\nYou can change the display order of the business process flows so that the newly configured flows are displayed at the top and BPFA is moved to the bottom of the list.

Deactivate BPFA. Deactivating the BPFA will prevent users from using it.\nB. Use a business rule to prevent users from switching to BPFA. A business rule can be configured to check the selected category and prevent users from switching to BPFA.\nLet me explain why the other options are not suitable:\n\nA. Remove all of the privileges for BPFA. Removing privileges for BPFA would prevent users from accessing it altogether, including the ability to see it in the list of available business process flows. This is not the desired outcome, as users should still be able to see the BPFA but not use it.\nD. Change the display order of the business process flows to move BPFA to the bottom of the list. Changing the display order would not prevent users from switching to BPFA. Users could still scroll down and select it.\nBy deactivating BPFA or using a business rule to prevent switching, you ensure that users can only access the newly configured business process flows based on the selected category.","comment_id":"1301989","poster":"memh"},{"timestamp":"1727151600.0","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"timestamp":"1722079320.0","comment_id":"1256266","upvote_count":"3","content":"Business rules are primarily used for form logic and data validation within entities.
