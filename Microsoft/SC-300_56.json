By default, all the applications a user can access are listed together on a single page. To better organize this page for your users, if you have an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license you can set up collections. With a collection, you can group together applications that are related (for example, by job role, task, or project) and display them on a separate tab. A collection essentially applies a filter to the applications a user can already access, so the user sees only those applications in the collection that have been assigned to them.","comment_id":"915385","poster":"TomasValtor","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"904722","timestamp":"1684829760.0","content":"I have read this question over and over and it specifically says at the top all 3 apps have the same settings.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Smallos"},{"poster":"eleazarrd","comment_id":"874027","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPara que los usuarios puedan ver App3 en el portal de Mis aplicaciones, es necesario realizar la opción A.
