Azure SQL Database does not support SQL Server Agent, which is required for MSX/TS jobs.

By using MSX, you can manage multiple SQL Server instances as if they were a single entity. MSX simplifies the administration tasks of managing multiple servers by allowing you to execute tasks on multiple servers at once, such as backing up databases or running queries.\n\nThe Target Server (TSX) is a SQL Server instance that is managed by the Master Server (MSX). TSX instances can be located on the same physical server as the MSX instance or on a different server.\n\nMSX/TSX can also be used for managing SQL Server Agent jobs, where you can define jobs at the master server and then distribute them to the target servers. This feature helps in centrally managing and scheduling SQL Server Agent jobs across multiple servers.","timestamp":"1680564960.0","poster":"U_C","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"860453"},{"poster":"U_C","content":"The answer is correct.","timestamp":"1680564780.0","comment_id":"860450","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-300/image260.png"],"timestamp":"2023-04-04 01:33:00","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have an Azure subscription.\n\nYou plan to migrate 10 on-premises Microsoft SQL Server instances to Azure.\n\nYou need to ensure that the migrated environment can be managed by using multiserver administration and supports master/target (MSX/TSX) jobs.\n\nThe solution must minimize administrative effort.\n\nWhich SQL deployment options should you select as the master server (MSX) and the target server (TSX)?
