Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu) is the most accurate choice.\n\nJustification: Both Caffe2 and PyTorch are widely used deep learning frameworks and are well supported on Linux platforms, particularly Ubuntu. The Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu) is pre-configured with the necessary libraries, tools, and deep learning frameworks to help you get started quickly with your deep learning projects.\n\nCentOS is a stable and reliable Linux distribution, but it may not have the latest version of Caffe2 or PyTorch, or the necessary dependencies to run them. Windows Server operating systems such as Windows 2012 and Windows 2016 are not as commonly used for deep learning and may not have the necessary support for these frameworks.
