Modify an Azure firewall\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over HTTP, you can use the following two solutions:\n\nB. Modify a network security group (NSG): An NSG is a fundamental Azure resource that allows or denies network traffic to and from Azure resources, such as virtual machines. By default, incoming traffic to a virtual machine is blocked. To allow incoming HTTP traffic (port 80), you need to create an NSG rule that permits inbound traffic on port 80 for the specific virtual machine (VM1).\n\nD. Modify an Azure firewall: Azure Firewall is a cloud-based network security service that provides stateful firewall capabilities. If you are using Azure Firewall to protect your virtual network, you need to create a rule that allows HTTP traffic (port 80) from the Internet to the specific virtual machine (VM1).","upvote_count":"3","poster":"MANANDAVEY","timestamp":"1689868500.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nhgx32983 is correct, 2 answers required so B and D.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"824690","timestamp":"1677582060.0","poster":"BlueAzure22"},{"timestamp":"1673793660.0","poster":"azirila","comment_id":"776675","content":"NSG ANd Azure Firewall, please change this","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"BD is the answer.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1673365440.0","comment_id":"771579","poster":"zellck"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"correct: B (NSG) and D (Firewall)","poster":"azirila","comment_id":"766690","timestamp":"1672927500.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"QBB","timestamp":"1668138180.0","comment_id":"715740","content":"Given answer is correct: B (NSG) and D (Firewall)"},{"timestamp":"1665107700.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Give rules = NSG and firewall","poster":"TonyghostR05","comment_id":"688210"},{"comment_id":"669219","content":"Should be B (NSG) and D (Firewall)","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1663176300.0","poster":"Lanka22"},{"comment_id":"649922","poster":"joaopellissari","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB and D","timestamp":"1661113560.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"soyoko","content":"To ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over HTTP, you need to modify a network security group or Azure Firewall.\nB & D are correct answers.","timestamp":"1655983980.0","comment_id":"620938"},{"timestamp":"1654751640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"EmmaW","content":"BD, NSG and Firewall","comment_id":"613631"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1654641360.0","content":"The answer should be B (NSG} and D (Firewall) it is looking for 2 possible solutions.","poster":"ITLearningalways","comment_id":"612951"},{"comment_id":"604149","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB & D is correct","timestamp":"1652996520.0","poster":"cri88"},{"poster":"bulichich","timestamp":"1652965980.0","comment_id":"603920","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\nB and D are the correct answers"},{"poster":"certstudent2016","comment_id":"589731","content":"B & D correct\nGot this on exam....pass with 928","timestamp":"1650602700.0","upvote_count":"7"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"HHHo","content":"Got this in exam on 2022.04.18","comment_id":"587908","timestamp":"1650323400.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Zoe_GR","content":"Yes, B & D indeed","comment_id":"570462","timestamp":"1647599220.0"},{"content":"B D are the correct","timestamp":"1645139340.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"kikinho_jaen","comment_id":"549822"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"538896","poster":"AnnSoftEng","timestamp":"1643818980.0","content":"B & D is correct"},{"content":"B and D both are correct","timestamp":"1643095560.0","poster":"DeepakR","comment_id":"531936","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"506118","poster":"mikep1","timestamp":"1640092260.0","content":"Of course: B + D"},{"content":"B, D son las respuestas correcta","timestamp":"1639454160.0","poster":"clozano","comment_id":"501050","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"16","poster":"Mozbius_","comment_id":"485113","content":"I won't lie seeing blatantly obvious errors makes me regret spending money here.
