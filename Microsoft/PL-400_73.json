By using a service endpoint that is triggered by the \"Create\" message and runs asynchronously in the post-operation stage, the new record will be created in the Dataverse, and added to an Azure Service Bus queue.\n\nThe Azure Function can then process the records as they are added to the queue, this pattern ensure that even if the Azure Function or another component of the integration is temporarily unavailable, the new record will still be created in the Dataverse and added to the queue, and the Azure Function will be able to process it when it becomes available again.\n\nSo, this solution is appropriate to avoid data loss condition and meet the goal of one-way integration from the Microsoft Dataverse to another system.","timestamp":"1690479720.0","upvote_count":"5","poster":"DimpleG","comment_id":"789953"},{"poster":"Juan0414","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect!\nYes","comment_id":"1365758","timestamp":"1741239600.0"},{"content":"Would it be a better solution if Azure Service Bus is notified on PreOperation (as suppose to PostOperation), and also wait until Azure Service Bus to confirm before proceeding to the Creation of the record?
