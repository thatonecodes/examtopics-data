This results in improved read performance as all the necessary data for a single entity can be retrieved from a single table without requiring joins with other tables. Similarly, when writing data, it is written to a single table without the need to update multiple tables. This approach is commonly used in data warehousing and reporting scenarios where read performance is prioritized over storage efficiency and data modification speed.","poster":"Mega2","comment_id":"1149249","upvote_count":"5"},{"poster":"AGTraining","content":"option A","timestamp":"1725430860.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1165441"},{"comment_id":"1078420","upvote_count":"1","content":"CORRECT.
