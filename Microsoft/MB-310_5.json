Because my god is this a poorly written question.\n\nIn D365 as of today (7/8/22) there is no \"offset:\" there is a ledger accrual start date. There is no \"debit\" or \"credit\" accrual scheme: there is an \"accrual account\" option with either \"account\" or \"offset account.\"\n\nFurther, it doesn't even explain what our journal entry is. There doesn't seem to be many accountants in the comments, but typically you would be debiting an expense account while crediting a liability account. (Then when paid, debit the liability against cash.)\n\nSo that being said, the setup makes no sense because none of the terms actually align with D365. The answers make no sense for the same reason, but also additionally there is no specifying of what is being accrued, the liability the expense, both or neither."},{"poster":"Ramanya","timestamp":"1641534000.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nFor both current and new employees, it has to be Debit accrual scheme.

By the time the 'new Fiscal Year' starts, and the 1st payment is paid to the life insurance, any new employees will become current employees. So, to prepare employees for the 1st insurance payment, any money collected at the start of the new Fiscal Year is a credit since the 1st payment has not yet posted. That is why B is correct.\nConfiguring the calendar for Debit accrual to begin at the 1st day of the new Fiscal Year ensures that the 2nd insurance payment is prepared and recorded properly. \nThe 1st day of the new fiscal year has not yet begun so credit to employee's 1st pay date until the Fiscal year does begin, and then once the Fiscal year begins, start the Debit accrual to properly record.\n\nThis is why I agree with the answer B&D.","poster":"LoriHafner"},{"content":"CD is correct\nCurrent employees must be twice a month (scheme starts at first date of fiscal year) (= D)\nNew employees must be on their first paydate (= C)\nThis automatically implies that it must be Debit","comment_id":"610767","poster":"BenLearn","timestamp":"1654197960.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"538475","timestamp":"1643791920.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC, D are correct","poster":"Ramanya"},{"content":"B and D are correct.\nInclusion of new employees is used to make the question quite tricky.\nIt is correct that the configuration of accrual schemes for the new fiscal year should only be done for current employees.","poster":"Niqs","comment_id":"326259","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1617328380.0"},{"content":"Correct answer is BD\nthis is buried within the QUESTION: - \"You need to configure accrual schemes for the new fiscal year.\"\nThere are only current employees in the new year","poster":"finance_BNE","comment_id":"320941","timestamp":"1616747520.0","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"poster":"Indzitis","timestamp":"1652781540.0","comment_id":"602873","content":"But next year there will be new employees too.

Tailspin Toys has been using custom-developed software for their accounting and supply chain management needs.\n\nTailspin Toys has toy factories in Mexico and Canada, with a head office based out of the United States. Tailspin Toys is currently operating with various financial departments including accounts payable, accounts receivable, fixed assets, and general accounting. The company has multiple legal entities to support their manufacturing units and selling organization.\n\nTailspin Toys wants to maintain consistent growth as a company and is now implementing Dynamics 365 Finance for all business processes.\n\n\nCurrent environment -\n\n\nVendors -\n• Tailspin Toys works with local and foreign vendors.\n• The procurement process is designed for manufacturing raw materials, finished products, and packing materials for toys.\n• The company monitors vendor balances by local and foreign vendors, both appearing in different general ledger accounts.\n• For vendor payments, the accounts payable manager generates payment proposals every Wednesday, to have approvals and check printing done by Thursday in order to mail the checks by Friday of each week.\n• Vendors can take part in the incentive program that offers travel vouchers and other gifts based on quantity and quality of supplies at the end of the year.\n• Incentive program data is being monitored outside of the system and qualifying vendors are then provided to the financial department for expenses.\n• The finance department accrues a small percentage of every vendor invoice during the year for this purpose, booking accounts payable liability account offsetting to the incentive expenses account.\n• The finance department accrual then allows management to easily make decisions regarding types of gifts and vouchers to provide to the top-performing vendors.\n\n\nReporting -\n• Management gets periodic reports from the finance department for all the legal entities. These reports provide all required finance data and are comprised of balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.\n\n\nBudget planning -\n• The finance department oversees all budget planning.\n• The finance department estimates the baseline for all budgets and distributes them to the respective departments.\n• Each department estimates and forecasts their budget and sends it back to the finance department where the budget is updated accordingly.\n\n\nExpenses -\nUtility bills for the toy factories are currently getting expensed to the following departments as per the listed breakdown.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nAsset leasing -\nTailspin Toys has leased assets in the form of factory buildings and warehouses. The company maintains asset books for the monthly leasing payments and pays compound interest on them. Tailspin Toys maintains future forecasts of their payment projections and budget requirements for leasing payments.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nConsolidation -\n• Automatic foreign currency consolidation at the corporate level is required by Tailspin Toys’ leadership.\n• Consolidated results are needed in multiple reporting currencies.\n\n\nExpenses -\n• Utility bills must be allocated to allow each department to expense the correct amount.\n\n\nReports -\n• Leadership requires financial reports to come to their inbox automatically as one at the end of every month.\n\n\nVendors -\n• The system must show accounts payable liability by type of vendor similar to how it works in the current system.\n• The chief financial officer (CFO) wants to configure the system to follow their business policies of paying vendors every Friday and as per credit issued by vendors and agreed method of payments.\n• The accounts payable administrator must automate the vendor invoice process for imported invoices to bypass the review stage when no discrepancy is determined.\n\n\nBudgets -\n• A new organizational hierarchy is required for budget planning purposes.\n• Leadership wants financial budgets enforced by alerting users upon reaching 90% of the total budget.\n\n\nAsset leasing -\n• The CFO must automatically process payments and journal entries for the leased properties.\n• Management must view payment forecasts based on leased assets.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n\nAccounts payable issues -\n• Vendor liability information for local and foreign vendors is not separated in the system.\n• The accounts payable manager observed that a percentage of each invoice paid to vendors is not being posted for the yearly incentives program.\n• The accounts payable clerk had to manually invoice a vendor receipt during user acceptance testing.\n• The accounts payable manager must automate the current process of vendor payment proposals.\n\n\nOther issues -\n• The differences resulting from consolidating subsidiaries with foreign currencies are not considered.\n• User A confirmed they did not receive an alert before running out of their budget.\n• Expense reports for the manufacturing and sales departments do not contain utility bill expenses.\n• The accounting manager reported that there is no batch journal created for the monthly lease expenses.\n\n\nYou need to address the requirement for allocating the utility bills.\n\nWhich allocation method should you use?","topic":"1","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/153166-exam-mb-310-topic-1-question-127-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nshould this be c?","timestamp":"1735855020.0","poster":"charmingstorm","comment_id":"1335772","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1734533820},{"id":"hmzQz4zbDDiXo4tjSN1F","isMC":false,"question_id":25,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722264420.0","comment_id":"639284","poster":"D365FOConsultant","upvote_count":"1","content":"correct"},{"poster":"sadiq_d365","content":"Seems correct","comment_id":"275675","timestamp":"1674620280.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1674619800.0","comment_id":"275672","content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/cost-accounting/terms-cost-accounting","poster":"sadiq_d365","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nA client plans to use the cost accounting module in Dynamics 365 Finance.\nYou need to associate the correct definitions to the correct cost accounting concepts.\nWhich terms match the definitions?
