You can argue that the question says explicitly, users have to have the Access Key to access the data and that SAS is not sharing the Access Key.

This means that when you mount a file share over SMB or access it via the FileREST protocol (such as through the Azure portal, PowerShell/CLI, or Azure SDKs), Azure Files will only allow the connection if it is made with SMB 3.0+ with encryption or HTTPS. Clients that do not support SMB 3.0 or clients that support SMB 3.0 but not SMB encryption will not be able to mount the Azure file share if encryption in transit is enabled. For more information about which operating systems support SMB 3.0 with encryption, see our detailed documentation for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
