Yes, the solution meets the goal of guaranteed availability of 99.99 percent. By including two virtual machines and two availability zones in your deployment strategy, you are providing a level of redundancy and resiliency that can help ensure the availability of your critical LOB application.\n\nWith two virtual machines, you can set up load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across both instances, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. By deploying the virtual machines in two separate availability zones, you are providing an additional layer of protection against outages or failures in a single location.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that availability targets are best-effort and not guaranteed.
