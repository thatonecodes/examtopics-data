These tables represent the data entities that the connector can interact with.\n\nD. triggers: Triggers are events that initiate the execution of a flow or an action. In the context of a connector, triggers are often used to start a flow based on changes or events occurring in the connected system.\n\nReference links:\n1. Microsoft Power Automate documentation on connectors: [Connectors overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/)\n2.

Actions allow you to perform specific tasks or operations using the data or services exposed by the connector. For example, if the connector is for a customer relationship management (CRM) system, actions might include creating a new record, updating an existing record, or retrieving records.\n\nTables: Tables, in the context of a connector, typically refer to the data structures or entities that the connector interacts with. For example, if the connector is for a database system, tables would represent different database tables. In a CRM system, tables might correspond to entities like \"Contacts,\" \"Accounts,\" or \"Opportunities.\"","poster":"rmeng","timestamp":"1715609100.0","comment_id":"1069489","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"896781","content":"On exam May '23; actions and tables","poster":"Kolif","timestamp":"1699893960.0"},{"timestamp":"1693845600.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"AZ_Guru_Wannabe","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nThe link in the 2 comments below shows the connector from canvas apps having Actions and Tables only.","comment_id":"829267"},{"poster":"EdrisKazemi","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nTables and triggers are commonly provided by connectors in canvas apps as they allow for the storage and manipulation of data within the app. Tables are used to store and organize data, while triggers are used to initiate actions or events based on certain conditions or user interactions.
