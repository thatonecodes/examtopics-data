Select Add indicator and set the IP address to 171.23.34.32/27.\nTo add threat indicators for all the IP addresses in a range of 171.23.34.32-171.23.34.63 in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal while minimizing administrative effort, you should select \"Add indicator\" and set the IP address to 171.23.34.32/27. This option utilizes CIDR notation to represent the IP address range efficiently.\nCIDR notation with \"/27\" represents a subnet mask that covers the range of IP addresses from 171.23.34.32 to 171.23.34.63. This method simplifies the process and minimizes the effort required to add multiple IP addresses individually.\n\nThe other options involve creating import files or specifying IP addresses individually, which may be more cumbersome and time-consuming compared to using CIDR notation for a range of IP addresses.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"963722","poster":"JoeP1","timestamp":"1690375500.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA because CIDR ranges can not be imported."},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhy not D?\n\nI see that you can add a new indicator such as 171.23.34.32/27, without the extra step of doing this through a .csv file, which clearly will minimize the administrative effort.","poster":"Marchiano","comment_id":"954215","comments":[{"content":"Because \n\"Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation for IP addresses is not supported.\" \naccording to the Microsoft web site:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/indicator-ip-domain?view=o365-worldwide","comments":[{"content":"Thank you!","poster":"Marchiano","comment_id":"960505","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1690122420.0"}],"poster":"JoeP1","timestamp":"1689705000.0","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"955765"}],"timestamp":"1689596700.0"},{"comment_id":"924221","timestamp":"1686835140.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mfalkjunk","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe IP address range within the subnet 171.23.34.32/27 is from 171.23.34.33 to 171.23.34.62.\n\nA should be sufficient."},{"timestamp":"1684345560.0","poster":"Adom3730","content":"Selected Answer: A\nYou can choose to upload a CSV file that defines the attributes of indicators, the action to be taken, and other details.\n\nType of the indicator.
