Using deterministic encryption allows point lookups, equality joins, grouping and indexing on encrypted columns. However, it may also allow unauthorized users to guess information about encrypted values by examining patterns in the encrypted column, especially if there is a small set of possible encrypted values, such as True/False, or North/South/East/West region.\nDeterministic encryption must use a column collation with a binary2 sort order for character columns.\nBox 2: Always Encrypted with Randomized encryption\n✑ Randomized encryption uses a method that encrypts data in a less predictable manner. Randomized encryption is more secure, but prevents searching, grouping, indexing, and joining on encrypted columns.\nNote: With Always Encrypted the Database Engine never operates on plaintext data stored in encrypted columns, but it still supports some queries on encrypted data, depending on the encryption type for the column. Always Encrypted supports two types of encryption: randomized encryption and deterministic encryption.\nUse deterministic encryption for columns that will be used as search or grouping parameters, for example a government ID number.
