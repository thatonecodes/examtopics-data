Server3, being domain-joined, supports Kerberos V5 authentication by default in an AD DS environment. Although Server3 lacks an explicit IPsec rule, Windows domain-joined computers can respond to IPsec authentication requests (like Server1’s) using Kerberos without needing a matching outbound rule. Server1’s \"Require inbound\" setting enforces authentication on the connection, and Server3 can comply, establishing a secure TCP session."},{"comment_id":"1352225","upvote_count":"1","poster":"BlackCat9588","content":"YYN\nPlease let me know if I am wrong","timestamp":"1738826040.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"BlackCat9588","timestamp":"1738722360.0","content":"My answer is YYN\nSeem no connection security rule information for Server 3.
