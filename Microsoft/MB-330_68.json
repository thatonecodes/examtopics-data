Blocked Locations. Why Blocked Locations?\nPreconfiguration Support: You can fully set up the new facility’s warehouse structure (e.g., warehouse, zones, locations), including fixed asset integration (e.g., associating locations with production equipment), without making it operational. Access Control: Blocking all locations in the new facility’s warehouse prevents inventory movements, picking, or production activities there until the transition. This ensures users cannot accidentally process transactions in the new facility. Transition Readiness: When the move occurs, you can unblock the locations (manually or via a batch process), making the facility immediately usable without additional setup.","timestamp":"1741799880.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":337,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"E","timestamp":"2025-03-12 18:18:00","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"set item stopped flag","C":"product lifecycle state","A":"release products","E":"blocked locations","D":"location lifecycle state"},"question_images":[],"exam_id":83},{"id":"Tp7V5jVBtFCITALGEp6L","unix_timestamp":1741802100,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-330/image168.png"],"question_id":338,"exam_id":83,"isMC":false,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-330/image167.png"],"answer_description":"","topic":"5","timestamp":"2025-03-12 18:55:00","answers_community":[],"question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nA company is configuring the handheld warehouse mobile device in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.\n\nSeveral warehouse activities are documented as required configurations.

Indirect Mode: Used for activities that don’t directly involve warehouse work but are standalone tasks, such as changing statuses, reprinting labels, or switching warehouses.

An \"empty break master\" means no additional variables (like weight, pieces, or mileage) are used to break down the rate—just the flat rate for the route. This fits the scenario perfectly: a flat rate needs to be assigned for the route from New York City (pickup, $500) to Colorado (destination, $450 interpreted as the rate for the route).

This option explicitly involves automating wave creation (via the wave template’s \"Automate wave creation\" setting) and processing the wave automatically when the order is released to the warehouse (using the \"Process wave at release to warehouse\" option in the wave template). This directly matches the scenario: the warehouse needs work completed (i.e., created) immediately upon release, and processing the wave at release generates the work (e.g., pick lists) without delay.
