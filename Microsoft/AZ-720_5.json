Object distinguished name - The distinguished name (DN) is a critical piece of information as it uniquely identifies the object in the Active Directory hierarchy. It includes the name of the domain where the object resides, the organizational unit (OU) that contains the object, and the common name (CN) of the object itself.\n\nE.

In the context of AD DS, the GUID is a unique value that remains with the object for its entire lifespan, even when the object is moved or renamed.\n\nI think D is wrong because the AD Connector name (Option D) is not usually required when troubleshooting a specific object synchronization issue in Azure AD Connect.
