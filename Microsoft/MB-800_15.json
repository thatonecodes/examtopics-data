Configure an Over-Receipt code with Tolerance percentage.\n\nConfiguring an Over-Receipt code with a Tolerance percentage is the appropriate action to address Issue 3 in the scenario.\n\nIssue 3 states that the company often receives a higher quantity of produce items than what they order because vendors allow for spoilage or damage of produce in transit. The company does not want to allow over receipt on non-produce items.\n\nBy configuring an Over-Receipt code with a Tolerance percentage, you can specify the acceptable over-receipt percentage for produce items in the system. This allows the company to account for the higher quantities of produce items received, while also maintaining control and preventing over receipt on non-produce items.\n\nThis configuration ensures that the company can accurately track and manage the receipt of produce items, while also maintaining the desired level of control for non-produce items in the inventory process."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"866379","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorrect","poster":"NA1926","timestamp":"1728573000.0"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"You need to configure the system for receiving produce from the vendors.\nWhat should you do?","topic":"11","answer":"A"},{"id":"tRGGfYel7cYPvQcfwywP","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/65565-exam-mb-800-topic-11-question-4-discussion/","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou need to create the process for salespeople.\nWhat should you do?
