User Options allows you to set delegates1. A delegate is a user who can perform actions on your behalf, such as approving or rejecting a workflow1.\nTo set up a delegate, on the Workflow tab of User Options, click the Add delegate button and select the user you want to delegate1. Then, in the Scope field, specify the scope to which the delegate can perform the action1. There are four options for Scope: All, User, Group, and Module.1\nIf you select the Scope of All, delegates can perform actions on all workflows to which they have access1. However, this is only a workflow action, and you cannot hand over your role to a delegate1.
