Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\n\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\n\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.\n\n\nTo start the case study -\nTo display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. is a global office supply company. The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services.\n\n\nCurrent environment -\n\n\nCorporate website -\n\nThe company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions.\n\n\nRetail Store Locations -\n\nThe company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\nThe application components must meet the following requirements:\n\n\nCorporate website -\n\n• Secure the website by using SSL.\n• Minimize costs for data storage and hosting.\n• Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).\n• Distribute the website content globally for local use.\n• Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification.\n• The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.\n\n\nRetail store locations -\n\n• Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.\n• Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.\n\n\nDelivery services -\n\n• Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.\n• Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.\n\n\nInventory services -\n\nThe company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.\n\n\nSecurity -\n\n• All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key.\n• Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n\nRetail Store Locations -\n\n• You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data.\n• Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.\n\n\nYou need to test the availability of the corporate website.\n\nWhich two test types can you use? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/116880-exam-az-204-topic-5-question-43-discussion/","choices":{"D":"Multi-step","A":"Standard","B":"URL ping","C":"Custom testing using the TrackAvailability API method"},"timestamp":"2023-07-31 10:10:00","isMC":true},{"id":"kxnYpVA53cYUG5GE96sw","topic":"5","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-08-08 06:01:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (94%)","6%"],"exam_id":48,"question_id":359,"choices":{"C":"rate-limit-by-key","A":"ip-filter","B":"quota-by-key","D":"rate-limit"},"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/117571-exam-az-204-topic-5-question-44-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"macobuzi","timestamp":"1693122540.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct:\nRate limits are usually used to protect against short and intense volume bursts.
