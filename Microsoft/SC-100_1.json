This is because Microsoft Sentinel data connectors are designed to send security events to external systems, such as Splunk, in real-time. By using a data connector, you can easily configure the integration and define which events to send to Splunk based on your organization's needs. Azure Event Hubs is not the best option for this scenario because it is used to stream large amounts of data to other services and may not provide the required security and filtering capabilities for security events. A Microsoft Sentinel workbook is not designed for sending data to external systems, but rather for visualizing and analyzing data within the Microsoft Sentinel environment.
