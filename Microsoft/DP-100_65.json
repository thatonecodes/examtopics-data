A nearest neighbor is a row of data (a case) that is very similar to some target case. The distance between any two cases is measured by combining the weighted vectors of all features.\nBy increasing the number of nearest neighbors, you get features from more cases.\nBy keeping the number of nearest neighbors low, you use features that are more like those in the original sample.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/smote","unix_timestamp":1624711620,"isMC":false,"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou create an experiment in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

In those cases,\nAUC_weighted can be a better choice for the primary metric.\nStep 4: Configure the automated machine learning run by selecting the experiment name, target column, and compute target\nStep 5: Run the automated machine learning experiment and review the results.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-auto-train","answer":"","exam_id":64,"discussion":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1327030","poster":"gunn_m","timestamp":"1734291240.0","content":"I was in the Submit an Automated ML job tab\nWe have the following flow:\n1Training method:\nWhere we choose whether it will be automatic training, custom script,\n\nPerform hyperparameter tuning.\n2Basic settings:\nExperiment name and description\n3Task type & data:\nWe select the dataset and the task type\n4Task settings:\nWe configure metrics among others\n5Compute\nWe select the computing resources\n6Review\n\nIt is important to note that the UI has changed recently.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Why is this incorrect, if we assume the training is done in train.py (which we import data, define model, and then predict and measure the accuracy), and then in python, we define SriptRunConfig (again we can define primary metric name) and then run the experiment, then the suggested order is correct","poster":"MohsenSic","comment_id":"394383","comments":[{"timestamp":"1659666720.0","comment_id":"420017","content":"It says \"Automated Machine Learning user interface in Azure Machine Learning studio \" why will you use python?","poster":"azure1000","upvote_count":"7"}],"timestamp":"1656555300.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1649240520.0","poster":"Sabrina442","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"329521","content":"You are totally right"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1647586080.0","comment_id":"313877","content":"I agree","poster":"kty"},{"timestamp":"1647367740.0","content":"Yes You are right","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"311635","poster":"OmarF"}],"content":"This is incorrect, its create dataset > configure experiment > select classification > select metric (AUC)> run exp","poster":"ImogenW","comment_id":"308016","upvote_count":"106","timestamp":"1647013920.0"},{"content":"Create Dataset, Configure, Select Classification, AUC Weighted, Submit experiment.\n\nTested","comment_id":"407546","upvote_count":"22","timestamp":"1657940040.0","poster":"slash_nyk"},{"poster":"harkamal","comment_id":"946096","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1720406820.0","content":"metric should be AUC Weighted"},{"comment_id":"832877","timestamp":"1709896800.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Exactly this question was on exam 07/March/2023","poster":"Yuriy_Ch"},{"comment_id":"811001","poster":"phdykd","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708108380.0","content":"Create Dataset, Configure, Select Classification, AUC Weighted, Submit experiment."},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"therealola","content":"On exam 18-06-22","comment_id":"617983","timestamp":"1687045440.0"},{"content":"On 20Feb2022","comment_id":"552111","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1676917140.0"},{"content":"on 19Oct2021","timestamp":"1666252200.0","comment_id":"465002","upvote_count":"4","poster":"hargur"},{"timestamp":"1665255780.0","content":"On Exam 01 Oct 2021","poster":"kisskeo","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"459387"},{"comment_id":"449301","timestamp":"1663825500.0","poster":"RyanTsai","upvote_count":"1","content":"agree: create dataset > configure experiment > select classification > select metric (AUC)> run exp"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"mthombenindhl84","comment_id":"443167","timestamp":"1662926520.0","content":"on exam 11/9/2021"},{"timestamp":"1662262380.0","content":"On exam 2021/08/31","poster":"dushmantha","comment_id":"438845","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"on 2/9/21","timestamp":"1662183300.0","poster":"snsnsnsn","comment_id":"438308"},{"timestamp":"1659423660.0","poster":"datamijn","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"418570","content":"on exam 2/8/2021"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1654317360.0","comment_id":"374066","content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml\nAnswer should be Create DataSet>Configure run>Select Classification as the machine learning task type>Select AUC_weighted> Run","poster":"rishi_ram"},{"timestamp":"1648321380.0","content":"AUC Weighted is correct as shown here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml","comment_id":"321375","upvote_count":"3","poster":"BilJon"}],"answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04274/0024800001.png"],"topic":"3"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":512,"isBeta":false,"id":64,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Microsoft","isMCOnly":false,"name":"DP-100","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":65},"__N_SSP":true}
