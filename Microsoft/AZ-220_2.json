For me ans must be B1=A","timestamp":"1640925660.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe S1 tier provides the ability to perform bulk device operations and allows up to 400,000 messages per day. With 1,000 devices sending one message per hour, the total number of messages per day will be 24,000 (1000 devices * 24 hours). Each message is 4 KB, which translates to a total of 96 MB of data per day (24,000 messages * 4 KB). This is well within the message limit of the S1 tier (which allows up to 8,000,000 messages per month).\n\nAdditionally, the S1 tier is a cost-effective option, as it is designed for moderate-scale solutions and provides a balance between cost and features. The free tier does not support bulk device operations, and the B1 and S2 tiers are designed for larger-scale solutions and are more expensive.\n\nTherefore, deploying one unit of the S1 tier will meet the requirements of the Azure IoT solution while minimizing costs.","timestamp":"1680924780.0","poster":"feyey","comment_id":"864376"},{"content":"So what is right answer??? \nI know i want to go for A as Free tier can't be used for prod environment.","comment_id":"857927","poster":"PreetDP900","timestamp":"1680354480.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFree tier message meter size is 0.5KB, it count 8 message for 4KB size.
