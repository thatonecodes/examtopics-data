Flaky test data for both passed and failed test is available in Test results. The Flaky tag helps you identify flaky tests. By default, flaky tests are included in the Test Summary. However, if you want to ensure flaky test failures don't fail your pipeline, you can choose to not include them in your test summary and suppress the test failure. This option ensures flaky tests (both passed and failed) are removed from the pass percentage and shown in Tests not reported.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1685979240.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"zellck","comment_id":"915536","content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/test/flaky-test-management?view=azure-devops#tests-marked-as-flaky\nYou can mark or unmark a test as flaky based on analysis or context, by choosing Flaky (or UnFlaky, depending on whether the test is already marked as flaky.)"}],"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1685979240.0","poster":"zellck"},{"timestamp":"1720510200.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1319455","content":"Wrong question, homes","poster":"Insanewhip","timestamp":"1732828740.0"}],"comment_id":"1244785","upvote_count":"1","poster":"sondrex","content":"every five minutes per location\nall the HTML, JavaScripts, and images of App1 load"},{"poster":"vsvaid","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nAgree with the answer","timestamp":"1702774500.0","comment_id":"1098609","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"yana_b","comment_id":"977598","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nCorrect answers are B & D","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1691668440.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"got this in 02 March 2023 exams. scored 870 marks.","poster":"AlexeyG","timestamp":"1677758700.0","comment_id":"826812"},{"poster":"Racheal28","timestamp":"1671194580.0","content":"Go this on my exam today and selected B , D .Passed","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"747182"},{"timestamp":"1670558160.0","content":"It was on my exam on December 7, 2022.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"739727","poster":"budha"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BD\nGiven answers are supported by explanation\n\nB and D","comment_id":"639997","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1659256500.0","poster":"syu31svc"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1658484840.0","comment_id":"635131","content":"Mark Flaky test and clear the Flaky test","poster":"Govcomm"},{"timestamp":"1652899500.0","comment_id":"603465","poster":"Mcelona","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nCheck https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/test/flaky-test-management ==> B & D is the right answer"},{"timestamp":"1647506040.0","comment_id":"569562","poster":"rdemontis","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BD\ncorrect"},{"poster":"Pankaj78","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1639849020.0","comment_id":"504363","content":"Selected Answer: BD\ncorrect"},{"poster":"debanjan10","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB and D","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1639111020.0","comment_id":"498293"},{"content":"why is it not A?","comments":[{"timestamp":"1623824880.0","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"383146","content":"If you disable flaky test detection, then when the test fails the pipeline is always going to be marked as failed.
