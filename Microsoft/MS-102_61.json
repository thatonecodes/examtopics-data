This can be applied to categorize activity originating from specific networks, such as your on-premises network, as \"Administrative\" based on IP address. By defining a named location for your on-premises network, you can automatically classify activities originating from that network.\n\nSo, you should create a named location and associate it with your on-premises network's IP range.","comments":[],"comment_id":"1399246","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":302,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1742131620,"answer":"D","exam_id":100,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_text":"You have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription and use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.\n\nYou are reviewing the activity log of the subscription.\n\nYou need to ensure that events originating from the on-premises network are categorized automatically as Administrative.\n\nWhat should you create?","timestamp":"2025-03-16 14:27:00"},{"id":"yr5M8TK2XKQii7XE0V8K","answers_community":["C (80%)","B (20%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/157753-exam-ms-102-topic-1-question-374-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_text":"You have an on-premises server named Server1 that runs Windows Server.\n\nYou have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription and use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.\n\nYou plan to configure Cloud Discovery and enable automatic log upload.\n\nYou need to ensure that you can run the log collector on Server1.\n\nWhat should you install on Server1?","question_images":[],"topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Docker","B":".NET Framework 4.8","D":"the Azure Connected Machine agent","A":"the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK"},"timestamp":"2025-03-08 09:54:00","question_id":303,"exam_id":100,"answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","discussion":[{"poster":"SummerK","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742131920.0","comment_id":"1399249","comments":[{"comment_id":"1401904","upvote_count":"1","content":"No, you're wrong, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1fG_7I9pk8","poster":"Maup33","timestamp":"1742648580.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe correct answer is B. .NET Framework 4.8.\n\nTo run the log collector for Cloud Discovery in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, you need to ensure that the required dependencies, such as .NET Framework 4.8, are installed on the server.

The correct answer is B. Use the streamlined connectivity type.\n\nIn Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, the streamlined connectivity type is specifically designed for scenarios where devices need to connect to Defender for Endpoint through a proxy service. This option helps ensure that devices use consolidated URLs and static IP ranges when making the connection, which aligns with your requirement.\n\nSo, by choosing streamlined connectivity, you'll be ensuring that the devices connect to Defender for Endpoint via the appropriate URLs and IP ranges in a manner that's optimized for proxy scenarios.","poster":"SummerK","comment_id":"1399250"}],"question_id":304,"question_text":"You have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription.
