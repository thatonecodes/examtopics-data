By using a Service principal, you can provide granular access to specific resources, without exposing the account key or SAS token. It also provides a centralized location to manage access to resources.\nWhile using a Managed identity is a valid option for authenticating when running code within a workspace or compute instance, it's not applicable for configuring authentication for datastores. A Managed identity provides an identity for a resource that can be used to authenticate to Azure services without requiring the use of credentials such as account keys or SAS tokens.","comment_id":"820709","comments":[{"poster":"AzureJobsTillRetire","timestamp":"1677286680.0","comment_id":"821068","content":"Service principle is less secure than managed identity.

This will allow you to connect to the compute instance remotely using Visual Studio Code and the Remote - SSH extension.\n\nEnabling Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access (option A) is not necessary for debugging code using Visual Studio Code Remote. RDP is used for remote desktop access to a Windows machine.\n\nModifying role-based access control (RBAC) settings at the workspace level (option B) or the compute instance level (option D) is not required for enabling Visual Studio Code Remote.

Differential privacy provides a formal guarantee that the data will be protected against privacy attacks.\nConverting the salary data to the average column value (option D) does not provide differential privacy.
