Identity Environment\n\nThe network contains an on-premises Active Directory domain named litware.com that syncs to a Microsoft Entra tenant named litware.com.\n\nThe Microsoft Entra tenant contains the users shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nAll users are registered for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n\nExisting Environment. Cloud Services\n\nLitware has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription associated to the Microsoft Entra tenant. All users are assigned Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 licenses.\n\nLitware has an Azure subscription associated to the Microsoft Entra tenant. The subscription contains the resources shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nLitware uses custom virtual machine images and custom scripts to automatically provision Azure virtual machines and join the virtual machines to the on-premises Active Directory domain.\n\nExisting Environment. Network and DNS\n\nThe offices connect to each other by using a WAN link. Each office connects directly to the internet.\n\nAll DNS queries for internet hosts are resolved by using DNS servers in the Boston office, which point to root servers on the internet. The Chennai office has caching-only DNS servers that forward queries to the DNS servers in the Boston office.\n\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes\n-\n\nLitware plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Deploy Azure Virtual Desktop environments to the East US Azure region for the users in the Boston office and to the South India Azure region for the users in the Chennai office.\n• Implement FSLogix profile containers.\n• Optimize the custom virtual machine images for the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.\n• Use PowerShell to automate the addition of virtual machines to the Azure Virtual Desktop host pools.\n\nRequirements. Performance Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following performance requirements:\n\n• Minimize network latency of the Azure Virtual Desktop connections from the Boston and Chennai offices.\n• Minimize latency of the Azure Virtual Desktop host authentication in each Azure region.\n• Minimize how long it takes to sign in to the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.\n\nRequirements. Authentication Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following authentication requirements:\n\n• Enforce Azure MFA when accessing Azure Virtual Desktop apps.\n• Force users to reauthenticate if their Azure Virtual Desktop session lasts more than eight hours.\n\nRequirements. Security Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following security requirements:\n\n• Explicitly allow traffic between the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts and Microsoft 365.\n• Explicitly allow traffic between the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts and the Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure.\n• Use built-in groups for delegation.\n• Delegate the management of app groups to Admin2, including the ability to publish app groups to users and user groups.\n• Grant Admin1 permissions to manage workspaces, including listing which apps are assigned to the app groups.\n• Minimize administrative effort to manage network security.\n• Use the principle of least privilege.\n\nRequirements. Deployment Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following deployment requirements:\n\n• Use PowerShell to generate the token used to add the virtual machines as session hosts to an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool.\n• Minimize how long it takes to provision the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts based on the custom virtual machine images.\n• Whenever possible, preinstall agents and apps in the custom virtual machine images.\n\n\nUser Profile Requirements\n-\n\nLitware identifies the following user profile requirements:\n\n• In storage1, store user profiles for the Boston office users.\n• Ensure that the user profiles for the Boston office users replicate synchronously between two Azure regions.\n• Ensure that Admin1 uses a local profile only when signing in to the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.\n\n\nYou need to configure a conditional access policy to meet the authentication requirements.\n\nWhat should you include in the policy configuration?

If you look closely, it asks what should be done first. Keep in mind that we don't know if the tenant has Entra ID P1, so we can't be sure if Conditional Access (CA) can be configured.
