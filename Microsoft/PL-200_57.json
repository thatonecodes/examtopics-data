You plan to move the changes to a test environment when they are complete.\nThe changes must meet the following requirements:\n✑ Must be clearly identified so that they are not confused with system components and components from other solutions.\n✑ Must not affect any existing components in the test environment.\nYou need to prepare a solution for deployment to the test environment.\nWhich four actions should you perform in sequence?

Because every solution has a publisher, you should create your own publisher rather than use the default. You specify the publisher when you create a solution.\nStep 2: Create a new unmanaged solution and select the correct publisher unmanaged solution\nUnmanaged solutions are used in development environments while you make changes to your application. Unmanaged solutions can be exported either as unmanaged or managed. Exported unmanaged versions of your solutions should be checked into your source control system. Unmanaged solutions should be considered your source for Microsoft Power Platform assets. When an unmanaged solution is deleted, only the solution container of any customizations included in it is deleted. All the unmanaged customizations remain in effect and belong to the default solution.\nIncorrect:\n* Select a managed solution and the correct publisher\nManaged solutions are used to deploy to any environment that isn't a development environment for that solution. This includes test, UAT, SIT, and production environments. Managed solutions can be serviced independently from other managed solutions in an environment. As an ALM best practice, managed solutions should be generated by exporting an unmanaged solution as managed and considered a build artifact. Additionally:\nYou can't edit components directly within a managed solution.\nStep 3: Add the table top the solution and add the new column.\nStep 4: Run the solution checker on the solution\nUse solution checker to validate your model-driven apps in Power Apps.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/use-powerapps-checker","timestamp":"2022-09-02 11:20:00","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1191109","poster":"jkaur","timestamp":"1728323580.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct"},{"comment_id":"841592","timestamp":"1694919480.0","content":"Correct","poster":"Ikhalil","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"Can anybody explain why its an unmanaged solution and not a managed one?
