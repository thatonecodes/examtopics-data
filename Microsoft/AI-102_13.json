Univariate Anomaly Detection\n\nExplanation:\nSince the system is monitoring temperature data from a data stream, and the goal is to generate alerts based on atypical values (likely unusual temperature readings), Univariate Anomaly Detection is the most suitable solution.\n\nUnivariate Anomaly Detection focuses on identifying anomalies in a single time-series dataset. In this case, temperature data can be considered a univariate time-series, where the system detects unusual or atypical temperature values based on historical trends or thresholds. This minimizes development effort by using a simple approach to detect outliers in one variable (temperature) without requiring complex multi-variable or machine learning models.","poster":"hamidai102","comment_id":"1332378"},{"timestamp":"1733750880.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAt first read, I felt like \"temperature data\" refers to the broader category of any variables included to monitor temperature (such as humidity, elevation, etc).
