Notice under \"View and Create firewall rules the statement: \"By default, inbound connections are blocked unless they match a rule that allows them, and outbound connections are allowed unless they match a rule that blocks them.\nThe user that is not able to load the program is not seeing the ping response from the server, not because he has deliberately set a rule, but because he has not deliberately allowed a rule that would alter the default action. The Echo Request (ICMPv6-In) rule that is blocked by default needs to be allowed. Answer is D."}],"timestamp":"1609325460.0","poster":"slaoui","comment_id":"255534","upvote_count":"3","content":"I think the answer is B. Here's my reasoning: \nThe question says \"If the server replies, the application loads. A user cannot open the application\".\nFor me this means that the server never gets the signal... as in outgoing to the server from the computer. \n\nSince the ping works from another computer, it doesn't seem like the problem comes from receiving part of the computer but from the outgoing part. \n\nSo I'm inclined to go with Beitran, JairoJunior_br and mark491. \nB"},{"content":"Once again, people saying two different answers in the comments.
