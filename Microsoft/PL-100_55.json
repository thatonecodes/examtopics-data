Yes is the correct answer\nSlicer Usage: Slicers in Power BI are used to filter data within a Power BI report. They can be used to filter data based on selected values, but they typically operate within the Power BI report itself. If you want to filter data in the Power BI report based on the context of a selected record in your canvas app, you would need to pass the selected record's information to the Power BI report, and the report should be configured to use that information for filtering."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/121319-exam-pl-100-topic-4-question-23-discussion/","answers_community":["B (67%)","A (33%)"],"answer":"B","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1695567600,"topic":"4","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"95WZ2eB8KxdiTAerIWOx","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Power BI dashboard on a model-driven form.","C":"Power BI dashboard on a model-driven dashboard.","D":"Power BI tile on a model-driven dashboard.","B":"Power BI tile on a model-driven form."},"unix_timestamp":1690452720,"answer_description":"","exam_id":114,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/116589-exam-pl-100-topic-4-question-24-discussion/","isMC":true,"topic":"4","discussion":[{"poster":"MeHungarian","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"964581","content":"I think its D actually","comments":[{"poster":"Net_IT","comments":[{"timestamp":"1703104680.0","content":"Yes I agree with C.","poster":"58117ec","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1101925"}],"timestamp":"1690782360.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"967798","content":"It's C because the requirement is to have 'multiple' visualizations displayed together.\nA Power BI tile as answer D suggests is A 'single' visualization on a dashboard."}],"timestamp":"1690452720.0"}],"timestamp":"2023-07-27 12:12:00","question_id":273,"answer":"C","answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"question_text":"You create a Microsoft Power BI report with multiple visualizations displayed together.\n\nThe report must be available to users in all security roles.\n\nYou need to display the report in a model-driven app.\n\nWhat should you embed?","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"lTnztGIasnpuFQ9zmr0t","isMC":false,"answer":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nA state planning department stores demographic data in a local SQL Server database.\n\nThe department uses a local report server to analyze the data for land development purposes.\n\nYou need to create a visual to display the demographic data.\n\nWhich component should you use?
