Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that you can deploy to your virtual network. This service enables secure and seamless RDP and SSH connections to your virtual machines via TLS directly in the Azure portal. When connecting through Azure Bastion, your virtual machines do not require a public IP address, agent, or special client software.\n\nBastion provides secure RDP and SSH connections to all virtual machines in the virtual network where the service is deployed. Using Azure Bastion prevents your virtual machines from making RDP and SSH ports publicly available. At the same time, we continue to enable secure access via RDP/SSH.\n\nAzure Bastion requires a subnet called AzureBastionSubnet within your virtual network. The subnet must have at least the subnet mask /27, or be larger.\n\nThe following Microsoft Docs articles contain more information on the topic:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/tutorial-create-host-portal\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/tutorial-create-host-portal","comment_id":"592994"},{"poster":"cirspass","content":"why subnet is /27，30 I think it so!
