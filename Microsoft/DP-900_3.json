This article summarizes the basics of the access control model for Data Lake Storage Gen2.\n\nACLs are applied on the file and folder level. The key thing to remember is that you are always going to need RBAC Control Plane permissions in combination with ACLs. Best practice is to assign your security principals RBAC Reader role on the Storage Account/Container level and continue with more restrictive ACLs on the file and folder level.\n\nThere are two types of ACLs:\n\nAccess ACLs: They control access to an object. An object can be a file or a folder.\n\nDefault ACLs: These are ACLs assigned on the folder level only which get inherited as Access ACLs by the child file or folder.","poster":"GetulioJr","comment_id":"379758","timestamp":"1639229640.0","upvote_count":"31"},{"content":"option B","poster":"AGTraining","timestamp":"1724934540.0","comment_id":"1162686","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1709754000.0","poster":"AZFabio","comment_id":"1000853","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nData Lake Storage is correct"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707055980.0","comment_id":"972125","poster":"akhil5432","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAZ data alke"},{"timestamp":"1693790940.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect Answer","poster":"chiiiweiii","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"828636"},{"comment_id":"813929","poster":"Joanna0","timestamp":"1692432120.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control-model#role-based-access-control-azure-rbac"},{"timestamp":"1675214940.0","comment_id":"640269","upvote_count":"4","content":"01/08.......EXAM","poster":"Drchattss"},{"comment_id":"607466","content":"correct","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1669445820.0","poster":"somsunu"},{"comment_id":"598916","timestamp":"1667985120.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"CORRECT","poster":"print_HelloWorld"},{"timestamp":"1667645400.0","poster":"pimni","content":"correct","comment_id":"597209","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Xuitex","timestamp":"1666600800.0","comment_id":"590943","content":"Correct","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1666448040.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"590053","poster":"roshanazMaster"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"583357","poster":"Teamdev","content":"for sure, it's correct","timestamp":"1665327360.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAppeared on the exam on 03/22/2022\nAnswer is correct!","comment_id":"572757","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1663824360.0","poster":"SiDoCiOuS"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"B IS CORRECT","poster":"Nikhil1702","timestamp":"1659102420.0","comment_id":"535558"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect","upvote_count":"2","poster":"sounakroy","comment_id":"530464","timestamp":"1658567220.0"},{"poster":"Kevin1221","timestamp":"1656828960.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect answer","comment_id":"515484"},{"content":"Correct answer B","poster":"Koph","comment_id":"504584","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1655597640.0"},{"timestamp":"1633622640.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"NavySteel","comment_id":"330514","content":"B is correct."},{"comment_id":"321670","timestamp":"1632721500.0","content":"It's correct.
