Typically this type of setting would be done as an environment variable. The only thing that makes me hesitate is this line: The connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database. Nothing stops you calling this code each time the connection is needed. In that way the connection string will not be stored in any of the variable types listed. But that is a big overhead. If you wanted to store the connection string between requests it must be stored in one of these variables types. query string is the least secure, and I would never consider it for this type of value as it exposes parts of the application to an attacker. I would select session, because session can still be updated, and is more secure than both query and viewstate. I would think twice about setting as an environment variable because of the line above that states that the connection changes frequently.
