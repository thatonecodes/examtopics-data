Each box contains 12 pieces. Each pallet contains 144 pieces.\n\nThe base unit of measure is the smallest unit of measure that is used to track inventory. In this case, the base unit of measure is pieces.\n\nAn item unit of measure is a unit of measure that is used to sell or purchase an item. In this case, the item unit of measure is a box.\n\nThe quantity per unit is the number of base units of measure that are in one item unit of measure. In this case, the quantity per unit is 12.\n\nTherefore, the correct way to assign the unit of measures is to create Pieces as a base unit of measure and add Box as an item unit of measure with the quantity per unit set to 12.","comment_id":"900542","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1681911960.0","poster":"NA1926","content":"Selected Answer: C\ncorrect","comment_id":"874732","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","comment_id":"870122","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1681468020.0","poster":"emina_pasic"},{"timestamp":"1676625840.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"essdee91","comment_id":"811686","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe wording on some of these questions are terrible, C is correct."},{"comment_id":"808577","timestamp":"1676392320.0","poster":"essdee91","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct.
