If you want to create a lock at a parent level, select the parent. The currently selected resource inherits the lock from the parent. For example, you could lock the resource group to apply a lock to all its resources.\n3) Give the lock a name and lock level.

According to AI traditional Azure VM doesn't offer auto-allocation. Here is the answer I've got:\n\nIn summary, while traditional Azure VMs do not support automatic memory allocation after deployment due to their fixed nature based on selected sizes, there are several mechanisms within Azure’s ecosystem—such as Virtual Machine Scale Sets, AKS for containerized applications, and serverless computing with Azure Functions—that facilitate dynamic scaling and efficient resource utilization according to workload demands.","comment_id":"1306615","poster":"rankocertified"}],"timestamp":"1729634820.0","poster":"DixonDavis","content":"Can the memory gets autoallocated ?
