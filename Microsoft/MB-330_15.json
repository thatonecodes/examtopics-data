Create a manual quality order for existing inventory. (Complete solution: triggers testing directly.) C. Assign brakes to an inventory status that is blocked.

Automatic quality orders are typically configured via quality associations tied to events like product receipts or production completions, not for existing stock.

Create an automatic quality order for existing inventory.\nYou can create an automatic quality order for existing inventory as part of the production order to assemble the bike using existing inventory, or at the picking or packing of the sales order before the finished bike leaves the warehouse. You just cant automatically create a quality order based on an inventory journal. \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/inventory/quality-associations\nNeither a Phantom BOM line or assigning a blocked inventory status represent a complete solution that would generate a quality order."},{"comments":[{"poster":"H_Incandenza","comment_id":"1040986","content":"Please explain, step by step, how to create an automatic quality order for existing inventory.\n\nI'm not saying it's impossible, just that, I can't seem to make it work.
