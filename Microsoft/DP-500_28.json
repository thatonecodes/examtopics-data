It takes an expression as its first argument that defines the measure to be calculated, and one or more filter expressions as its subsequent arguments.

Currently, the customers can access all the data.\nContoso has one Power BI workspace named FinData that contains a single dataset. The dataset contains financial data from around the world. The workspace is used by 10 internal users and one external customer. The dataset has the following two data sources: the data warehouse and the Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool.\nUsers frequently query the Synapse Analytics workspace by using Transact-SQL.\n\nUser Problems -\nContoso identifies the following user issues:\nSome users indicate that the visuals in Power BI reports are slow to render when making filter selections.\nUsers indicate that queries against the serverless SQL pool fail occasionally because the size of tempdb has been exceeded.\nUsers indicate that the data in Power BI reports is stale. You discover that the refresh process of the Power BI model occasionally times out.\n\nPlanned Changes -\nContoso plans to implement the following changes:\nInto the existing Power BI dataset, integrate an external data source in JSON that is accessible by using the REST API.\nBuild a new dataset in the FinData workspace by using data from the Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool.\nProvide all the customers with their own Power BI workspace to create their own reports. Each workspace will use the new dataset in the FinData workspace.\nImplement subscription levels for the customers. Each subscription level will provide access to specific rows of financial data.\nDeploy prebuilt datasets to Power BI to simplify the query experience of the customers.\nProvide internal users with the ability to incorporate machine learning models loaded to the dedicated SQL pool.\nYou need to recommend a solution to resolve the query issue of the serverless SQL pool. The solution must minimize impact on the users.\nWhat should you in the recommendation?","unix_timestamp":1670872620,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1670872620.0","comment_id":"743245","poster":"nbagchi","content":"Correct"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Akin_Eren","comment_id":"1116586","timestamp":"1704714720.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\ni would go with option D as well, because updating statics is not a certain solution as we don't know if there is any change on tables as statistics changes require"},{"poster":"metiii","comments":[{"timestamp":"1704500520.0","content":"I might agree with this one.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"reignreign03","comment_id":"1114856"}],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nUsing a dedicated SQL Pool or Apache Spark Pool will probably resolve the issue but they would have a huge impact on the user, you should consider that part of the question otherwise you are ignoring it completely.

By executing the sp_set_process_data_limit stored procedure, the size of tempdb can be controlled, preventing it from being exceeded and causing queries to fail occasionally. This stored procedure limits the amount of data that can be processed by each query, and it can be set at the query level or the session level.
