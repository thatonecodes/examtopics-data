Hybrid Environment\n\nProseware has an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forest named corp.proseware.com that syncs with a Microsoft Entra tenant named proseware.com.\n\nProseware has an Azure subscription that is linked to proseware.com.\n\nProseware has an internal certification authority (CA).\n\nExisting Environment. Network Infrastructure\n\nThe offices contain the resources shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nNYCNet connects to Azure by using an ExpressRoute circuit.\n\nSFONet connects to Azure by using a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.\n\nExisting Environment. Azure Resources\n\nThe Azure subscription contains the virtual networks and subnets shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe subscription contains four virtual machines named VM1, VM2, VM3, and VM4. VM1 and VM2 host an app named App1.\n\nVM3 and VM4 host a web app named App2 that is accessed by using a FQDN of app2.proseware.com. Users access app2.proseware.com by using HTTP or HTTPS.\n\nVM1, VM2, and VM4 are connected to SpokeVNet.\n\nThe subscription contains Application Gateway resources shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe subscription contains an Azure Front Door Standard profile named FD1. FD1 contains a single origin group that targets APPGW1 by using the default endpoint name.\n\nHubVNet connects to NYCNet by using an ExpressRoute gateway named ERGW1.\n\nPlanned Changes and Requirements. Planned Changes\n\nProseware plans to implement the following changes:\n\nâ€¢ Deploy an Azure Private DNS Resolver named PRDNS1 to HubVNet and link PRDNS1 to SpokeVNet.\nâ€¢ Create a DNS forwarding ruleset named DNSRS1 and associate DNSRS1 with PRDNS1.\nâ€¢ Deploy Azure Virtual Network Manager and implement the following rules:\n- Allow inbound connections on TCP port 3389 from the on-premises networks to SUBNET-JUMPHOSTS.\n- Block inbound connections on TCP port 80 from the internet to SpokeVNet.\nâ€¢ Ensure that Azure Virtual Network Manager rules take precedence over conflicting NSG rules.\nâ€¢ Deploy two network virtual appliances (NVAs) named NVA1 and NVA2 to HubVNet.\nâ€¢ Deploy a gateway load balancer named LBGW1 to HubVNet.\nâ€¢ Configure LBGW1 to inspect traffic on TCP ports 443, 1433, and 1434 from LBS1 by using NVA1 and NVA2.\nâ€¢ Ensure that all the traffic to App2 is processed by using FD1.\n\nPlanned Changes and Requirements. Connectivity requirements\n\nProseware identifies the following connectivity requirements:\n\nâ€¢ Minimize the complexity of the Azure Virtual Network Manager deployment.\nâ€¢ Route traffic between NYCNet and SFONet via the ExpressRoute circuit and the S2S VPN.\nâ€¢ Ensure that remote users on Windows 11 devices can connect to HubVNet by using a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN and their proseware.com credentials.\n\nPlanned Changes and Requirements. Security requirements\n\nProseware identifies the following security requirements:\n\nâ€¢ Whenever possible, use the internal CA.\nâ€¢ Ensure that all connections routed via APPGW1 use end-to-end encryption.\nâ€¢ Ensure that user connections to Azure-hosted apps use end-to-end encryption.\nâ€¢ Ensure that all inbound internet traffic to app2.proseware.com is routed via FD1.\nâ€¢ Prevent devices that connect to NYCNet from accessing Azure services that use private endpoints.\nâ€¢ Enable the virtual machines that connect to HubVNet and SpokeVNet to access Azure services that use private endpoints.\n\nPlanned Changes and Requirements. General requirements\n\nProseware identifies the following general requirements:\n\nâ€¢ Minimize the IP address space required to deploy platform-managed resources to the virtual networks.\nâ€¢ From SpokeVNet, resolve name resolution requests for the azure.proseware.com namespace and the corp.proseware.com namespace by using PRDNS1.\nâ€¢ Whenever possible, minimize administrative effort.\n\n\nYou need to configure connectivity between NYCNet and SFONet. The solution must meet the connectivity requirements.\n\nWhat should you do? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","answer":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image603.png"],"timestamp":"2025-02-13 15:42:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/156454-exam-az-700-topic-2-question-100-discussion/","question_id":65,"discussion":[{"poster":"northgaterebel","content":"For HubVNet: Deploy an Azure Route Server\nFor VPNGW1: Configure active-active mode\n\n\"If you want to use transit routing between ExpressRoute and VPN, ...
