It allows you to execute PowerShell scripts on non-Windows operating systems, including macOS.\n\nmacOS: With PowerShell Core installed, a macOS computer can run PowerShell scripts just like a Windows machine.\n\nSince the solution involves running the PowerShell script from a macOS computer with PowerShell Core 6.0 installed, this configuration meets the goal of running a PowerShell script to create Azure resources."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721651580.0","content":"WIth Powershell Core for Mac OS you need to import Azure module.

No\n\nPowerShell Core 6.0 is not officially supported on macOS. While PowerShell Core is cross-platform and can run on macOS, the specific version 6.0 mentioned in the solution is outdated, and it's recommended to use a newer version for compatibility and support reasons.\n\nAdditionally, while PowerShell Core is cross-platform, certain Azure PowerShell modules or cmdlets may have dependencies or limitations specific to Windows environments.\n\nTherefore, the recommended approach would be to run the PowerShell script from a computer running Windows with a supported version of PowerShell installed, such as Windows PowerShell or PowerShell 7.x (PowerShell Core).
