A priority can only be specified once, but is supported on both the class and method level, with method level taking precedence over class level.\nThe Owner attribute, SysTestOwner, has also been added. This attribute was technically already supported for filtering in the Test Toolbox window, but the attribute itself was missing in X++. Similar to Priority, an owner can only be specified once and is supported on both the class and method level, with the method level taking precedence.\nSysTestProperty specifies a property and a value (two strings), and can now be used in the Test Toolbox window in Visual Studio.
