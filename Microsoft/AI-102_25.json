In this case, the Custom Vision model will be trained to classify the entire image as \"good\" or \"defective.\" Classification is suitable if you want a binary answer.\nObject Detection: You use object detection when you want to identify and locate specific defects or objects within an image. This is useful if you have multiple defect classes or if you want to identify the exact location of defects within a component.\nSo, if you only need to distinguish between good and defective components, classification may suffice. However, if you need to identify and locate specific defects within components, you should opt for object detection.
