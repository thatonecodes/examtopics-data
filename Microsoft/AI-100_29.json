No\n\nEnabling Model data collection does not directly address the goal of monitoring the compute performance of the AI models deployed in a production environment.\n\nModel data collection is a feature in Azure Machine Learning that allows you to collect data about model invocations, inputs, and outputs for the purpose of model monitoring and analysis. It helps you understand how the model is performing and identify any issues or deviations from expected behavior.\n\nHowever, to monitor the compute performance of the models, you would need to utilize other monitoring mechanisms, such as Azure Monitor, which provides comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics capabilities for Azure resources, including Azure Machine Learning.

From the Azure Application Insights page, you can use Application Insights for monitoring output data, responses, requests stats, exceptions, failure rates, dependency rates, etc. Although \"output data\" sounds convincing, this is very different from \"compute performance\", which is what we want to monitor. Collecting output data doesn't necessarily tell us about model performance. Model data collection, on the other hand, allows for tracking \"data drift\", which is how the performance of your model is changing over time, so I would say this is probably what is meant by monitoring \"compute performance\".
