Each region can have many webspaces, but your app can only move between plans that are created in the same webspace. An App Service Environment is an isolated webspace, so apps can be moved between plans in the same App Service Environment, but not between plans in different App Service Environments.\n\nYou can’t specify the webspace you want when creating a plan, but it’s possible to ensure that a plan is created in the same webspace as an existing plan. In brief, all plans created with the same resource group and region combination are deployed into the same webspace. For example, if you created a plan in resource group A and region B, then any plan you subsequently create in resource group A and region B is deployed into the same webspace. Note that plans can’t move webspaces after they’re created, so you can’t move a plan into “the same webspace” as another plan by moving it to another resource group.","poster":"arunpaul"}],"content":"Azure App Service Plan is restricted to geographies and regions.
