Microsoft Defender for Identity.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Identity (previously known as Azure Advanced Threat Protection) is a cloud-based security solution that leverages user behavioral analytics and machine learning to identify and detect suspicious activities in on-premises Active Directory environments. It can provide insights into the use of insecure protocols like NTLMv1, SMB1, and unsigned LDAP, which can help to identify and prevent security threats.\n\nThreat Intelligence - TAXII, Azure Active Directory, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud are other types of data connectors available in Microsoft Sentinel, but they are not directly relevant to the security requirement of identifying all connections to the domain controllers that use insecure protocols.","poster":"SuradjBajaj","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1709988360.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think is correct\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/data-connectors/microsoft-defender-for-identity","comment_id":"833701","poster":"nefaxto","timestamp":"1709971920.0"},{"timestamp":"1701841680.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOK this damn queston is hard- so the answer is A- but i may also be missing something - \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/data/sentinel-threat-intelligence\nGoogle this term and see what you get microsoft sentinel data connectors for threat protection- there are only 2 connectors for threat protection- thats why I chose A . - ITs A or D but I havent decided which i will answer on the test -","poster":"joehoesofat","comment_id":"736546","upvote_count":"3"}],"exam_id":61,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (86%)","14%"],"timestamp":"2022-09-28 18:06:00","answer":"D","topic":"6","question_text":"You are planning the deployment of Microsoft Sentinel.\nWhich type of Microsoft Sentinel data connector should you use to meet the security requirements?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/83936-exam-az-801-topic-6-question-4-discussion/"},{"id":"BQ7tcTeFQ08VOEbJ9Lyt","answers_community":[],"topic":"7","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04226/0001500001.jpg"],"unix_timestamp":1665157500,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/84632-exam-az-801-topic-7-question-1-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-10-07 17:45:00","isMC":false,"answer_ET":"","discussion":[{"content":"Correct.\n\"You can configure BitLocker to automatically unlock volumes that do not host an operating system.\" (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/bitlocker/enable-bitlockerautounlock?view=windowsserver2022-ps)\nAlso, BitLocker is available on NTFS as well as ReFS, see the first link provided: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/refs/refs-overview","upvote_count":"9","timestamp":"1712504700.0","comment_id":"688769","poster":"GoforIT21"},{"content":"C, D, E & F\nD, E & F","timestamp":"1739003520.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"BlackCat9588","comment_id":"1353294"},{"poster":"syu31svc","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"886100","timestamp":"1730464860.0","content":"For BitLocker, volumes formatted with the Resilient File System (ReFS) on Windows Server 2016 and later versions can also be encrypted\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/bitlocker/enable-bitlockerautounlock?view=windowsserver2022-ps\n\nYou can configure BitLocker to automatically unlock volumes that do not host an operating system\n\nAnswer is correct"}],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04226/0001600001.jpg"],"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou need to configure BitLocker on Server4.\nOn which volumes can you turn on BitLocker, and on which volumes can you turn on auto-unlock?
