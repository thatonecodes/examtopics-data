By modifying this policy, you can specify which apps (including third-party and custom apps) users are allowed to install and interact with in Microsoft Teams. If an app is not included in this policy, users won't be able to see it or use it.\n\n- **Global App Setup Policy**: This policy controls which apps are pinned to the app bar in Teams and in what order they appear. By modifying this policy, you can customize the user's navigation experience in Teams by pinning specific apps to the app bar.\n\nIn summary, the app permission policy controls **what apps users can use**, while the app setup policy controls **how apps are displayed** to users in Teams."},{"content":"I think the Answer A is correct. question says what should you modify.
