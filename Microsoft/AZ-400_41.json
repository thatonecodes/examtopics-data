By adding an Azure Key Vault task to the pipeline, you can retrieve the necessary secrets from the key vault at runtime and use them in the pipeline. This way, you can ensure that sensitive information is not hardcoded in the pipeline or checked into source control, which can pose a security risk. Instead, you can use the Azure Key Vault task to retrieve the secrets dynamically during pipeline execution.","timestamp":"1676290620.0","comment_id":"807364","poster":"fkaracan"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","poster":"JYKL88","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"752910","timestamp":"1671672180.0"},{"poster":"syu31svc","comment_id":"646681","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1660470420.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/key-vault-parameter?tabs=azure-cli\n\n\"Instead of putting a secure value (like a password) directly in your template or parameter file, you can retrieve the value from an Azure Key Vault during a deployment.\"\n\nD is correct"},{"content":"Correction, Azure Key Vault reference from ARM to access the secret from the Azure Key Vault","poster":"Govcomm","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"635164","timestamp":"1658485920.0"},{"timestamp":"1658485860.0","poster":"Govcomm","content":"Azure Key Vault for the secret","comment_id":"635163","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"632440","timestamp":"1658027580.0","poster":"Dileep75","content":"I think C & D will do the job","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"608040","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\n(c)lear","poster":"us3r","timestamp":"1653648900.0"},{"poster":"rdemontis","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"569710","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn my opinion D is the best answer because the requirement is to minimize the likelihood that infrastructure credentials will be leaked.
