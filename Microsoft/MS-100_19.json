Here's why.\n\nIn SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, the search index is built up by crawling the content on your sites. The crawler picks up content and metadata from the documents in the form of crawled properties. The search schema helps the crawler decide what content and metadata to pick up. Examples of metadata are the author and the title of a document. However, to get the content and metadata from the documents into the search index, the crawled properties must be mapped to managed properties. Only managed properties are kept in the index. For example, a crawled property related to author is mapped to a managed property related to author.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/protect-documents-that-have-fci-or-other-properties?view=o365-worldwide","comments":[{"upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"145602","timestamp":"1595928300.0","content":"Answer: A\nExplanation\nYour organization might use Windows Server FCI to identify documents with personally identifiable information (PII) such as social security numbers, and then classify the document by setting the Personally Identifiable Information property to High, Moderate, Low, Public, or Not PII based on the type and number of occurrences of PII found in the document.

Unallowed actions, like apps trying to access a network resource or Windows Information Protection protected data, are allowed but audited. Silent mode is good choice for more open IT environments or where large groups of users, like testers or application developers, have legitimate reasons to perform actions that might be blocked under other circumstances. Silent mode is also good to use when an organization is thinking about implementing Allow Overrides or Hide Overrides mode, because the event log will offer information about the number of overridden or blocked events that implementing Windows Information Protection will cause.","timestamp":"1580634420.0","poster":"Goofer","comment_id":"45778"},{"timestamp":"1579293240.0","comment_id":"40224","poster":"LMcM","upvote_count":"1","content":"After reading the doc files on this, I think it should log on App1 (which is protected), and App3 (assuming this is under WIP silent - which doesn't enforce but still logs), and App2 is exempt where there should not be logging."},{"content":"The file is created from App 1, so it doesn't trigger the policy when it's open in any way.\nFor the second selection, it does trigger the policy because the policy applies to App1.","timestamp":"1579280520.0","poster":"steven1","comment_id":"40166","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Moji1","comment_id":"37238","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"timestamp":"1579136040.0","content":"actually I was thinking the other way - 2 is exempt from the policy so I didn't think it would log on 1 or 2 but would log on App 3","comment_id":"39569","poster":"ExamStudy68","upvote_count":"13","comments":[{"comment_id":"198900","timestamp":"1602556260.0","content":"Yes, basically the same question as in MS-101https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/13686-exam-ms-101-topic-3-question-34-discussion/\n\nYou can open File1 from : App1, App2 and App3\nIf you open File1 in App1, App2 and App3, an action will be logged for : App3 ONLY","upvote_count":"9","poster":"VTHAR"}]}],"content":"App 1 is protected, App 2 is exempted and App 3 is not in the scope of this WIP policy.
