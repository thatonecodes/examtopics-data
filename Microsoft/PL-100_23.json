They might be overkill for your needs if you're only storing a single risk score.\n\nLookups are typically used to retrieve data from another data source, not to store it temporarily like you're doing with your risk score.\n\nSo in this case, your formula on the button click would set a context variable to the calculated risk score, which could then be referenced elsewhere on the screen.\n\nRemember that the exact implementation of this might depend on the specific programming language or framework you're using to build your app.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Edriska","comments":[{"poster":"laysmuncher","content":"bro you are everywhere","comment_id":"1041308","comments":[{"comment_id":"1076461","content":"I think its a chatgpt thing he is using","poster":"MeHungarian","timestamp":"1700585040.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1697080260.0"},{"poster":"devoprevo","comment_id":"975886","content":"\"The submit button will calculate a risk score for the project and return to the previous screen\"\n\nyou need a global variable.","upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1691515980.0"}]},{"upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"timestamp":"1682627940.0","content":"I disagree that it doesn't discuss the variable on different screens.\n\nIt says: \"The submit button will calculate a risk score for the project and return to the previous screen with that risk score\"\n\nWhile back() is ideal, navigate() is the next best option that works just fine.\n\nThe answer provided is correct","comment_id":"883038","poster":"Fergzoid","upvote_count":"5"}],"content":"Navigate cannot be used with Global variables.
