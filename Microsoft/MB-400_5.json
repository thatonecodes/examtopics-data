The reason is twofold.\n\n1: The question states that YOU need to CONFIGURE THE SECURITY to meet the requirement. Saying to users to share a record may work, but this is the user making use of the sharing feature in the application. It is NOT you configuring the security.\n\n2: There is a security implication with sharing records with users, when the requirement focuses on departments. What happens if, during the course of an opportunity, a user switches department? Well, they would still have the record shared with them when they move to the 3rd department, breaking the requirement that only 2 departments would have access.\n\nB is therefore correct.","timestamp":"1608113520.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"poster":"proceSorI","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1608028500.0","content":"The correct answer is B.\nHowever, there are times when two departments need to work together on an opportunity.\nIt's explicitly mentioned \"two departnemts\"","comment_id":"244476"},{"poster":"jkaur","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is A","timestamp":"1607615160.0","comment_id":"240289"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"212730","poster":"Thomson","timestamp":"1604495820.0","content":"I think the trick in this question is, that they don’t ask for the most efficient way.
