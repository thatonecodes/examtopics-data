Configure a registry entry on Server1.\n\nTo prevent private details in the telemetry data from being transmitted to Microsoft, you can configure a registry entry on Server1. This can be done by creating a new registry entry with the name \"AllowTelemetry\" in the following registry key:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DataCollection\n\nThe value of the \"AllowTelemetry\" registry entry should be set to 0, which disables the transmission of telemetry data to Microsoft.\n\nOption A, \"run readinessreportcreator.exe,\" is not relevant to preventing private details in telemetry data from being transmitted to Microsoft.\n\nOption C, \"configure a registry entry on the computers,\" would not be effective in this scenario because the telemetry data is being collected on Server1, not the client computers.\n\nOption D, \"run tdadm.exe\" is not relevant to preventing private details in telemetry data from being transmitted to Microsoft.","timestamp":"1678838400.0"},{"content":"B. Configure a registry entry on Server1.\n\nTo prevent private details in the telemetry data from being transmitted to Microsoft, you can configure a registry entry on the server that hosts the telemetry database (Server1) to control the data that is collected and sent. This can be done by modifying the registry keys that control the telemetry settings on the server. This will prevent private data from being sent to Microsoft while still allowing the server to collect and store telemetry data for your organization.","timestamp":"1674294600.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Do you have a link for this?","poster":"EM1234","comment_id":"834143","timestamp":"1678377300.0"}],"poster":"Josty","comment_id":"783149","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1669982340.0","content":"This is indeed some strange question.
