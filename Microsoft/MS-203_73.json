In fact Recipient Management shouldn't be able to assign a license. Furthermore, if you assign an E5 license to a new cloud user, it will automatically create a mailbox. So the whole Admin1 scenario is absurd.\nNow to the admin audit logs in EXCH 2019 - they will record any actions taken to modify objects in an Exchange organization by default. THIS exactly is what Forkbeard reports in his test, so I presume either he does it on EXCH 2019 or EXO is following the 2019 principle - in which case the online documentation regarding excluded verbs is not correct.\nSoooo, you either answer what happens in reality, or you answer what you read in theory.\nI'm afraid, that the \"correct\" answer will be the theory, simply because that's how the exam questions are created on the first place."},{"content":"Ok so I tested this.
