FSLogix application masking\n\nFSLogix application masking allows you to control which applications are visible to users based on group membership. This way, you can install both App1 and App2 on all session hosts, but only users in the sales department will see App1, and only users in the research department will see App2. This approach meets all your requirements and minimizes administrative effort."},{"timestamp":"1730361360.0","poster":"Bonesurfer","upvote_count":"4","content":"A\nUsing FSLogix application masking allows specific applications to be visible to only authorized users. In this scenario, it enables App1 to be visible only to the sales department and App2 to only the research department.\n\nRemoteApp application groups are typically used to publish specific applications directly to users rather than providing a full desktop session.
