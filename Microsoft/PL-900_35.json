You can see the model metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and evaluate how well the model performs on different scenarios.\n\nPublished - Use the model in Power Apps and Power Automate: You can use the model in Power Apps and Power Automate after it has been published. Publishing a model makes it available for prediction in your apps and flows. You can also share the model with other users in your environment.\n\nDraft - Build the model and add data: You can build the model and add data when the model is in the draft state. This is the initial state of the model when you create it. You can choose the model type, name the model, and upload or select the data you want to use for training.","poster":"rmeng","timestamp":"1731664800.0","comment_id":"1071291","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"fizzikkz","comment_id":"1066402","timestamp":"1731155040.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Trained \nPublished\nDraft"},{"timestamp":"1730992680.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1064926","poster":"rmeng","content":"Trained\nPublished\nTrained"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1003515","poster":"PRash3566","content":"Having an exam tomorrow.
