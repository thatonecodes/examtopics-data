Furthermore, access from the on-premises network must necessarily take place with MFA. Although I don't understand the meaning of this scenario, I don't see how a sign-in risk policy can be applied as the reliability of the origin of access to the azure portal would be calculated by Azure itself and not by us. How does Azure understand that access is from a different network than the corporate one? To do this, you need to configure the location. But at that point what need do we have to use a sign-in risk policy? Just configure Conditions to set up an allowed location and set GRANT to request MFA.
