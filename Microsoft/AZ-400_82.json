The easiest way to do this is to add an ARM template deployment task to Pipeline1 that assigns Policy1 to Subscription1.\n\nTo do this, create an ARM template that includes a policy assignment resource that references Policy1. Then, add an ARM template deployment task to Pipeline1 that deploys this template to Subscription1.\n\nThe task should be configured to only deploy the policy assignment resource, rather than the entire ARM template, to reduce the impact on other resources in Subscription1.
