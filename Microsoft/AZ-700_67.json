The subscription contains multiple Azure SQL Database resources and a virtual network named VNet1 that has five subnets. All the subnets are associated with a network security group (NSG) named NSG1. NSG1 blocks all outbound traffic, unless specifically allowed by a rule.\n\nEach subnet contains 50 virtual machines. Multiple virtual machines host instances of SQL Server on Virtual Machines and will be configured to replicate with the Azure SQL Database resources.\n\nYou need to configure a new outbound rule in NSG1 to allow the SQL Server on Virtual Machines instances to connect to the Azure SQL Database resources. The solution must meet the following requirements:\n\n• Minimize modifications to NSG1 when additional instances of SQL Server on Virtual Machines are deployed.\n• Ensure that only SQL Server on Virtual Machines instances can connect to the Azure SQL Database resources.\n\nHow should you configure each setting for the new outbound rule? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/155334-exam-az-700-topic-5-question-40-discussion/","isMC":false},{"id":"ben91N9MCeSiouNDxJOm","unix_timestamp":1734852420,"choices":{"B":"storage1 in the East US Azure region only","C":"storage1 and storage2 in the East US Azure region only","D":"storage1 and storage2 in the East US Azure region and their replicas in the paired region","A":"storage1 in the East US Azure region and its replica in the paired region"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-12-22 08:27:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1336845","poster":"pringlez28","timestamp":"1736104260.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\n\"RA-GRS secondary access is automatically allowed if the primary account is listed.\"\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoint-policies-overview"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"sismer","timestamp":"1736053800.0","comment_id":"1336632","content":"Selected Answer: A\nreplica will get access automatically"},{"poster":"Asheesh22","comment_id":"1330302","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1734852420.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt will allow automatic access of its Replica"}],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image568.png"],"question_id":332,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/153314-exam-az-700-topic-5-question-41-discussion/","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":58,"question_text":"You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nYou create a service endpoint policy that has the following settings:\n\n• Associated subnets: Subnet1\n• Service: Microsoft.Storage\n• Scope: Single account\n• Resource: storage1\n\nWhich resources can VM1 access?","answer_description":"","topic":"5"},{"id":"7NkmJhOinepEFVTz8RND","answer_description":"","question_id":333,"question_text":"You have the resources shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nYou need to protect the virtual machines by using Azure DDoS Network Protection plans.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of DDoS Network Protection plans you should deploy?","isMC":true,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image580.png"],"topic":"5","answer":"A","discussion":[{"poster":"4d1c008","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nNo sure why the answer is showing up as more than one, but it will be just 1 per subscription.","comment_id":"1399395","timestamp":"1742155620.0"},{"poster":"Saba53","timestamp":"1739546820.0","comment_id":"1356478","content":"Selected Answer: A\nShould be 1","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nFor DDoS Network Protection, under a tenant, a single DDoS protection plan can be used across multiple subscriptions, so there's no need to create more than one DDoS protection plan.
