Clearly it is not A or D. ETL process can be run in parallel to save time. While data is being extracted, a transformation process could be working on data already received and prepare it for loading, and a loading process can begin working on the prepared data, rather than waiting for the entire extraction process to complete. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/etl). This suggests that C is also incorrect.\nThis leaves B. By the book, this would be correct for ELT but appears incorrect for ETL because the transformation process occurs in an isolated specialized engine prior to loading. However, in reality, a lot of older ETL routines are actually ELT based on their infrastructure.
