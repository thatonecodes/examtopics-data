The link below mentions the login method having that \"echo GITHUB_TOKEN\" language. GITHUB_TOKEN is a installation access token, kind of like a PAT.

The article is about pushing containers, so its assuming the container is built already. But of the remaining options, 2 are other login methods and 1 is a pull, which we dont need to do when deploying. So build must be the other option used, and it goes before the push. Usually it goes docker login, docker build, docker push.\n\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry","poster":"mfawew223","comment_id":"1083817","upvote_count":"7"},{"timestamp":"1704401580.0","comments":[{"content":"Would it not be possible to build before login?
