This question intentionally lacks detail. If your company has a warehouse dedicated to vendor owned goods, a transfer would make sense. This would also make sense in terms of ownership change. If the need is for replenishment for immediate consumption upon receipt, then you wouldn't utilize a transfer. You wouldn't confirm the order (you would confirm delivery date) The vendor delivers, you receive, ownership change, consumption.\nAll this to say, this question is terrible. It could be a couple different combinations, all of which are missing something key and would need to be replaced with a less than ideal or poorly worded option.","comment_id":"1190513","poster":"Elyse0814","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1712422320.0"},{"timestamp":"1673601960.0","comment_id":"774289","poster":"alfi22190","upvote_count":"1","content":"answer is correct"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1652948700.0","comment_id":"603723","poster":"PrzemoK","content":"From physical point of view that is correct. but from the system point of view there is no such step as transfer from vendor WH, so in this case the process should end by posting the vendor invoice (on automatically created PO after changing ownership)"},{"comment_id":"534497","poster":"Labtecoza","comments":[{"poster":"Labtecoza","content":"It is used for consumption so ignore the second part","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"534499","timestamp":"1643353800.0"}],"timestamp":"1643353740.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Bit of a weird question, no?\n\n\"Transfer\" is worded poorly, as they imply an inventory transfer.\nThere's also no consumption to warrant an ownership change?"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer would be:\n1. create replenishment order\n2. confirm the order\n3. do product receipt\n4. change the ownership","poster":"jenico","comments":[{"timestamp":"1645359000.0","comment_id":"551753","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"603761","content":"I tested goods receipt and had to confirm the PO before a receipt could be processed.
