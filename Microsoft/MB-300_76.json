It allows for seamless integration and synchronization of transactional data across multiple systems, providing a consolidated view of the data.\n\n2. For synchronizing data for reporting: Entity store\nEntity store is a feature in Dynamics 365 Finance that allows you to create a denormalized, optimized database for reporting purposes.
