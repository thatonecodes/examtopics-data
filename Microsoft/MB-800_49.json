Step 2 from COA does not flow logically to step 3, as the the Account Type Default Dimension is not opened from COA. If the answer is trying to assign specific Default Dimension Value against specific G/L Account, then step 3 should be \"open Default Dimensions and select the customer source dimension code\", which is not an option.\n\nMy answer would be:\n1. Create a dimension code to identify the customer source\n2. Create dimension values for the customer source dimension code\n3.

Configuration template: Configuration templates in Dynamics 365 Business Central can be used to streamline the process of creating new customers. You can set up a template with common settings and then use that template each time you create a new customer. This can help ensure consistency and accuracy in your customer data.\n\nD. Permissions: You'll also need to configure permissions to ensure that only authorized users can create new customers. In Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can set up permission sets that define what actions a user or group of users can perform. You can then assign these permission sets to your users.\n\nThe other options (A: Responsibility center and B: Configuration worksheet) are not typically used for configuring the new customer creation process in Dynamics 365 Business Central.","poster":"ivanrlg"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\ncorrect","poster":"NA1926","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1728656880.0","comment_id":"867396"},{"content":"C,D is correct.","timestamp":"1692441240.0","poster":"KateTs","comment_id":"550901","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"532147","timestamp":"1690283820.0","poster":"Cica","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nD is required","upvote_count":"3"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/70552-exam-mb-800-topic-5-question-3-discussion/","choices":{"D":"Permissions","A":"Responsibility center","B":"Configuration worksheet","C":"Configuration template"}},{"id":"wU46qbXH0IB8boR0BeGP","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou need to design a process to resolve the broker issues for Accounts.\nWhich three actions should perform in sequence?
