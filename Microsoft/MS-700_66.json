In Group Policy Management, create a Group Policy setting to specify DSCP values.\n\nBy setting the Insert Quality of Service (QoS) markers for real-time media traffic as Enabled in the Microsoft Teams admin center, you allow Teams to automatically assign audio and video data packets with a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value. To ensure that computers prioritize real-time media traffic, you will need to create a Group Policy setting to specify the DSCP values. This will ensure that real-time media traffic has priority over other network activities. Setting the media port range and media bit rate is not necessary to prioritize audio and video during Teams meetings. Creating a network roaming policy in the Teams PowerShell module is not relevant to this scenario.","upvote_count":"10","poster":"JamesWilliams","comment_id":"872291"},{"comment_id":"1186706","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nChatGPT agrees with answer B","timestamp":"1727689560.0","poster":"Bobalo"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"The answer has to be \"B\".\n\n\"A\" states: \"configure the media port range to use any available ports.\"\n\nYou don't want to configure it for any available ports...","comment_id":"859281","poster":"Jacob64","timestamp":"1696274520.0"},{"timestamp":"1695572400.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"849530","upvote_count":"1","content":"*….and after activating QoS","timestamp":"1695572460.0","poster":"Jagomsah"}],"poster":"Jagomsah","comment_id":"849528","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn my opinion it should be A, as after activating QoS, we must select the port ranges for each real traffic in Meeting Settings (it automatically creates the related GPO).\nActually to check it’s working, firstly check that the GPO’s are crated, and then run the Network Monitor to ensure the ports are properly used.\n\nDon’t need toncreate the GPO’s manually!","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nResearched Best practice to set up QoS and it doesnt not mention adjusting use any port.
