Records in dbo.SalesTransactions are updated in SQLDW up to three days after being created. The records do NOT change after three days.\n\nPower BI -\nLitware has a new Power BI tenant that contains an empty workspace named Sales Analytics.\nAll users have Power BI Premium per user licenses.\nIT data analytics are workspace administrators. The IT data analysts will create datasets and reports.\nA single imported dataset will be created to support the company’s sales analytics goals. The dataset will be refreshed every 30 minutes.\n\nRequirements -\n\nAnalytics Goals -\nLitware identifies the following analytics goals:\nProvide historical reporting of sales by product and channel over time.\nAllow sales managers to perform ad hoc sales reporting with minimal effort.\nPerform market basket analysis to understand which products are commonly purchased in the same transaction.\nIdentify which customers should receive promotional emails based on their likelihood of purchasing promoted products.\nLitware plans to monitor the adoption of Power BI reports over time. The company wants custom Power BI usage reporting that includes the percent change of users that view reports in the Sales Analytics workspace each month.\n\nSecurity Requirements -\nLitware identifies the following security requirements for the analytics environment:\nAll the users in the sales department and the marketing department must be able to see Power BI reports that contain market basket analysis and data about which customers are likely to purchase a product.\nCustomer contact data in SQLDW and the Power BI dataset must be labeled as Sensitive. Records must be kept of any users that use the sensitive data.\nSales associates must be prevented from seeing the CustomerEmail column in Power BI reports.\nSales managers must be prevented from modifying reports created by other users.\nDevelopment Process Requirements\nLitware identifies the following development process requirements:\nSQLDW and datalake1 will act as the development environment. Once feature development is complete, all entities in synapseworkspace1 will be promoted to a test workspace, and then to a production workspace.\nPower BI content must be deployed to test and production by using deployment pipelines.\nAll SQL scripts must be stored in Azure Repos.\nThe IT data analysts prefer to build Power BI reports in Synapse Studio.\nHow should you configure the Power BI dataset refresh for the dbo.SalesTransactions table?","question_id":33,"topic":"1","isMC":true},{"id":"PjshlHfSduSnR4mp6OD0","question_id":34,"choices":{"D":"Create a separate report page for users to view a column chart.","C":"Enable report readers to personalize visuals.","A":"Create a mobile report that contains a column chart.","B":"Add a column chart a bookmark, and a button for users to choose a visual."},"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-07-01 00:26:00","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer":"C","exam_id":70,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1688163960,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/113786-exam-dp-500-topic-1-question-130-discussion/","answers_community":["C (67%)","B (33%)"],"question_text":"You have a Power BI report hosted on the Power BI service.
