If you run in a dedicated mode, you need to turn on the Always On setting for your Function App to run properly. The Function runtime will go idle after a few minutes of inactivity, so only HTTP triggers will actually \"wake up\" your functions. This is similar to how WebJobs must have Always On enabled.\nScenario: Notification latency: Users report that anomaly detection emails can sometimes arrive several minutes after an anomaly is detected.\nAnomaly detection service: You have an anomaly detection service that analyzes log information for anomalies. It is implemented as an Azure Machine Learning model. The model is deployed as a web service.\nIf an anomaly is detected, an Azure Function that emails administrators is called by using an HTTP WebHook.\nReferences:\nhttps://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/wiki/Enable-Always-On-when-running-on-dedicated-App-Service-Plan","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1660163940.0","poster":"pingpongset","comment_id":"645153","content":"Function app with consumption plan can be activated without Always On.\n\nShould not A C be the answer?\n\n\"On a Consumption plan the platform activates function apps automatically and on a Premium plan the platform keeps your desired number of pre-warmed instances always on automatically.\"\nhttps://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/wiki/Enable-Always-On-when-running-on-dedicated-App-Service-Plan","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"114805","content":"Code Snippet : https://vceguide.com/when-you-deploy-policy-service-policies-may-not-be-applied-if-they-were-in-the-process-of-being-applied-during-the-deployment-2/","timestamp":"1592660100.0","poster":"ather_13"},{"timestamp":"1589908200.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"lau13","comments":[],"content":"options image are all error 404 not found now","comment_id":"92274"},{"comment_id":"63816","content":"options please guys :)","timestamp":"1584183720.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"The options are displayed already","comment_id":"81835","poster":"dollarpo7","timestamp":"1588275060.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"poster":"RaedKazan"},{"timestamp":"1583946840.0","comment_id":"62570","comments":[{"content":"Yes, this is the correct answer.","comment_id":"73101","upvote_count":"6","poster":"riley5","timestamp":"1586550660.0"},{"poster":"lau13","timestamp":"1589908860.0","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"92281","content":"App Service Plan = Dedicated Plan, that's the only plan that have the \"Always On\" option."}],"content":"Is this answer correct?","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ebadali"}],"timestamp":"2020-03-11 18:14:00","answer":"BD","topic":"7","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/16277-exam-az-203-topic-7-question-1-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1583946840,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"question_id":137,"question_text":"You need to resolve a notification latency issue.\nWhich two actions should you perform?
