Azure SQL Database is a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering for hosting relational databases. It supports built-in autoscaling to automatically adjust compute resources based on demand, making it ideal for dynamic workloads.\n\nSQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines\nIncorrect. This is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) option where you have to manage the underlying virtual machine, database software, and scaling manually.\n\nAzure SQL Managed Instance\nIncorrect. While Managed Instance is a PaaS service, it does not natively support autoscaling in the same way as Azure SQL Database. You must adjust resources manually.\n\nAzure SQL Edge\nIncorrect.
