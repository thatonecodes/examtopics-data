However the answer states that you are using Dynamic DEVICE Membership which won't work (You cant assign a license to a device).\n\nI have a feeling that this is just a typo in the answer.\n\nB cannot be the correct answer, as they have specified you purchased M365 E3 licenses. When using Edition upgrade and mode switch you need to provide a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) or Key Management Server (KMS) key.
