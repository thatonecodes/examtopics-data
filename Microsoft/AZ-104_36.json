Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1**.\n - The Azure File Sync agent enables data sync and cloud tiering. This agent must be installed on each server you want to sync with Azure.\n\n2. **D. Register Server1**.\n - After the agent is installed, you need to register your server with the Storage Sync Service. This step creates a trust relationship between your server and the Azure File Sync service.\n\n3. **E. Add a server endpoint**.\n - Once your server is registered, you add it to the sync group by creating a server endpoint. The server endpoint represents a specific location on the registered server, such as a folder, and keeps it in sync with the Azure file share.\n\nTo summarize, the sequence is:\n1.
