So we should understand what caused performance issue first. It says it's caused by table scan.\n\nThe issue of a table scan has to do with crossing the partition boundaries. The level of performance you are guaranteed is explicitly set at the partition level. therefore, when you run a full table scan, its a) not very efficient, b) doesn't have any guarantee of performance. This is because the partitions themselves are set on separate storage nodes, and when you run a cross partition scan, you're consuming potentially massive amounts of resources (tying up multiple nodes simultaneously).\n\nTherefore the solution after migrating to Cosmos DB is to reduce partition keys.
