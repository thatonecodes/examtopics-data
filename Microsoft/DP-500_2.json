This can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the data source and Power BI, which in turn can reduce the number of queries sent to the data source."},{"poster":"solref","comments":[{"poster":"Plb2","comment_id":"935699","timestamp":"1687889880.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"different answers"}],"timestamp":"1680074640.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nITS THE SAME THAN 94","comment_id":"854120"},{"comment_id":"784039","upvote_count":"3","content":"Duplicate of question 94","timestamp":"1674372780.0","poster":"per_ing"}],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/96449-exam-dp-500-topic-1-question-104-discussion/","topic":"1","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"You have a deployment pipeline for a Power BI workspace.
