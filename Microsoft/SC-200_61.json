Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.\n\nAfter you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.\n\nYou have an Azure subscription that uses Microsoft Defender XDR.\n\nFrom the Microsoft Defender portal, you perform an audit search and export the results as a file named File1.csv that contains 10,000 rows.\n\nYou use Microsoft Excel to perform Get & Transform Data operations to parse the AuditData column from File1.csv. The operations fail to generate columns for specific JSON properties.\n\nYou need to ensure that Excel generates columns for the specific JSON properties in the audit search results.\n\nSolution: From Defender, you modify the search criteria of the audit search to reduce the number of returned records, and then you export the results. From Excel, you perform the Get & Transform Data operations by using the new export.\n\nDoes this meet the requirement?","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1714974660,"timestamp":"2024-05-06 07:51:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1733520600.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe JSON properties displayed in the previous screenshot (after you click Load more) are based on the properties found in the AuditData column from the first 1,000 rows in the CSV file.
