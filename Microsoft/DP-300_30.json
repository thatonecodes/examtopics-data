App1 will use SQL Server Authentication.\nYou need to create App1. The solution must ensure that App1 can be given access to other databases by using the same credentials.\nWhich three actions should you perform in sequence?

Here is some sample Transact-SQL that creates a login:\nCREATE LOGIN readonlylogin WITH password='1231!#ASDF!a';\nYou must be connected to the master database on SQL Azure with the administrative login (which you get from the SQL Azure portal) to execute the CREATE\nLOGIN command.\nStep 2: On DatabaseA, run CREATE USER [App1] FROM LOGIN [App1]\nUsers are created per database and are associated with logins. You must be connected to the database in where you want to create the user. In most cases, this is not the master database. Here is some sample Transact-SQL that creates a user:\nCREATE USER readonlyuser FROM LOGIN readonlylogin;\nStep 3: On DatabaseA run ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD Member [App1]\nJust creating the user does not give them permissions to the database. You have to grant them access. In the Transact-SQL example below the readonlyuser is given read only permissions to the database via the db_datareader role.\nEXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'readonlyuser';\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/adding-users-to-your-sql-azure-database/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04275/0011000002.png"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1719516480.0","content":"Seems to be right","comment_id":"392318","upvote_count":"15","poster":"ssp01"},{"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1723207380.0","comment_id":"422129","poster":"erssiws","content":"The answers are correct"},{"timestamp":"1721858700.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"421792","poster":"learnazureportal","content":"db_datacenter is a typo. it should be a db_datareader","timestamp":"1723144200.0"}],"content":"Step 3 should be add db_datacenter no db_datareader, 1 and 2 are steps is the answer a guess","comment_id":"413487","upvote_count":"3","poster":"hdenryardila105t00"}]},{"id":"DoXbpHlO868yg4TTd7te","answer_images":[],"question_text":"You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 on a virtual network named VNet1.
