VNet1 has “Allow gateway transit” and VNet2 and VNet4 have “Use remote gateways” enabled.\n\nClients using Windows can access directly peered VNets, but the VPN client must be downloaded again if any changes are made to VNet peering or the network topology. Non-Windows clients can access directly peered VNets. Access isn't transitive and is limited to only directly peered VNets.","poster":"ChrisTorro","comment_id":"1121138","timestamp":"1705096740.0"},{"timestamp":"1696144440.0","comment_id":"1022068","poster":"afridi43","upvote_count":"3","content":"B is correct \nB. Create a route table and associate the table with GatewaySubnet on VNet1.\n\nReason below:\n1- User1 is already able to establish a Point-to-Site (P2S) connection to GW1 to access AppSvr1. This indicates that the VPN client on Computer1 is configured correctly for the existing P2S connection.\n\n2- The problem is that User1 cannot access AppSvr2, which is located in Vnet2 and not directly connected to the P2S connection. To enable User1 to access resources in Vnet2, you need to ensure that the traffic from the P2S connection is correctly routed to Vnet2.\n\n3- Creating a route table and associating it with the GatewaySubnet on VNet1 allows you to define custom routes for the VPN traffic. You can configure the route table to route traffic destined for Vnet2 through the peering connection between Vnet1 and Vnet2."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA, these topics were covered in more detail in AZ-104","timestamp":"1692453060.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"985245","poster":"Tiago_MP"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"ala76nl","comments":[{"poster":"ala76nl","comment_id":"958017","timestamp":"1689909540.0","content":"This answer was wrong given below webpage answer A!!","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"You're correct that VNet peering does indeed establish a link and routing between the two virtual networks (VNet1 and VNet2).
