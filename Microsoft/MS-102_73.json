If users from the media department are traveling to different countries, you can configure a Conditional Access policy that recognizes the user's location as trusted or safe, allowing them to bypass the block if their sign-ins are flagged as high-risk due to their travel.\n\nBy adding trusted named locations, you ensure that users in the media department, when traveling, won't be blocked due to the high-risk sign-in policy. Additionally, this will allow users to remediate the issue themselves by ensuring they are recognized as coming from trusted regions, avoiding unnecessary administrative intervention."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nBy configuring named locations, you can define trusted IP ranges or countries.
