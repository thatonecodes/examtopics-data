Well, because for example the cluster may even be deleted immediately after the training completed, etc. We can't be sure why we've being asked not to consider еру сщыеы other than necessary for training, but that's what we've being asked for.\n\nAnd during the training, cluster eventually use all the possible nodes, so defining the [min_instances = 0] will not affect the costs for training at all.","poster":"vv_bb","comments":[{"content":"2) According to the page below, if you'll not define the min_instances, then the default value = 0 will be used. \nSo actually there is even no need to explicitly define [min_instances = 0]\n\nWhile, if you're not defining tier, then the default value = 'dedicated' will be used. \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-compute-aml?view=azureml-api-2","poster":"vv_bb","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1715512920.0","comment_id":"1068542"}],"timestamp":"1715512860.0"}],"comment_id":"1068539","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1715512800.0","poster":"vv_bb","content":"The correct answer is: \n - AmlCompute\n - tier=\"LowPriority\""},{"timestamp":"1705084260.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Correct.","comment_id":"950005","poster":"damaldon"},{"comment_id":"928781","poster":"Batman160591","timestamp":"1703111700.0","content":"seems correct","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1687293300,"timestamp":"2023-06-20 22:35:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/112726-exam-dp-100-topic-2-question-100-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-100/image493.png"],"question_id":46,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-100/image492.png"],"isMC":false,"answer_ET":"","answer":""},{"id":"2fh4oYXOpI87cu6aYCeF","answer":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"966139","content":"Selected Answer: B\n- Option A (Stop the compute instance) will not enable Intellisense.
