It provides the flexibility to let the bot take in user input in a fuzzy way based on the list items given to the entity.\nSpecifically, when this toggle is on, it lets the bot autocorrect misspellings and expands the matching logic semantically, such as automatically matching \"softball\" to \"baseball\".\n\n\nBox 2: Synonyms -\nSynonyms: This option allows you to manually expand the matching logic by adding synonyms. Smart match and synonyms seamlessly work together to make your bot even smarter.\nFor example, for the \"hiking\" product category, you can add \"trekking\" and \"mountaineering\" as synonyms. For \"Yoga\", you can add \"Pilates\" as a synonym.\n\nBox 3: Slot filling -\nSlot filling is a natural language understanding concept that means saving an extracted entity to an object.

The college uses Microsoft Power Platform to manage its recruiting efforts. The registration team and assistants use model-driven apps. The coaches use canvas apps on their mobile devices.\n\nProspects are considered underage if they are younger than 18 years old at the time of registration.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nEnvironment\n-\n\n• Custom code is not allowed in the system.\n• Server-side synchronization is configured for emails, appointments, contacts, and tasks.\n• The database and file storage of Dataverse must be minimized to keep costs low.\n\n\nContact table\n-\n\n• Birthdate is a custom date and time field.\n• Age at Registration is a calculated field that displays the age of the prospect at the time of registration.\n• Current Age is a calculated field that displays the age of the prospect based on the current date and time.\n\n\nEvaluation table\n-\n\n• The Evaluation table is a custom table used to track evaluation criteria.\n• Evaluation records cannot be manually created.\n• Users must not be able to continue until an evaluation record is created automatically for the prospect.\n\n\nConsent table\n-\n\n• The consent forms completed by the parents are stored as records in the Consent table.\n• Occasionally, a parent cannot complete the consent online and a paper copy must be printed. The signed copy must be scanned and stored with the consent record.\n\n\nTeam website\n-\n\n• The team website is created by using Power Pages.\n• A starter layout template was used to create the site.\n• The site consists of five pages:\no Home: A page open to everyone to view the announcements from the team.\no Schedule: A page open to everyone to view the tryout and game schedule.\no Evaluations: A page that displays tracking from the evaluation table. Prospects are able to view their own information only.\no Forms: A page that displays the consent form.\no Contact Us: A page for anyone to submit questions and comments.\n• Two web roles for authenticated users are created: Primary Contact User and Prospect User.\no All primary contacts and prospects are assigned to their respective roles.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nRegistration\n-\n\n• Parents and prospects are created as contacts and must be linked.\n• The registration team must be able to rapidly create prospects without navigating away from the Parents form. Only the First Name, Last Name, and Birthdate fields should be displayed for the team.\n• Assistants must be able to update prospect information and add teams that the prospect has previously played on to a subgrid.\n\n\nParental consent\n-\n\n• When a prospect is underage, a Primary Contact field will appear. The field must be populated before the prospect record can be saved.\n• A view named Underage Prospects that lists all underaged prospects is required.\n• The Underage Prospects view must run once a week without requiring modifications to display correct information.\n• A consent email must meet the following requirements:\no be sent to the primary contact of each new underage prospect\no contain a link to the team website\no be automatically sent weekly and tracked to the contact record in Dataverse\no include the current date using the full month name, date, and year\n\n\nEvaluations\n-\n\n• Coaches rate prospects each day on a scale of 1-10 in three categories: endurance, coordination, and skill.\n• The total of the three categories is displayed at the bottom of the form. If the total for the day is greater than 25, the number should appear green.\n\n\nYou need to configure the Primary Contact field.\n\nWhat should you configure?
