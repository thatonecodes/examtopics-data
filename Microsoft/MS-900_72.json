Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) is the servicing tool that should be used for scheduling upgrades and updates to be executed consistently for all devices. WSUS allows administrators to manage and distribute updates and upgrades to Windows-based computers on a corporate network. It can be used to deploy software updates, security patches, and service packs to Windows operating systems and Microsoft applications. WSUS can also be used to manage the deployment of feature updates, such as upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Using WSUS, the company can schedule the upgrade to Windows 10 for all the point-of-sale terminals and ensure that they receive updates and upgrades consistently for at least five years. This solution will keep costs to a minimum by automating the upgrade process and reducing the need for manual intervention.","comment_id":"839677","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1678868880.0"},{"timestamp":"1674878100.0","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"poster":"Irism","comment_id":"800717","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1675761840.0","content":"true but this does not minimize costs, therefor wsus is the answer"}],"poster":"kilo365","comment_id":"790246","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe servicing tool that should be used for scheduling consistent upgrades and updates while keeping costs to a minimum for the POS terminals upgrade is Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based device management tool that allows for remote management, conditional access, device compliance policies, inventory and more."},{"comment_id":"765932","poster":"dekinha","timestamp":"1672852440.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nis WSUS"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nWSUS is an on-premises deployment of Windows Update, akin to having a private cloud for Windows Updates.
