Add code to verify the read_results.status value.\nWe need to check this status to ensure that the operation is complete before retrieving the results. Adding code to check the read_results.status value provides the status of the OCR operation (e.g., \"notStarted\", \"running\", or \"succeeded\"), so we avoid to access results before they are available.\n\nD. Wrap the call to get_read_result within a loop that contains a delay.\nThe OCR process in Azure AI Vision is asynchronous, so wrapping the call to get_read_result in a loop with a delay allows you to continuously check whether the operation is complete.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737404460.0","comment_id":"1343849"},{"poster":"mrg998","timestamp":"1725964200.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"B & D for sure","comment_id":"1281472"},{"timestamp":"1722977280.0","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nB and D","poster":"moonlightc","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1261825"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Remove the operation_id parameter.","C":"Add code to verify the status of the read_operation_location value.","B":"Add code to verify the read_results.status value.","D":"Wrap the call to get_read_result within a loop that contains a delay."},"unix_timestamp":1722977280,"question_id":116,"exam_id":40,"timestamp":"2024-08-06 22:48:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["BD (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/145183-exam-ai-102-topic-2-question-39-discussion/","answer_ET":"BD"},{"id":"InafH60aKv8ilod7fM8e","topic":"2","answer":"","question_id":117,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou are developing a webpage that will use the Azure Video Analyzer for Media (previously Video Indexer) service to display videos of internal company meetings.\nYou embed the Player widget and the Cognitive Insights widget into the page.\nYou need to configure the widgets to meet the following requirements:\n✑ Ensure that users can search for keywords.\n✑ Display the names and faces of people in the video.\n✑ Show captions in the video in English (United States).\nHow should you complete the URL for each widget?
