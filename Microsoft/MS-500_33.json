Enable MFA for the Research group members.\n\nEnabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the Research group members adds an extra layer of security to their mailbox accounts and helps protect against unauthorized access, including potential spear-phishing attacks. By enabling MFA, users are required to provide additional verification, such as a code sent to their mobile device or biometric authentication, when signing in to their accounts.\n\nBefore running the Attack simulator, it's important to ensure that the target users, in this case, the members of the Research group, have MFA enabled.
