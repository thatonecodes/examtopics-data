Based on the requirements of each message type, Microsoft recommends Azure messaging services. The options include Azure Service Bus, Event Grid, and Event Hubs.\nAzure Service Bus queues are well suited for transferring commands from producers to consumers.\nData is transferred between different applications and services using messages. A message is a container decorated with metadata, and contains data. The data can be any kind of information, including structured data encoded with the common formats such as the following ones: JSON, XML, Apache Avro, Plain Text.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/messaging\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview","comment_id":"779619","timestamp":"1674018960.0","poster":"yeanlingmedal71"},{"timestamp":"1672942980.0","comment_id":"766930","poster":"maku067","content":"Selected Answer: C\nseems correct.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1672930440.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC, all day..","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ServerBrain","comment_id":"766740"}],"answer_images":[],"question_id":240,"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1672930440,"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"name":"AZ-305","isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":286,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Microsoft","id":54},"currentPage":48},"__N_SSP":true}
