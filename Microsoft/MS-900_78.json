It’s purpose-built for this kind of cross-organization collaboration.","upvote_count":"2"}],"comment_id":"1371781","poster":"a6cc995","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/ms-900/image513.png"],"unix_timestamp":1741532700,"answer_description":"","question_id":386,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/162204-exam-ms-900-topic-1-question-447-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-03-09 16:05:00","exam_id":113,"topic":"1","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nA company is using Microsoft Teams for collaboration.\n\nThe company plans to allow employees to collaborate with other Microsoft Entra organizations by using Teams shared channels.
