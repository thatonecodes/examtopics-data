When the exchange rate is updated for a transaction currency, the existing records that the currency is assigned to aren't updated. But if a money field in one of these records is later updated, or if the state of the record changes, the system retrieves the latest exchange rate for the currency and recalculates the record's money fields based on the latest rate. When you view a record, the monetary values that are shown are based on the exchange rate that was last assigned to the record. This rate might not reflect the latest exchange rate.\n\nFor example, when an order is created, the values of its money fields are calculated based on the exchange rate that's in effect for the assigned currency at that time.
