So the premise that you plan to deploy the two prescribed hosts to HostPool1 is flawed from the start. \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/prerequisites?tabs=portal\n\nIf you have existing session hosts in the host pool, make a note of the virtual machine size, the image, and name prefix that was used. All session hosts in a host pool should be the same configuration, including the same identity provider. For example, a host pool shouldn't contain some session hosts joined to Azure AD and some session hosts joined to an Active Directory domain.\n\nNext the answer given is wrong for Host1.
