What do they consider the 'user's record in the app'? The 'user's record in the app' is the 'System User' record. The system user record in D365 is controlled via O365. This means the only way to edit the username on the 'user's record' is to be a global admin and edit through the admin center.

But then after rethinking about how they constructed the question, I think the question is yes. Why?\nI looked into the link which DennisWypior posted here in the comments, and there it shows how to change a user's name in the 365 Admin Portal and it makes sense, because Elisabeth probably does not only want to have her last name changed on the Dynamics 365 platform.\nNow when you change the last name of an user in 365 Admin Portal, it doesn't change the last name attribute of the users sysuser record. I tried it, but maybe the changes take longer until they also appear in Dataverse?
