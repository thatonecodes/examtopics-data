As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.\nYour company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named contoso.com that contains several Windows 10 devices.\nWhen you join new Windows 10 devices to contoso.com, users are prompted to set up a four-digit pin.\nYou need to ensure that the users are prompted to set up a six-digit pin when they join the Windows 10 devices to contoso.com.\nSolution: From the Azure Active Directory admin center, you configure automatic mobile device management (MDM) enrollment. From the Endpoint Manager admin center, you configure the Windows Hello for Business enrollment options.\nDoes this meet the goal?","choices":{"A":"Yes","B":"No"},"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-11-08 12:01:00","answer":"A","discussion":[{"content":"A is correct","timestamp":"1636369260.0","comment_id":"474229","poster":"john909","upvote_count":"6"},{"timestamp":"1655945820.0","content":"Correct answer!","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"620695","poster":"mrjeet"}],"answer_description":"Hello for Business is an alternative sign-in method that uses Active Directory or an Azure Active Directory account to replace a password, smart card, or a virtual smart card. It lets you use a user gesture to sign in, instead of a password. A user gesture might be a PIN, biometric authentication such as Windows Hello, or an external device such as a fingerprint reader.\nIntune integrates with Hello for Business in two ways:\n✑ An Intune policy can be created under Device enrollment. This policy targets the entire organization (tenant-wide). It supports the Windows AutoPilot out-of- box-experience (OOBE) and is applied when a device enrolls.\n✑ An identity protection profile can be created under Device configuration. This profile targets assigned users and devices, and is applied during check-in.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/protect/windows-hello","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/65650-exam-md-101-topic-4-question-42-discussion/","exam_id":96},{"id":"J3Tw2QQ2lkXRth6v328Z","question_id":307,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer":"A","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-10-16 00:48:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1650979260.0","content":"April 2022.
