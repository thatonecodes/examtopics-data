You can specify either the item sales price or the cost group. Some manufacturers want to calculate a suggested sales price for manufactured items. The calculated sales price can reflect a rolled-price approach that is based on the component’s sales price record. Alternatively, the calculated sales price can reflect a cost-plus-markup approach that is based on the component’s cost and applicable profit percentage, which is associated with the item’s cost group.","upvote_count":"4"}],"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (44%)","B (33%)","11%","11%"],"question_id":86},{"id":"uXqRUd6lnRD4uiLdj2mC","topic":"1","question_id":87,"timestamp":"2024-03-15 18:28:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":["ADE (71%)","BCD (29%)"],"unix_timestamp":1710523680,"answer":"ADE","answer_description":"","exam_id":84,"answer_images":[],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-335/image96.png"],"answer_ET":"ADE","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/136145-exam-mb-335-topic-1-question-3-discussion/","choices":{"E":"Configure the BOM line to be of type Vendor and associate the corresponding vendor account.","A":"Configure the inventory policy for the item model group to set the value of the Stocked product option to Yes.","D":"Configure a costing resource and requirement to point to a Vendor type resource.","C":"Allocate subcontracted work in its own cost breakdown block.","B":"Use a purchase agreement as a service agreement."},"question_text":"Case Study -\nThis is a case study.

IngredientC for unscented liquid cleaning solution is stored in inventory in 50-liter barrels and allocated in 50-liter increments. Two barrels of IngredientC are uses to produce a barrel of unscented liquid cleaning solution.\nCurrent environment. Production sites\nThe Eastern United States facility manufactures equipment.\nThe Western United States facility manufactures liquid cleaning solutions.\nRaw materials and finished products are stocked at the warehouse and distributed from the warehouse.\nCurrent environment. Warehouse facilities\nThe warehouse consists of the following zones:\n//IMG//\n\nRequirements. Cleaning equipment manufacturing\nYou identify the following requirements for manufacturing cleaning equipment:\nProduction is Make to Stock and must be scheduled at an operational level.\nMachine equipment is produced on an assembly line. Scheduling must be based on production orders.\nFinished products must be packaged and shipped directly from the warehouse.\nTo reduce delivery times and excess inventory, equipment must be produced as needed.\nThe ability to schedule production must be based on resource capacity and the availability of required materials.\nProduction order operations must be scheduled to start only when capacity and materials are available at the same time and in the required quantities.\nRequirements. Liquid cleaning solution manufacturing\nProduction is Make to Order and is scheduled at the job level. Products must be manufactured in batches.\nFinished products must be packaged and shipped directly from the warehouse.\nYou must be able to calculate the estimated consumption of ingredients and ensure that the amount is divisible by the number of units the raw material is available.\nFormula changes must be reviewed and approved. You must ensure that approved formulas cannot be deleted or edited. Approved formulas may be deactivated.\nAn ingredient used to manufacture unscented cleaning solution is defined as a restricted product.

Costing -\nThe price of raw materials used for manufacturing unscented cleaning solution must be tracked based upon commodity exchange pricing. The margin and cost multiplier must be set up for commodity traded raw material.\nYou must set up cost calculation groups to ensure that indirect costs that originate in the manufacturing of finished goods are recognized and absorbed into the product cost.\nThe production manager needs to set up picking list journals and BOM item consumption.\n\nRequirements. Reporting -\nProduction control parameters must be setup for reporting of automatic BOM and Route consumption.\nYou must create reports that include information about cost records and categories for items, and calculation formulas for indirect costs.\nYou must treat manufactured items as purchased items for cost roll-up purposes during BOM calculations and reporting.\nYou must configure automatic route consumption in connection with the automatic running of Report as finished.\n\nRequirements. Inventory control -\nYou must not be required to track the lot number for items when you enter inventory information into the system. Lot numbers for items must be entered when items are picked from inventory.\n\nIssues -\nUsers report the following issues:\nThe production manager observes that items are being deducted from inventory two times on production jobs. A shop supervisor mistakenly registers the process for assembling batteries for the pressure washers to Registered as prepared. You must reschedule the process for a future date.\nCustomer1 orders 20 barrels of unscented solution. The order is confirmed. Production must be scheduled to start on December 21 to meet the customers delivery deadline.\nUser2 reports that costs for manufactured items are twice as high as expected.\nUser1 reports that the formula for the liquid cleaning solution sometimes changes during production. You must enforce the policies regarding formula editing for current and future use.\nYou need to configure production operations for the pine and orange scent solutions.\nWhich three actions should you perform?
