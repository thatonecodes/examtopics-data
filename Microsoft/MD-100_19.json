The solution must ensure that the captured state is transactionally consistent.\n\nWhich three PowerShell commands should you run in sequence on Client1?

Before that, it is important to perform the configuration requested in the question, which is to guarantee the captured state is transactionally consistent. Then save a checkpoint with the state of the three actions. There is no need to restore anything, the question doesn't ask for that.\n\n1 - SetVM -Name VM1 -CheckpointType Production\n\nSet to Production Checkpoint, if the production checkpoint fails a standard checkpoint is being created.\n\n2 - Checkpoint-VM Name VM1\n\nCreates a checkpoint of the type configured for the virtual machine.\n\n3 - Export-VMCheckpoint -VMName VM1 -Name VM1Checkpoint -Path C:\\Export\n\nExport bundles the checkpoint as a virtual machine so the checkpoint can be moved to a new location. Once imported, the checkpoint is restored as a virtual machine. Exported checkpoints can be used for backup.\n\nUsing checkpoints to revert virtual machines to a previous state: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/checkpoints","comment_id":"830570","poster":"flabezerra","timestamp":"1678081680.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"I see how the given answer can make sense, but we are lacking some vital information. First, we're never told that we can't use the automatic backup from Hypter-V. Slyly, they use the phrase \"create an export\" and not create a checkpoint. If we use the automatic backup and all commands are on client one, which is the actual scripting context in the question, the answer should be closer to what Windows311 gives. No point in Restore-VMCheckpoint if it's not an Client2. It says that we \"plan\" to do that, not that we're doing that currently. \n\nSo, to be it concisely, I agree with Windows311 on the answer.","comment_id":"824136","poster":"ChrisC21","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1677530280.0"},{"content":"The given answer does not make sense to me...\n\nAfter some digging i believe its this:\n1) Checkpoint-VM Name VM1\n2) Get-VMCheckpoint -VMName VM1\n3) Export-VMCheckpoint -VMName VM1\n\nCheckpoint type is Prodcution as default (https://www.nakivo.com/blog/need-know-hyper-v-checkpoints/) so we wont need to set that.
