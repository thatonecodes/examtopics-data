This is because a transactional database follows the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensures that all transactions are executed in a reliable and consistent manner.\nWhen a transaction is executed, the database system ensures that all changes made to the data are logged in a transaction log. This log contains a record of all changes made during the transaction, including updates, inserts, and deletions. If any part of the transaction fails, the database system uses the transaction log to roll back the transaction and undo any changes that were made.\nBy logging all data changes, the database system can ensure that the data remains consistent and that no data is lost or corrupted.
