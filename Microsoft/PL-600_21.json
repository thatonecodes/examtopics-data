The Azure SQL Database can then be used as a source for Power BI reports, providing a near-real-time connection to the latest data. The Data Export Service ensures that data in the SQL database is constantly kept in sync with Dataverse, allowing for near-real-time updates to Power BI reports.\n\nWhen using the Microsoft Dataverse connector, Power BI can query Dataverse and retrieve the latest data.
