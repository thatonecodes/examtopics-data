Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\n\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\n\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.\n\n\nTo start the case study -\nTo display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground -\n\nCity Power and Light is one of the biggest energy companies in North America. They extract, produce and transport oil. The company has more than 50 offices and 100 oil extraction facilities throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. They use railways, trucks, and pipelines to move oil and gas from their facilities.\n\nThe company provides the following services:\n\n• Produce oil from oil sands safely, responsibly, and reliably.\n• Refine crude oil into high-quality products.\n• Develop and manage wind power facilities.\n• Transport oil to different countries/regions.\n\nCity Power and Light uses various Microsoft software products to manage its daily actives and run its machine-critical applications.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nManagePipelineMaintenanceTasks -\nA user named Admin1 creates a cloud flow named ManagePipelineMaintenanceTasks. Admin1 applies a data loss prevention (DLP) policy to the flow. Admin1 shares the flow with a user named PipelineManager1 as co-owner. You must determine the actions that PipelineManager1 can perform.\n\n\nMaintenanceScheduler -\nYou create a cloud flow that uses a desktop flow. The desktop flow connects to third-party services to fetch information. You must not permit the desktop flow to run for more than 20 minutes.\n\nYou must configure sharing for MaintenanceScheduler to meet the following requirements:\n\n• User1 must be able to work with you to modify the desktop flow.\n• User2 must be able to access and review the run history for the cloud flow.\n• You must grant User3 permissions to run but not modify the desktop flow.\n\n\nERPDataOperations flow -\nCity Power and light uses an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The ERP system does not have an API.\n\nEach day the company receives an email that contains an attachment. The attachment lists orders from the company’s rail transportation partners. You must create an automation solution that reads the contents of the email and writes records to the ERP system. The solution must pass credential from a cloud flow to a desktop flow.\n\n\nRailStatusUpdater -\nCity Power and Light actively monitors all products in transit. You must create a flow named RailStatusUpdater that manages communications with railways that transport the company’s products. RailStatusUpdater includes five desktop flow actions.\n\nYou must run the desktop flows in attended mode during testing. You must run the desktop flows in unattended mode after you deploy the solution. You must minimize administrative efforts.\n\n\nPackaging -\nAll flow automations must be created in a solution. All required components to support the flows must be included in the solution.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n\nProductionMonitor flow -\nYou create a cloud flow named ProductionMonitor which uses the Manually trigger a flow trigger. You plan to trigger ProductionMonitor from a cloud flow named ProdManager.\n\nYou add a Run a Child flow action in ProdManager to trigger ProductionMonitor. When you attempt to save ProdManager the following error message displays:\nRequest to XRM API failed with error: 'Message:Flow client error returned with status code \"Bad request\" and details \"(\"error\":\n{\"code\":ChildFlowUnsupportedForinvokerConnections\", \"message\": The workflow with id 8d3bcde7-7e98-eb11-b1ac-000d3a32d53f\", named FlowA cannot be used as a child workflow because child workflows only support embedded connections. \"}}\"Code\" 0x80060467 InnerError.'\n\n\nCapacityPlanning flow -\nDevelopers within the company use cloud flows to access data from an on-premises capacity planning system.\n\nYou observe significant increases to the volume of traffic that the on-premises data gateway processes each day. You must minimize gateway failures.\n\n\nDataCollector flow -\nYou have a desktop flow that interacts with a web form. The flow must write data to several fields on the form.\n\nYou are testing the flow. The flow fails when attempting to write data to any field on the web form.\n\n\nRailStatusUpdater flow -\nThe RailStatusUpdater flow occasionally fails due to machine connection errors. You can usually get the desktop flow to complete by resubmitting the cloud flow run. You must automate the retry process to ensure that you do not need to manually resubmit the cloud flow when machine connection errors occur.\n\n\nYou need to resolve the issue reported with the RailStatusUpdater flow.\n\nWhat are two possible ways to achieve the goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.","topic":"2","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/129069-exam-pl-500-topic-2-question-20-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Create a duplicate action for the desktop flow to run after the first desktop flow.","A":"Call a separate child cloud flow to perform the desktop flow a second time.","C":"Put the desktop flow action into a Do until loop.
