(On macOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, container jobs are not available.) Containers provide isolation from the host and allow you to pin specific versions of tools and dependencies. Host jobs require less initial setup and infrastructure to maintain.\n\nContainers offer a lightweight abstraction over the host operating system. You can select the exact versions of operating systems, tools, and dependencies that your build requires.

Many of you points to the difference between assigning and procuring licenses. But actually there no difference. \n\"We simplified Azure DevOps billing, so now rather than complete a purchase process, you assign and remove users. You get billed according to those assignments. This article helps you take advantage of the tools we have for managing paid access for users. This way you only pay for what you need.\"\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/billing/buy-basic-access-add-users?view=azure-devops\n\n2. You can easily automate user adding to Azure Devops Teams by assigning AAD groups to the DevOps Teams.\n3. The same could be with entitlements\n4. You could automate azure devops users group memberships using group rules. Yes, you can do it but only the first time you ASSIGN the membership to the users. If after some days you want to change this membership how do you think to di it automatically? Of course you can't, because now you can't know which group you want to assign a particular user to in several days. This operation, \"modifying group memberships\" is to be done manually.","comments":[{"poster":"rdemontis","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"581052","content":"I'm not sure if my previous answer is correct.
