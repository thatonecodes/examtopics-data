Create an agreement with the applicable invoice terms\nAgreements in Field Service define recurring work orders, pricing structures, and invoice terms. Since the customer has a contract for a year, an agreement is the best way to ensure consistent discounts apply to all work orders during that period.\n\nD.

The price list should be associated with the agreement or work orders for this customer.\n\nWhy not B? Entitlements in Field Service are used to define free or discounted service based on specific conditions (e.g., warranty work, support cases).
