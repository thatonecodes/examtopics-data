However, this feature is typically used when you encounter issues while copying pre-existing data between finance and operations apps and Dataverse1. In the scenario you described, the issue was due to an unplanned maintenance window, not a sync issue. Therefore, enabling alert conditions would be more effective in preventing data loss and errors during such interruptions1.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"aivo","comment_id":"1023004","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer should be A. The question is about preventing loss of requests in future. Alert notifications can handle cases of planned or unplanned maintenance. Based on alert settings dual-write system can take action on your behalf. For example, it can pause or stop dual-write. If one of the apps becomes unavailable and, based on thresholds defined for alert, dual-write goes into a paused state, all new requests are queued (that is, they aren't lost). After both apps are running smoothly, you can resume from the paused state. The updates will then be read back from the queue and written to the recovered app.","timestamp":"1696242420.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1006858","poster":"Sugar14","content":"whats the correct answer here?","timestamp":"1694626620.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Daniel73847","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1003875","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAs an admin, you can create one or more alert settings to handle cases of planned or unplanned maintenance.

Use catch-up errors. Explanation: \"Catch-up errors\" is a feature in Dual-Write that helps to handle errors and ensure data consistency during synchronization.
