Azure Data Factory Edge\n\nTo implement a storage solution that allows real-time querying of data with low latency and ensures data persistence on the devices for at least 14 days, you should use Azure Data Factory Edge.\n\nAzure Data Factory Edge is designed to collect, transform, and analyze data from edge devices. It provides a scalable and reliable solution for ingesting, processing, and storing data at the edge. With Azure Data Factory Edge, you can configure data flows to ingest data from your Azure IoT Edge devices and store it in the desired storage format (e.g., Azure Blob storage, Azure Data Lake Storage).\n\nBy using Azure Data Factory Edge, you can set up data pipelines to stream and process the data in real-time, allowing you to query the data as it streams into the solution with minimal latency. Additionally, you can define retention policies to ensure that the data files persist on the devices for at least 14 days.","poster":"rveney","timestamp":"1687463640.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"415216","content":"What is \"You want the data files to persist on the devices for at least 14 days.\" for?","timestamp":"1627366560.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"YipingRuan"},{"content":"I would go for D : \"In-Memory OLTP increases number of transactions per second and reduces latency for transaction processing.
