The Detect API detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. It also returns a unique ID that represents the stored face data. This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses."},{"timestamp":"1743890760.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nComputer Vision is the best choice for your needs:\nWhy: It offers a flexible, cost-effective solution for detecting PPE compliance (masks and safety glasses) using custom-trained models.
