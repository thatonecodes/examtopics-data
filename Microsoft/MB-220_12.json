Compliance -\n\nAs the Litware marketing executives create a digital marketing library, you will be responsible for ensuring each marketing page is used appropriately and contains the required field values. Analyzing page performance will be a key element.\n\nAll marketing content must include the company logo, utilize the company colors (Green and Yellow), and have properly formatted sentence structure.\n\nThe following content must follow generally accepted grammar rules:\n\n• Landing Pages\n• Subscription Centers\n• Forward to a Friend\n• Voice of the Customer\n• Event management\n• Embedded Forms\n\nAll Marketing Pages with more than 5,000 views monthly must be reviewed quarterly to ensure content is updated and meets brand standards.\n\nExisting environment. Dynamics 365 Marketing\n\nThis is a newly-installed system.\n\n• No Users (other than you) have been added.\n• There is no integration with any ERP system. An integration with LinkedIn and other social media sites must be configured.\n• No custom configuration has been performed, and this will be within your area of responsibility.\n• Your focus will be on ensuring your Dynamics 365 Marketing system is optimized for the type of marketing information Litware, Inc. needs to send out, and the results they want to analyze.\n• You and others will be responsible for creating Content Blocks and Customer Journey Templates that meet brand and company standards, which will be used in multiple ways in all marketing efforts.\n• All Lead Scoring Models will create new contacts in the database when the score is over 30.\n\n\nExisting environment. Licensing -\n\nLitware, Inc. has a total of 10 Dynamics 365 Marketing licenses, one of which is the functional consultant license.\n\nAs the functional consultant of the account, you will be responsible for ensuring your company does not exceed the limits of your current subscriptions / licenses.\n\nLitware, Inc. does not want to add any new licenses or purchase any more storage.\n\nNo Marketing Emails have been sent yet, and there are no Contacts in your Marketing database.\n\nSeveral social media accounts have been configured and authenticated.

Planned changes -\n\nYou will need to add several Users, who will then become members of your marketing team, including giving them accurate privileges and security related to their roles.\n\nEach User must be given the freedom to accomplish their tasks, and yet not given permission to use tools outside their area of responsibility.\n\nAs the marketing executives at Litware, Inc. begin creating the digital content they will need for their customer journeys, you must ensure all the forms and web pages match company brand standards and best practices.\n\nLitware, Inc. needs to implement controls on all Customer Journeys that will send emails at times when recipients are most likely to open them.\n\nAll Customer Journeys need to include the ability to capture contact info for anyone who is not already in your database.\n\nAny Contact who fails to open 5 email messages should be marked as “Do not email.”\n\nRequirements. Analysis and reporting\n\nWhen the marketing executives begin to report on outcomes with Customer Insights, your job as the functional consultant will be to create custom analytics with Power BI. This will require you to set up Azure Blob Storage and give some of your users adequate permissions to use the information stored there.\n\nAnalysis and reporting is necessary for the following elements:\n\n• lead scoring models – to ensure scores over 30 are creating new contacts.\n• email insights – for unique opens and click-thru information.\n• website insights – to determine the most popular web pages.\n• marketing form interactions – to see which forms were submitted most frequently.\n• incomplete journeys – to identify messages that can be improved.\n\nAll emails marked as blocked need to be analyzed and grouped as to the reason for the block.\n\nA custom entity called Building Location is used as a reference for every contact. All segments need to include sorting by this entity.\n\nEvery Customer Journey should be analyzed while running to evaluate any Contacts that are stopped. If the Contact stopped because Litware, Inc. reached the send quota for the month, the blocked Contacts should be added to a new segment and retried on the first of the following month.\n\nRequirements. Compliance and access\n\nThe use of Power BI will require you to set up Azure Blob Storage and give some of your users adequate permissions to use the information stored there.\n\nActivity templates will be used to provide follow-up with marketing Contacts as appropriate. You will be responsible for ensuring these are created in the system in a way that allows your Users to perform the tasks as assigned.\n\nAs digital content templates are developed, you will be responsible for ensuring each one complies with Litware, Inc.’s brand standards. In addition, you will need to be aware of known issues with specific email clients and avoid those problems.\n\nAll public content must comply with applicable national and international laws.\n\nSegments must be dynamic in order to comply with GDPR regulations. Any bounced emails or unsubscribes will immediately be marked as such and no longer used.\n\nMarketing Emails should be sent from an individual, to avoid spam filters that block generic email addresses.\n\nRequirements.

You will need to report on your limits monthly to your manager.\n• For the GDPR privacy requirements for European recipients, it is your responsibility to ensure perpetual access to navigation sites that enable them to manage the permissions that govern Litware, Inc.’s permission to contact them, and ensure these sites are being visited as frequently as expected.\n• All marketing materials that are made publicly available through Litware, Inc. must meet privacy requirements. The Privacy Policy must be reviewed quarterly to ensure accuracy and compliance with applicable laws.\n• Lead scoring will be based on the following:\no Interaction with website content\no Previous purchases from Litware, Inc.\no Demographic details\n\n\nPlanned Event.

Speakers -\n\n• Most speakers will be compensated, and all will receive complimentary lodging and meals at the host hotel.\n• Some classes will require two smaller classrooms to be combined into one large room. Litware, Inc. staff will manage this process between sessions.\n• Each speaker is allowed to bring 1 additional person at no charge.

General overview -\n\nYou are working at the non-profit foundation as one of the Microsoft Power Platform consultants in their Global and European Area Office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nThe foundation's vision is to “Engage in a digital habi-verse.” Their idea is to reach out to the public, in particular the younger generation, by immersing animals and habitats in the digital metaverse.\n\nTheir goal is to connect and create awareness of actual non-digital wildlife.\n\n\nOverview. Organization -\n\nHeadquartered in Amsterdam, the foundation has national offices all around the world.\n\nAll the national offices are responsible for fundraising, as well as establishing a local donor, ambassador, and volunteer community. The foundation s headquarters (HQ) supports the national offices with IT platforms and templates. HQ also provides services around finance, customer service, and marketing.\n\nFunds are allocated to metaverse initiatives selected by HQ or donated to other supporting programs and causes.\n\nExamples of recently supported programs:\n\n• Funded an initiative from a fitness app to introduce animals to their in-app fitness challenges. Runners could compare their times to different animals or do a “live\" sprint or activity against them.\n• Supported a Roblox gaming project where a wildlife sanctuary was digitally duplicated. With actual animals being tracked, gamers can see their digital avatars move around the digital sanctuary in real -time, and make donations through the Robux digital currency.\n\n\nOverview. IT environment -\n\nThe foundation relies on Microsoft technologies throughout their organization. The foundation uses Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit, that is predominantly based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform.\n\nAlthough the foundation limits customizations and relies on standard functionality, there are some relevant configurations:\n• Dynamics 365 is extended with the Microsoft Common Data Model for Nonprofits.\n• Unless otherwise stated, no customizations have been made to forms or views.\n• The foundation prefers to not create new workflows or additional automated processes.\n• There is an integration with their finance solution. For this, many entities require a mandatory Cost Center allocation field. These entities include events, campaigns, and donor commitments.\n• All countries/regions and offices work within the same Dynamics 365 tenant and environment. To secure and segregate data, business unit hierarchies and security roles are configured.\n\nThe Dynamics 365 Marketing module is used for journey orchestration and engagement to send email, SMS, and push messages.\n• Microsoft Power Pages is used for the foundation's online volunteer and event portals.\n• For SMS messaging, Twilio has been configured as a SMS provider in Dynamics 365 Marketing.\n• Business Process flows are used for events, campaigns, opportunities and leads. To ensure a good user experience, mandatory fields for creation should be part of the first process step.\n• There are numerous processes automated through Power Automate. For example: o All new users are created as contacts. o Submitted form information is copied and registered on master entities. o Task activities can be created from real-time campaigns for employees.\n\nNew initiative and scenario. Background information\n\nThe foundation has set up a basic event template and configuration to support national initiatives. As part of the event process, each event uses individual segment-based journeys for inviting audiences. Common actions such as registrations and check-ins use a single journey per default Marketing trigger.\n\nThe foundation s newest initiative is to use outdoor music festivals to create awareness and attract new donors and volunteers. For these large complex events, the management and coordination of the events will initially be done by a dedicated HQ team.\n\nThe goal is to have a large presence in public spaces where people are engaged with examples of supported projects, compelling speaker sessions, and silent virtual reality (VR) disco. The music from the stages can be heard and experienced in a virtual, wildlife-packed rainforest. At the physical event location, visitors can use Microsoft Power Apps to donate and join the community.\n\nYou need to support the new event scrum team as a scrum developer. The foundation recently completed its first pilot event at a large outdoor music festival in Amsterdam.\n\nTogether with the team, you are reviewing the results as you prepare for the next festival in Buenos Aires, Brazil.\n\nNew initiative and scenario. Event design principles\n\nSet up and design principles for new events are as follows:\n• Event management and engagement is conducted through the real-time marketing module in Dynamics 365 Marketing.\n• Event locations have a public area, as well as several spaces for event sessions and the silent VR disco.\n• To further promote the foundation and the event, VIPs are invited with the request to share and create social content. The invited VIPs are already linked ambassadors (constituents), but the foundation wants to expand their ambassador base through these events. VIPs will receive special event passes.\n• The event team consists of the foundation's employees, as well as volunteers. Their role is to facilitate the event, supply information, convert donations, and check people in during the sessions.\n• All national constituents of the event location are invited through an initial segment-based journey.\n• The content of all touchpoints must be engaging and include its own branding. A creative agency supported the foundation with custom HTML designs for templates according to the Dynamics 365 Marketing design principles.\n• Senior marketeers want to be included in the invitation journeys, but segments that include them have yet to be created.\n• Leads should be created from the event registrations.\n• Post-event surveys are sent out to registered and checked-in constituents that gave permission during the registration.\n\n\nIssues and requests -\n\nDuring the Amsterdam event retrospective, the team received the following feedback:\n• Content designers were unable to use the drag and drop editor of the imported emails.\n• Senior marketeers did not receive event invitations.\n• All registered contacts received a post-event experience survey invitation, even if they were not checked in at the event.\n• Registered contacts received two different confirmation emails.\n• When creating the event(s). the cost center field is mandatory, but difficult to find on the event form.\n\nFor the Buenos Aires event, the foundation decided to add some new design principles:\n• To raise funds, a contribution will be charged for session packages and the silent VR disco.\n• National ambassadors should receive a special SMS invitation to receive free VIP access to the sessions and silent VR disco.\n• Event team members must be onboarded through a Dynamics 365 Marketing journey.\n\n\nYou need to resolve the issue where senior marketeers did not receive event invitations.\n\nWhat should you change in the segment configuration for the journey?","answer_description":"","answer":"A","answer_images":[]},{"id":"NOPSCwwQRpdA4WribEf0","exam_id":76,"timestamp":"2024-11-18 17:00:00","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-220/image186.png"],"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1731945600,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-220/image185.png"],"isMC":false,"answer":"","question_id":60,"discussion":[{"content":"I believe it´s 12543, i.e. first you create a foram a then you add lists as checkboxes there...","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Hancha","timestamp":"1731945600.0","comment_id":"1314058"}],"topic":"2","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/151554-exam-mb-220-topic-2-question-23-discussion/","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nYou need to set up the default subscription center for customers to manage their communication settings.\n\nIn which order should you perform the actions?
