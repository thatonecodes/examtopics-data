The Key Phrase Extraction API evaluates unstructured text, and for each JSON document, returns a list of key phrases. As defined in the section print(‘{keyphrase}’)function it prints the key phrases extracted from the input string to the console.\n\nNo is CORRECT. The function is designed to extract key phrases only and here in the options we have “the”, “on” which are not the key phrase but the general words. Therefore, it is unlikely it includes \"the\" and \"on\". The output might include \"cat\" and \"mat\" depending on how exactly the function is implemented.\n\nNo is CORRECT.
