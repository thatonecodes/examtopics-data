Run the Table.Buffer function in Query1.\nWhen Query1 is referenced by the other queries, Power Query might re-evaluate it multiple times during a refresh. By applying the Table.Buffer function in Query1, you force its results to be cached in memory.

Run the Table.Buffer function in Query1.\nThe Table.Buffer function loads the data from Query1 into memory, which can speed up subsequent transformations and queries that reference Query1.\n\nThis is particularly useful when Query1 is referenced multiple times (e.g., by Query2, Query3, and Query4), as it reduces the need to reload the data from the source.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/powerquery-m/table-buffer","timestamp":"1741948860.0","comment_id":"1395571","upvote_count":"1","poster":"5bf040d"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1349788","poster":"drigotto8","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGemini say so, seems reasonable.\nWhen you use Table.Buffer on a query (like Query1 in this case), you force Power BI to fully load the results of that query into memory. Because Query1 is referenced by the other three queries, this buffering has a significant positive impact. Instead of Query2, Query3, and Query4 each re-evaluating Query1 every time they are refreshed, they can simply reuse the buffered copy already in memory.

If Query1 is used in other queries, applying Table.buffer ensures all the customer data is loaded into memory once, speeding up the refresh process.\n\nReconfiguring Query1 as a dataflow could help with reusability and organizing transformations, but it doesnâ€™t directly improve refresh times for the existing model.","timestamp":"1736831520.0"},{"poster":"Pey1nkh","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen a query in Power BI is referenced multiple times (as Query1 is referenced by Query2, Query3, and Query4 in this scenario), Power BI can execute Query1 multiple times during the data refresh process.
