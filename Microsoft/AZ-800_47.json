Here's why:\n\nDHCP Scope Options: Scope options apply to all clients receiving IP addresses from that scope. These options include settings like default gateway, DNS server addresses, and domain name. While useful for general network configuration, they don't provide a mechanism to assign specific IP addresses to individual devices.\n\nWhat you need: DHCP Reservations To ensure printers always have the same IP address, you need to configure DHCP reservations. A DHCP reservation creates a mapping between a device's MAC address and an IP address within the DHCP scope. This ensures that whenever the printer requests an IP address, it receives the same one, regardless of other devices on the network.","poster":"Krayzr","comment_id":"1322616","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733459640.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1308838","poster":"Ni_yot","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB, you need a static IP address for this to work","timestamp":"1731078240.0"},{"timestamp":"1730875740.0","content":"Answer is B","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1307693","poster":"Ksk08"}],"question_id":231,"unix_timestamp":1730875740,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/150839-exam-az-800-topic-5-question-49-discussion/","answer_description":"","exam_id":60,"choices":{"B":"No","A":"Yes"},"question_images":[],"isMC":true},{"id":"QGAmD2EWc3VOsQjn8kf7","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1652266020,"choices":{"D":"File Server Resource Manager (FSRM)","C":"Distributed File System (DFS) Namespaces","B":"Work Folders","A":"Storage Spaces"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/75467-exam-az-800-topic-5-question-5-discussion/","timestamp":"2022-05-11 12:47:00","exam_id":60,"question_text":"You have a server that runs Windows Server and contains a shared folder named UserData.\nYou need to limit the amount of storage space that each user can consume in UserData.\nWhat should you use?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1652266020.0","upvote_count":"15","comment_id":"600058","poster":"AvoKikinha","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFeatures\nFile Server Resource Manager includes the following features:\n\nQuota management allows you to limit the space that is allowed for a volume or folder, and they can be automatically applied to new folders that are created on a volume.
