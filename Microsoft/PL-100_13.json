For example, you can save a customer's name in a variable called UserName. The bot can then address the customer by name as the conversation continues.\nHowever, you can also make variables into bot variables, so that they apply across the entire bot.\n\nBox 3: Publish -\nAfter creating a chatbot in the Power Virtual Agents portal, you must publish your bot before Teams users can interact with it.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/authoring-fundamentals https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/teams/authoring-variables-bot-teams https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/add-power-virtual-agents-bot-to-teams","isMC":false,"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou need to design and distribute a chatbot that captures ideas for new recipes.\nWhat should you use?
