When deploying resources through Azure Resource Manager templates, it's a best practice to store sensitive data like administrative passwords in Azure Key Vault rather than in the template itself. By referencing the Azure Key Vault in the ARM template, the password can be fetched securely during deployment.\n\nThe access policy in Azure Key Vault defines what operations can be done on the secrets (like read or write) and who can perform these operations.\n\nThus, the best way to securely store and reference an administrative password in an Azure Resource Manager template is by using Azure Key Vault and setting an appropriate access policy."},{"comment_id":"995220","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1693494180.0","poster":"CarlosMarin","content":"This question was in my exam on 31/08/2023."},{"content":"answer is right.
