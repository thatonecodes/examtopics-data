When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\nOverview -\nLitware, Inc. is a manufacturing company that has offices throughout North America. The analytics team at Litware contains data engineers, analytics engineers, data analysts, and data scientists.\n\nExisting Environment -\n\nFabric Environment -\nLitware has been using a Microsoft Power BI tenant for three years. Litware has NOT enabled any Fabric capacities and features.\n\nAvailable Data -\nLitware has data that must be analyzed as shown in the following table.\n//IMG//\n\nThe Product data contains a single table and the following columns.\n//IMG//\n\nThe customer satisfaction data contains the following tables:\n\nSurvey -\n\nQuestion -\n\nResponse -\nFor each survey submitted, the following occurs:\nOne row is added to the Survey table.\nOne row is added to the Response table for each question in the survey.\nThe Question table contains the text of each survey question. The third question in each survey response is an overall satisfaction score. Customers can submit a survey after each purchase.\n\nUser Problems -\nThe analytics team has large volumes of data, some of which is semi-structured. The team wants to use Fabric to create a new data store.\nProduct data is often classified into three pricing groups: high, medium, and low. This logic is implemented in several databases and semantic models, but the logic does NOT always match across implementations.\n\nRequirements -\n\nPlanned Changes -\nLitware plans to enable Fabric features in the existing tenant. The analytics team will create a new data store as a proof of concept (PoC). The remaining Liware users will only get access to the Fabric features once the PoC is complete. The PoC will be completed by using a Fabric trial capacity\nThe following three workspaces will be created:\nAnalyticsPOC: Will contain the data store, semantic models, reports pipelines, dataflow, and notebooks used to populate the data store\nDataEngPOC: Will contain all the pipelines, dataflows, and notebooks used to populate OneLake\nDataSciPOC: Will contain all the notebooks and reports created by the data scientists\nThe following will be created in the AnalyticsPOC workspace:\nA data store (type to be decided)\n\nA custom semantic model -\n\nA default semantic model -\n\nInteractive reports -\nThe data engineers will create data pipelines to load data to OneLake either hourly or daily depending on the data source. The analytics engineers will create processes to ingest, transform, and load the data to the data store in the AnalyticsPOC workspace daily. Whenever possible, the data engineers will use low-code tools for data ingestion. The choice of which data cleansing and transformation tools to use will be at the data engineers’ discretion.\nAll the semantic models and reports in the Analytics POC workspace will use the data store as the sole data source.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\nThe data store must support the following:\nRead access by using T-SQL or Python\nSemi-structured and unstructured data\nRow-level security (RLS) for users executing T-SQL queries\nFiles loaded by the data engineers to OneLake will be stored in the Parquet format and will meet Delta Lake specifications.\nData will be loaded without transformation in one area of the AnalyticsPOC data store. The data will then be cleansed, merged, and transformed into a dimensional model\nThe data load process must ensure that the raw and cleansed data is updated completely before populating the dimensional model\nThe dimensional model must contain a date dimension. There is no existing data source for the date dimension. The Litware fiscal year matches the calendar year. The date dimension must always contain dates from 2010 through the end of the current year.\nThe product pricing group logic must be maintained by the analytics engineers in a single location. The pricing group data must be made available in the data store for T-SOL. queries and in the default semantic model. The following logic must be used:\nList prices that are less than or equal to 50 are in the low pricing group.\nList prices that are greater than 50 and less than or equal to 1,000 are in the medium pricing group.\nList prices that are greater than 1,000 are in the high pricing group.\n\nSecurity Requirements -\nOnly Fabric administrators and the analytics team must be able to see the Fabric items created as part of the PoC.\nLitware identifies the following security requirements for the Fabric items in the AnalyticsPOC workspace:\nFabric administrators will be the workspace administrators.\nThe data engineers must be able to read from and write to the data store. No access must be granted to datasets or reports.\nThe analytics engineers must be able to read from, write to, and create schemas in the data store. They also must be able to create and share semantic models with the data analysts and view and modify all reports in the workspace.\nThe data scientists must be able to read from the data store, but not write to it. They will access the data by using a Spark notebook\nThe data analysts must have read access to only the dimensional model objects in the data store. They also must have access to create Power BI reports by using the semantic models created by the analytics engineers.\nThe date dimension must be available to all users of the data store.\nThe principle of least privilege must be followed.\nBoth the default and custom semantic models must include only tables or views from the dimensional model in the data store. Litware already has the following Microsoft Entra security groups:\nFabricAdmins: Fabric administrators\nAnalyticsTeam: All the members of the analytics team\nDataAnalysts: The data analysts on the analytics team\nDataScientists: The data scientists on the analytics team\nDataEngineers: The data engineers on the analytics team\nAnalyticsEngineers: The analytics engineers on the analytics team\n\nReport Requirements -\nThe data analysts must create a customer satisfaction report that meets the following requirements:\nEnables a user to select a product to filter customer survey responses to only those who have purchased that product.\nDisplays the average overall satisfaction score of all the surveys submitted during the last 12 months up to a selected dat.\nShows data as soon as the data is updated in the data store.\nEnsures that the report and the semantic model only contain data from the current and previous year.\nEnsures that the report respects any table-level security specified in the source data store.\nMinimizes the execution time of report queries.\nYou need to assign permissions for the data store in the AnalyticsPOC workspace. The solution must meet the security requirements.\nWhich additional permissions should you assign when you share the data store? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n//IMG//","exam_id":71,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-600/image224.png"],"answer_ET":"","question_id":125,"timestamp":"2024-02-12 16:19:00","unix_timestamp":1707751140,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1707931320.0","upvote_count":"84","poster":"Bharat","comment_id":"1150366","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1736009280.0","poster":"scorradi","content":"My guest based in the question description:\nData analysts --> Build Reports on the default dataset.\nData Scientist -> Spark, because they need to use Notebooks as the question says.\nData Engineers -> Spark, because the need to write data.","comment_id":"1336448"},{"comment_id":"1328325","timestamp":"1734507540.0","poster":"Training_be2","upvote_count":"3","content":"Data analysts --> Build Reports on the default dataset\nData Scientist will access the data through a Notebook --> Read all Apache Spark\nData Engineers will read and write to the data store (lakehouse) --> Read all Apache Spark\nSQL Analytics Endpoint is read-only mode.
