At this point, the computer is not fully operational, and some administrative tasks can only be performed by members of the local Administrators group or the domain-level Administrators group.\n\nUser1 is a member of the Domain Admins group, which has administrative privileges over all computers in the domain, including Computer1. This means that User1 can perform administrative tasks, such as restoring a system restore point, when the computer is in Advanced startup mode.\n\nSo User1 can restore RP1 on Computer1 while Windows is running or if Computer1 restarts by using Advanced startup."},{"poster":"Odeon12","timestamp":"1676067840.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"804825","content":"Q1: User1 and User 3 only.
