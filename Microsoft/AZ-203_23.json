The client and server will synchronize their sampling so that, in Search, you can navigate between related page views and requests.\n\nIngestion sampling happens at the Application Insights service endpoint. It discards some of the telemetry that arrives from your app, at a sampling rate that you set. It doesn't reduce telemetry traffic sent from your app, but helps you keep within your monthly quota. The main advantage of ingestion sampling is that you can set the sampling rate without redeploying your app. Ingestion sampling works uniformly for all servers and clients, but it does not apply when any other types of sampling are in operation.","poster":"realbart","comment_id":"70244","timestamp":"1585771080.0","upvote_count":"5","comments":[{"poster":"riley5","upvote_count":"2","content":"From this, are you saying ingestion sampling is correct?","comment_id":"74298","timestamp":"1586821320.0"}]},{"comment_id":"58244","upvote_count":"1","content":"B should be the answer","poster":"Dumindu","timestamp":"1583250120.0"},{"poster":"KK_uniq","content":"correct answer is B.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1612563000.0","content":"Agree.\n\n\"The daily cap is intended to be used as a way to manage an unexpected increase in data volume from your managed resources and stay within your limit, or when you want to limit unplanned charges for your workspace.
