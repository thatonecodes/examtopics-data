If Azure Service Fabric determines that a failover needs to occur, the failover will be similar to that of a failover cluster instance (FCI). The service fabric will look for a node with spare capacity and spin up a new SQL Server instance. The database files will then be attached, recovery will be run, and gateways will be updated to point applications to the new node. No virtual network or listener or updates are required.
