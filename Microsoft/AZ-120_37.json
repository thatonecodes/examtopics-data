After you make sure that there's enough disk space, perform full database and log backups by using one of the following disk backup methods. You can back up either directly to volumes attached to the HANA Large Instance units or to NFS shares that are set up in an Azure virtual machine (VM). In the latter case, customers set up a Linux VM in Azure, attach Azure Storage to the VM, and share the storage through a configured NFS server in that VM. If you perform the backup against volumes that directly attach to HANA Large Instance units, copy the backups to an Azure storage account. Do this after you set up an Azure VM that exports NFS shares that are based on Azure Storage. You can also use either an Azure Backup vault or Azure cold storage.\n\n Another option is to use a third-party data protection tool to store the backups after they're copied to an Azure storage account. The DIY backup option also might be necessary for data that you need to store for longer periods of time for compliance and auditing purposes. In all cases, the backups are copied into NFS shares represented through a VM and Azure Storage.","comment_id":"161500"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"137745","poster":"GiuseppeF","content":"The right answer is A.
