To create the appliance, you download a setup file in Open Virtualization Appliance (.ova) format, and import it as a VM on your on-premises vCenter Server.\nStep 2: Create a migration group in the project\nFor the purposes of assessment, you gather the discovered VMs into groups. For example, you might group VMs that run the same application. For more precise grouping, you can use dependency visualization to view dependencies of a specific machine, or for all machines in a group and refine the group.\nStep 3: Create an assessment in the project\nAfter a group is defined, you create an assessment for it.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-overview","answer":"","topic":"3","timestamp":"2020-06-08 03:21:00","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02518/0024400001.jpg"],"answers_community":[],"isMC":false,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02518/0024500001.jpg"],"question_id":47,"exam_id":42},{"id":"CIGF99Z0snEgomOpO6pP","answer_description":"References:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-overview","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-01-12 23:56:00","answer":"D","question_id":48,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1710928620.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1178142","content":"D is right","poster":"tashakori"},{"poster":"Rahul91Shree","content":"Answer is United States Only, \nQuestion is very clear about geography.
