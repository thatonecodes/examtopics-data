This allows you to re-distribute your data to match the desired new partition key scheme, and make the relevant application changes afterwards, thus achieving the effect of “updating your partition key”.\nYou will need to have access to an Azure subscription, and an Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account that will be used for the migration metadata (this can be the same as the collection where you wish to change partition key scheme, if you wish).\nThe deployment uses Azure Resource Manager (ARM) to deploy two app service plans.
