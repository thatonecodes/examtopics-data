Yes\n\nThe solution meets the goal of granting all organizational users read access to one dashboard and three reports.\n\nBy creating an Azure Active Directory (AAD) group that contains all the users and sharing each selected report and the one dashboard to the group, you can grant read access to the selected resources to all users in the organization.
