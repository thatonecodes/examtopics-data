Records in dbo.SalesTransactions are updated in SQLDW up to three days after being created. The records do NOT change after three days.\n\nPower BI -\nLitware has a new Power BI tenant that contains an empty workspace named Sales Analytics.\nAll users have Power BI Premium per user licenses.\nIT data analytics are workspace administrators.
