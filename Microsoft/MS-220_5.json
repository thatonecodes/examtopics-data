This question is about emails with attachments. If I go to Microsoft Admin Center -> Show All -> Security -> Email and Collaboration -> Policies and Rules -> Threat Policies I can see Anti-spam, Anti-malware, and Safe Attachments.

Makes me wonder if someone is trying to pollute the website with false answers. But at present, the answer is \"A\" (Anti-malware) and \"C\" (Safe Attachments) since both of those pertain to attachments, whereas AntiSpam does not.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"788485","timestamp":"1674718560.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"imo it's BC","poster":"Jotest"},{"timestamp":"1674603780.0","poster":"TtotheA2021","content":"Selected Answer: BC\ni: Anti-malware, Anti-malware policies are used to help protect your organization against malware and other malicious software.
