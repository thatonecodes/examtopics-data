Therefore, to create an anomaly detection model, you prepare training data with all the valid sizes of bottles. If something doesn't fall under the valid ones, will be rejected.\n\nThis scenario is similar to detecting fraudulent transactions, you often don't have enough examples of fraud to train on. But you might have many examples of good transactions. The PCA-Based Anomaly Detection module solves the problem by analyzing available features to determine what constitutes a \"normal\" class. The module then applies distance metrics to identify cases that represent anomalies. This approach lets you train a model by using existing imbalanced data.","poster":"sreekarv"},{"timestamp":"1620967260.0","poster":"Geekie","content":"Answer is Anomaly detection.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"218957"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"10","content":"Anomaly detection might indicate fraud but is not used to identify the correct bottle shape.","comment_id":"241420","poster":"Johnnien","timestamp":"1623476760.0"}],"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1619811480.0","content":"Answer should be A-Anomaly Detection\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/learn/modules/get-started-ai-fundamentals/3-understand-anomaly-detection\n\nImagine you're creating a software system to monitor credit card transactions and detect unusual usage patterns that might indicate fraud.\n Or an application that tracks activity in an automated production line and identifies failures. <<<<<<<<<<\nOr a racing car telemetry system that uses sensors to proactively warn engineers about potential mechanical failures before they happen.","comment_id":"209593","poster":"gargaditya"},{"timestamp":"1619430600.0","comments":[{"content":"computer vision is a workload","comment_id":"254458","timestamp":"1624920360.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"nohaph"}],"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"206224","poster":"ealcober","content":"the question asks fot WORKLOAD (anomaly detect.) not SERVICE (Computer Vision...)"},{"comment_id":"204216","content":"Should be anamoly detection","poster":"mailtridev","timestamp":"1619097360.0","comments":[{"content":"The right answer is C: Computer Vision.
