By applying RLS, you can restrict report recipients’ visibility to only the data relevant to them.\nIn your scenario, you want to ensure that employees can only see results related to the emails they sent. RLS provides a fine-grained approach to achieve this without affecting the model size.\nHiding columns or removing them during import won’t prevent recipients from accessing the data if they have direct access to the model.","poster":"Umbre"},{"comment_id":"1171993","timestamp":"1710271560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect","upvote_count":"1","poster":"AZFabio"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nCLS is not available in Power Bi so we either Mask or remove the columns.
