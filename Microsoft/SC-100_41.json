Hybrid Connections\n\nHybrid Connections is a feature in Azure App Service that provides a way to access application resources in other networks. It uses a secure, outbound-only connection that doesn’t require opening inbound ports to your on-premises network. This makes it a suitable choice for accessing on-premises databases without exposing additional internet-accessible endpoints.","timestamp":"1714402860.0","comment_id":"1056998"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"zellck","timestamp":"1699956960.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-hybrid-connections\nWithin App Service, Hybrid Connections can be used to access application resources in any network that can make outbound calls to Azure over port 443. Hybrid Connections provides access from your app to a TCP endpoint and doesn't enable a new way to access your app. As used in App Service, each Hybrid Connection correlates to a single TCP host and port combination. This enables your apps to access resources on any OS, provided it's a TCP endpoint. The Hybrid Connections feature doesn't know or care what the application protocol is, or what you are accessing. It simply provides network access.","comment_id":"897380"},{"timestamp":"1694341560.0","poster":"josh_josh","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is D","comment_id":"834955","comments":[{"poster":"Ramye","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721311320.0","content":"Private End Point goes with VNet in Azure, so this can't be used.","comment_id":"1126027"},{"poster":"Toschu","content":"Not possible, because there is no VPN between Azure and the local network.","timestamp":"1695620520.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"849888"}],"upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"834627","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. A private endpoint should be included in the recommendation.\n\nPrivate endpoints provide secure access to Azure Services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Using a private endpoint, you can access Azure services such as Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, and others over a private IP address in your virtual network. With a private endpoint, traffic between your virtual network and the Azure service travels over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.\n\nIn this scenario, using a private endpoint for the Microsoft SQL Server databases on the on-premises network would provide a secure connection between the web apps and the databases without requiring a Site-to-Site VPN or an ExpressRoute connection. This would minimize the number of open internet-accessible endpoints to the on-premises network, which would help enhance security.","poster":"Fal991l","timestamp":"1694311740.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"995524","poster":"atoon","timestamp":"1709254560.0","content":"That is not correct.

A hybrid connection consists of an Azure Relay service endpoint that is used to relay traffic between the App Service app and the on-premises resource.","timestamp":"1694311800.0","poster":"Fal991l","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"834632","content":"To use hybrid connections, you need to install an agent on a machine in your on-premises network that has access to the resource you want to connect to. The agent communicates with the Azure Relay service endpoint, enabling communication between the App Service app and the on-premises resource.\n\nHowever, compared to private endpoints, hybrid connections can have some additional configuration overhead, require the installation of an agent on the on-premises network, and could add some additional network hops. Therefore, private endpoints are generally considered to be the preferred option for connecting Azure App Service web apps to on-premises resources.","timestamp":"1694311800.0","poster":"Fal991l"}]}]}],"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/79246-exam-sc-100-topic-4-question-4-discussion/"},{"id":"CQxDo9tMCg59IQK1jGHX","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_id":205,"answer":"D","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1738343880,"exam_id":121,"topic":"4","question_text":"You have an on-premises server that runs Windows Server and contains a Microsoft SQL Server database named DB1.\n\nYou plan to migrate DB1 to Azure.\n\nYou need to recommend an encrypted Azure database solution that meets the following requirements:\n\n• Minimizes the risks of malware that uses elevated privileges to access sensitive data\n• Prevents database administrators from accessing sensitive data\n• Enables pattern matching for server-side database operations\n• Supports Microsoft Azure Attestation\n• Uses hardware-based encryption\n\nWhat should you include in the recommendation?","timestamp":"2025-01-31 18:18:00","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/155761-exam-sc-100-topic-4-question-40-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Azure SQL Managed Instance that has Always Encrypted configured","D":"Azure SQL Database with Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) enclaves","B":"Azure SQL Database with virtualization-based security (VBS) enclaves","A":"SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines with virtualization-based security (VBS) enclaves"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nTo meet these requirements, I recommend using Azure SQL Database with Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) enclaves.
