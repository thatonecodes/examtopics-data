Thus, single sign-on does not work with these protocols. However, applications can prompt for credentials or use credentials stored in the Windows Vault, which are not protected by Windows Defender Credential Guard with any of these protocols. It is recommended that valuable credentials, such as the sign-in credentials, are not to be used with any of these protocols. If these protocols must be used by domain or Azure AD users, secondary credentials should be provisioned for these use cases.\n\nWhen Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled, Kerberos does not allow unconstrained Kerberos delegation or DES encryption, not only for signed-in credentials, but also prompted or saved credentials.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-how-it-works","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"626849","poster":"valgaw"},{"poster":"HKEX388","comment_id":"619855","comments":[{"comment_id":"628849","upvote_count":"2","content":"it's not D.
