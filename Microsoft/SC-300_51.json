Fabrikam has an Azure AD tenant named fabrikam.com.\n\nExisting Environment. Existing Environment\n\nThe on-premises network of Contoso contains an Active Directory domain named contoso.com. The domain contains an organizational unit (OU) named Contoso_Resources. The Contoso_Resources OU contains all users and computers.\n\nThe contoso.com Active Directory domain contains the relevant users shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nContoso also includes a marketing department that has users in each office.\n\nExisting Environment. Microsoft 365/Azure Environment\n\nContoso has an Azure AD tenant named contoso.com that has the following associated licenses:\n\n• Microsoft Office 365 Enterprise E5\n• Enterprise Mobility + Security E5\n• Windows 10 Enterprise E3\n• Project Plan 3\n\nAzure AD Connect is configured between Azure AD and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Only the Contoso_Resources OU is synced.\n\nHelpdesk administrators routinely use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage user settings.\n\nUser administrators currently use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manually assign licenses. All users have all licenses assigned besides the following exceptions:\n\n• The users in the London office have the Microsoft 365 Phone System license unassigned.\n• The users in the Seattle office have the Yammer Enterprise license unassigned.\n\nSecurity defaults are disabled for contoso.com.\n\nContoso uses Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to protect administrative roles.\n\nExisting Environment. Problem Statements\n\nContoso identifies the following issues:\n\n• Currently, all the helpdesk administrators can manage user licenses throughout the entire Microsoft 365 tenant.\n• The user administrators report that it is tedious to manually configure the different license requirements for each Contoso office.\n• The helpdesk administrators spend too much time provisioning internal and guest access to the required Microsoft 365 services and apps.\n• Currently, the helpdesk administrators can perform tasks by using the User administrator role without justification or approval.\n• When the Logs node is selected in Azure AD, an error message appears stating that Log Analytics integration is not enabled.\n\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes -\n\nContoso plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Implement self-service password reset (SSPR).\n• Analyze Azure audit activity logs by using Azure Monitor.\n• Simplify license allocation for new users added to the tenant.\n• Collaborate with the users at Fabrikam on a joint marketing campaign.\n• Configure the User administrator role to require justification and approval to activate.\n• Implement a custom line-of-business Azure web app named App1. App1 will be accessible from the internet and authenticated by using Azure AD accounts.\n• For new users in the marketing department, implement an automated approval workflow to provide access to a Microsoft SharePoint Online site, group, and app.\n\nContoso plans to acquire a company named A. Datum Corporation. One hundred new A. Datum users will be created in an Active Directory OU named Adatum. The users will be located in London and Seattle.\n\nRequirements. Technical Requirements\n\nContoso identifies the following technical requirements:\n\n• All users must be synced from AD DS to the contoso.com Azure AD tenant.\n• App1 must have a redirect URI pointed to https://contoso.com/auth-response.\n• License allocation for new users must be assigned automatically based on the location of the user.\n• Fabrikam users must have access to the marketing department’s SharePoint site for a maximum of 90 days.\n• Administrative actions performed in Azure AD must be audited. Audit logs must be retained for one year.\n• The helpdesk administrators must be able to manage licenses for only the users in their respective office.\n• Users must be forced to change their password if there is a probability that the users’ identity was compromised.\n\n\nYou need to meet the planned changes and technical requirements for App1.\n\nWhat should you implement?","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: D\ncorrect answer","comment_id":"1024322","poster":"ACSC","timestamp":"1712193840.0"},{"timestamp":"1721792760.0","content":"D\nAzure AD app registration is used to integrate your application with Azure AD and use its capabilities, such as authentication and authorization.
