However, it is not designed for directly testing or optimizing content filter configurations with sample questions in Content Safety Studio.\n\nTo meet the requirement of testing content filters on sample questions, you should use the Moderate text content feature, as it specifically allows you to check for objectionable content in text input and output. Therefore, using the Safety metaprompt feature does not fulfill the requirement.","poster":"a8da4af","comment_id":"1304731"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/150482-exam-ai-102-topic-8-question-8-discussion/","question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
