No. The recommendation to use k=3 is a common practice in k-fold cross-validation, but it may not necessarily satisfy the requirements in every case. It depends on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the data sample.\n\nFor example, if the data sample is small, using k=3 may not provide enough training data for the model to learn from, resulting in a high variance in the evaluation metric. In this case, a larger value of k may be more appropriate. On the other hand, if the data sample is very large, using k=3 may result in a low bias but high variance, in which case a smaller value of k may be more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, it's important to consider the specific requirements and characteristics of the task and data sample when choosing the value of k for k-fold cross-validation.
