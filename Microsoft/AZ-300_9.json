In this section, you will perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g., copy and paste, ability to navigate to external websites) will not be possible by design.\nScoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for that task.\nLabs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam in the time provided.\nPlease note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be able to return to the lab.\n\nTo start the lab -\nYou may start the lab by clicking the Next button.\nYou need to allow RDP connections over TCP port 3389 to VM1 from the Internet.
