Please if you r not sure with it, ask for rather than state here. \nWe got VM1 & VM2 here, VM1 in RG1 and RG1 set budget alert with in 1000 euros.

Act group2 with trigger SMS and Act group3 with trigger Azure app, which are all not working here. Then when running out of the budget, VM1 stopped. It won't affect other resources.

However, when the budgets run over 50% (500 euros), action 1 will be triggered - send email. 500 / 600 * 30 = 25 days, which means every 25 day in a month, a notification email will be sent to recipients.
