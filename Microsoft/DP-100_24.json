The Correct answer is: C\nThe correct method for splitting a time series dataset should consider the sequential nature of the data. The options available in the Split Data component in Azure ML are:\n1. Split Rows: This mode is used to simply divide the data into two parts. This mode is generally used when the sequence of data is not a concern.\n2. Regular Expression Split: This mode is for dividing the dataset based on a pattern in a text field such as analyzing sentiment.\n3. Relative Expression Split: This mode applies to conditions on a number column, which could include date/time fields.\nFor time series data, where the sequence and continuity of data points are important, neither randomization (as in Split Rows with randomization) nor pattern-based splits (as in Regular Expression Split) are appropriate.

This number column can be a date/time field, age, dollar amounts, percentages, or any other numerical value. It provides flexibility in defining the splitting criteria based on these numeric conditions.\n\nIn the context of a time series dataset, you can use the Relative Expression Split mode to split the dataset based on conditions related to the time component, such as dividing data by calendar date, time periods, or specific ranges of dates.","timestamp":"1705075260.0","comment_id":"949862","poster":"PI_Team"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1691672160.0","comment_id":"804448","poster":"RamundiGR","content":"it clearly C!! you can check on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/component-reference/split-data"},{"poster":"RamundiGR","upvote_count":"2","content":"why the moderator does not bother to correct those answers?","comment_id":"799798","timestamp":"1691322840.0"},{"content":"I think D is the correct one to choose random dates belonging to all years in two datasets","upvote_count":"1","poster":"NachoPrendes","timestamp":"1690722120.0","comment_id":"792949"},{"content":"why not B?","comment_id":"745191","poster":"Edriv","timestamp":"1686747540.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"732920","poster":"KIshor1212","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCalendar year\nA common scenario is to divide a dataset by years.

That’s not the case with time series data. Here, you’ll want to use values at the rear of the dataset for testing and everything else for training.\nExample: Select first 10 years for training and 2 years for testing.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-module-reference/split-data (check the Relative Expression Split section)","comment_id":"583746","timestamp":"1665415200.0","poster":"azurelearner666","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"C is the correct choice.
