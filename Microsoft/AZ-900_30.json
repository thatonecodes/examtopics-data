When deployed with a web application firewall (WAF), DDoS Protection Standard protects both at the network layer (Layer 3 and 4, offered by Azure DDoS Protection Standard) and at the application layer (Layer 7, offered by a WAF).\n\nSource: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"453804","poster":"JpTheCloudGuy"},{"content":"answer is wrong. it should be perimeter layer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"453504","timestamp":"1632844680.0","poster":"anushkaeranga"},{"timestamp":"1632824220.0","poster":"Kkkcl","content":"Incorrect answer, should be perimeter layer","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"453275"},{"timestamp":"1632823500.0","poster":"[Removed]","comments":[{"content":"Perimeter Layer\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-network-connectivity-azure/7-combine-services-complete-solution","poster":"comuse","timestamp":"1632905520.0","comment_id":"453968","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"453268","content":"Azure firewall is Network layer.
