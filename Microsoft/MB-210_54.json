Not A, as question asks what you as admin needs to do, not what user needs to do. Not C, as you can have both Kanban and Calendar controls at the same time","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"611859","poster":"ceejaybee"},{"content":"The option D. Add the Kanban control to the view is not the correct answer because the Kanban control is already available in Dynamics 365 Sales. The Kanban control is added to the Activity entity by default. Therefore, there’s no need to add the Kanban control to the view.\n\nThe salesperson can switch their view type to Kanban by selecting the More commands icon on the command bar, then selecting Show As, and finally choosing Kanban. This allows the salesperson to visually represent their sales activities in their different states and they can drag them to move from one status to another.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Select Show As in the ribbon. This allows the salesperson to switch their view type to Kanban without needing to add the Kanban control to the view.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724049120.0","poster":"MitarbeiterKC","comment_id":"1153787"},{"poster":"NA1926","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714481700.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n1a-2c-3b corretta","comments":[{"content":"sorry D correct","timestamp":"1714481760.0","comment_id":"1057923","poster":"NA1926","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1057921"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\ncorretto","comment_id":"1051887","poster":"NA1926","timestamp":"1713878580.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"NA1926","content":"Selected Answer: D\ncorrect","comment_id":"1019000","timestamp":"1711562220.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"909843","upvote_count":"1","poster":"inka11","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD\n\nYou need to ensure that the salesperson can switch their view type = add Kanban","timestamp":"1701322260.0"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Dotzs","comment_id":"802820","content":"- You need to have more that one control for the 'show as' button to show.\n- If you have another control that is not Kanban, you cannot perform that action\n- So you need to add the Kanban control first","timestamp":"1691547240.0"}],"upvote_count":"2","poster":"bigfootjoe","comment_id":"638805","timestamp":"1674931860.0","content":"This is A because this question is specifically asking about \"Show As\" NOT that the control needs to be added."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1672051080.0","poster":"ramberry","comment_id":"622419"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Select Create View in the ribbon.","A":"Select Show As in the ribbon.","C":"Remove the Calendar control, and then add the Kanban control to the view.","D":"Add the Kanban control to the view."},"question_id":266,"exam_id":75,"answer":"D","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1654437180},{"id":"o16vZtszD6K7E59BSEu3","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04190/0022000001.jpg"],"exam_id":75,"timestamp":"2022-08-10 23:37:00","unix_timestamp":1660167420,"answer_ET":"","answers_community":[],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04190/0022100001.jpg"],"answer":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/77996-exam-mb-210-topic-2-question-85-discussion/","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/qualify-lead-convert-opportunity-sales https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/create-edit-opportunity-sales","question_id":267,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nA company uses Dynamics 365 Sales.
