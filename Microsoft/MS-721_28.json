Yes.\n\nIn this specific scenario, using New-CsTeamsNetworkRoamingPolicy with -AllowIPVideo set to $False is an appropriate solution to meet the goal of preventing video calls when users roam at the specified corporate site. Here's why:\n\nNetwork Roaming Focus: This cmdlet is specifically designed to manage Teams features during network transitions, making it suitable for the roaming aspect of the requirement.\nSite-Specific Restriction: Network roaming policies can be assigned to specific network sites, ensuring the video restriction applies only when users roam within the designated corporate site.\nDynamic Adjustment: The policy dynamically adjusts video settings based on the user's network location, effectively disabling video when they're at the restricted site and allowing it when they're elsewhere.","poster":"Azazel993","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
