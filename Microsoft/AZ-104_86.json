It does this by adding an extra layer of authorization to critical operations.\n\nHow Resource Guard works\n\nResource Guard works by associating a vault with a Resource Guard. When you try to perform a critical operation on the vault, Azure first checks to see if you have the appropriate permissions on the Resource Guard. If you do not have the appropriate permissions, the operation will fail.\n\nHow to create a Resource Guard\n\nCreating a Resource Guard is a simple process that can be done in the Azure portal.
