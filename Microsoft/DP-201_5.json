The only way to give users fine-grained access to folders in ADLS Gen2 is to use Access Control Lists. If this is not used you will have to use RBAC and this can only give access to ALL of the data in a storage account or ALL of the data in the container, which will not fulfill the requirement. \n\nIt is also unlikely that Shared Access Signatures (SAS) should be used. The reason is that this is internal and you want to have a concept of who actually access what (and they likely have users set up in AAD).
