If a storage fault domain fails due to hardware or software failure, only the VM instance with disks on the storage fault domain fails.\n\nBox 2: managed disks -\nManaged disks provide better reliability for Availability Sets by ensuring that the disks of VMs in an Availability Set are sufficiently isolated from each other to avoid single points of failure.
