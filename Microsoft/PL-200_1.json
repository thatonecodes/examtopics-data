Security Roles\n\nIn Power Platform, you can manage access to apps through Security Roles. By assigning the appropriate Security Role to the members of the sales team, you can ensure that they have the necessary permissions to access the app. Please note that the Dynamics administration center and Manage Roles are not the correct places to configure app permissions.","poster":"Marius12345","comment_id":"1063049","timestamp":"1699197600.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1697346720.0","comment_id":"1043870","poster":"Brooklyn_","upvote_count":"2","content":"To ensure that sales team members can access the app, you should configure app permissions in the Dynamics administration center. Option A, \"Dynamics administration center,\" is the correct choice.\n\nIn Dynamics 365 or a similar CRM system, the Dynamics administration center is typically where you control user access and permissions to various apps and features. You can assign users to roles, configure security settings, and manage overall access to specific applications.\n\nOption B, \"Manage Roles,\" and Option C, \"Security Roles,\" are important components within the Dynamics administration center. \"Manage Roles\" is where you create custom roles to define what actions users can perform in the app, and \"Security Roles\" are used to grant or restrict access to specific records and entities within the system. However, configuring app permissions typically begins at the broader level in the Dynamics administration center before fine-tuning access at the role and security role levels."},{"comment_id":"1016847","poster":"drjphat","content":"Power Apps Admin Center > Environments > [Select Env] > Settings> Users + Permissions > SECURITY ROLES.
