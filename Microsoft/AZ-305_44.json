Azure File Sync can be used to sync files from your on-premises server (VM1) to an Azure file share, and optionally, to other Windows servers in different branch offices."},{"timestamp":"1709336520.0","comment_id":"1163843","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD for sure.","poster":"JoShizo","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1680453120.0","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","comment_id":"859068","upvote_count":"6","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. an Azure file share and Azure File Sync\n\nAzure File Sync enables you to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files while maintaining local access to the data. In this scenario, you can use Azure File Sync to synchronize the shared files on VM1 to an Azure file share. This ensures that the latest versions of the files are available in Azure.\n\nIn case the Toronto branch office becomes inaccessible, users can access the shared files directly from the Azure file share.
