It's important that you select the version that best fits the conversational AI experience you're designing.\n- Direct Line Speech. It provides text-to-speech and speech-to-text services within the channel. It allows a client to stream audio directly to the channel which will then be converted to text and sent to the bot. Direct Line Speech can also convert text messages from the bot into audio messages spoken by an AI-powered voice.
