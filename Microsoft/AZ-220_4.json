However, when it comes to performing OTA updates, using cloud-to-device messages is usually the more appropriate method.\n\nCloud-to-device messages can be used to send firmware updates or other configuration changes to devices, and they can be scheduled to occur at specific times or intervals using Azure IoT Hub's Jobs feature.\n\nTherefore, the recommended method for performing an OTA update on devices that connect to an Azure IoT hub by using scheduled jobs is to use a cloud-to-device message.
