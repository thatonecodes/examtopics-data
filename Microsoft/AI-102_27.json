Creating a new entity for the domain alone is not sufficient for implementing the given phrase list effectively. Entities are used to identify specific data points within a query, such as locations or names.\n\nTo properly train the language model with these phrases, you should add them as example utterances within the FindContact intent. This helps the Language Understanding (LUIS) service learn from the specific examples and improve its ability to recognize similar queries.\n\nSo, you should:\n\nAdd the given phrases as example utterances in the FindContact intent.\n\nOptionally, create entities to capture specific details like locations (e.g., London, Seattle, Ukraine).","poster":"pabsinaz"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nRight answer is no","timestamp":"1734760200.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"pabsinaz","comment_id":"1329836"},{"poster":"4371883","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. it should be phrase list. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/luis/concepts/patterns-features","comment_id":"1295063","timestamp":"1728465720.0"},{"comment_id":"1288155","timestamp":"1727100240.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNO - you need a pattern","poster":"mrg998"},{"poster":"AzureGeek79","comment_id":"1283430","upvote_count":"1","content":"ChatGPT answer is B.

No\n\nThe solution does not meet the goal. In Language Understanding, entities are used to identify and categorize key data points in user utterances, such as names, places, or dates. While creating a new entity for the domain (e.g., city or country) could be part of the solution, it's not enough on its own.\n\nThe phrases provided are intended for training an intent, specifically the \"FindContact\" intent. Therefore, the solution should involve adding these phrases as example utterances under the \"FindContact\" intent in the Language Understanding service. This helps the model understand the kind of language users might use when they want to find a contact.\n\nAdditionally, an entity for locations (cities, countries) could be created and used in these utterances to help the model identify and extract the location information from user inputs.
