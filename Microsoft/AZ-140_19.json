Group Policies are indeed powerful for managing settings across multiple machines. However, for enabling screen capture protection specifically in Azure Virtual Desktop, the recommended approach is to use the Azure VM extension designed for this purpose.\n\nThe Azure VM extension directly supports the screen capture protection feature, ensuring that it is applied correctly and effectively across your session hosts. Group Policy settings, on the other hand, do not provide the specific functionality needed for this type of protection in Azure Virtual Desktop environments."},{"poster":"Karl_Anthony_Towns","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1299911","timestamp":"1729319040.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA for sure."},{"timestamp":"1705297260.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1123085","content":"B.
