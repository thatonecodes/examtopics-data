JIT access is a security protocol where permission to access applications or systems is only for a preset limited timeframe on an as-needed basis. This prevents the risks associated with standing privileges that hackers or fraudulent insiders can exploit1. JEA is a model that provides service team engineers with temporary privileged access to production environments when such access is required to support Microsoft online services.

What is SIEM, and how does it differ from SOAR? When should one solution be used over the other?\n\nWhile SOAR tools are primarily used to orchestrate and automate threat response, SIEM offers greater visibility into activity through threat detection, log management, incident analysis, and regulatory and standards compliance. This visibility is achieved by logging and consolidating multiple streams of data from across your network, providing a bird’s-eye view of your organization’s overall security landscape.\n\nThe two systems work best in tandem. SIEM collects and analyzes data, SOAR runs based on that data—forming a complete solution for risk detection, visibility, and response.
