The System Administrator has the authority to allow and remove access of other users and define the extent of their rights. For example, the System Administrator and the System Customizer are given access to custom entities by default while all other users need to be given access. This is the only role that cannot be edited.\n\nBox 4: System Customizer -\nEnd users must have minimum access to the required systems.\nSales users must only have access to their own records.\nThe System Customizer role is similar to the System Administrator role which enables non-system administrators to customize Dynamics 365. A Customizer is a user who customizes entities, attributes and relationships.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/environments-overview https://crmbook.powerobjects.com/system-administration/business-administration/security-roles/\nConfigure Common Data Service","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou need to assign the minimum environment security role to the appropriate users.\nWhich security roles should you use?
