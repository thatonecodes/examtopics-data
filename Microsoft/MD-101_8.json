Here is a passage near the top of that page: 'In this mode, you can use Windows Autopilot to join a device to an on-premises Active Directory domain. Configuring this feature is very similar to the Windows Autopilot user-driven mode process today:\n\nRegister the device with Windows Autopilot.\nCreate an Autopilot deployment profile specifying Hybrid Azure AD as the method in which you would like to join devices to Azure AD.\nInstall the Intune Connector for Active Directory on a computer running Windows Server 2016 (or later).\" \nThe passage you quoted is near the bottom of that page and is referring to steps in loading web-tenant devices into the AutoPilot process to then add to the on-premises AD domain. Since this test question comes from the on-premises AD domain insuring all systems get registered in the AAD and enrolled in Intune, the Service Connection Point autodiscover and Group Policy steps are the only path to achieve complete hybrid status.
