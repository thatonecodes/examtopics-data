A job includes settings common to the tasks, such as priority and the pool to run tasks on. The app uses the\nBatchClient.JobOperations.CreateJob method to create a job on your pool.\nNote:\nStep 1: Create a pool of compute nodes. When you create a pool, you specify the number of compute nodes for the pool, their size, and the operating system.\nWhen each task in your job runs, it's assigned to execute on one of the nodes in your pool.\nStep 2: Create a job. A job manages a collection of tasks. You associate each job to a specific pool where that job's tasks will run.\nStep 3: Add tasks to the job. Each task runs the application or script that you uploaded to process the data files it downloads from your Storage account. As each task completes, it can upload its output to Azure Storage.\nIncorrect Answers:\nC, F: To create a Batch pool in Python, the app uses the PoolAddParameter class to set the number of nodes, VM size, and a pool configuration.\nE: BatchClient.PoolOperations does not have a CreateJob method.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/quick-run-dotnet https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/quick-run-python","discussion":[{"content":"I believe D and E are correct. to create compute nodes, you need to have a pool. and D and e can create a pool","upvote_count":"19","timestamp":"1574873700.0","comment_id":"24855","poster":"jddjsjdsf"},{"poster":"James007","content":"B is \"incorrect\" - there is no BatchClient.PoolOperations.CreateJob.\nThe correct answer is E - BatchClient.PoolOperations.CreatePool.","timestamp":"1582769160.0","comment_id":"55787","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1591694040.0","comment_id":"105823","poster":"godsbane","content":"True.
