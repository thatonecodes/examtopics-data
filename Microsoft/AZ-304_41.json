The on-premise network is 172.16.0.0/16, that is from 172.16.0.1 to 172.16.255.255, so the answers 172.16.0.0/16 and 172.16.1.0/28 are not valid (overlap with on-pemise subnet)\n2) the range 192.168.1.0/28 is from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.15, only 16 ips and we need 25 IPs, so the only valid answer for subnet1 is 192.168.0.0/24\n3) the range for the gateway can't ovelap with on-premise, and Microsoft recommend that would be /27 or /28, so the answer valid for gateway is 192.168.1.0/28\n\nCheck the example: https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal","comment_id":"237591","timestamp":"1607367900.0","upvote_count":"120"},{"upvote_count":"15","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"thanks for explanation","poster":"rdemontis","timestamp":"1638540180.0","comment_id":"493172"}],"content":"Example calculation for 192.168.1.0/28 network.\n\nAn ip-address can be 32 bits max.
