A node image contains up-to-date OS security patches, OS kernel updates, Kubernetes security updates, updated versions of binaries like kubelet, and component version updates that are listed in the release notes.\n\nWhen a node image is updated, a cordon and drain action is triggered on the target node pool's nodes:\n\n A node with the updated image is added to the node pool. The number of nodes added at a time is governed by the surge value.\n One of the existing nodes is cordoned and drained. Cordoning ensures that the node doesn't schedule pods. Draining removes its pods and schedules them to other nodes.\n After the node is fully drained, it's removed from the node pool. The updated node added by the surge replaces it.\n This process is repeated for each node that needs to be updated in the node pool.\n\nA similar process occurs during a cluster upgrade.\n\nSource: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/operator-guides/aks/aks-upgrade-practices"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nLt9898","timestamp":"1724312460.0","comment_id":"1156280","poster":"PierreTang"},{"timestamp":"1723843440.0","comment_id":"1152286","content":"Selected Answer: A\nHang on, why is everybody favouring selecting the image before provision of the node?
