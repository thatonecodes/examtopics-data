Dynamic groups automatically include members based on specified attributes (like department) that are evaluated using rules. In this scenario, you would create dynamic user groups and define a membership rule based on the department attribute. This eliminates the need for manual assignment or scripting as users are automatically added to the appropriate group based on their department.\nF. The bulk import of users in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) is typically done using a CSV file. The CSV file allows you to specify user attributes, including the department.
