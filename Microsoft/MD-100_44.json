As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.\nYou have a computer that runs Windows 10. The computer contains a folder. The folder contains sensitive data.\nYou need to log which user reads the contents of the folder and modifies and deletes files in the folder.\nSolution: From the properties of the folder, you configure the Auditing settings and from the Audit Policy in the local Group Policy, you configure Audit privilege use.\nDoes this meet the goal?","answer":"B","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNo.\n\nThe proposed solution will only enable auditing of privileged actions such as changing system time or restoring files and folders. To meet the goal, you need to enable object access auditing on the folder containing sensitive data, and then configure the auditing settings to log the desired events (such as read, modify, and delete) for the appropriate user accounts or groups. Once auditing is enabled, the logs can be collected and analyzed to determine who has accessed or modified the files.","poster":"Buruguduystunstugudunstuy","comment_id":"850360","timestamp":"1679768940.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"746299","timestamp":"1671120300.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSet 'Audit Object Access' audit policy","poster":"Hatsapatsa"},{"timestamp":"1663591200.0","content":"This is correct","poster":"AUP123","comment_id":"673280","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1663591200,"question_id":216,"answer_description":""},{"id":"TFqsZ88jLBaLOoA1bpBD","choices":{"C":"In Azure AD, assign user1@contoso.com the Security administrator role.","A":"In Azure AD, assign user1@contoso.com the Cloud device administrator role.","D":"On Computer1, create a local user and add the new user to the Remote Desktop Users group.","B":"From the local Group Policy, modify the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services user right."},"timestamp":"2019-11-06 20:54:00","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/7761-exam-md-100-topic-4-question-1-discussion/","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1573070040,"question_id":217,"question_text":"You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that contains a user named user1@contoso.com.\nYou have a computer named Computer1 that runs Windows 10.\nYou join Computer1 to Azure AD.
