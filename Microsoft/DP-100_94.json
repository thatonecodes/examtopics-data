This technique allows you to search through a range of potential models and select the one that achieves the best fairness-accuracy trade-off.\n\nDemographic parity is a constraint used in Fairlearn that aims to ensure that the predicted outcomes are statistically independent of the protected attribute (in this case, ethnicity). This means that the proportion of positive outcomes (admission to the trial) should be the same across all ethnic groups.\n\nTherefore, by using the Grid search technique to find the optimal model that satisfies the Demographic parity constraint, you can mitigate and minimize disparities for each category in the Ethnicity feature.","comment_id":"820559","upvote_count":"2","poster":"phdykd"},{"content":"Appeared on exam 07/11/2022","timestamp":"1699368420.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"713117","poster":"fvil"},{"poster":"ning","comments":[{"content":"This question might be wrongly worded, Grid Search is only good for binary feature, ethnicity is categorical so, it cannot be really used ...","poster":"ning","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"616678","timestamp":"1686824700.0"}],"timestamp":"1686743280.0","comment_id":"616192","upvote_count":"1","content":"Grid search is good for sure ...\nHowever,\nDemographic parity: ensure that an equal number of positive predictions are made in each group\nFalse-positive rate parity: ensure that each group contains a comparable ratio of false-positive predictions\nSo, which one is better ???"},{"poster":"ranjsi01","content":"correct. \n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/detect-mitigate-unfairness-models-with-azure-machine-learning/4-mitigate-with-fairlearn","timestamp":"1674674460.0","comment_id":"532359","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04274/0045100001.jpg"],"timestamp":"2022-01-25 20:21:00","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"Box 1: Grid Search -\nFairlearn open-source package provides postprocessing and reduction unfairness mitigation algorithms: ExponentiatedGradient, GridSearch, and\nThresholdOptimizer.\nNote: The Fairlearn open-source package provides postprocessing and reduction unfairness mitigation algorithms types:\n✑ Reduction: These algorithms take a standard black-box machine learning estimator (e.g., a LightGBM model) and generate a set of retrained models using a sequence of re-weighted training datasets.\n✑ Post-processing: These algorithms take an existing classifier and the sensitive feature as input.\n\nBox 2: Demographic parity -\nThe Fairlearn open-source package supports the following types of parity constraints: Demographic parity, Equalized odds, Equal opportunity, and Bounded group loss.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-fairness-ml","exam_id":64,"answer_ET":"","answer":"","topic":"5","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/70564-exam-dp-100-topic-5-question-24-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04274/0045200001.jpg"],"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nA biomedical research company plans to enroll people in an experimental medical treatment trial.\nYou create and train a binary classification model to support selection and admission of patients to the trial.
