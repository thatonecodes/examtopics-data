The company has 33 offices and 12 warehouses across the US, Mexico, and Canada. As their customers’ needs grow in sophistication, Contoso wants to delight customers with breakthrough products, exceptional service, and on-time delivery of materials. They want to automate time consuming and manual processes that are prone to error. Contoso wants to consolidate and automate ordering and fulfillment processes.\n\n• The company has a fleet of 500 delivery trucks. The company has 150 drivers and uses third-party contractors to deliver goods.\n• The company has 400 warehouse workers and 30 finance clerks.\n• Contoso has 85 sales representatives and 50 customer service representatives. Sales representatives spend most of their time on the road visiting customers or prospects.\n• The IT department consists of four system administrators and six system analysts.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nOverview\n-\nContoso Pharmaceuticals has a custom enterprise resource management (ERP) system. It is difficult to integrate other applications and services with the system. Office staff manually key in purchase orders, customer orders, and invoices after they receive a scan or hard copy of an agreement.\n\n\nApplications\n-\n\n• The company uses a custom supplier management system named SMSApps that runs on each user’s workstation. The system is costly to run and maintain. SMSApp does not have an API.\n• Sales representatives manage customer requests by using Dynamics 365 Sales.\n• Contoso has Microsoft Power Platform development, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production environments.\n• Administrators create one Accounts Payable (AP) mailbox for each environment to support testing.\n• The use of a DLP policy and Desktop Flow development is specified as part of the automation requirements.\n\n\nSecurity\n-\nYou assign all users one or more Microsoft Dataverse security roles.\n\n\nBusiness Process\n-\n\n1. Sales representatives create quotes by using a Microsoft Word document template. The template allows representatives to include product, quantity, and cost estimation details that will be needed to fulfil an order. The representative converts quotes to a PDF file and emails the file to the customer for approval.\n2. The sales representative alerts the finance team about the new order and emails the finance team a copy of the quote for processing.\n3. The finance team prints the quote and manually creates a purchase order (PO) into SMSApp to request materials from a known and trusted vendor.\n4. The SMSApp distributes the PO to stakeholders. The system sends a copy to a shared finance team mailbox.\n5. Once a PO is fulfilled by a vendor, the system sends an email to the finance mailbox. The finance team releases an order to the warehouse.\n6. Materials are shipped from the vendor to one of Contoso’s warehouses. Warehouse workers enter key information from the waybill into SMSApp. The materials are unloaded and racked in the warehouse until they are shipped to customers.\n7. Upon checking for new daily orders in SMSApp, they see an open order is pending that is awaiting the newly received materials.\n8. The Warehouse worker loads an order onto a truck for delivery and marks the order as complete in SMSApp.\n9. Sales representatives provide fulfillment status and tracking information for orders.\n10.

They must be able to access the Purchase Order Quantity flow.\n\nFlow for processing invoice data\n\n• You must create a flow to monitor the AP mailbox. When an invoice arrives as an attachment in the inbox, the flow must automatically process the invoice data by using a form processing model. The flow must cross-check the received items against the packing slip.\n• You must use different Accounts Payable email addresses for development, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production environments.\n• You must use an environment variable to represent the Accounts Payable mailbox for the environment in use.\n• You must be able to use the environment variable across multiple cloud flows, a custom connector, and a canvas app.\n\n\nTechnical requirements\n-\n\n• Users must only be allowed to connect to and access systems that are required for the employee to perform required job tasks.\n• All automation flows must be either co-owned or shared between staff.\n• All employees must be able to access the new environment to build personal productivity automations.\n• You must distribute the workload for desktop flows to optimize productivity.\n• A DLP policy must be created and applied to the Development environment. Connectors required by the data entry automation flow must be added to the policy.\n\n\nOrder fulfillment flow\n-\nYou must automate the customer communication process by using an unattended desktop flow. The flow must check the fulfilment status of each active order in SMSApp. If an order is fulfilled, the flow must send the customer an email that includes tracking information for their order.\n\n\nMonitor flows\n-\n• All data extracted from Invoices should be stored in a custom Dataverse table.\n• You must assign users from the finance to the Finance business unit.
