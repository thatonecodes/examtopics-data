The Seattle branch office opened recently.\n\nContoso has an Azure subscription and uses Microsoft 365.\n\nExisting Infrastructure. Active Directory\n\nThe network contains an on-premises Active Directory domain named contoso.com and an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. One of the domain controllers runs as an Azure virtual machine and connects to a virtual network named VNET1. All internal name resolution is provided by DNS server that run on the domain controllers.\n\nThe on-premises Active Directory domain contains the organizational units (OUs) shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe on-premises Active Directory domain contains the users shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe Azure AD tenant contains the cloud-only users shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nExisting Infrastructure. Network Infrastructure\n\nAll the Azure virtual networks are peered. The on-premises network connects to the virtual networks.\n\nA virtual network named VNET4 was recently created are peered to the other virtual networks. VNET4 does NOT contain any AVD virtual machines.\n\nAll servers run Windows Server 2019. All laptops and desktop computers run Windows 10 Enterprise.\n\nSince users often work on confidential documents, all the users use their computer as a client for connecting to Remote Desktop Services (RDS).\n\nIn the West US Azure region, you have the storage accounts shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nExisting Infrastructure. Remote Desktop Infrastructure\n\nContoso has a Remote Desktop infrastructure shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes -\n\nContoso plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Implement FSLogix profile containers for the Paris offices.\n• Deploy an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool named Pool4.\n• Migrate the RDS deployment in the Seattle office to Azure Virtual Desktop in the West US Azure region.\n\nRequirements. Pool4 Configuration\n\nPool4 will have the following settings:\n\n• Host pool type: Pooled\n• Max session limit: 7\n• Load balancing algorithm: Depth-first\n• Images: Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session\n• Virtual machine size: Standard D2s v3\n• Name prefix: Pool4\n• Number of VMs: 5\n• Virtual network: VNET4\n\nRequirements. Technical Requirements\n\nContoso identifies the following technical requirements:\n\n• Before migrating the RDS deployment in the Seattle office, obtain the recommended deployment configuration based on the current RDS utilization.\n• For the Azure Virtual Desktop deployment in the Montreal office, disable audio output in the device redirection settings.\n• For the Azure Virtual Desktop deployment in the Seattle office, store the FSLogix profile containers in Azure Storage.\n• Enable Operator2 to modify the RDP Properties of the Azure Virtual Desktop deployment in the Montreal office.\n• From a server named Server1, convert the user profile disks to the FSLogix profile containers.\n• Ensure that the Pool1 virtual machines only run during business hours.\n• Use the principle of least privilege.\n\n\nYou need to configure the virtual machines that have the Pool1 prefix. The solution must meet the technical requirements.\n\nWhat should you use?","question_id":211,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","isMC":true},{"id":"x0R85nmu9YLCkJLHS1AV","answer":"C","exam_id":46,"timestamp":"2023-09-29 01:57:00","question_id":212,"discussion":[{"content":"C.
