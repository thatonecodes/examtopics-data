You need to enable it on each VM you want to protect. This action initiates the replication process and allows you to configure settings like the replica server, recovery points, and replication frequency.\n\nE. \n\nIn a workgroup environment, Kerberos authentication is not typically used. Certificate-based authentication is the recommended and more secure method for Hyper-V Replica in workgroups. You will need to configure both Host1 and Host2 to use certificate-based authentication. Additionally, you will need to ensure that TCP port 443 (or the port you configure for HTTPS) is open in the firewalls of both servers to allow replication traffic.\n\nF. \n\nHost2 will be the server receiving the replicated virtual machines. You must enable the Hyper-V Replica role on Host2 to designate it as the Replica server. This action configures Host2 to accept replication connections and store the replica VMs.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1360366"},{"comment_id":"1310761","content":"copilot says CDF","poster":"NicolaF","comments":[{"content":"copilot is wrong: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/manage/set-up-hyper-v-replica given answer is correct.
