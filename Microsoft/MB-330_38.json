Configure counter types - This configures the system to track fuel use in liters (e.g., a “Fuel Consumption” counter) and link it to a maintenance plan (e.g., service every 1,000 liters). It ensures timely maintenance scheduling based on usage, directly meeting the first requirement.\nE. Create attributes - This configures the system to account for the additional planning time due to the burners’ complexity. An attribute like “Estimated Service Time” (e.g., 4 hours) can be added to the asset and used in planning processes, meeting the second requirement.\nWhy not A and D. A. Register consumption: This is an operational step, not a configuration action. It happens after maintenance, not as a setup for fuel tracking or time planning.\nD.
