Predictive analytics uses historical data, machine learning, and statistical algorithms to predict future outcomes.\n\nb. what occurred in the past\nThis is the correct answer. Descriptive analytics analyzes historical data to provide insights and summarize what has already happened. It is often used to generate reports and dashboards that give a clear view of past events.\n\nc. which actions you can perform to affect outcomes\nThis describes prescriptive analytics. Prescriptive analytics suggests possible actions to influence future outcomes based on data analysis and often incorporates optimization techniques or simulations.\n\nd. why something occurred in the past\nThis describes diagnostic analytics. Diagnostic analytics digs deeper into the historical data to explain why something happened by identifying patterns and relationships in the data.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1730715720.0","poster":"man5484","comment_id":"1306882","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I love this answer, provides context on all and provides a clear description of which is the correct answer, and which is not.
