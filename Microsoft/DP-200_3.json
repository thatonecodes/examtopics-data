This allows the collection of objects/files within an account to be organized into a hierarchy of directories and nested subdirectories in the same way that the file system on your computer is organized. With the hierarchical namespace enabled, a storage account becomes capable of providing the scalability and cost-effectiveness of object storage, with file system semantics that are familiar to analytics engines and frameworks.\nBatch processing: HD Insight Spark\nAparch Spark is an open-source, parallel-processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analysis applications.\nHDInsight is a managed Hadoop service.
