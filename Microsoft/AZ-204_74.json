While this ensures no data is lost due to eviction, it also means that once the cache is full, new data can’t be added, reducing cache efficiency for both reads and writes.\n(Option D), which sets the Maxmemory policy to volatile-lru, is likely already the default policy in the Standard tier. It evicts less frequently accessed data with an expiration, optimizing memory usage. However, this doesn’t increase the total available memory for read operations, especially if the current policy is already set to an eviction-based policy like volatile-lru.\nSorry for not providing a doc link.","comment_id":"1301886"}],"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI'd choose A because:\nDecreasing maxmemory-reserved (option A) directly increases the amount of memory available for storing cached data by reducing the memory reserved for Redis internal operations. This effectively increases the available memory for both read and write operations.
