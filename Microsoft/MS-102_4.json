Security groups are specifically designed for managing access control and permissions in Microsoft 365. They can be used to manage access to various resources and assign roles to group members, providing a more streamlined and efficient way of managing permissions.\n\nIn this case, using a security-only group is the appropriate choice because it focuses on access management and role assignment, ensuring that the Endpoint Security Manager role is correctly assigned to the group members. Other types of groups, like Microsoft 365, mail-enabled security, or distribution groups, serve different purposes (such as collaboration or email communication) and are not designed for managing access control and role assignments in the same way as security groups are.","timestamp":"1694001360.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1000565","comments":[{"timestamp":"1699090980.0","comments":[{"content":"Ex-actly.","timestamp":"1699895820.0","comment_id":"1069559","poster":"NrdAlrt","upvote_count":"1"}],"upvote_count":"2","content":"Yes, you SHOULD use a security group.
