It will also speed up the sharing of data.\nDenver: DFS, because this location is in close proximity to LA and connected to the remote office via a link.\nMontreal: This is most likely an office with less than 100 users since it is a 'branch' office and close to New York and the HQ. Therefore, Distributed mode.\nLA: Direct access, because they don't have any servers at that location, it makes sense that DA would be used so that they are always connected to the domain.","answer_ET":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03655/0006200001.jpg"],"unix_timestamp":1603940460,"timestamp":"2020-10-29 04:01:00","isMC":false,"discussion":[{"content":"A key difference at this point is that DFS-R has all the data within a folder target available locally (which means you need to know what data is required ahead of time and ensure it's replicated) and can be accessed even when the branch is disconnected from the primary location. BranchCache only has the data that has been used by clients at the location (or data that has been pre-cached) but can only be accessed providing the primary server can be contacted, which means the branch can't be disconnected from the primary location. If you need data available even if the connection to the primary data center is unavailable, you need to use DFS-R. If you simply want to provide caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data, then BranchCache is a great solution.\n\nhttps://www.itprotoday.com/windows-78/dfs-r-vs-branchcache-branch-offices","upvote_count":"1","poster":"falcon4fun","comment_id":"208234","timestamp":"1603940460.0"}],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03655/0006200002.jpg"]},{"id":"voPK8OvQ1fUggai6pc9C","answer_description":"There are two major steps when you deploy this solution:\n✑ Create an Azure virtual network and establish a site-to-site VPN connection to your on-premises network.\n✑ Install Azure AD Connect on a domain-joined virtual machine in Azure\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/deploy-microsoft-365-directory-synchronization-dirsync-in-microsoft-azure?view=o365-worldwide","answer":"D","discussion":[{"poster":"NotBillGates","content":"Tech requirements state dirsync must be installed on virtual machine in Azure.
