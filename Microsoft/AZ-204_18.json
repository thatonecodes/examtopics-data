You set the value for Indexing Mode to\nConsistent.\nYou need to minimize latency and any impact to the availability of the solution. You must override the default consistency level at the query level to meet the required consistency guarantees for the scenarios.\nWhich consistency levels should you implement? To answer, drag the appropriate consistency levels to the correct requirements. Each consistency level may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

It is not Consistent prefix because there is no control at all on how old the version you are getting. So, it has to be Strong.\nArgument 2: Because default consistency is Strong the writes will be synchronous in all regions. And the fact that this is Strong consistency shows that this is not multi-region writes because Strong consistency is not supported in Multi-region writes. So, a bounded-staleness will work (but it could be consistent prefix as well or even be eventual because all the replicas are kept in sync while writing. That part I'm still confused).
