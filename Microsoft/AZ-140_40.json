These configurations are typically found in shared host pools.\n\nGeo-redundant storage -\nGeo-redundant storage (GRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region. GRS offers durability for storage resources of at least 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) over a given year.\nIncorrect:\n* Geo-zone-redundant storage is more expensive compared to GRS\nGeo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) combines the high availability provided by redundancy across availability zones with protection from regional outages provided by geo-replication. Data in a GZRS storage account is copied across three Azure availability zones in the primary region and is also replicated to a secondary geographic region for protection from regional disasters. Microsoft recommends using GZRS for applications requiring maximum consistency, durability, and availability, excellent performance, and resilience for disaster recovery.\nAzure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region:\n* Locally redundant storage (LRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. LRS is the least expensive replication option, but isn't recommended for applications requiring high availability or durability.\n* Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.*\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/disaster-recovery-concepts https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#geo-redundant-storage","answer_ET":"","question_id":197,"exam_id":46,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/81366-exam-az-140-topic-5-question-22-discussion/","answer":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou have an Azure subscription.\nYou plan to deploy an Azure Virtual Desktop solution to the East US Azure region.
