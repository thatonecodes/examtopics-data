On storage2, enable identity-based access for the file shares.\n\nTo grant Group4 Azure RBAC read-only permissions to all the Azure file shares, you should enable identity-based access for the file shares on storage2. Identity-based access enables you to manage access to file shares based on Azure AD identities, including users, groups, and service principals. By enabling identity-based access, you can grant access to specific users or groups and manage access control centrally from Azure AD.\n\nRecreating storage2 with Hierarchical namespace enabled (Option B) is not relevant to granting RBAC permissions to Azure file shares.\n\nChanging the account kind type to StorageV2 (general purpose v2) (Option C) is not relevant to granting RBAC permissions to Azure file shares.\n\nCreating a shared access signature (SAS) (Option D) provides temporary access to resources in storage accounts, but it does not allow you to grant RBAC permissions to Azure file shares.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. On storage2, enable identity-based access for the file shares.","comments":[{"comment_id":"833250","content":"ChatGpt answer, but i agree","poster":"mdwSysOps","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1694188920.0"}]},{"poster":"tashakori","content":"A is right","timestamp":"1726309200.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1173389"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I think it should be A.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-ad-ds-assign-permissions?tabs=azure-portal","timestamp":"1686802140.0","poster":"Shely","comment_id":"745762"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1683729180.0","poster":"Babushka","comment_id":"715386","content":"Selected Answer: A\nRBAC = Role Based Access Control and you will give Reader Role so you would need Azure AD for this, no?
