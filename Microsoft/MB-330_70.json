In Dynamics 365, the \"Number of tasks in a helper bundle\" (Option A) directly relates to grouping tasks for parallel execution by helper processes during master planning."},{"comment_id":"960882","timestamp":"1721772900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is number of helpers","poster":"Nors","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"524989","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1673877960.0","poster":"Karl127","content":"A and B are correct, but due to the following I would chose A:\n\nIf you have performance issues, we recommend that you reduce the Number of helpers in task bundle setting to 1. You can then start the trial-and-error process to find the best value for your setup. In general, performance issues occur when one item takes longer to process than the remaining items. In this case, you will see that two subsequent tasks that have a status of Coverage in the master planning run take significantly different amounts of time to run. In extreme cases, this difference might be as much as 30 minutes. You can infer the amount of time that tasks take to run by looking at the duration of each task."}],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":83,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1642341960,"question_text":"A retailer that uses Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management is conducting master planning runs with 300,000 items in a single planned order run on average.\nOptimizations are needed to improve performance.
