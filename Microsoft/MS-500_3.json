But the \"Exchange Admin\" role in AAD is really the Exchange Service A\ndmin in Exchange Online. The Exchange Service Admins are part of the Organization Management group and inherits all the permissions. So they are the same thing as giving the user Org Management permissions. So the answer is correct.\n\nThere are of course advantages of using AAD, e.g access review, PIM etc etc but as the question stands this is the correct answer."}],"comment_id":"421445","content":"I very much disagree that the answer is to grant the user the Organization Management EXO role. This EXO role does indeed grant the user wide-spread permissions throughout Exchange. However, this role also includes \"Security Admin\", \"Compliance Admin\" and \"Security Reader\".\n\nOur goal is to ensure Least Privilege. Obviously we wouldn't want to make our user a Global Admin. This breaks the goal of Least Privilege\".

Even if you assign the person the role of \"Exchange Administrator\", they will automatically be a member of the Organization Manager role group.
