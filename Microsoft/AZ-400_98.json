You can choose to extract the parameters from the encapsulated tasks as configuration variables, and abstract the rest of the task information.\n\nThe new task group is automatically added to the task catalog, ready to be added to other release and build pipelines. Task groups are stored at the project level, and are not accessible outside the project scope.\n\nTask groups are a way to standardize and centrally manage deployment steps for all your applications.
