Therefore, you can target an Intune app protection policy to either Intune enrolled or unenrolled iOS/iPadOS and Android devices. You can have one protection policy for unmanaged devices in which strict data loss prevention (DLP) controls are in place, and a separate protection policy for MDM managed devices, where the DLP controls may be a little more relaxed.
