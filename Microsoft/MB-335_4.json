The Plastic Molding group is responsible for manufacture of all plastic parts used in the assembly area.\n\nMotorcycle manufacturing -\nThe parts for the product assembly are picked from the warehouse and staged at the correct workstation by a warehouse operator for each production order.\n\nPlastic manufacturing -\nPlastic parts are molded using dyes that create multiple parts at once. The parts are machined in the same production process to remove excess plastic and add additional holes for assembly. Excess plastic is recycled back into the feedstock of the same color plastic chips for use in the molding process.\n\nMetal parts -\nRaw metal parts are purchased fully machined but without primer or paint. The parts are subcontracted to a vendor for primer and paint based upon the color requirements.\n\nFacility -\nThe company has a single warehouse that supports both the assembly and plastic manufacturing areas. The warehouse consists of three aisles with 15 bins and three shelves. The facility has no Wi-Fi capacity but has hardwired terminal stations throughout the assembly production line\nTransactions are currently completed by office staff. Raw materials transfer must support capacity constraints for paint and primer.\n\nRequirements -\n\nSales orders -\nThe company has the following requirements for sales order:\nDuring the configuration of a sales order, invalid combinations must be prevented.\nEach configuration must create a unique bill of material (BOM) and Route based on options selected.\nSales pricing for the sales order must be based upon options selected.\nDue to emissions regulations, the motorcycles cannot be sold to the state of California.\n\nMotorcycle manufacturing -\nThe company has the following requirements for motorcycle manufacturing:\nSchedule labor only at the labor pool level without machines by day.\nProduce motorcycles within a scheduled day in any order.\nRecord actual production labor with start/stop times.\nRecord manager approval of labor entered prior to posting.\nPost actual material consumption after production is finished.\n\nPlastic manufacturing -\nThe company has the following requirements for motorcycle manufacturing\nSchedule both labor and machines.\nAdjust schedules by using a Gantt chart.\nBackflush standard labor by operation.\nPost actual material consumption at the start of production.\nTrack and allocate costs to the excess plastic.\nReport multiple molded part numbers during the same production run.\nDetermine the correct mold to use on a production order.\nGenerate a batch number for each production order.\n\nMetal parts -\nThe company has the following requirements for metal parts manufacturing:\nSchedule shipments to the vendor for painting.\nReceive painted parts into inventory from the vendor.\nTrack vendor inventory levels.\n\nDefaults -\nYou must configure defaults for manufacturing execution production orders to meet the following requirements:\nEnsure accuracy for production order pick list posting.\nEnsure correct pick list creation.\n\nIssues -\nIn the current system, the company cannot calculate overhead rates and determine the breakdown of material, labor, machine, and overhead costs for production.\nThe company is manually calculating an 8% overhead on materials and posting a journal manually.\nYou need to configure scheduling for each production area.\nWhich scheduling options should you use?
