Since each session runs for 15 minutes, setting the timeout to 25 minutes keeps the session warm and reduces the initialization delay.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"jl420"}],"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"B":"Increase the number of nodes to 16.","A":"Configure the session timeout to be 25 minutes.","C":"Enable dynamically allocated executors.","D":"Enable an isolated compute."},"question_id":71,"timestamp":"2024-11-13 01:43:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/151181-exam-dp-100-topic-2-question-123-discussion/","question_images":[],"topic":"2","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1731458580,"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","isMC":true},{"id":"Rfq9EzEevQHrSGXHmZ7Y","question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
