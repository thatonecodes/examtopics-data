Create an agreement with the applicable invoice terms\nAgreements in Field Service define recurring work orders, pricing structures, and invoice terms. Since the customer has a contract for a year, an agreement is the best way to ensure consistent discounts apply to all work orders during that period.\n\nD. Create a price list with the appropriate products, services, and pricing discounts\nA price list ensures that the correct prices (with the 20% discount) are automatically applied to all parts and labor. The price list should be associated with the agreement or work orders for this customer.\n\nWhy not B? Entitlements in Field Service are used to define free or discounted service based on specific conditions (e.g., warranty work, support cases). Since the customer signed a contract for a discount, an entitlement is not the best fit for this scenario.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740087300.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"hideouscrocodile","timestamp":"1733072460.0","content":"Selected Answer: BD\ncorrect, BD","comment_id":"1320631"},{"content":"correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729658340.0","comment_id":"1301874","poster":"MrEz"}],"answers_community":["BD (50%)","AD (50%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":129},{"id":"phu7IgtUFgfwWmf0XX9y","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/156884-exam-mb-240-topic-1-question-252-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"Your company's product inventory specialists use the Field Service mobile app to manage inventory, purchasing, and returns.\n\nYou need to train the product inventory specialists on the processing actions available with return merchandise authorizations (RMA).\n\nWhich three processing actions are available?
