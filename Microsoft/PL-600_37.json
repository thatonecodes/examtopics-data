I wish we could add screenshots. I do this regularly for our Power Platform Solutions using ADO (Azure DevOps). The scenario is to ADD to source control aka the repo. There is NO import solution for this pipeline. Now, when you need to move from repo to another environment (TEST or PROD), you will need an import task in ADO.

So I go with:\n\nCreate an Azure DevOps Project: You need a project container where all the ALM process components, like source control, build pipelines, and release pipelines, will reside. It's the foundational step before setting up specific ALM processes.\n\nInstall the Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools: These tools are necessary for automating the build and deployment process of Power Platform solutions. They include tasks like exporting a solution from an environment, checking it into source control, and deploying solutions to target environments.\n\nCreate an Export pipeline: Before you can release a solution, you need to have it exported from the development environment. The export pipeline facilitates the automation of extracting the solution from the Power Platform environment so that it can be stored in source control.\n\nRun the pipeline\n\nSo: 6,5,3,2"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1315205","poster":"No_Doubt","timestamp":"1732100580.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"I don't agree with you, should be 6 then 5\nThe reason \"Install the Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools\" typically happens after creating the Azure DevOps project is that the build tools need to be configured within the context of a specific project in Azure DevOps."}],"content":"You this one is a little trigger without a little more details\n5.6.3.2\n\n1.

For me, dont be confused by the fact about naming. You can call your pipeline whatever you want and yes you can easily create a pipeline that Exports the solution.
