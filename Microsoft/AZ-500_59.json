This is best done by assigning the VM with a \"user assigned managed identity\". We can set up this\nmanaged identity to have the required permissions on the extension repository via RBAC roles. The managed\nidentity requests permissions via the Azure IMDS from the Azure AD and hence needs to know the right\nTenant ID to get the token from. I believe the Azure AD ID is the same as the Tenant ID.","poster":"wardy1983","timestamp":"1700228880.0","comment_id":"1073356"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"ErikPJordan","comment_id":"1014362","timestamp":"1695402960.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1014364","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1024706","poster":"_punky_","content":"ChatGPT is totally useless if u are using v3.5 and anyway I do not pay for v4 so IDK the answer anyway(even Copilot is weak).
