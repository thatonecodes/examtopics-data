After installation, the devices can be onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, which allows Intune to enforce antivirus configurations on these devices effectively.\n\nWhile configuration profiles are used to set specific policies, the Defender for Endpoint client must first be installed to enable these policies to function. This minimizes administrative effort as the installation process and onboarding streamline policy application across devices.\n\nThus, the correct answer is: C.
