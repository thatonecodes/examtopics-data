Increase the priority of Policy1.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Microsoft 365 Defender (formerly known as Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection), policies are evaluated in priority order, and the first policy that matches the conditions is applied. In this scenario, it seems that the \"Strict protection preset security policy\" (which is applied to the Executives group) is being evaluated before \"Policy1.\"\n\nTo ensure that Policy1 is applied to all members of the Executives group, you should increase the priority of Policy1. This way, it will be evaluated before the \"Strict protection preset security policy,\" and its settings will be applied.","timestamp":"1723792860.0","comment_id":"982294","upvote_count":"3","poster":"andrewkdc97"},{"poster":"RyanPAN","upvote_count":"3","content":"A. Increase the priority of Policy1.\nReason: The priority of policies determines how they are applied when conflicts occur. In this case, since the Strict protection preset security policy has already been applied to the Executives group, Policy1 has failed to apply. By increasing the priority of Policy1, you can ensure that Policy1 will be applied to all members of the Executives group when policy conflicts occur.","timestamp":"1719716880.0","comment_id":"938757"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"T0g9bChZW7AZeXdvvodI","question_id":285,"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/61487-exam-ms-203-topic-4-question-12-discussion/","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-09-04 06:46:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Yes","B":"No"},"exam_id":103,"unix_timestamp":1630730760,"question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
