Add a scope: Scopes are used to group actions together. This allows you to control the execution of a set of actions collectively and handle the success or failure of the entire group. By grouping actions within a scope, you can easily implement rollback logic if any action within the scope fails.\n\nB. Set Run After to Has failed: By setting the \"Run After\" condition to \"Has failed\" for specific actions, you can define actions that should run only if a preceding action fails. This is useful for implementing rollback logic, such as deleting items that were created if subsequent actions fail.\n\n\nC. Perform a changeset request action: Changesets are used in some contexts to batch requests, but this is not directly related to handling failure and rollback logic in a cloud flow with SharePoint actions.\n\nD.
