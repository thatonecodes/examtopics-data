Configure Azure AD Connect using a global administrator account that is not federated.\n\nTo enable the password writeback feature in Azure AD Connect, you must use a global administrator account that is sourced from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This is required to provide the necessary permissions to update passwords in Azure AD. If the account is federated, the federation service (for example, ADFS) would be responsible for authentication and Azure AD wouldn't be able to get the authentication token, resulting in the error observed. Hence, to resolve this issue, you should use a global administrator account that is not federated.","poster":"terawatt","comment_id":"958305","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"4","exam_id":59,"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Restart the Azure AD Connect service.","D":"Disable password writeback and then enable password writeback using the Azure AD Connect configuration.","A":"Configure Azure AD Connect using a global administrator account that is not federated.","B":"Configure Azure D Connect using a global administrator account with a password that is less than 256 characters."},"question_images":[],"question_id":36,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/115930-exam-az-720-topic-4-question-10-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1689933240,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-07-21 11:54:00","question_text":"A company uses Azure AD Connect.
