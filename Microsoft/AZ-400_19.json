For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.\n\nThe kubelet uses readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. A Pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready. One use of this signal is to control which Pods are used as backends for Services. When a Pod is not ready, it is removed from Service load balancers.","comment_id":"401593","timestamp":"1625725560.0","poster":"jperona","comments":[{"content":"best comment here","comment_id":"446303","timestamp":"1631851140.0","upvote_count":"7","poster":"d0bermannn"}],"upvote_count":"66"},{"comment_id":"1340199","poster":"Zeus666","timestamp":"1736836560.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"The readiness probe ensures that the container is ready to handle incoming requests, and the periodSeconds property indicates the frequency of the readiness check."},{"poster":"sondrex","timestamp":"1719468180.0","comment_id":"1237900","content":"1. livenessProbe: Ensures the container is running.
