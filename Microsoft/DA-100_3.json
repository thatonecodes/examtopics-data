This technique can be used to raise the grain of fact-type tables. There is a distinct trade-off, however, resulting in loss of detail.\nFor example, a source sales fact table stores one row per order line. Significant data reduction could be achieved by summarizing all sales metrics, grouping by date, customer, and product. Consider, then, that an even more significant data reduction could be achieved by grouping by date at the month level. It could achieve a possible 99% reduction in model size, but reporting at day level—or individual order level—is no longer possible. Deciding to summarize fact-type data always involves tradeoffs.
