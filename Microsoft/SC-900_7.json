These six elements are the foundational pillars of the Zero Trust model:\n- Identities may be users, services, or devices. When an identity attempts to access a resource, it must be verified with strong authentication, and follow least privilege access principles.\n- Data should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes. Security efforts are ultimately about protecting data, and ensuring it remains safe when it leaves devices, applications, infrastructure, and networks that the organization controls.\n- Networks should be segmented, including deeper in-network micro segmentation. Also, real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should be employed.","timestamp":"1682223060.0","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"timestamp":"1679666640.0","content":"Correct","poster":"zeos38","comment_id":"849348","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1677095040.0","comment_id":"818316","poster":"obaali1990","content":"Correct","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-01-03 11:04:00","unix_timestamp":1672740240,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sc-900/image180.png"],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/93645-exam-sc-900-topic-1-question-128-discussion/","answer":"","answer_ET":"","isMC":false,"question_id":32,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sc-900/image181.png"],"question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nMatch the pillars of Zero Trust to the appropriate requirements.\n\nTo answer, drag the appropriate pillar from the column on the left to its requirement on the right.

For example, protecting information at rest using encryption is a preventative action against attacks and breaches. Separation of duties is a preventative action to manage conflict of interest and guard against fraud.\n\nDetective actions actively monitor systems to identify irregular conditions or behaviors that represent risk, or that can be used to detect intrusions or breaches. Examples include system access auditing and privileged administrative actions.
