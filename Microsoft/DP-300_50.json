Enable the SQL Server Agent.\n\nExplanation:\nTo enable SQL Agent Job email notifications, you need to enable the SQL Server Agent. The SQL Server Agent is a component of the SQL Server Database Engine that can execute scheduled administrative tasks, such as executing SQL Agent jobs. SQL Agent jobs can be configured to send email notifications based on job status. To enable the SQL Server Agent, you can use SQL Server Management Studio or Transact-SQL commands. Once the SQL Server Agent is enabled, you can configure email notifications for SQL Agent jobs in the SQL Server Agent properties.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1693716900.0","comment_id":"827721","poster":"KIET2131"},{"poster":"Ciupaz","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1682331120.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn this page: \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/job-automation-managed-instance?view=azuresql\nthey use sp_configure option.","comment_id":"702907"},{"timestamp":"1677585240.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Bigdicktome","comment_id":"654955","content":"Are you sure this is the answer?
