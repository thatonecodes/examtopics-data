From IoT hub, create a new IoT Edge device.\nPrepare your device to access the Microsoft installation packages.\nInstall the repository configuration that matches your device operating system.\nUbuntu Server 18.04: curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/multiarch/prod.list > ./microsoft-prod.list\nIn your IoT Hub in the Azure portal, IoT Edge devices are created and managed separately from IOT devices that are not edge enabled.\n1. Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to your IoT hub.\n2. In the left pane, select IoT Edge from the menu.\n3. Select Add an IoT Edge device.\n4. Provide a descriptive device ID. Use the default settings to auto-generate authentication keys and connect the new device to your hub.\n5. Select Save.\nStep 2: Run the following commandsג€¦\nInstall the container runtime.\nAzure IoT Edge relies on an OCI-compatible container runtime. For production scenarios, we recommended that you use the Moby-based engine provided below.\nThe Moby engine is the only container engine officially supported with Azure IoT Edge. Docker CE/EE container images are compatible with the Moby runtime.\nInstall the Moby engine.\nsudo apt-get install moby-engine\nInstall the Moby command-line interface (CLI). The CLI is useful for development but optional for production deployments. sudo apt-get install moby-cli\nInstall the security daemon. The package is installed at /etc/iotedge/. sudo apt-get install iotedge\nStep 3: Add the connection string to the /etc/iotedge/config.yaml file,..\nTo manually provision a device, you need to provide it with a device connection string that you can create by registering a new device in your IoT hub.\nOpen the configuration file.\nsudo nano /etc/iotedge/config.yaml\nFind the provisioning configurations of the file and uncomment the Manual provisioning configuration section. Update the value of device_connection_string with the connection string from your IoT Edge device.\nSave and close the file.\nAfter entering the provisioning information in the configuration file, restart the daemon: sudo systemctl restart iotedge\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux","isMC":false,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"140151","content":"Shouldn't the answer be:\n1.
