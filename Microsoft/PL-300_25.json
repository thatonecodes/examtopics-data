Lets think about the difference here: \"ALLSelected\" takes consider of external filter (here we have a report-level filter as we are filtering products to check their sales percentage), while \"ALL\" ingnores all filters. \nI also tested out a toy dataset in Power BI. Say I have four products, each makes up 25% of total sales. If we use \"ALL\" DAX and choose product A&B in the filter, we will see A and B both make up 25% of total sales, but instead what we want is \"ALLSELECT\" DAX which gives us A and B both makes up 50% of total sales, this meets the question requirement of \"respect the report-level filter\".","poster":"VGG2001","upvote_count":"11","comment_id":"949323","timestamp":"1689110760.0"},{"timestamp":"1677659040.0","comment_id":"825638","upvote_count":"17","poster":"Heyzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","content":"\"The measure must respect the report-level filter when calculating the total\" so shouldn't it be ALLSELECTED?"}],"content":"The tricky thing here is that the report contains a report-level filter for Products and you need to calculate all sales (for all products) for the divisor.
