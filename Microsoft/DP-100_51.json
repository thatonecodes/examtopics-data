To reset the state of a Python SDK v2 notebook in an Azure Machine Learning Studio workspace, you can perform any of the following actions: B. Change the compute to switch to a different compute instance and reset the state of the notebook. C. Reset the compute to restart the compute instance running the notebook and reset its state. E.
