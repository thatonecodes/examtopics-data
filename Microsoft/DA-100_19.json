The balance is showing two asset accounts and one liability account. We can't make the direct sum of things that are the opposite.\nThe assets minus liabilities and net worth are always equal to zero, but the example does not show all the accounts.\n\nSome good question would be:\n1* which is the Balance Amount for the assets every month, quarter, etc.? In this case we should sum only the asset accounts (cash and inventories)\n2* which is the working capital? This are short term assets minus short term liabilities. But there are two problems. They are giving us long-term liabilities, not short-term ones.
