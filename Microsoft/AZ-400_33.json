It's even more important for critical applications and those who process sensitive or highly confidential information.\n\nApplication security concepts haven't been a focus for developers in the past. Apart from the education and training issues, their organizations have emphasized the fast development of features.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of DevOps practices, security testing is much easier to integrate. Rather than being a task done by security specialists, security testing should be part of the day-to-day delivery processes.\"\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/software-composition-analysis/2-inspect-validate-code-bases-for-compliance","upvote_count":"1","poster":"chingdm"},{"timestamp":"1669587540.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"728650","comments":[{"content":"We are not talking about what to enable FIRST, just what must be enabled.
