Create a button flow with full address and date trigger tokens.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this scenario, the management requires delivery staff to communicate the location and the exact time of each delivery to improve the delivery service. The best way to achieve this with Power Apps is to create a button flow that includes full address and date trigger tokens.\n\nOption A is not the best solution because it requires user input, which may not always be reliable or consistent.\n\nOption C is also not the best solution because a UI flow requires more complex configuration and can be more difficult to maintain than a button flow.\n\nOption D includes a timestamp trigger, but does not include a full address trigger, which is important for accurate delivery tracking.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best solution as it includes both a full address and a date trigger, which will allow the delivery staff to communicate the location and exact time of each delivery, which can then be tracked using the Microsoft Database system used by the postal service."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the correct answer","poster":"SashM","comment_id":"532477","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1643151840.0"},{"poster":"Clubsodas","comment_id":"527811","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1642616640.0","content":"I believe the correct answer is D as both are valid trigger tokens and contain the information looking to be captured.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/introduction-to-button-trigger-tokens#:~:text=Next%20steps-,What%20are%20button%20trigger%20tokens%3F,device%20at%20a%20given%20moment."}],"isMC":true,"question_images":[]},{"id":"LYL0su4fBsKXCOifm4qP","question_id":207,"answer_images":[],"question_text":"You create a new solution publisher and include a publisher prefix value.\nWhich two actions can you perform?
