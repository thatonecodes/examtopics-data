Use a formula to populate a table when the app starts.\n\nThis is because a collection is a type of data source that is local to the app and does not require a connection to a cloud service.

This way, the data will be available before user interaction and only to the app.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Using the Excel Online connector to retrieve the data would require an internet connection and a cloud service, which are not necessary for a small amount of tabular data that is only available to the app.\nB.
