A does not solve the issue! Even if an incident type contains appropriate service tasks, products, and services, it is still possible that created work orders based on agreements (\"they should have them documented from the Agreement\") are being generated without service tasks, products, or services! So with A it is possible that an incident type has tasks, services, products, but a related work order generated from agreement has not. C is about not creating work orders at all.\nIn contrast: B ensures that incident type and related work order from agreement are the same in terms of tasks, services, products. D is evidently an option which\nguarantees work orders with tasks, services, products.","comment_id":"101218"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA. Incident Type contains appropriate Service Tasks, Products, and Services.\nThis is a critical check because the Incident Type often serves as the template for Work Orders generated from an Agreement. If it’s missing the necessary details, the Work Orders will be incomplete.\n\nD. Agreement Booking Setup contains appropriate Service Tasks, Products, and Services.\nThis directly addresses the configuration of the Agreement’s booking process. If the setup lacks the required service tasks, products, or services, the generated Work Orders will inherit that deficiency.","poster":"LnP","timestamp":"1740099120.0","comment_id":"1359566","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1359567","content":"B is more about the initial Agreement creation process rather than the ongoing Work Order generation.

For example, normally the incident would require 1 hour of a service, but for the agreement, you negotiated with the customer 2 hours of a service. Rather than having to create a second incident type just for this agreement, you can set Copy Incident Items to Agreement to No, add the incident to the agreement, then manually add the specific service tasks, product, services, and so on. This way you can use the same incident type, which helps for reporting later on. Set this option to Yes and the incident items will be added to the agreement and you can accept these items or make slight variations from there.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/field-service/set-up-customer-agreements","poster":"shine","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"134185","timestamp":"1673640600.0"},{"content":"For me, personally, A, B and D make sense.","comment_id":"79898","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Qr4nk","timestamp":"1666793040.0"},{"comments":[{"content":"But based on Marimar's logic above (which I agree with), this is only happening for \"certain\" customers which means that it is solely an agreement issue.
