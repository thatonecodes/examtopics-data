Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\n\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\n\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear.

The IT group contains an enterprise analytics team and an information security team.\n\n\nExisting Environment -\n\n\nData Storage -\n\nFabrikam has three Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces named workspace1prod, workspace1test, and workspace1dev. Each workspace is connected to an Azure Data Lake Storage account and contains a lake database that is accessed by using the built-in serverless SQL pool. The data in the Data Lake Storage accounts is available in the lake databases for analysts from every business unit to query and analyze by using Power BI.\n\nThe company imports the following files into the Data Lake Storage accounts:\n\n• User experience data stored as JSON files\n• Finance data stored as CSV files\n• Sales data stored as CSV files\n\n\nReporting -\n\nFabrikam has a Power BI tenant that contains 30 workspaces in Pro license mode. The data in the workspaces is a mix of Import and DirectQueiy datasets. All reports are interactive.\n\nFabrikam has three frequently used workspaces as shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe Corporate Data Models workspace contains a dataset named Financial Model that is used by reports in the P&L workspace. Financial Model is maintained by the enterprise analytics team. The Corporate Data Models workspace and the User Experience workspace have corresponding development and test workspaces.\n\n\nUser Problems -\n\nAdministrators report an increase in the maintenance of Power BI tenant assets due to analysts in the Finance and Accounting business unit who create new Power BI datasets when the existing datasets already meet their needs.\n\nAnalysts in the Product business unit report the following issues:\n\n• Datasets are published to the User Experience workspace, while the data sources reference workspace1test.\n• The parsing of user experience data in Power Query is very slow.\n\nThe enterprise analytics team identifies two DAX measures in the Financial Model dataset that are consistently slow to execute. The team must identify all the reports that use the Financial Model dataset and notify the report owners of changes to the measures.\n\nMembers of the enterprise analytics team report that creating Power BI reports and adjusting tables and views in Azure Synapse is tedious because they must switch between the Power BI workspaces and the Azure Synapse workspaces.\n\nThe information security team identifies that the user experience data is being shared externally.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nPlanned Changes -\n\nFabrikam plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Power BI will be registered as a data source in Microsoft Purview.\n• The analysts in the Product business unit will create a more automated process for deploying Power BI reports and datasets to the User Experience workspace.\n\nThe enterprise analytics team plans to perform the following tasks:\n\n• Update the DAX calculations in the Financial Model dataset.\n• Create views in the Azure Synapse workspaces to speed up the parsing of user experience data.\n• Create and document the change management process for shared Power BI datasets.\n\n\nTechnical Requirements -\n\nFrom Microsoft Purview, analysts in all the business units must be able to see all the assets in the Power BI tenant and the Azure Synapse workspaces.

The solution must meet the following requirements:\n\n• Access to the tenant by external users must be approved by a manager and granted by the IT group.\n• The external users must be prevented from publishing or modifying content in the tenant.\n• Users must be prevented from sharing Power BI reports publicly to the internet.\n\nThe new process for deploying Power BI reports and datasets to the User Experience workspace must ensure that the datasets point to the lake database to which the relevant dataset is deployed.
