The system will always calculate the best price for a customer following these rules: \n- Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?\n- Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?\n- Is the order date (or the posting date for the invoice and credit memo) within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement?\n- Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, Business Central checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.\n\nTherefore, the customer is in the buying group for restaurants, which means he can buy overstocked olive oil for $18. And the fact that he buys it on the special day, he gets an additional 15 % discount = $15.30\n\nReference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements?tabs=current-experience","poster":"Niischo","comment_id":"606482"},{"poster":"PatMurph","comment_id":"587251","content":"\"...there is an overstock special at a 15 percent discount off the regular price.\"\nRegular price is 20$.\n\nSo the ocrrect answer is 20$ - 15% = 17$","timestamp":"1681739760.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"poster":"Citop","timestamp":"1681739760.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"587250","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is correct.
