You can't add a private endpoint to a VM....\nOn the other hand, we have a managed instance that also needs to be in a subnet, where it is also not possible to add a private endpoint.\nThe documentation below explains this very well, note that there is no private endpoint for VMs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/vnet-existing-add-subnet?view=azuresql","comments":[{"content":"nonsense - • Virtual Network Peering (B): This offers low latency since it uses the Azure backbone network, but it does not natively encrypt traffic.

The purpose of the read-only mode is to prevent any modification to the data in the Query Store. However, it still allows all the read operations, including the ability to retrieve and analyze the stored queries.\n\nThe Query Store is a feature introduced in SQL Server 2016, which captures a history of queries and their execution statistics.
