Linked virtual networks have full access and can resolve all DNS records published in the private zone. You can also enable autoregistration on a virtual network link. When you enable autoregistration on a virtual network link, the DNS records for the virtual machines in that virtual network are registered in the private zone. When autoregistration gets enabled, Azure DNS will update the zone record whenever a virtual machine gets created, changes its' IP address, or gets deleted.\n\nThe only way to change the IP address is to set it to static within the portal as changing it on the VM itself is a BIG no no.
