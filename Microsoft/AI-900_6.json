Speech-to-Text is used to interpret what is spoken and convert it into text, and B. Key Phrase Extraction can process the text to identify the main points, these two alone might not be sufficient for a complete AI solution that controls smart devices using verbal commands. it doesn’t necessarily understand the context or the specific actions that need to be taken based on those key phrases. For example, in a command like “Turn on the living room lights”, key phrase extraction might identify “turn on”, “living room”, and “lights” as key phrases, but it doesn’t inherently understand that “turn on” is an action that needs to be applied to the “living room lights”. That's my reason why language modeling is a better answer than key phrase extraction.","poster":"tsummey","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1227104","timestamp":"1717916220.0","poster":"Alex_W","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nSTT plus key phrase extraction perfectly fit the job."},{"poster":"sujitwarrier11","comment_id":"1219344","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nI believe the given answer is correct.

We all agree speech-to-text is correct. Key Phrase Detection is also correct. Here is why:\nKey phrase extraction is a technique that identifies the most important phrases in a given text. eg: \"Turn the light on\", or \"What is today's date?\" \n\nLanguage modeling is a technique that is used to predict the probability of a sequence of words in a given language. It is used to generate text that is similar to the input text. For example, given the text “The cat sat on the”, a language model would predict that the next word is “mat” with a higher probability than “car”.\n\nSince we are talking about a smart device, the answer will be key phrase detection.\n\nUpvote me it makes sense to you.","timestamp":"1706164680.0"},{"comment_id":"1053582","poster":"1StepGrow","timestamp":"1698223740.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Thank you for the valuable information on the blog.I am not an expert in blog writing, but I am reading your content slightly, increasing my confidence in how to give the information properly.

This could allow the AI to understand the users' intent and respond appropriately.\nKey phrase extraction could also work but is more complex because an additional layer would have to be added that understands user intent based on the combination of keywords extracted. But it would become complex and probably less efficient as well.
