Not at all related, this is from my own internal playing around to understand the scoring system::\nFunny how Tailw111nd is accepted with a banned word of \"Tailwind\".\nI assume this is because: Tailw + l + l + l + nd = 5 points?\n\nBut then I tried a combination of appended strings: Tailw1nd + (strings)\nTailw1ndadcb accepted (4+ characters had to be appended).\nI assume \"Tailwind + a + d + c + b\" = 5 points.\n\nSo is it 1 = L or 1 = i?\nAnd if it is 1 = L, how come Tailw1ndadcb didn't match similar to the previous?\nTailw + l + nd + a + d + c + b \n\nMicrosoft has it specified as:\nOriginal letter Substituted letter\n0 o\n1 l (This is an L, not an i)\n$ s\n@ a\n\nThere's no Microsoft examples for cases of 'special characters' being inserted mid-string in the banned character list. That's what sprung my suspicions. I'd love it if someone could link an article to support this.","poster":"Holii","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1717984980.0"}],"poster":"Goseu","upvote_count":"17","comment_id":"369578","content":"After normalization we have : \n✑ Pr0jectlitw@re - > projectlitware = 2 points\n✑ T@ilw1nd -> tailwind =1 point\n✑ C0nt0s0 -> contoso = 1 point\nYou need 5 points therefore everything is blocked.","timestamp":"1653837540.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer is C","timestamp":"1732857420.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1083123","poster":"poesklap"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"dule27","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
