Correct me if I'm wrong:\n\nTo provide the apps with access to the storage accounts, I recommend the following identity solution:\n• Identity type: System-assigned managed identity\n• To control access, use: Role-based access control (RBAC)\n\nThis solution will minimize administrative effort because:\n• System-assigned managed identities are automatically created and deleted by Azure when you create or delete the app service. You don’t need to register or manage them separately.\n• Role-based access control (RBAC) allows you to assign granular permissions to the managed identities based on the roles they need to access the storage accounts.
