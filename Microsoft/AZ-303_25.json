Rotating the keys helps to keep the storage accounts secure by invalidating old keys. To manually rotate the keys, the following process must be followed:\n\nAlter service connections to use the secondary key.\n\nRotate the primary key in the Azure portal or on the command line. For example, to rotate key1 for the az303fsdemosa storage account in PowerShell, execute the following commands:\n\nClick here to view code image\n\nNew-AzStorageAccountKey '\n -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName '\n -Name $storageAccountName '\n -KeyName key1\nAlter service connections to use the primary key again.\n\nRotate the secondary key using the same method as shown in step2.\n\nThe switch between primary and secondary in this process is why Microsoft recommends that only the primary or secondary keys are used by all services by default.
