Use Power Query to merge columns.\n\nPower Query is a data connection and data transformation tool that allows you to connect to various data sources, including Dynamics 365, and manipulate the data as needed. One of the capabilities of Power Query is the ability to merge columns, which can be used to combine the City and State columns into one column on the report.
