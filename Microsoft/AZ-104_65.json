Creating an Azure storage account and configuring shared access signatures (SASs) is not necessary for monitoring events on a virtual machine. Azure Monitor can directly collect events from the VM's System event log using the Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n \n2. The Microsoft Monitoring Agent can indeed collect logs and send them to Azure Monitor, but specifying a storage account as the source would not be the typical approach for monitoring System event logs. You would usually send the logs directly to a Log Analytics workspace.\n\n3. To monitor the System event log for specific events, you would set up a Log Analytics workspace, configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent to send logs to that workspace, and then set up an alert based on a query that examines those logs.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nB.
