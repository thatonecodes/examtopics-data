Disenroll the device from your provisioning service, to prevent future auto-provisioning. Depending on whether you want to revoke access temporarily or permanently, you may want to either disable or delete an enrollment entry.\n2. Deregister the device from your IoT Hub, to prevent future communications and data transfer. Again, you can temporarily disable or permanently delete the device's entry in the identity registry for the IoT Hub where it was provisioned.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/bs-latn-ba/azure/iot-dps/how-to-unprovision-devices","answer":"A","question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
