Static code analysis\n2. Static code analysis\n3. Penetration testing\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/devsecops-controls#static-application-security-testing\nBut a team must start somewhere when implementing static code scanning practices. One way is to introduce static code analysis inside of continuous integration. This method verifies security as soon as code changes happen. One example is SonarCloud. It wraps multiple static application security testing (SAST) tools for different languages. SonarCloud assesses and tracks technical debt with a focus on maintainability. It looks at code quality and style and has security-specific checkers. But there are many other commercial and open-source tools available in the market.","comment_id":"913143","timestamp":"1685756460.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"comments":[{"content":"I also blieve that the given answer is correct.","comment_id":"1212414","timestamp":"1715862960.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mattt"}],"timestamp":"1667945580.0","poster":"dmeld","comment_id":"714141","upvote_count":"3","content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/devsecops-controls\nThe given answer is correct.\nPull requests are standard in the development process. Part of the pull request process is peer reviews that often reveal undiscovered defects, bugs, or issues related to human mistakes. It's good practice to have a security champion or knowledgeable security teammate who can guide the developer during the peer review process before creating a pull request.\n\nSecure coding practice guidelines help developers learn essential secure coding principles and how they should be applied. There are secure coding practices available, such as OWASP secure coding practices to incorporate with general coding practices."},{"poster":"syu31svc","content":"Did a course on Cloud Guru\n\nAnswer is as follows\n\nPull request ---> static code analysis\nContinuous Integration ---> static code analysis\nContinuous delivery ---> Penetration testing","comment_id":"644388","timestamp":"1660028880.0","upvote_count":"6"},{"timestamp":"1658586600.0","poster":"Govcomm","content":"Thread modelling\nStatic code analysis\nPenetration testing","comment_id":"635633","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Given answers are correct.\nhttps://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/threat-modeling-sdlc/#:~:text=While%20threat%20modeling%20should%20take,modeling%20within%20the%20support%20cycle.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/security-code-analysis-overview","poster":"Inland","comment_id":"620633","timestamp":"1655931360.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Static\nStatic\nPen test","timestamp":"1652956260.0","poster":"Eltooth","comment_id":"603793"},{"poster":"Cheehp","timestamp":"1649929620.0","upvote_count":"6","content":"Selected during exam. \nStatic code analysis\nStatic code analysis\nPenetration testing","comment_id":"585666"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Static code\nThreat modeling\nPenetration","poster":"d0bermannn","comment_id":"450683","timestamp":"1632462660.0"},{"upvote_count":"13","content":"Threat modeling: - It is usually a manual process and done as part of PR review\nStatic code- During the build phase using tools like sonarqube\nPenetration:- once code is build and ready for deployment we check if the that it is free from web attacks","comment_id":"413212","timestamp":"1627134660.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1689595260.0","content":"Wrong.
