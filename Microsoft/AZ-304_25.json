The lock overrides any permissions the user might have.\nNote: You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly. In the portal, the locks are called Delete and Read-only respectively.\n✑ CanNotDelete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.\n✑ ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource.
