The company has a development department that will help with the ERP implementation.\n\nMost employees work remotely from different countries or regions and speak different languages. The various locations and languages cause issues with the current on-premises software.\n\n\nPlanned improvements\n-\nFabrikam Inc. plans to implement new and modern software to manage the company. The company wants to use Business Central because it is cloud-based and meets all company requirements.\n\nThe company intends to improve reporting and integration functionality by using modern tools such as Power BI and APIs. To reduce the amount of information sent by email, the company plans to expose vendor information to be consumed from external users.\n\n\nTechnical specifications\n-\nThe development department installed Visual Studio Code to create Business Central extensions so the ERP system could be customized according to company needs. All extensions must be developed for the Business Central 2024 wave 1 online version.\n\nThe development department plans to use telemetry to control the appropriate use of each new development and works directly in licensed sandbox environments supplied by Microsoft.\n\nDepartment-specific requirements\n\nThe following departments at Fabrikam Inc. have multiple requirements:\n• Development\n• Control\n• Accounting\n• Quality\n\n\nDevelopment department\n-\nThe development department designed an extension for the purchase department. Because the developers plan to work with telemetry for monitoring operations, they need the Application Insights information. To accomplish this, the department must add a setting in the corresponding file.\n\nThe quality department does not want to receive any warning about the Application Insights setting when the extension is compiled.\n\n\nControl department\n-\n\nThe control department requires customizations to Business Central by using a per-tenant extension (PTE) named Subcontract Docs. The PTE includes a table named Subcontract Documents. The table has the following fields:\n\n\nID: A unique identifier\n-\nSubcontract No.: Related to the standard Vendors table\nDescription: A short description of a received document\nDocument: A media type that has the document\nComments: Comments about the document\nDate: When the document was imported\nAmount: Amount related with the imported document\nPosted: Indicates if the document is managed\n\nThe extension must be in English - United States (ENU) and Spanish Traditional Sort (ESP) so the application can be used in both languages. The translations must be on the table, not on the page, to avoid repeating them. The control department does not want to use translation files.\n\nThe control department manager requires a brief guide for the Description and Comments fields when employees create a new record so users know what to include in the fields. The guide must disappear as soon as users add a value in the fields.\n\nThe Subcontract Documents table must be displayed on a new page named Subcontract Document List through an action from the standard Vendor page.\n\nThe Amount field, included in the Subcontract Document List, must be formatted in bold format when the record is posted (field Posted = true).\n\nThe control department also requires a report to display a list of subcontract documents named Subcontract Documents Excel List. The report must meet the following requirements:\n• Downloads a file only in Microsoft Excel.\n• Includes a predefined format with two worksheets: one with the posted subcontract documents and another with the unposted subcontract documents.\n\n\nAccounting department\n-\nThe accounting department plans to use Power BI to analyze information generated by the control department. The accounting department plans to expose an API named API Customer Lines. To improve the performance, the API must use read-only information and work with a Query object to summarize the data.\n\nYou have the following code:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe accounting department must expose data such as the following:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe qty column must be the sum of the Outstanding quantity field of Sales Order Lines. It must be in descending order by quantity.\n\nThe department also exposes a page named Fabrikam Vendor API that includes vendor information from the Vendor table, such as number and name. The API must use the replica database to improve performance.\n\nBecause Fabrikam Inc. is based in multiple countries and regions, the company periodically must send accounting movements between two dates to the local tax offices named Fabrikam Accounting.\n\nThe format for this file must be an XML file generated by an XMLport object. For security reasons, it is not possible to receive data from this XMLport.\n\nThe generated XML file must have a schema like this:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nQuality department\n-\nThe quality department requires that every new app or extension is designed to meet standard company guidelines. The quality department plans to follow the standard Business Central data model. The quality development must be able to use triggers correctly.\n\nThe department must ensure that when a vendor is deleted, the system also removes each record in the Subcontract Documents table related to the vendor. If the subcontract document record has the field Posted = false, it must not be possible to delete the record.\n\nThe department has a version 1.0.0.1 installed for an extension named Quality Control. The department develops a new version 1.0.0.2 and uses a codeunit with the subtype Upgrade to update it. The department requires the values for AppVersion and DataVersion on the trigger OnUpgradePerCompany after using NavApp.GetCurrentModuleInfo(myinfo).\n\n\nYou need to develop the report Subcontract Documents Excel List that is required by the control department.\n\nYou have the following code:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nFor each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-820/image177.png"],"question_id":64,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/154939-exam-mb-820-topic-1-question-79-discussion/","answer":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2025-01-20 05:22:00"},{"id":"YcGiEjUH8vH2tdOEANbL","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"poster":"leoizgon","comment_id":"1365983","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-json-files#appjson-file","timestamp":"1741287000.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Sourabh9045","timestamp":"1729065600.0","comment_id":"1298607","content":"allow debugging property is specifies in the app.json file.
