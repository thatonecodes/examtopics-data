BPM is recommended if you want to enable the management and distribution of test libraries across projects and tenants. These capabilities are especially useful for Microsoft partners and independent software vendors (ISVs). BPM enables the distribution of test libraries as part of LCS solutions.\n\nIf you aren't using BPM, you can manually create test cases in Azure DevOps and attach developer recording files to your Azure DevOps test cases. You can create developer recording files directly from the Task recorder pane.","timestamp":"1727846280.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nRSAT is perfect for analysing results and ensuring that development doesn't negatively impact existing functionality. It has reports on automated tests for reviewing results. Trace parser is used for diagnostics and performance analysis but it doesn't generate tests nor does it review tests.

Regression suite automation tool (RSAT).\n\nRSAT is a tool that allows you to record business tasks using Task Recorder and then convert them into a suite of automated tests, without having to write source code. RSAT is fully integrated with Azure DevOps for test execution, reporting, and investigation. You can use RSAT to analyze test results generated by the development team and compare them with the expected outcomes.\n\nTrace parser is a tool that helps you analyze performance issues and identify the root causes of slow-running code. Task Recorder is a tool that helps you create documentation and training materials by recording business processes. SysTest is a framework that helps you author unit and component test code in Visual Studio. These tools are not designed for analyzing test results generated by the development team.\n\"","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1056671","poster":"Zeljo","timestamp":"1698567600.0"},{"poster":"Wonderama","content":"D - SysTest.
