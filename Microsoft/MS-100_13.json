After you invite a user through any of these methods, the invited user's account is added to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), with a user type of Guest. The guest user must then redeem their invitation to access resources. An invitation of a user does not expire.\nThe invitation will include a link to create a Microsoft account. The user can then authenticate using their Microsoft account. In this question, the vendors already have Microsoft accounts so they can authenticate using them.\nIn this solution, we are creating guest account invitations by using the New-AzureADMSInvitation cmdlet and specifying the ג€\"InvitedUserEmailAddress parameter.\nNote:\nThere are several versions of this question in the exam. The question has two possible correct answers:\n1. From the Azure portal, create guest accounts.\n2. From Azure Cloud Shell, run the New-AzureADMSInvitation cmdlet and specify the ג€\"InvitedUserEmailAddress parameter.\nOther incorrect answer options you may see on the exam include the following:\n1. From the Azure portal, modify the authentication methods.\n2. From the Azure portal, add an identity provider.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/b2b/add-users-administrator https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/new-azureadmsinvitation?view=azureadps-2.0","isMC":true,"question_id":61,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"14","unix_timestamp":1601402400,"answer":"D"},{"id":"bLnxzStvhd0ypDquhvA2","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04294/0043200001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04294/0043300001.jpg"],"answer_ET":"","exam_id":98,"answer":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou create the Microsoft 365 tenant.\nYou implement Azure AD Connect as shown in the following exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nUse the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nHot Area:\n//IMG//","unix_timestamp":1633020060,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1707123720.0","poster":"Amir1909","content":"- both on-permiss and cloud-based \n- on-permiss only","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1140833"},{"content":"what is the correct answer ? it should be using PHS right ?","comment_id":"530288","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Davidchercm","timestamp":"1642917900.0"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"jkklim","content":"why cannot ?","timestamp":"1640439060.0","comment_id":"509131"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Startkabels","comment_id":"729632","timestamp":"1669671120.0","comments":[{"poster":"Paolo2022","timestamp":"1670007960.0","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"JCkD4Ni3L","content":"I agree, here is an interesting article about it. \nhttps://www.semperis.com/blog/understanding-azure-ad-password-hash-sync/#:~:text=Microsoft%20needed%20to%20provide%20an%20easy%20way%20to,synchronize%20with%20Azure%20AD%20use%20password%20hash%20sync.","timestamp":"1682190240.0","comment_id":"877565"}],"content":"As far as I understand it, Password Hash Sync does work as a high availability approach for on-prem authentication.
