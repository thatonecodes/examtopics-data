High code coupling can make it difficult to change or modify the system, as any changes to one part of the system may require changes to other parts of the system.\n\nDependency cycles are situations where two or more parts of a software system depend on each other. Dependency cycles can make it difficult to understand the system and can lead to problems when changes are made.\n\nBy reducing code coupling and dependency cycles, you can make the software system easier to understand and change.

Technical debt can occur when developers take shortcuts, such as copying and pasting code or creating dependencies between different parts of the codebase. This can lead to an accumulation of technical debt over time, which makes it harder to add new features or make changes to the existing codebase.\n\nReducing code coupling and dependency cycles can help break down these dependencies and make the codebase more modular and easier to work with. By reducing code coupling, you can make it easier to modify specific parts of the codebase without affecting other parts. Similarly, by reducing dependency cycles, you can break down complex relationships between different parts of the codebase and make it easier to understand and modify the code."},{"timestamp":"1693089600.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nReducing code coupling and dependency cycles will definitely reduces technical debt.\nA easy to read & loosely coupled code will always reduce technical debt","poster":"mohiniu","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"823085"},{"comment_id":"722958","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\ntestestestes","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1684605420.0"},{"timestamp":"1678806180.0","content":"always taught loose coupling and highly cohesive functions are best way for for coding so i would answer yes.","comment_id":"669032","poster":"Atos","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"syu31svc","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1675593600.0","comment_id":"642849","content":"Selected Answer: A\nReduce code complexity and decreasing code coupling and dependency cycles help to do just that\n\nAnswer is Yes"},{"comment_id":"635641","upvote_count":"1","content":"Reduce the code coupling and dependendies","poster":"Govcomm","timestamp":"1674491760.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Dileep75","timestamp":"1673939580.0","content":"we can not say that it meet the goal.

Automatically watch repositories\nWhen you're automatically watching a repository, you get notified of all activity. Clearing this option would stop these notifications and ensure you only receive notifications for discussions you're participating in or mentioned.\n\nOption B, Participating, shouldn't be cleared, because this is the setting that ensures you get notifications for discussions you're participating in or when you are mentioned. Similarly, D, Watching, should not be cleared because it pertains to your chosen subscriptions, not automatic ones.","comment_id":"903840"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"RonZhong","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB is correct: \n\nIf you don't want notifications to be sent to your email, deselect email for participating and watching notifications.","comment_id":"872680","timestamp":"1681734180.0"},{"content":"got this in 02 March 2023 exams. scored 870 marks.","timestamp":"1677759060.0","comment_id":"826827","poster":"AlexeyG","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"lugia4000","comments":[{"comment_id":"809393","timestamp":"1676458680.0","poster":"lugia4000","content":"Typo sorry, A and C","upvote_count":"4"}],"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1676458680.0","comment_id":"809392","content":"By the way this came out today, picked B and D and had 930"},{"timestamp":"1675938480.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"803082","poster":"smariussorin","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nYou receive a notification when an entry is made to any team discussion. - Automatically watch teams (A)\n\nYou need to ensure that you receive email notifications only for discussions in which you commented or in which you are mentioned. - Participating (B)\n\nSeams that the question have changed order."},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nA C should be the correct answer, participating notification is desired.\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/about-notifications","comment_id":"787307","upvote_count":"4","poster":"SayCloud","timestamp":"1674626940.0"},{"comment_id":"772579","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D in my opinion.\n\nThe question is about not receiving notifications for discussions, not repositories. By removing \"Automatically watch teams\" you opt-out of team @mentions. But, if the option was enabled until now, you will still receive notifications from past discussions, so you need to clear \"Watching\" as well. Option B \"Participating\" means that you either responded or are mentioned by someone in the particular discussion. The question clearly states that we still want to receive those notifications.","poster":"Frefren","timestamp":"1673444280.0"},{"poster":"ttl","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1672699620.0","comment_id":"764095","content":"i will select AC"},{"comments":[{"poster":"Frefren","timestamp":"1675089000.0","comment_id":"792921","upvote_count":"1","content":"Read carefully, \"You receive a notification when an entry is made to any team discussion.\" is not what we want, it's a statement of the current situation.
