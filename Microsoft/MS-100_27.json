Download it from the official website (https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions. Node.js is required as a prerequisite for the CLI for Microsoft 365.\n\nRun npm install -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365: After installing Node.js, this command installs the CLI for Microsoft 365, which is a cross-platform command-line interface that allows you to manage settings and perform administrative tasks within your Microsoft 365 tenant.\n\nRun m365 spo storageentity list: After the installation is complete, you can connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant and list the SharePoint Online tenant properties. First, connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant using the m365 login command. Once authenticated, this command will display the properties of the SharePoint Online tenant in your Microsoft 365 tenant.","timestamp":"1679149260.0","poster":"Meebler","comment_id":"842822","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"In exam on 4th Feb 2023.","poster":"sufisuffix","comment_id":"798890","timestamp":"1675607100.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/getting-started-office365-cli-powershell/\nhttps://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/installing-cli/\n\nYou don't use the SPO module to input CLI for M365 commands based on these sources.
