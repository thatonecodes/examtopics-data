Returns Management\n\n• RMA's\n◦ Tied to Customer Service\n◦ Track open Returns to reduce part/asset leakage & charge for not returned items\n◦ The biggest issue we face today is that we can't track an item that a customer has returned\n\n• RTV\n◦ Ability to send in-warranty parts back to vendor for credit or exchange\n\n\nDesired Functionality. IoT\n-\n\n• IoT devices will be place on all new and existing equipment.\n• Devices will measure compressor temperature and motor pressure of the equipment.\n• Azure Machine Learning is desired to predict failure based on trends of compressor temperature and pressure readings.\n• Currently, there is no way to capture backflow pressure because it can only be measured during the onsite inspection by a technician.\n• Contoso Compressor would like to capture that value and feed it back to the machine-learning algorithm to better measure performance and predict failure.\n\n\nYou are the lead consultant on a Dynamics 365 Field Service implementation for Contoso Compressor.\n\nOne of your assignments is to set up the system for a technician to create inspections on assets, while working on another job at a customer site.\n\nWhich five actions should you perform in sequence to manage this process? To answer, move the five appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area. Arrange the five actions in the correct order.\n\n//IMG//","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-240/image169.png"],"answer":"","timestamp":"2024-10-25 16:44:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/150246-exam-mb-240-topic-1-question-274-discussion/","exam_id":78,"discussion":[{"content":"Rather than adding an inspection directly to an incident type, you'll create an incident type service task record.
