The company completes over 2,000 flights a day with flights operating exclusively in North America. Blue Yonder Airlines is in the planning phase for replacing its current enterprise resource planning (ERP) with Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain Management, and Commerce and is making solution architecture decisions prior to engaging the remainder of the implementation team.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nTechnology\n-\n\n• Blue Yonder Airlines operates on a custom-built ERP solution.\n• Blue Yonder Airlines uses a proprietary reporting and analytics platform that reports on data between multiple systems, including the ERP solution.\n• The ERP solution automatically pushes transactional data every five minutes to a separate database that the reporting and analytics platform uses for sales and operations planning (S&OP) activities.\n• SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports are used for several financial reports that are sent to vendors in the existing ERP solution.\n• Users utilize a third-party tool that selects alternate layouts of the reports depending on the users' requirements.\n• Blue Yonder Airlines currently uses Microsoft 365 and Office 365.\n\n\nImplementation\n-\n\n• The implementation of new solutions and features follows an Agile implementation strategy.\n• Blue Yonder Airlines has several highly skilled project managers.\n• Blue Yonder Airlines has a live Microsoft Dataverse instance that runs several model driven Microsoft Power Apps apps. Several initiatives using Microsoft Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents are in the middle of implementations.\n\n\nDevelopment\n-\n\n• There are five different functional groups, called pods, which fully own their development cycles for different functionality in their ERP.\n• All code is deployed and managed by using Microsoft Visual Studio projects.\n• All development environments are currently hosted by a third-party company. The current costs are very expensive.\n• Blue Yonder Airlines plans to use the new ERP implementation to address performance and integration issues.\n\n\nLicensing\n-\n\n• Blue Yonder Airlines does not require licensing on its ERP solution because the system is custom.\n• Most users have more access within the ERP solution than required.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nTechnology\n-\n\n• The previous custom ERP data will be replaced with Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps in the current reporting and analytics platform.\n• Only native Dynamics 365 capabilities should be used.\n• The level of effort required from IT staff must remain the same.\n• Standard SSRS reports will be used.\n• The current third-party financial reporting tool does not integrate with Dynamics 365.\n• Blue Yonder Airlines has a highly experienced in-house team of implementation experts.
