They provide online and on-site training across Europe, North America, and Japan. They have won several awards throughout their 20-year span in the training industry.\n\nContoso offers trainings in various topics and areas, such as Business Analyst, Digital Marketing, Oracle Apps, Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365 Stack, Foreign Languages, Cisco, et cetera.\n\nContoso has its main offices in North America, Europe and Japan. Their global headquarters are based in Redmond, Washington. Each regional office has its own sales and marketing teams, and perform focused Marketing Campaigns based on the operating region, in order to meet the local market demands. They use in-house developed applications to manage their marketing and sales efforts.\n\nUntil 2019, Contoso’s business was 70% on-site and 30% online, and their marketing efforts were in line with this model. Almost 35% of their total business revenue comes from three countries/regions in Europe: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. As part of their 2021 business plan, Contoso changed their business strategy and moved the majority of their courses online. The goal is to have all courses fully online by the end of 2021. As part of this new business strategy, Contoso started using Dynamics 365 Marketing and Dynamics 365 Sales, and wants to move away from their existing in-house applications.\n\nOffice hours are from 9:00AM to 5:00PM every day of the week, except for holidays which have no work hours. These office hours apply to all offices, using their local time zones. Contoso also has a 24/7 support team Operating out of Redmond, USA, which handles all customer-related queries from all regions.\n\n\nExisting Environment -\n\nContoso’s existing environment consists of the following applications:\n\n• Dynamics 365 Marketing\n• Dynamics 365 Sales - 120 Users\n• Custom Built Customer Service Portal\n• A Call Center application for the 24/7 Support Team\n• Custom build CRM Application for Lead and Sales Management\n• Office 365\n• SharePoint integrated with D365 Sales\n• Dynamics 365 App for Outlook\n• Microsoft Teams\n\n\nThe Marketing Team -\n\nContoso, Ltd. has a Marketing team of 30 members throughout the organization.\n\n• 1 - Chief Marketing Officer (Entire Organization)\n• 1 - Vice President of Marketing (Entire Organization)\n• 3 - Marketing Heads, one for each region (North America, Europe, and Japan)\n• 6 - Marketing Managers, two for each region (North America, Europe, and Japan)\n• 18 - Marketing Professionals (a team of three, reporting to each Marketing Manager)\n• 1 - Dynamics 365 Marketing Functional Consultant\n\nThe Marketing Team handles the following activities:\n\n• Customer Journeys\n• Customer Segmentation\n• Creating Email Templates\n• Creating Marketing Pages, Forms etc.\n• Event Management: Live Events and Webinars\n• Region-specific Marketing content generation\n• Customer Survey Management\n• Social Media Management\n\nYou are a Dynamics 365 Marketing functional consultant at Contoso, Ltd. Your responsibilities include:\n\n• Managing customer journeys and fixing any issues.\n• Reviewing all marketing survey responses to measure customer satisfaction in real-time.\n• Capturing and analyzing customer and employee feedback.\n• Providing Contoso with all the required solutions and trainings with regards to using the Dynamics 365 Marketing application.\n• Building reports and dashboards, and presenting them to the Marketing department leadership using either the standard reports and dashboards, or using Power BI.\n• Helping the marketing team in the localization of their customer journeys and surveys based on the region they are working in.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nLocalization is the key -\n\nContoso understands that localization is the key in some of the European markets such as Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.\n\nContoso wants to ensure that:\n• the customer journeys and surveys are executed in the local languages of the above-mentioned countries/regions.\n• the Marketing Heads and Marketing Managers are restricted to the information within their operating regions.\n• for some of the courses and events, special focus is placed on the above three countries/regions. The marketing team should create content and email templates, and design customer journeys accordingly.\n• reports and dashboards are built to give an overview of the region-specific marketing activities.\n• there is also a global dashboard available to Management.\n\nCampaign localization is also required for Japan.\n\n\nOther Critical Requirements -\n\nContoso organizes a lot of pre-scheduled demo sessions, limited time offers on specific courses, et cetera. They want to make sure that outdated information is not delivered to their customers.\n\nAdditionally, Contoso wants to:\n\n• identify the days and times when each contact is most likely to be actively reading their email, and deliver their messages accordingly.\n• create customer journey templates which are region- and language-specific.\n• create effective inbound customer journeys so that the customers are included in the right channel based on their interactions.\n• create different activity templates that can be triggered based on the customer interaction and the region they belong to.\n• have the ability include specific surveys as part of the customer journey.\n• have the ability to create multi-lingual surveys where the customer can choose their preferred language.\n• leverage some of the standard Power BI-based reports and dashboards to measure their marketing effectiveness and understand various performance metrics.\n• enable the sales team to send out surveys with minimum effort and access surveys from their Sales app.\n\n\nChallenges -\n\nThese are some of the challenges Contoso is facing today. Contoso wants to address these as soon as possible.\n\n• Time zone difference between different regions is causing major issues for their global campaigns resulting in minimal response rates.\n• Localization efforts in the past have not yielded the desired results to Contoso, due the limitations in their execution.\n• Reports based on performance metrics of their campaigns always required manual inputs and a lot of Excel work.\n• Outbound and inbound customer journeys always required monitoring by a group of marketing team members. The team members needed to segregate the interactions based on the channels and then manually include them into the correct segments.\n• User adaptation, especially in the Sale team, is very low. Contoso wants to improve this by providing ease of navigation and avoid moving between different applications to access information.\n\n\nYou need to create a customer journey for the promotion of the upcoming webinar on Azure Services.\n\nYou are looking through the gallery of existing customer journey templates to select the appropriate template.\n\nWhich four pieces of information will help you decide on the right template? Each answer presents a part of the solution.","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"exam_id":76,"answer_ET":"ABCE","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1189009","poster":"MrEz","upvote_count":"1","content":"agree: ABCE\n• identify the days and times when each contact is most likely to be actively reading their email, and deliver their messages accordingly. --> target = contacts, ruling out Targets\ni did not find any trace in the case study that would include Recurrence, ruling out Recurrence","timestamp":"1728004560.0"}],"answer":"ABCE","question_id":145,"unix_timestamp":1712193360,"choices":{"F":"Owner","C":"Name","G":"Target","D":"Recurrence","E":"Language","A":"Description","B":"Purpose"},"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2024-04-04 03:16:00"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Microsoft","name":"MB-220","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":230,"id":76},"currentPage":29},"__N_SSP":true}
