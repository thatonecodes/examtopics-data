The first application is a server component that provides user authentication.\nStep 2: Create a client application\nThe second application is a client component that's used when you're prompted by the CLI for authentication. This client application uses the server application for the actual authentication of the credentials provided by the client.\nStep 3: Deploy an AKS cluster.\nUse the az group create command to create a resource group for the AKS cluster.\nUse the az aks create command to deploy the AKS cluster.\nStep 4: Create an RBAC binding.\nBefore you use an Azure Active Directory account with an AKS cluster, you must create role-binding or cluster role-binding. Roles define the permissions to grant, and bindings apply them to desired users. These assignments can be applied to a given namespace, or across the entire cluster.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-integration","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"21","timestamp":"1615590960.0","content":"Correct answer\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-integration-cli","poster":"dadageer","comment_id":"309271"},{"poster":"bmanu","comments":[{"poster":"TheProfessor","content":"All Azure AD Integration (legacy) AKS clusters will be migrated to AKS-managed Azure AD automatically starting from December 1st, 2023.
