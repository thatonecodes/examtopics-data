It provides high availability by distributing resources across physically separate locations within the same Azure region. If one data center experiences a failure, the resources in other availability zones within the region remain operational, ensuring minimal downtime.\n\nThe other options do not align with the purpose of availability zones:\n\nA. a physical server failure: This is typically handled by Azure's redundancy within a single data center, not availability zones.\n\nB. an Azure region failure: Availability zones are within a region, so they do not protect against the failure of an entire region.
