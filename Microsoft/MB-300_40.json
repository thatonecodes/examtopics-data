Privileges can be assigned directly to roles, however we recommend that you only assign duties to roles. This is so that the privileges are first grouped together into a duty, which makes it easier to maintain.\nA privilege contains permissions to individual application objects, such as user interface elements and tables. For example, the Cancel payments privilege contains permissions to the menu items, fields, and tables that are required to cancel payments.\nBy default, privileges are provided for all features in finance and operations.
