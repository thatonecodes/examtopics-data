For every 1,000 TPM, you can make 6 RPM.\n\nSo, if you need to process 600 requests every minute, you'll require a TPM that supports that many RPM. Using the ratio, for 600 RPM, you need 100,000 TPM (because 600 divided by 6 equals 100, and 100 multiplied by 1,000 equals 100,000).

Setting the appropriate capacity value ensures that the resource can respond to 600 requests per minute.\n\n100 is CORRECT because a throughput of 600 requests per minute requires the ability to process a substantial number of tokens per minute. Each capacity unit supports 1,000 tokens per minute (TPM). For a typical request, assuming it processes up to 100 tokens per request (input + output), the capacity required is 600 requests * 100 tokens = 60,000 TPM. Setting the capacity to 100 ensures the resource can handle up to 100,000 TPM, meeting the 600 requests per minute requirement with sufficient buffer.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1354907","poster":"syupwsh","timestamp":"1739262900.0"},{"content":"This was in the exam on 15/08/2024","timestamp":"1723670880.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"moonlightc","comment_id":"1265984"},{"poster":"HaraTadahisa","comment_id":"1235233","content":"1. capacity\n2. 100","timestamp":"1719039900.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"PeteColag","comment_id":"1220874","content":"Parameter Type Description\nsku Sku The resource model definition representing SKU.\ncapacity integer This represents the amount of quota you are assigning to this deployment.
