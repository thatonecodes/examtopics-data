Here's why:\n\nTypes of views\nThere are three types of views: personal, system, and public.\n\n1. Personal view - Personal views are owned by individuals and only visible to that person unless THEY SHARE their personal views with others.\n2. System view - As a system administrator or system customizer, you can edit system views. System views are special views the application depends on, which exist for system tables or are automatically created when you create custom tables. These views have specific purposes and some additional capabilities.\n3. Public view - Public views are general purpose views that you can customize as you see fit. They are important because all app users can access them, when they are made available, by using the view selector. It is possible to use public views in subgrids in a form or as a list in a dashboard.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-views#types-of-views","timestamp":"1693996380.0","poster":"velisam","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"12","timestamp":"1685510940.0","poster":"imnz","content":"The answer is correct in my opinion.\n\n1.
