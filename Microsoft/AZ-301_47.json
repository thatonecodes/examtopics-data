With ADFS your authentication request is handed off the the ADFS system and system and once you have your token you are redirected back to the application and thus you're request was handled by on premise AD. With PTA your authentication is queued to be handled by Azure AD, I grant that it is handled then by an on premise agent with compares creds to what is stored in AD but ultimately the access token is then finally handled by Azure AD.\n\nSecondly, it only makes sense given that it then goes on to ask us to load balance the authentication solution. I think we can all agree there is no requirement to load balance PTA or even possibility too.\n\nThe Second box I think is more self-explanatory, given the need to multi-region redundancy we require traffic manager.

This is the only way I can reason it:\n\nThe authentication solution is AZ Active Directory, with pass through feature to avoid hash storing.

To authenticate users against cloud services I will use App identity and user access defined in AZ AD.\n\nThus, there the load balancing it mentions it is impossible to be applied to AZ AD connect, which is managed by Microsoft. It is not an active-active load balancing but rather is referring to load balancing in case of a failure, fact that is repeated all over the statement.
