This will ensure that Report2 uses the data from Dataset1, rather than the data from the local dataset.\nDelete all the calculated tables: Report2 contains several calculated tables that were based on the local dataset.

You are not able to modify queries to connect Power BI Dataset. Also, when you connect to Power BI Dataset and after that go to Power Query, there is 0 queries, nothing is displayed. Plus, in the question there is no indication that we need the calculated tables and parameters, so no problem with deleting them.

Incorrect: As removing dataset permissions would generate errors while refreshing data. Local dataset eneds to be removed from Report2\n B. Correct: As you need to prepare report for shared dataset which would work as live connection so all pwer query objects should be deleted\n C. As we need to delete the power query objects and in shared dataset there is a live connection with all the tables in that dataset modifying the source of eact PQ object/query is irrelevant\n D. Incorrect: There is no mention of power query parameters so seems irrelevant with scenario posted in the querstion\n Correct: When you are building a report based of shared Dataset you can not use calculated tables (6:35 of video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENZm_7jWU4Q) so they would need to be deleted.
