When NAT gateway is deployed to a specific zone, it will provide outbound connectivity to the internet explicitly from that zone. The public IP address or prefix configured to NAT gateway must match the same zone. NAT gateway resources with public IP addresses from a different zone, zone-redundancy or with no zone aren't allowed.\nNAT gateway can provide outbound connectivity for virtual machines from other availability zones different from itself.
