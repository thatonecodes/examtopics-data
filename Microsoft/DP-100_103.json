The datasets also contain many outliers.\nStep 2: Add the Bayesian Linear Regression module.\nScenario: You produce a regression model to predict property prices by using the Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regression modules.\nStep 3: Configure the regularization weight.\nRegularization typically is used to avoid overfitting. For example, in L2 regularization weight, type the value to use as the weight for L2 regularization. We recommend that you use a non-zero value to avoid overfitting.\nScenario:\nModel fit: The model shows signs of overfitting. You need to produce a more refined regression model that reduces the overfitting.\nIncorrect Answers:\nMulticlass Decision Jungle module:\nDecision jungles are a recent extension to decision forests. A decision jungle consists of an ensemble of decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\nL-BFGS:\nL-BFGS stands for \"limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno\".
