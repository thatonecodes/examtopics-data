Company Overview -\nContoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics.\n\nOverview. IT Structure -\nThe company’s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems.\nThe data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data.\nThe data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL.\n\nExisting Environment. Fabric -\nContoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items.\nContoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode.\nExisting Environment. Source Systems\nContoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company’s website.\nThe company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint.\nContoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions.\nExisting Environment. Product Data\nPOS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables:\n\nProducts -\n\nProductCategories -\n\nProductSubcategories -\nIn the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories.\n\nExisting Environment. Azure -\nContoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups:\nDataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts\nDataEngineers: Contains the data engineers\nContoso has an Azure subscription.\nThe company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric.\nExisting Environment. User Problems\nThe VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric.\nThe data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail.\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes -\nContoso plans to create the following two lakehouses:\nLakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources\nLakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries\nAdditional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation.\nContoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric.\nRequirements. Technical Requirements\nThe new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization.\nEach layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers.\nData imports must run simultaneously, when possible.\nThe use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements:\nMinimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access.\nPrevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses.\nItems that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements:\nThe items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items.\nIngested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format.\nNo changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer.\nDevelopment effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data.\nIn the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again.\nLakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB.\nOnce a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed.\nRequirements. Data Transformation\nIn the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1.\nSome product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer.\n\nRequirements. Data Security -\nSecurity in Fabric must meet the following requirements:\nThe data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files.\nThe data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer.\nThe data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.\nThe data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA.\nYou need to schedule the population of the medallion layers to meet the technical requirements.\nWhat should you do?","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-01-01 09:31:00","unix_timestamp":1735720260,"question_id":90,"answer":"A","topic":"3","exam_id":72,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1735720260.0","poster":"GHill1982","comment_id":"1335147","upvote_count":"8","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis makes it easier to manage dependencies between different stages of the data processing and ensure each step is completed before moving on to the next."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOnly A meet the requrements: Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer.
