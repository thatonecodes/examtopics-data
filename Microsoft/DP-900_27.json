It allows you to store and analyze large amounts of data, and it is optimized for big data analytics workloads.\n\nN - Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and manage data pipelines. It does not use a massively parallel processing architecture by default, but allows you to perform complex data integration and transformation tasks by integrating with other Azure services.\n\nN - Azure HDInsight is designed for big data analytics workloads and does not enable you to build tabular models from multiple data sources to support OLAP queries. Azure Analysis Services is a service that you can use to create and manage tabular models for OLAP.","poster":"Stuurwiel1","comment_id":"787707"},{"content":"Y, N, N","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732509480.0","comment_id":"1217943","poster":"Sekharad"},{"content":"yes\nno\nno","timestamp":"1725191220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1163552","poster":"AGTraining"},{"timestamp":"1712933820.0","content":"Yes, No, No","comment_id":"1041854","poster":"Anuragsharma83","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1008787","timestamp":"1710560160.0","poster":"karan17","content":"y,n,n is the right answer","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Dusica","content":"Y, N, N","timestamp":"1684736880.0","comment_id":"724174","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"urielramoss","comment_id":"703068","upvote_count":"4","content":"YNN !!!!!!","timestamp":"1682343780.0"},{"upvote_count":"7","poster":"quocdunginfo2","comment_id":"676861","timestamp":"1679562480.0","content":"Y,N,N is answer"}]},{"id":"vEzZSMWg1uWjvCwFYDni","isMC":false,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04277/0022400001.jpg"],"answer":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nSelect the answer that correctly completes the sentence.\nHot Area:\n//IMG//","discussion":[{"poster":"pallmall","comment_id":"661450","content":"duplicate but correct answer","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1678126920.0"},{"content":"An elastic pool","timestamp":"1725191280.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"AGTraining","comment_id":"1163553"},{"poster":"Mega2","comment_id":"1150230","timestamp":"1723633860.0","content":"Correct: An elastic pool","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"895429","content":"Duplicated question","upvote_count":"1","poster":"choby","timestamp":"1699745820.0"},{"content":"Question 212","poster":"NuriaIzard","timestamp":"1688995800.0","comment_id":"771561","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1680060960.0","comment_id":"682310","poster":"MEIQIN","content":"Repeated question"},{"content":"Duplicated","timestamp":"1679562900.0","comment_id":"676864","upvote_count":"3","poster":"quocdunginfo2"},{"content":"Correct answer but duplicate","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1678197480.0","comment_id":"662436","poster":"Tsang"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/80678-exam-dp-900-topic-1-question-225-discussion/","question_id":132,"exam_id":73,"answer_ET":"","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1662481320,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04277/0022400002.jpg"],"timestamp":"2022-09-06 18:22:00"},{"id":"ik5A6GGvqENUZtGzbSo7","answers_community":["D (96%)","4%"],"isMC":true,"exam_id":73,"question_id":133,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"isolation","A":"atomicity","B":"durability","C":"consistency"},"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/80679-exam-dp-900-topic-1-question-226-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1664177640.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nConfirmed is Isolation.\nIt was in 26/09/2022 exam and I scored 1000.","poster":"studysmart","comments":[{"timestamp":"1666443660.0","content":"Congrats, Fully Trusting ur answers !
