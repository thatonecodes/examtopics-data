This principle is even more important when AI systems are being developed. Key checks and balances need to make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion bias toward a group or individual.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/best-practices/trusted-ai#reliability-and-safety\nAI systems need to be reliable and safe in order to be trusted. It's important for a system to perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation process.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"zellck","comment_id":"933276"},{"content":"Got this in Jun 2023 exam.","timestamp":"1687747860.0","comment_id":"933989","upvote_count":"2","poster":"zellck"}],"comment_id":"933274","content":"Selected Answer: CDF\nCDF is the answer/\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/best-practices/trusted-ai#inclusiveness\nInclusiveness mandates that AI should consider all human races and experiences, and inclusive design practices can help developers to understand and address potential barriers that could unintentionally exclude people.
