In the Azure portal, navigate to your managed instance and select “Automatic tuning” from the menu. From there, you can enable or disable automatic tuning options such as “Force plan” and “Create index”. Therefore, the correct answer is B. From the Azure portal, configure automatic tuning.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because enabling the FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN option is not related to automatic tuning. FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN is a query hint that forces a query to use the last known good query plan in the plan cache instead of generating a new one."},{"comments":[{"content":"Here you are:\n\nFor Azure SQL Managed Instance, the supported option FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN can only be configured through T-SQL.
