The policy would then be assigned to your managed devices. Once the policy is applied, the bookmarks will be added to Chrome automatically.\n\nTo deliver bookmarks using a configuration profile, you would need to create a file that contains the bookmark data. The file would then be pushed to your managed devices. Once the file is on the device, you would need to use a script to import the bookmarks into Chrome.\n\nThis process is more complex and time-consuming than using an app configuration policy. It also requires you to create and maintain a bookmark file, which can be cumbersome if you have a large number of bookmarks or if you need to frequently update them.","poster":"VirtualJP","comment_id":"1039286"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nPlenty of links already in discussion, answer is D","comment_id":"1039279","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1696924320.0","poster":"ZaFletch"},{"comment_id":"1024231","content":"Selected Answer: D\nShould be D","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Rocky83","timestamp":"1696367220.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D App Config Policy.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-configure-chrome-android","poster":"Gillactus","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1006079","timestamp":"1694562240.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1006078","timestamp":"1694562180.0","poster":"Gillactus","content":"Answer is D App Config Policy.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-configure-chrome-android"},{"comment_id":"1005028","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694452380.0","poster":"Grg433","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think B is correct \nA configuration profile in Microsoft Intune allows you to configure settings and features on enrolled devices, including configuring bookmarks in the Chrome browser.
