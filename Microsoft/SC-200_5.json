RegEx pattern matching\n\nTo detect sensitive documents in SharePoint Online, you can use a RegEx (regular expression) pattern matching rule in the data loss prevention (DLP) policy. A RegEx pattern is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, which can be used to match specific sequences of characters in the documents.\n\nIn this scenario, you can use a RegEx pattern to match the customer account numbers, which consist of 32 alphanumeric characters. By using a RegEx pattern, you can accurately identify the sensitive documents that contain the customer account numbers and take appropriate action, such as blocking access to the documents or sending notifications to the appropriate users.\n\nOnce you have defined the RegEx pattern, you can create a DLP policy in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that uses the pattern to detect sensitive documents. The DLP policy can then be configured to take appropriate action, such as blocking access to the sensitive documents or sending notifications to the appropriate users.","comment_id":"806465","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"\"Once you have defined the RegEx pattern, you can create a DLP policy\".
