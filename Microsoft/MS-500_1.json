Not a conditional access policy. I don't understand the confusion by some in the comments section.\n\nAnyway,\n\nAnswer 1: This isn't a conditional access policy but operates the same way re: inclusion and exclusions. Exclusions take precedant. If they are excluded the policy won't apply. So only User 1 has to reset their password.\n\nAnswer 2: The MFA status (which is the legacy per-user MFA) is enabled and not enforced. We haven't been told this user already has registred MFA methods through aka.ms/mfasetup or via an admin so we can only assume it hasn't been configured yet. Therfore, User 2 won't technically be prompted for MFA. Only once the user registers an MFA method will they be prompted by MFA. So they will be prompted for MFA registration like others have stated. Once registered and confirmed the state will change to enforced.\n\nThe answer would have to be Neither User 1 or User 2 based on this. Unless the question is wrong and it should say enforced.
