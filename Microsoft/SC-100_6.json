Litware has 30 branch offices and remote employees across the United States. The remote employees connect to the main offices by using a VPN.\n\nLitware has grown significantly during the last two years due to mergers and acquisitions. The acquisitions include several companies based in France.\n\n\nExisting Environment\n-\n\nLitware has a Microsoft Entra tenant that syncs with an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forest named litware.com and is linked to 20 Azure subscriptions. Microsoft Entra Connect is used to implement pass-through authentication. Password hash synchronization is disabled, and password writeback is enabled. All Litware users have Microsoft 365 E5 licenses.\n\nThe environment also includes several AD DS forests, Microsoft Entra tenants, and hundreds of Azure subscriptions that belong to the subsidiaries of Litware.\n\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes\n-\n\nLitware plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Create a management group hierarchy for each Microsoft Entra tenant.\n• Design a landing zone strategy to refactor the existing Azure environment of Litware and deploy all future Azure workloads.\n• Implement Microsoft Entra Application Proxy to provide secure access to internal applications that are currently accessed by using the VPN.\n\nRequirements. Business Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following business requirements:\n\n• Minimize any additional on-premises infrastructure.\n• Minimize the operational costs associated with administrative overhead.\n\nRequirements. Hybrid Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following hybrid cloud requirements:\n\n• Enable the management of on-premises resources from Azure, including the following:\no Use Azure Policy for enforcement and compliance evaluation.\no Provide change tracking and asset inventory.\no Implement patch management.\n• Provide centralized, cross-tenant subscription management without the overhead of maintaining guest accounts.\n\nRequirements. Microsoft Sentinel Requirements\n\nLitware plans to leverage the security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) capabilities of Microsoft Sentinel. The company wants to centralize Security Operations Center (SOC) by using Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nRequirements. Identity Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following identity requirements:\n\n• Detect brute force attacks that directly target AD DS user accounts.\n• Implement leaked credential detection in the Microsoft Entra tenant of Litware.\n• Prevent AD DS user accounts from being locked out by brute force attacks that target Microsoft Entra user accounts.\n• Implement delegated management of users and groups in the Microsoft Entra tenant of Litware, including support for:\no The management of group properties, membership, and licensing\no The management of user properties, passwords, and licensing\no The delegation of user management based on business units\n\nRequirements. Regulatory Compliance Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following regulatory compliance requirements:\n\n• Ensure data residency compliance when collecting logs, telemetry, and data owned by each United States- and France-based subsidiary.\n• Leverage built-in Azure Policy definitions to evaluate regulatory compliance across the entire managed environment.\n• Use the principle of least privilege.\n\nRequirements. Azure Landing Zone Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following landing zone requirements:\n\n• Route all internet-bound traffic from landing zones through Azure Firewall in a dedicated Azure subscription.\n• Provide a secure score scoped to the landing zone.\n• Ensure that the Azure virtual machines in each landing zone communicate with Azure App Service web apps in the same zone over the Microsoft backbone network, rather than over public endpoints.\n• Minimize the possibility of data exfiltration.\n• Maximize network bandwidth.\n\nThe landing zone architecture will include the dedicated subscription, which will serve as the hub for internet and hybrid connectivity. Each landing zone will have the following characteristics:\n\n• Be created in a dedicated subscription.\n• Use a DNS namespace of litware.com.\n\nRequirements. Application Security Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following application security requirements:\n\n• Identify internal applications that will support single sign-on (SSO) by using Microsoft Entra Application Proxy.\n• Monitor and control access to Microsoft SharePoint Online and Exchange Online data in real time.\n\n\nYou need to recommend a multi-tenant and hybrid security solution that meets to the business requirements and the hybrid requirements.\n\nWhat should you recommend? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","unix_timestamp":1738081380,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sc-100/image137.png"],"answer":"","discussion":[{"poster":"AlbertE1nstein","upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1738081380.0","content":"1.
