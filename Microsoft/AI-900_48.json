These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation.\n\nBox 2: Accountability -\nThe people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate. Organizations should draw upon industry standards to develop accountability norms. These norms can ensure that AI systems are not the final authority on any decision that impacts people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over otherwise highly autonomous AI systems.\n\nBox 3: Privacy and security -\nAs AI becomes more prevalent, protecting privacy and securing important personal and business information is becoming more critical and complex. With AI, privacy and data security issues require especially close attention because access to data is essential for AI systems to make accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people. AI systems must comply with privacy laws that require transparency about the collection, use, and storage of data and mandate that consumers have appropriate controls to choose how their data is used\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/responsible-ai-principles/4-guiding-principles","exam_id":41,"unix_timestamp":1602100140,"answer":"","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1726764660.0","comment_id":"201212","comments":[{"poster":"vmontalvao","comment_id":"317872","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1616487060.0","content":"Yes, for the 2nd one."}],"content":"Accountability\nThe people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate.

It's important for a system to perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation process.","poster":"zellck","comments":[{"poster":"zellck","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/best-practices/trusted-ai#privacy-and-security\nA data holder is obligated to protect the data in an AI system, and privacy and security are an integral part of this system.

The matchPerson mode returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that may or may not belong to the same person.\n\nBox 3: identification -\nFace identification can address \"one-to-many\" matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. Match candidates are returned based on how closely their face data matches the query face.
