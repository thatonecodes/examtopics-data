There's literally nothing out there that explains whether this would exclude or include a user when they are set for both on a single policy. Only thing I can find is this link with the author talking about inclusion vs exclusion with user groups in InTune and how it doesn't mix well when mixing with device groups: https://www.petervanderwoude.nl/post/exclude-specific-groups-of-users-or-devices-from-an-app-assignment/\n\nPer his information though, excluded user groups take precedence over included ones when the service calculates the combined results. So Group2 does not get the first policy applied because those member would be removed from the final combined inclusion calculation. It would only apply the second one. Per this logic, the answer provided is correct assuming InTune treats user group inclusions/exclusions the same as EOP.

According to this - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/how-policies-and-protections-are-combined?view=o365-worldwide - only 1 policy is applied if a user is in two policies - and the first policy is the one that is applied. For User 2 - they are in both group 1 and group 2. Only antispam1 policy would come into play because it is rank 0. But which takes precedence - inclusion or exclusion?
