For example, T-shirts can have sizes S, M, L, etc. while a model of shoes can have 40, 41, 42, 43, etc. as sizes. Both can use the same configuration group, if size is the only dimension.\nThus, if I had to choose, I would say that creating the dimension group happens first, followed by the creation of sizes."}],"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"295265","poster":"ZVV","timestamp":"1613843460.0"}]},{"id":"dQv6VsLrXtAyq0k0rcxk","question_text":"A company manufactures and sells speaker boxes.
