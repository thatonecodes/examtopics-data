When you register a model, it creates a versioned entry in the model registry, which helps you keep track of different iterations or improvements made to the model over time. This allows for easy deployment, reproducibility, and management of different versions of the trained model."},{"comment_id":"901344","poster":"alexein74","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
