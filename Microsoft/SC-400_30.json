If content matches multiple rules, the first rule evaluated that has the most restrictive action is enforced. For example, if content matches all of the following rules, Rule 3 is enforced because it's the highest priority, most restrictive rule:\n\nRule 1: only notifies users\nRule 2: notifies users, restricts access, and allows user overrides\nRule 3: notifies users, restricts access, and doesn't allow user overrides\nRule 4: restricts access\nRules 1, 2, and 4 would be evaluated, but not applied.
