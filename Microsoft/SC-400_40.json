Once the difference is understood, the concept can be applied to all questions having an SIT and trainable classifier.\n\nSensitive Information Types (SITs) are classifiers that detect specific patterns in sensitive data like social security or credit card numbers. Microsoft offers numerous preconfigured SITs, but custom ones can also be created. They're used when the data to classify has a known pattern.\n\nA Trainable Classifier is a tool that learns to identify various content types through exposure to numerous examples. Once trained, it can be used to apply Office sensitivity labels, Communications compliance policies, and retention label policies. Its accuracy improves with more data. It's used when the data to classify lacks a specific pattern. So, use it when you have a big enough sample with unknown pattern.\n\nThe given answers are correct.","comment_id":"1169087","upvote_count":"2","poster":"jimmyjose","timestamp":"1725820080.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1688543640.0","comment_id":"766491","poster":"Rockalm","content":"Correct.
