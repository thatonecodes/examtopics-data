OLS would not limit the number of fields available; it would limit the data within those fields. Perspectives, on the other hand, are designed to limit which fields or tables are visible or available to the user, which directly addresses the requirement of making only 25 fields available for report personalization.","poster":"Momoanwar","timestamp":"1704863700.0","comment_id":"1118195"},{"poster":"88f4694","comment_id":"1111513","upvote_count":"2","content":"To ensure that only 25 fields are available when end users personalize visuals in Power BI, you should configure object-level security (OLS)1.\n\nObject-level security (OLS) in Power BI allows you to restrict the visibility of tables and columns in a dataset1.
