Pass-through authentication\n\nExplanation:\nTo ensure that on-premises account lockout policies are applied to Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) sign-ins, you must use pass-through authentication (PTA). Here's why:\n\nPass-through authentication allows Microsoft Entra to authenticate users directly against the on-premises Active Directory. This means that any policies enforced in AD, including account lockout policies, are applied during sign-in.\nIn contrast:\nPassword hash synchronization (PHS) hashes passwords and syncs them to Microsoft Entra, meaning authentication happens in the cloud, not against the on-premises AD. On-premises account lockout policies do not apply in this scenario.\nAzure AD Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) simplifies sign-in for users but does not enforce on-premises account lockout policies by itself.\nMicrosoft Entra Cloud Sync is used for syncing users and groups but does not affect authentication methods or enforce on-premises policies."}],"question_images":[],"answer":"D","question_id":121},{"id":"HUen4Q5INvuKqrJ2pKqb","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_description":"","topic":"2","timestamp":"2025-02-16 00:09:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/156581-exam-sc-300-topic-2-question-112-discussion/","exam_id":123,"question_text":"You have a Microsoft Entra tenant.\n\nYou open the risk detections report.\n\nWhich risk detection type is classified as a user risk?","unix_timestamp":1739660940,"answer":"D","choices":{"B":"anonymous IP address","C":"unfamiliar sign-in properties","A":"password spray","D":"Microsoft Entra threat intelligence"},"answer_images":[],"question_id":122,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1559427","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree with others, answer D: Let's classify each of the risk detection types:\n\nSign-in Risk:\nA.
