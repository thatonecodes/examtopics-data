The default \"time grain\" is 1 minute. The default \"time window\" for comparison is 5 minutes. So part one of the question: it starts with 4 instances, after 5 minutes it gets another 2 instances, and the question states 6 minutes so it's currently at 6 instances.

As an example, consider the following better rule combination.\n\nIncrease instances by 1 count when CPU% >= 80\nDecrease instances by 1 count when CPU% <= 60\nIn this case\n\nAssume there are 2 instances to start with.\nIf the average CPU% across instances goes to 80, autoscale scales out adding a third instance.\nNow assume that over time the CPU% falls to 60.\nAutoscale's scale-in rule estimates the final state if it were to scale-in. For example, 60 x 3 (current instance count) = 180 / 2 (final number of instances when scaled down) = 90. So autoscale does not scale-in because it would have to scale-out again immediately. Instead, it skips scaling down.\nThe next time autoscale checks, the CPU continues to fall to 50. It estimates again - 50 x 3 instance = 150 / 2 instances = 75, which is below the scale-out threshold of 80, so it scales in successfully to 2 instances.\"\n\nCooldown period is 5 mins between scales, in or out, it should be taking into consideration too.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"85929","poster":"CristianN"},{"timestamp":"1587233640.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"the duration tab is not displayed.

Therefore, if we set it as default, the duration time for scale out (described on the template as “increase”) will be 10min, and for scale in (described on the template as “decrease”) will be 5min. \n\nThis issue really does not make sense.
