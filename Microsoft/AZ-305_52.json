However, the solution also needs to connect to ExpressRoute circuits in four specific Azure regions: East US, Southeast Asia, North Europe, and South Africa.\n\nTo meet all these requirements, a hub should be deployed in each of these four regions. This ensures that each region has a local connection point, reducing latency. Even though connections are optimized across three regions, the fourth hub is necessary to provide a local connection point in the fourth region.\n\nSo, while three hubs might seem sufficient based on one requirement, considering all requirements makes it clear that four hubs are needed.

For these scenarios, you can deploy API Management into the cluster VNet.
