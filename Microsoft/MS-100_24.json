No\n\nAdding a custom domain to Azure AD and instructing User2 to sign in with that domain does not meet the goal of allowing User2 to access the resources in Azure AD.\n\nThe issue is that User2 is not able to authenticate with Azure AD using their user principal name (UPN) of user2@fabrikam.com. This is because the on-premises Active Directory user object for User2 does not have a matching user principal name in Azure AD.\n\nTo allow User2 to access the resources in Azure AD, you need to ensure that the on-premises Active Directory user object for User2 is synchronized to Azure AD and that the user object has a matching user principal name in Azure AD.
