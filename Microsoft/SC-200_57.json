This policy detects anomalous access to cloud apps from IP addresses that are not associated with the user's location. Since remote users of Litware connect to the network using VPNs from different locations, Cloud App Security may generate false positive alerts when users connect to both offices simultaneously. Modifying the \"Activity from anonymous IP addresses\" policy can help resolve this issue by excluding VPN IP addresses from being flagged as anonymous.
