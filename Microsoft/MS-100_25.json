So this question was not super easy for me. Since there is a lot of back-and-forth in the discussions on this question, I setup my tenant to match the conditions of this question to get the actual answer. I also matched my on-prem user accounts and the files to migrate. Same user permissions on the files, same permission preservation on the files in SPMT, and same User Mapping file. \n\nThe answers are:\nUserA is the owner: Yes\nUserB is the owner: No\nGroupA is the owner: Yes\n\nIt looks like it really comes down to that Full Control perm on the file share. If a user has that level permission, then they will also be an owner in the SPO site after migration.\n\nSo I 2/3's don't agree with the given answer to this question. \n\nIt's possible I f'ed this practical test up somehow, but the SPMT is pretty straight forward and there isn't a lot of ambiguity in the use. So I am confident with my results.","timestamp":"1643235180.0"},{"content":"The Given Answer is correct. Please refer the link attached below. \nIf a file has Write permission for user1, then the file will be set to Contribute for user1 in SPO. If a file has Read permission for user1, then the file will be set to Read for user1 in SPO. For Full control permission, the file will be migrated as Full control in SPO.\n##Nothing mentioned about converting a Full control to owner##\nReference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointmigration/understanding-permissions-when-migrating","timestamp":"1642239180.0","comment_id":"524046","upvote_count":"2","poster":"kanag1"},{"timestamp":"1640602440.0","poster":"PDR","comments":[{"timestamp":"1640604300.0","poster":"PDR","upvote_count":"1","content":"tested this with a migration:\nUser1 with Full Control on file1 is given OWNER permission on the file when migrated to Sharepoint Online site\nUser2 with modify on file1 is given 'Can Edit' permission on the file when migrated to Sharepoint Online site but not Owner.\n\nWhilst not relevant to the question it is worth noting that the migrated users do not get any Sharepoint Site level permissions so dont actually have permission to access the document library and would have to access using a direct link.","comment_id":"510260"}],"comment_id":"510233","upvote_count":"1","content":"I think these doc pages are key to reference for the answer for this:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointmigration/understanding-permissions-when-migrating\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/understanding-permission-levels\n\nProblem here is that whilst it states that Full Control permissions will get mapped it doesnt state that user with full control will be migrated and given OWNER .... but the owner role is the only one that has Full Control permissions when using the Permissions settings in a Sharepoint site, so logically you would assume that a user given Full Control must be an OWNER. \nNeed to test to be sure though as something being logical and it actually being the case isnt a given!"},{"comment_id":"472167","content":"YNY just read the links and articles if you are not familiar with SPMT","timestamp":"1635957780.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"TimurKazan"},{"upvote_count":"7","poster":"melatocaroca","timestamp":"1623248520.0","comment_id":"378351","comments":[{"timestamp":"1623249300.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"378361","content":"Also csv does not contain all the required fields\nCSV file format for migration needs six columns. \no The first three are source values that detail where your data is currently located. \no The remaining three columns indicate \n o the site, \n o document library, \n o optional subfolder \n o where you're migrating your data to. \nAll six columns must be accounted for in the file, even if you don't need a value for a given field.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointmigration/mm-user-mapping-file","poster":"melatocaroca"},{"timestamp":"1636800480.0","poster":"jinxie","comment_id":"477397","upvote_count":"3","content":"The TRUE FALSE flag here is to indicate if the entity is an AD group or not. it has nothing to do with the migration. as per MS article on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointmigration/mm-user-mapping-file\n\nThe following example uses Excel to create the CSV file.\n\nStart Excel.\n\nEnter the values for your user-mapping.\n\nColumn A: From the source location, enter the log in name of the user.
