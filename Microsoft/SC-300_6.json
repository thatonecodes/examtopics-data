Modify the Local intranet Zone settings.\n\nExplanation:\nTo configure Windows 10 computers for Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-On (Seamless SSO), you need to ensure that users' credentials are automatically passed from their Windows session to Azure AD when accessing cloud resources. This is achieved by configuring the Local intranet zone settings in Internet Explorer or Edge.\n\nAzure AD Seamless SSO works by authenticating users seamlessly without prompting for credentials when they access resources in Azure AD. However, for it to work, the Azure AD URLs (like https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com) must be trusted by the browsers on the Windows 10 machines. This is achieved by adding the URLs to the Local intranet zone.\nOption A (Configuring Sign-in options) and Option B (Enabling Enterprise State Roaming) are not related to enabling Seamless SSO.\nOption D (Installing the Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent) is also incorrect, as the Authentication Agent is used for Pass-through Authentication (PTA) rather than Seamless SSO.\nTherefore, Option C is the correct choice to ensure Azure AD Seamless SSO works on Windows 10 computers.","poster":"ColdCut","comment_id":"1308105","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1730921460.0"},{"timestamp":"1711630980.0","comment_id":"1184773","upvote_count":"1","poster":"emartiy","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA for implementing Single Sign-on...

Here's why:\n\nGuest Access in Microsoft 365: By using Azure AD's B2B collaboration feature, you can invite users from one Azure AD tenant as guests in another tenant.
