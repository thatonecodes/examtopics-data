From the Microsoft Intune admin center, create an antivirus policy.\n\nHere’s the reasoning:\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint is an antivirus solution, and its settings can be managed through an antivirus policy in Microsoft Intune. This includes settings that prevent users from disabling the antivirus. Therefore, creating an antivirus policy in the Microsoft Intune admin center would be the appropriate action to take.\n\nOption A, creating a security baseline, is not the best choice because security baselines are predefined sets of recommended security settings that might not cover the specific requirement of preventing users from disabling Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\n\nOption C, creating a Conditional Access policy in the Microsoft Entra admin center, is not applicable because Conditional Access policies are used to enforce access controls based on conditions, not to manage antivirus settings.\n\nOption D, creating a device compliance policy, is also not the best choice because device compliance policies are used to determine whether a device is compliant with the organization’s rules, not to manage antivirus settings.","poster":"Krayzr"},{"timestamp":"1738223580.0","comment_id":"1348943","poster":"Meek_Learner","upvote_count":"1","content":"To prevent users from disabling Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Windows 11 computers managed through Microsoft Intune, you should create an antivirus policy from the Microsoft Intune admin center.\nAntivirus policies in Intune allow administrators to enforce Microsoft Defender security settings, ensuring that users cannot disable key protection features.\nThe antivirus policy will include settings to:\n\nEnable Tamper Protection, preventing users from modifying security settings.\nEnsure real-time protection remains enabled.\nConfigure attack surface reduction rules to enhance endpoint security.\nBy using an antivirus policy, you can enforce and maintain Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configurations effectively across your organization's devices."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726878420.0","comment_id":"1287083","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI checked it","poster":"bigreg"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"3661de6","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","comment_id":"1196035","timestamp":"1713186000.0"},{"timestamp":"1712664360.0","comment_id":"1192267","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kerimnl","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct answer"},{"timestamp":"1710879300.0","comment_id":"1177695","poster":"Darkfire","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB should be correct based on:\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-tamper-protection-intune?view=o365-worldwide#:~:text=In%20the%20Intune%20admin%20center%2C%20go,Deploy%20the%20policy%20to%20devices."},{"comment_id":"1169413","timestamp":"1709981460.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"CaTa_LySt","content":"To prevent users from disabling Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on the Windows 11 computers enrolled in Microsoft Intune, you should:\n\nA.
