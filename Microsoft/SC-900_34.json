Two-factor verification helps you to use your accounts more securely because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised. Two-factor verification uses a second factor like your phone to make it harder for other people to break in to your account.\n\nBox 2: Yes -\nIn Windows 10, Windows Hello for Business replaces passwords with strong two-factor authentication on devices. This authentication consists of a new type of user credential that is tied to a device and uses a biometric or PIN.\n\nBox 3: No -\nWindows Hello credentials are based on certificate or asymmetrical key pair. Windows Hello credentials can be bound to the device, and the token that is obtained using the credential is also bound to the device.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview","unix_timestamp":1662735000,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-09-09 16:50:00","isMC":false,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04254/0004700002.jpg"],"answer":"","answers_community":[],"exam_id":125,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1666080120.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"745210","content":"Windows Hello for Business actually counts as multi-factor authentication.
