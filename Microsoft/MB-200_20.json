All potential optimizations begin with an optimization impact value of 0. Potential optimizations have no impact measurement yet because the optimization hasn't been applied. Over time, after an optimization is applied by clicking OPTIMIZE, an integer value is displayed that represents query performance impact. For example, after one week since the optimization was applied, the value that appears can help indicate whether an optimization has improved or degraded query performance for the given entity. A negative value suggests an improvement in query performance, whereas a positive number suggests a degradation in query performance. So, an optimization applied one week ago that has a value of -10% suggests a 10 percent improvement in query performance.\nref : https://portal.dynamics365support.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01217/en-us","poster":"anoss","timestamp":"1583929800.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Hi Gavin - yes - this feature appears to have been removed in V9 orgs.","poster":"Qr4nk","timestamp":"1583926620.0","comment_id":"62393"},{"comment_id":"49048","poster":"createscript","timestamp":"1581407940.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"This question is no longer relevant as Data Performance Tool does not exist anymore in Dynamics 365 CE v9 (it was only available in v8).
