A commonly used example of this is to federate your on- premises Active Directory environment with Azure AD and use this federation for authentication and authorization.\n\nBox 2: Yes -\nAs described above, third-party cloud services and on-premises Active Directory can be used to access Azure resources. This is known as 'federation'.\nFederation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. A typical federation might include a number of organizations that have established trust for shared access to a set of resources.\n\nBox 3: Yes -\nAzure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a centralized identity provider in the cloud.
