You set apps to Exempt if they are unenlightened. You can Deny the app so it won't be able to work with corporate data or Allow it so it can work with corporate data but you have the risk of data being copied out of this app due to the protection not being in place.\n\nExempting something and using Deny is the same as not including the app within Protected Apps section within WIP.

I did a WIP with enrollment (Since I already have an autopilot test pc) with IE as protected app, Edge as exempt app , block setting and sharepoint as protected cloud resource.
