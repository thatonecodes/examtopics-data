These columns will be used for the slicers to filter the data by month.\nAction 2: Select unpivot other columns. This action will transform the 2019, 2020, and 2021 columns into rows, creating a column called \"Attribute\" that contains the years and a column called \"Value\" that contains the sales data. This step makes the data more suitable for visualization and filtering by year.\nAction 3: Rename the Attribute column as Year and the value column as sales. Renaming the columns provides a more descriptive and meaningful structure for your data.\nAfter performing these actions, your data will be in a format that allows you to create visuals and add slicers for the month and year in Power BI.","upvote_count":"33","comment_id":"998835","timestamp":"1693859760.0","poster":"Igetmyrole"},{"timestamp":"1726019400.0","content":"on the exam 11/9/24 and I got this right surprisingly.
