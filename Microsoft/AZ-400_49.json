You can then in your server execute a Powershell script, but there is no way to guarantee it will execute before the rebase because as far as I know Github won't wait for the Powershell script to end execution because all Github does about it is to send the custom HTTP request. I don't know if Github waits for a response from the server after sending the request before proceeding, but if it isn't the case then it's impossible. Besides, I don't think there is a webhook for rebase events since rebases are made locally.
