JavaScript resources can be reused on multiple forms easily, as long as the web resource is added to each form's library. For use, controls are powerful, but they can be confusing for users as they are not without faults and bugs (in my limited experience). Implementing business logic with PCF would probably require developing custom components--which definitely does NOT meet the business requirement that the simplified form set up must improve maintainability. The reference page on Microsoft's website explicitly mentions that this is a functionality for developers, not for no-code/low-code super-users.\n\nMy answer is D.
