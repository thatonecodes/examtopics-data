Enterprise users had the ability to connect a Microsoft account to their Active Directory domain account to gain access to settings sync. In Windows 10, this connected Microsoft account functionality is being replaced with a primary/secondary account framework.\nThe primary account is defined as the account used to sign in to Windows. This can be a Microsoft account, an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account, an on- premises Active Directory account, or a local account. In addition to the primary account, Windows 10 users can add one or more secondary cloud accounts to their device. A secondary account is generally a Microsoft account, an Azure AD account, or some other account such as Gmail or Facebook. These secondary accounts provide access to additional services such as single sign-on and the Windows Store, but they aren't capable of powering settings sync.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/enterprise-state-roaming-faqs","question_id":288,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/57097-exam-md-101-topic-4-question-26-discussion/","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"You have computers that run Windows 10 and are joined to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).\nAll users sign in to the computers by using their Azure AD account.\nEnterprise State Roaming is enabled.\nFrom the Settings app, a user named User1 adds a Microsoft account.\nWhich account will be used for the Synchronizing Windows setting?","topic":"4","exam_id":96,"unix_timestamp":1625407980,"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"10","poster":"Jana08","timestamp":"1625407980.0","content":"Link provided by admin is broken:\n\nIn the November 2015 or later releases of Windows 10, Enterprise State Roaming is only supported for a single account at a time.
