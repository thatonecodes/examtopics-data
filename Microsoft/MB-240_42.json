However, option D - associating it to an entitlement for the Service Account - aligns more directly with the context of work orders, which are typically tied to the account receiving the service.\n\nGiven the goal is to apply the discount to \"all work order products and services\" for two years, the best approach is to use an entitlement (which can enforce the two-year term) and link it to the account tied to the work orders. In most service management systems, this is the Service Account.","poster":"LnP"},{"timestamp":"1726415220.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"C is correct","comment_id":"1174433","poster":"Yoch78"},{"timestamp":"1724759940.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"nivetha797","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct.
