Just checked. When forwarders are removed from the DNS in the child domain, this DNS is not able so resolve records in the root domain. And more. When child domain is installed, forwarders are configured automatically :)","timestamp":"1663669980.0","poster":"rimvydukas","comment_id":"674042"},{"poster":"jaguero","content":"Question 7 Exam 4: Create a development environment as proposed by Microsoft, a root domain crvinfo.local and 2 child domains (peru.crvinfo.local and brasil.crvinfo.local).\n\nBy default the root domain (crvinfo.local) created 2 delegated zones for Peru and Brazil, with these delegated zones you can resolve child domain names.\n\nIn the child domain, forwards are automatically configured to the IP address of the root domain.

Also, confusingly, the 'forwarder' is actually who you are 'forwarding to'.. so google would be your 'forwarder'. You wouldn't \"forward\" something to an internal resource so my answer here is no.

You could allow a single server to do external queries and block DNS everywhere else, and have all your internal DNS servers point to the one that has external access for example. A forwarder is simply \"Where do I send requests that I can't resolve\".
