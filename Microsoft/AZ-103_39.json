Check this link:\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview\n\nDiagnose network traffic filtering problems to or from a VM\nWhen you deploy a VM, Azure applies several default security rules to the VM that allow or deny traffic to or from the VM. You might override Azure's default rules, or create additional rules. At some point, a VM may become unable to communicate with other resources, because of a security rule. The IP flow verify capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied the communication, so that you can resolve the problem.
