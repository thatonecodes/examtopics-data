The company supports agricultural production resources by distributing seeds fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery to the farms.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nThe company is migrating all applications from an on-premises datacenter to Microsoft Azure. Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff.\n\n\nCorporate website -\nâ¢ The company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources.\n\n\nFarms -\nâ¢ The company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications.\n\n\nDistributors -\nâ¢ Distributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\nThe application components must meet the following requirements:\n\n\nCorporate website -\nâ¢ The site must be migrated to Azure App Service.\nâ¢ Costs must be minimized when hosting in Azure.\nâ¢ Applications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources.\nâ¢ All code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production.\nâ¢ File transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase.\nâ¢ All site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit.\nâ¢ A queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests.\n\n\nFarms -\nâ¢ Farmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID.\n\n\nDistributors -\nâ¢ The company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs.\nâ¢ API telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data.\n\n\nInternal staff -\nâ¢ App and API updates must be validated before release to production.\nâ¢ Staff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update.\nâ¢ Staff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID.\n\n\nSecurity -\nâ¢ All web communications must be secured by using TLS/HTTPS.\nâ¢ Web content must be restricted by country/region to support corporate compliance standards.\nâ¢ The principle of least privilege must be applied when providing any user rights or process access rights.\nâ¢ Managed identities for Azure resources must be used to authenticate services that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n\nCorporate website -\nâ¢ Farmers report HTTP 503 errors at the same time as internal staff report that CPU and memory usage are high.\nâ¢ Distributors report HTTP 502 errors at the same time as internal staff report that average response times and networking traffic are high.\nâ¢ Internal staff report webpage load sizes are large and take a long time to load.\nâ¢ Developers receive authentication errors to Service Bus when they debug locally.\n\n\nDistributors -\nâ¢ Many API telemetry values are sent in a short period of time. Telemetry traffic, data costs, and storage costs must be reduced while preserving a statistically correct analysis of the data points sent by the APIs.\n\n\nYou need to configure App Service to support the corporate website migration.\n\nWhich configuration should you use?
