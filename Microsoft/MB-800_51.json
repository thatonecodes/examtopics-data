This step involves adding the vendor's information to the system.\n\nAdd items, including quantity, to the lines: Once the vendor is added, you can create a purchase order. This step involves adding the specific items and their quantities that you want to purchase from the vendor.\n\nChange Purchase Order to a Status of Released: After adding items to the purchase order, you need to release it. This changes the status of the order to \"Released\", meaning that the purchase order is finalized and can be sent to the vendor.\n\nSelect Post & Receive: After the goods are received from the vendor, you need to post the receipt and update the inventory.
