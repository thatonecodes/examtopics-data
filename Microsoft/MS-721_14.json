Roaming policies controlling Video are assigned to Network sites. \nA - turning this off still allows for other types of A/V calls\nB - this setting is per call, so 1500 is way too high.\nD - QoS is assigned at the meeting policy, and doesn't relate specifically to a voice experience. This may be helpful, but doesn't control available bandwidth, just prioritization of traffic. They would be better off using the Media bit rate setting in this policy.

Set the provisioning server URL for the handset is a relevant action for configuring SIP handsets, it may not directly resolve the issue of the Teams sign-in option not appearing. Here’s why option B is more appropriate:\n\nSign-in Requirement: For the Teams sign-in option to be available, the device must be registered and recognized within the Microsoft Teams environment. Adding the MAC address in the Microsoft Teams admin center links the handset to the Teams account, enabling sign-in functionality.\n\nProvisioning Server URL: Setting the provisioning server URL is important for directing the handset to the correct configuration settings, but if the device isn’t registered or recognized by Teams, simply configuring the provisioning server won't trigger the Teams sign-in option. The device needs to be added to Teams first for it to retrieve the appropriate configuration and display the sign-in option.","comment_id":"1304272","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1730170560.0"}],"answer":"E","question_text":"You have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription that uses Microsoft Teams Phone.\n\nYou are reconfiguring a SIP handset to use SIP Gateway.\n\nYou discover that the Teams sign-in option fails to appear on the handset.\n\nYou need to ensure that the Teams sign-in option appears on the handset.\n\nWhat should you do?","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Microsoft","isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false,"name":"MS-721","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":111,"numberOfQuestions":191},"currentPage":14},"__N_SSP":true}
