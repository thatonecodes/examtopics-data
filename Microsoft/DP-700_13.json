You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear.

Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.\nExisting Environment. Fabric Environment\nLitware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.\nThe company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.\nExisting Environment. Data Processing\nThe retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\nLitware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.\nLitware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.\nExisting Environment. Sales Data\nMonth-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.\nIn the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.\nThe sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:\n\nSales Date -\n\nAuthor -\n\nPrice -\n\nUnits -\n\nSKU -\nA table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.\nExisting Environment. Security Groups\nLitware has the following security groups:\n\nSales -\n\nFabric Admins -\n\nStreaming Admins -\nExisting Environment. Performance Issues\nBusiness users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”\nThe data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.\nWhen the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.\nThe company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes -\nLitware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.\nLitware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.\n\nRequirements. Version Control -\nLitware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.\nRequirements. Governance Requirements\nTo control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.\n\nRequirements. Data Requirements -\nLitware identifies the following data requirements:\nProcess the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).\nMake the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.\nWhen a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.\nYou need to resolve the sales data issue. The solution must minimize the amount of data transferred.\nWhat should you do?","answer_images":[],"exam_id":72,"topic":"2"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":97,"isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":72,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Microsoft","name":"DP-700"},"currentPage":13},"__N_SSP":true}
