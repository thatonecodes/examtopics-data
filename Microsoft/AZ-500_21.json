So basically when SSO, users don't need to type in their passwords to sign in to Azure AD, and usually, even type in their usernames. This feature provides your users easy access to your cloud-based applications without needing any additional on-premises components.\n\nAnd Microsoft already recommends to use Integrated Authentication if you are logged into Windows using your Azure Active Directory credentials from a federated domain, or a managed domain that is configured for seamless single sign-on for pass-through and password hash authentication (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-configure?tabs=azure-powershell#active-directory-integrated-authentication)\n\nOption A (AD - Password) sounds like a correct answer if you set Remember password.
