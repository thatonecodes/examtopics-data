Standard file shares are created in general purpose (GPv1 or GPv2) storage accounts and premium file shares are created in FileStorage storage accounts.\nYou cannot create Azure file shares from Blob storage accounts or premium general purpose (GPv1 or GPv2) storage accounts. Standard Azure file shares must created in standard general purpose accounts only and premium Azure file shares must be created in FileStorage storage accounts only. Premium general purpose (GPv1 and GPv2) storage accounts are for premium page blobs only.\n\nBox 2: Yes -\nGeo-redundant storage (GRS) brings additional redundancy to the data storage over both LRS or ZRS. Along with the three copies of your data stored within a single region, a further three copies are stored in the twinned Azure region. So using GRS means you get all the features of the LRS storage within your primary zone, but you also get a second LRS data storage in a neighbouring Azure region. This data is updated asynchronously, so there is a small lag between the 2 data sets, but for most cases this is acceptable.\n\nBox 3: Yes -\nBlob Storage Standard can be used both LRS and GRS.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-faq https://www.skylinesacademy.com/blog/2019/7/31/azure-storage-replication https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction","question_id":260,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/41361-exam-az-303-topic-5-question-84-discussion/"}],"exam":{"provider":"Microsoft","isImplemented":true,"id":52,"numberOfQuestions":334,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"name":"AZ-303"},"currentPage":52},"__N_SSP":true}
