Power Apps Maker portal is the recommended solution for creating the initial inspection checklists. Power Apps Maker portal allows for the creation and customization of apps, forms, and workflows without requiring extensive coding knowledge. It can be used to create a user-friendly interface for inspectors to use when completing the checklists. Additionally, it allows for the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors and provides a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. It also supports the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.","upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1684352340.0","comment_id":"900473"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think B because the Data migration utility moves records from a Dynamics 365 instance to another one.
