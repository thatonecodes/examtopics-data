The star schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries.\nExample:\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nThe data in the question is not normalized.\nThe snowflake schema is a variation of the star schema, featuring normalization of dimension tables. Example:\n\nNote: A snowflake schema is a logical arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database such that the entity relationship diagram resembles a snowflake shape. The snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact tables which are connected to multiple dimensions.[citation needed]. \"Snowflaking\" is a method of normalizing the dimension tables in a star schema.
