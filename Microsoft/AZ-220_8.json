The rule monitors the temperature reported by the device and sends an email when it falls below 400 degrees.\nB: Configure the rule conditions.\nConditions define the criteria that the rule monitors.

You can write a function that takes the device's metadata as input and returns the IoT hub endpoint that the device should be provisioned to. This enables you to apply more complex allocation logic beyond the standard allocation policy options provided by Azure IoT Hub.\n\nUsing the custom allocation policy, you can implement a load balancing strategy that distributes devices evenly between IoT hubs in the same geographic location, based on the current load and availability of each hub. This can help ensure that the devices are distributed efficiently and prevent overloading of any particular IoT hub.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: Custom (Use Azure Function).","poster":"feyey","timestamp":"1680930120.0","comment_id":"864413"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1658324400.0","content":"why not Evenly weighted distribution?","comment_id":"634075","poster":"IMARRA","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1671915180.0","comment_id":"755138","poster":"exnaniantwort","content":"It misses the requirement \"The load between the IoT hubs in the same geographic location must be balanced\"."}]},{"poster":"zb99","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1657298340.0","comment_id":"628851","content":"Selected Answer: D\nOnly way to include ID in allocation logic is with a custom Function."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIMO answer should be D","poster":"Plee","timestamp":"1648549800.0","comment_id":"577489"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nI see Static configuration is not wrong, it works!","poster":"liberty123","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"570299","timestamp":"1647587700.0"},{"timestamp":"1642450200.0","poster":"coramella","content":"Selected Answer: D\n“ This article demonstrates a custom allocation policy using an Azure Function written in C#.
