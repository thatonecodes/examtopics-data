In AzKeyValut, a Key is any Cryptographic Key, a Secret is a password or connection string, a certificate is a Public/Private Key-Pair. When you create a certificate in the Key vault, it actually puts the private key in a Key, password to protect the certificate in a secret, and Public key+medata in the certificate. To digitally sign a document you need a certificate ( private key + Public key). The signing process itself needs the private key of the certificate.

An authorized cloud service can request the Key Vault perform one or more cryptographic operations with a key on its behalf.\nAn Azure Key Vault certificate is simply a managed X.509 certificate. What’s different is Azure Key Vault offers life cycle management capabilities. Like Azure Keys, a service can request Azure Key Vault to create a certificate. When Azure Key Vault creates the certificate, it creates a related private key and password. The password is stored as an Azure Secret while the private key is stored as an Azure Key.
