To manage security updates on these session hosts, we need to change the configuration to use Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session images instead.\n\nWindows 10 Enterprise multi-session is a version of Windows 10 Enterprise that is optimized for multiple concurrent users. When using multi-session images, multiple users can share a single VM, which can reduce costs and simplify management. By using multi-session images, we can take advantage of Azure automation to manage security updates on the VMs.\n\nOption A and B are incorrect because changing the host pool type to pooled and specifying load balancing algorithms will not allow you to manage the security updates using Microsoft Endpoint Manager.\n\nOption D is not necessary to manage security updates.
