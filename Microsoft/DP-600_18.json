Delete any unused semantic models from Workspace1 ❌\n\nThis might free up resources but does not directly improve XMLA write performance. The performance is tied to the individual model's processing efficiency rather than the number of models in the workspace.\n\nC. Configure Model1 to use the Direct Lake storage format ❌\n\nDirect Lake is optimized for reading, not writing. It bypasses import and DirectQuery modes, improving query performance but not XMLA write operations.\n\nD. Delete any unused columns from Model1 ❌\n\nWhile reducing unused columns may improve memory usage and query performance, it does not significantly impact XMLA write speed.","timestamp":"1743390540.0","comment_id":"1413918","upvote_count":"1","poster":"4390015"},{"timestamp":"1742406120.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe Large semantic model storage format is designed to handle larger datasets and improve performance for both read and write operations.
