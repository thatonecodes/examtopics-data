The two primary operations that you can use for connectors are:\n\nTrigger Operations: These operations allow the app to respond to specific events. For example, a connector might have a trigger operation that initiates whenever a new record is added to a database.\nAction Operations: These operations allow the app to perform actions on the data source. For example, an action operation might include creating, reading, updating, or deleting data in a database.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1138431"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1703643660.0","poster":"itsbradman","content":"Actions and Triggers: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connectors","comment_id":"1106517"},{"timestamp":"1703353140.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1104157","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nIn the context of Power Apps and the use of connectors to support business operations, the two operations that are applicable for connectors are:\n\nActions\nExplanation: Actions refer to the operations that a connector can perform on a data source. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations). Actions can also involve executing specific functions or procedures defined in the data source or service. For example, a connector to a CRM system might provide actions to add a new customer record or update an existing order.\n\nTriggers\nExplanation: Triggers are used to initiate a process in response to an event. In Power Automate, part of the Power Platform, connectors use triggers to start workflows or flows based on certain events. For instance, a trigger could be set up to start a flow when a new row is added to a database table, or when a new email arrives in an inbox. These triggers enable automated workflows that respond to changes or actions in connected systems.","poster":"dciferit"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1045753","poster":"Chelton","content":"A connector is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and Azure Logic Apps.
