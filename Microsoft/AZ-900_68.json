Tags are name-value pairs that enable you to categorize resources in a way that is meaningful to your organization. You can use tags to identify resources that belong to a specific department or project, for example.\n\nOnce you have tagged your resources with the appropriate department or project information, you can use the Azure Cost Management + Billing service to generate reports and analyze costs by department or project. This can help you identify areas where you may be able to reduce costs or optimize your resource usage.\n\nBudgets and alerts can also be useful tools for monitoring and managing costs in an Azure subscription, but they are not specifically designed for identifying which department is responsible for the cost of each resource."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1694063880.0","comment_id":"831624","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAgree C","poster":"JohannesV"},{"timestamp":"1691777100.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nwe need to identify which department is responsible, that is done by tags","poster":"Rashica","comment_id":"805581"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"HakimNY","timestamp":"1689537300.0","comment_id":"778324","content":"and is Tags"},{"timestamp":"1689534540.0","comment_id":"778275","poster":"Vick98","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nit should be C, tags are used for this"},{"content":"Mensen van Goodzo.
