Let's take a moment to talk about each one in more detail.\n\nGood or poor: A good or poor call consists of a call that contains a complete set of service metrics, for which a full QoE report was generated and received by the service. Determining whether a stream is good or poor is described earlier in this guide.\n\nUnclassified: An unclassified stream doesn't contain a full set of service metrics. These can be short calls—usually less than 60 seconds—where averages couldn't be computed and a QoE report wasn't generated. The most common reason for calls to be unclassified is that there was little to no packet utilization. An example of this would be a participant who joins a meeting on mute and never speaks. The participant is receiving, but not transmitting, media. Without media being transmitted, there won't be any metrics available for CQD to use to classify the endpoint's outbound media stream.","comment_id":"98845","upvote_count":"115"},{"timestamp":"1649336340.0","comment_id":"72112","upvote_count":"11","poster":"Steve94228","content":"70 in total, 66 with metric data"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Alrick","comment_id":"733824","content":"on test 18/11/2022","timestamp":"1733150040.0"},{"timestamp":"1732653720.0","comment_id":"727809","content":"on exam 26-Nov-2022","upvote_count":"2","poster":"MJ_Hammami"},{"content":"Was on test on 22.08.2022","poster":"Nokwai","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724329800.0","comment_id":"650245"},{"comment_id":"577338","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1711704120.0","content":"On Test 29.03.22","poster":"Tybor"},{"comment_id":"526469","timestamp":"1705572180.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"dodo_on_tour","content":"On Test 18.01.22"},{"content":"Thanks Praveen","poster":"ViSr","comment_id":"509456","timestamp":"1703573460.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"225645","content":"4 % are unclassified, but the calls were established --> 66+4 = 70 in total and 66 with metric data","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1669194720.0","poster":"ostumm"},{"poster":"danielsh","content":"70 in total, 66 correct","comment_id":"148889","timestamp":"1659414840.0","upvote_count":"9"}],"answer_description":"","question_id":367,"isMC":false},{"id":"JbMpB5wK5uowwFIGAQRx","topic":"5","answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"Teams usage","A":"Teams device usage","B":"Teams live event usage","C":"Teams user activity"},"question_text":"Your company has a Microsoft 365 subscription.\nThe company deploys Microsoft Teams for 5,000 users.\nYou need to generate a report that contains the following information:\n✑ The number of active Microsoft Teams users during the last seven days.\n✑ The number of active team channels during the last seven days.\nWhich usage reports should you run?","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","exam_id":109,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/21627-exam-ms-700-topic-5-question-14-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_id":368,"timestamp":"2020-05-30 15:41:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1606750860.0","comment_id":"98859","content":"The Teams usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center gives you an overview of the usage activity in Teams, including the number of active users and channels","upvote_count":"27","poster":"Praveen_Thandassery"},{"poster":"ostumm","timestamp":"1621930440.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"227409","timestamp":"1621930680.0","content":"and D delivers an overview about: Team name, Active users, Guests, Active Channels, Post messages, Reply messages, Channel messages and Urgent messages","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ostumm"},{"timestamp":"1621930560.0","comment_id":"227407","upvote_count":"5","poster":"ostumm","content":"sorry, A,B,C and D are sub selections of Analytics and Reports -> Usage reports, but D delivers the data requested by the question"}],"content":"A,B and C are sub selections of Analytics and Reports -> Usage reports.
