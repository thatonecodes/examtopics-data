This means that all inbound and outbound traffic to/from resources associated with the NSG is blocked. \n\nTo allow traffic to flow, you need to create inbound and/or outbound security rules explicitly in the NSG. These rules define the type of traffic (such as TCP or UDP), the source and destination IP addresses and ports, and the action (allow or deny).\n\nIt's important to note that NSGs are applied to subnets or network interfaces, not individual virtual machines. This means that all virtual machines associated with a subnet or network interface will be subject to the same NSG rules.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that NSGs are stateful, which means that if you create an inbound security rule to allow traffic, the return traffic will be allowed automatically. You don't need to create a separate outbound security rule to allow the return traffic.","timestamp":"1682780280.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"speedyweedy","content":"Answer is YYY\n\nNSG does block all traffic by default","timestamp":"1682780160.0","comment_id":"884408"},{"content":"Take my test tomorrow.
