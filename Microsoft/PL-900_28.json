Column - Hidden Field Appear In the scenario where a hidden field needs to appear when a checkbox is checked, the appropriate component to use is a Column. Columns in model-driven apps can be configured to show or hide based on certain conditions, such as the value of a checkbox. Therefore, by configuring a column to be hidden by default and visible when the checkbox is checked, the requirement for the hidden field to appear is fulfilled.\n\n2. TABLE - List of customers and fields display: To display a list of customers and fields about customers, the appropriate component to use is a Table. In a model-driven app, a Table component can be configured to show a list of records from a specific entity, such as the customers entity in this scenario.
