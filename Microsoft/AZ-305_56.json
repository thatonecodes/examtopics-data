By adding an access policy for your App1 application, you can define the specific actions (such as \"get\" or \"list\") that the application can perform on the secrets stored in the Key Vault.\n\nRole assignments, on the other hand, are used to grant broader access to Azure resources at a higher scope, such as a subscription or resource group. While role assignments can provide access to the Key Vault itself, they do not offer the same granular control over secret operations as access policies do.\n\nTherefore, in the context of retrieving secrets from Azure Key Vault for your App1 application, the primary mechanism to use would be an access policy within the Key Vault.
