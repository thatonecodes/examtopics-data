Create the XML file (for ODT)\nThis sets up the parameters for installing Office on your local system. What languages, whether to use a FallbackCDN, and where the installation source is located. In this case it'll be on a local share. \n\n2. Run .\\setup.exe /download .\\ODT_XML_Install.xml (From PowerShell)\nThis downloads the installation based on the configuration in the XML to an \"Office\" folder from where you launch the ODT setup.exe from.\n\n3. Run .\\setup.exe /configure .\\ODT_XML_Install.xml (From PowerShell)\nFinally, the '/configure' tells ODT to do the actual install using the same configuration in the XML. \n\nI don't see anywhere in M365 to disable downloads.

I guess there is some kind of typo because the right option stays under M365 Admin Center > Settings > Org-wide settings > Office installation options but this disables the \"Download Office\" option that appers in every user office home page.\n\nFor what concerns the rest, is required to prepare the environment to distribute Office and not to install it on computers, so D is not needed in this case. Instead is necessary to create a custom XML with the Office Customization Tool (B), place it in a shared folder and call the setup.exe in download mode (A).","comments":[{"content":"I agree!
