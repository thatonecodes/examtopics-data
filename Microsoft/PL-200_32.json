Power Automate allows you to create automated workflows between your apps, services, and data to automate repetitive tasks and streamline business processes, including sending emails. By using Power Automate, you can easily integrate your canvas app with your email service, and configure the necessary triggers and actions to send emails with the click of a button.\n\nClassic workflows (A) are a deprecated feature of Dynamics 365, and they are not available in canvas apps. Azure Logic Apps (C) are similar to Power Automate cloud flows, but they are primarily used for enterprise integration scenarios and not for app development. Business process flows (D) are used to guide users through a set of stages and steps to complete a specific business process, and they do not provide the capability to send emails.","poster":"fariasalan86","timestamp":"1692293460.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"851321","comments":[{"timestamp":"1700154060.0","poster":"D365Apprentice","upvote_count":"1","content":"Where that is a possibility, it is not as efficient as creating a PA Cloud Flow","comment_id":"899292"}],"timestamp":"1695749280.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Question #22 (just two questions above this one) regards sending emails from a business process flow by creating a stage.
