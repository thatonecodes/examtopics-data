Their standard model bicycles are available year-round. Limited-edition bicycle models are released several times a year to boutique retailers domestically.\n\nAdventure Works has had the most success with their limited-edition bicycles. These bicycles have high margins, are in high demand, and have a strong following with the younger generation biking community.\n\n\nCurrent environment. General -\n\nAdventure Works expects to triple their manufacturing capabilities in the next few years due to increasing demand. The company plans to invest in Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, and the Power Platform products to migrate from a custom-built enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution and Microsoft Excel worksheets.\n\nAdventure Works sells only to the United States and Canada. Despite their limited market, they cannot keep up with current demand. Over time, they want to expand their market to remain profitable.\n\nAdventure Works has no capabilities or budget to undertake any development beyond Excel formula-level tasks.\n\nCurrent environment. Bicycle manufacturing\n\n• Bicycle models are measured and reported against how well a single model performs as a sum of all the variations of that model. For example, the Street Kid YOLO model sold 25,000 units in 2019 across all variations of the product, but the Purple Female frame made up 30 percent of that model's sales.\n• The Street Kid YOLO models sell in different volumes depending on the market.\n• The creation of production orders for bicycles occurs monthly and is based on historical sales.\n• Each part of a bicycle’s assembly occurs at a different station in the Adventure Works production facility.\n• A piece of paper that has eight sections accompanies a bicycle throughout the manufacturing process. As each step is completed, the respective section is completed and signed off by a production worker.\n• The completed paper is used in the put-away process by the warehouse workers.\n\n\nCurrent environment. Financials -\n\n• The standard model and limited-edition bicycle teams are separate operating units within the manufacturing division. Financials are tracked and reported separately even though they are produced and sold in the same sales channels.\n• Updates to the standard model bicycle models are created when a part for a bicycle becomes unavailable. This can change the cost of the product.\n• An updated model of a bicycle with new parts will be maintained as a new item and have a new price. However, it will look like the exact same product to retailers and distributors.\n\nCurrent environment. Manufacturing process\n\nThe bicycle manufacturing process is shown in the following graphic:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nCurrent environment.
