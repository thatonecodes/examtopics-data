The Woodgrove Bank headquarters is in California and has 450 office workers. The office workers include financial advisors, customer service representatives, finance clerks, and IT personnel.\n\nCurrent environment. Bank applications\n\n• An application named Banker Desktop. The branch employees use this desktop app to review business transactions and to perform core banking updates.\n• An application named Member Management System. This application is a custom customer relationship management (CRM) that integrates with other systems by using an API interface.\n• An application named Fraud Finder. This application is a mission-critical, fraud management application that runs on the employees' desktops. The bank has experienced challenges integrating the application with other systems and is expensive to support.\n• SharePoint Online provides an employee intranet as well as a member document management system that includes polices, contracts, statements, and financial planning documents.\n• Microsoft Excel is used to perform calculations and run macros. Branch employees may have multiple Microsoft Excel workbooks open on their desktop simultaneously.\n\nCurrent environment. Bank devices\n\n• All supervisors are provided with a mobile device that can be used to access company email and respond to approval requests.\n• All branch employees and supervisors are provided with a Windows workstation.\n\nRequirements. New member enrollment\n\nWoodgrove Bank requires new members to sign up online to start the onboarding process. The bank requires some manual steps to be performed during the onboarding process.\n\nFirst step:\n• Members complete an online Woodgrove Bank document and email the PDF attachment to the bank’s shared mailbox for processing.\nSecond step:\n• Members are asked to provide secondary identification to their local branch, such as a utility bill, to validate their physical address.\n• Branch staff scan the secondary identification in English or Spanish using optical character recognition (OCR) technology.\nThird step:\n• A branch supervisor approves the members’ application from their mobile device.\n• Only supervisors are authorized to complete application approvals.\nFourth step:\n• Data that is received from applications must be validated to ensure it adheres to the bank's naming standards.\nThe bank has the following requirements for the members’ data:\n• New members must be enrolled by using the document automation solution.\n• Member data is subject to regulatory requirements and should not be used for non-business purposes.\n• A desktop workflow is required to retrieve member information from the Member Management System on-demand or by using a cloud flow.\n\n\nRequirements. Bank fees -\n\nThe process for calculating bank fees include:\n• using a shared Excel fee workbook with an embedded macro, and\n• an attended desktop flow that is required to automate the fee workbook process. The flow should open an Excel workbook and calculate the members' fees based on the number of products.\n\n\nRequirements. Fraud detection -\n\nThe bank has the following requirements to minimize fraud:\n• Branch employees must use the Fraud Finder application during onboarding to validate a member’s identity with other third-party systems.\n• Branch employees must be able to search for a member in the Fraud Finder application by using a member's full name or physical address.\n• If fraudulent activity is identified, a notification with member details must be sent to the internal fraud investigation team.\n\n\nRequirements. Technical -\n\nThe bank has the following technical requirements:\n\n\nFlows -\n• The Fraud Finder application uses a custom connector with Power Automate to run fraud checks.\n• The application approval process triggers a cloud flow, then starts an attended desktop flow on the branch employee s workstation and completes the approval.\n• The banker desktop flow runs using the default priority\n• An IT administrator is the co-owner of the banker desktop flow.\n• The IT department will be installing the required OCR language packs.\n• The Extract text with OCR action is used to import the members' secondary identification\n\n\nMember Management System -\n• A secure Azure function requires a subscription key to retrieve members’ information.\n• Production flows must connect to the Member Management System with a custom connector. The connector uses the Azure function to perform programmatic retrievals, creates, and updates.\n• The host URL has been added to the custom connector as a new pattern.\n• A tenant-level Microsoft Power Platform data loss prevention (DLP) policy has been created to manage the production environment.\n• A developer creates a desktop flow to automate data entry into a test instance of the Member Management System.\n• A developer creates an on-demand attended desktop flow to connect to a data validation site and retrieve the most current information for a member.\n\n\nBanker desktop application -\n• A banker desktop flow is required to update the core banking system with other systems.\n• When a transaction is complete, the branch employee submits the request by using a submit button.\n• After submitting the request, an instant cloud flow calls an unattended desktop flow to complete the core banking update.\n• The banker desktop flow must be prioritized for all future transactions.\n\n\nDeployment & testing -\n• Development data must be confined to the development environment until the data is ready for user acceptance testing (UAT).\n• The production environment in SharePoint Online must connect to the development instance of the Member Management System.\n• Developers must be able to deploy software every two weeks during a scheduled maintenance window.\n• The banker desktop flow must continue to run during any planned maintenance.\n• The fraud custom connector requires a policy operation named EscalateForFraud with a parameter that uses the members' full name in the request.\n\n\nScalability -\n• The bank requires a machine group to distribute the automation workload and to optimize productivity.\n• The IT administrator needs to silently register 20 new machines to Power Automate and then add them to the machine group.\n\n\nSecurity -\n• The IT administrator uses a service principal account for machine connection.\n• The IT administrator has the Desktop Flow Machine Owner role.\n\n\nIssues -\n\nA branch staff member reports the document automation solution is not processing new members’ data and emails are not being sent for approvals.\n\nAn IT administrator reports that the banker desktop flow has become unresponsive from data that is queued in another flow.\n\n\nCode -\n\nA Power Automate developer created the following script for the Member Management System desktop flow:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nYou need to choose the two optical character recognition (OCR) engines that are able to extract text from the members' secondary identification.\n\nWhich two OCR technologies achieve this goal?

Define a base URL\n\nExplanation: Defining a base URL allows you to set a common part of the URL that is shared across all requests. This is useful for handling the dynamic subdirectory path as part of the base URL.\nC. Define a policy\n\nExplanation: Policies in a custom connector allow you to define rules or behaviors for requests. You can use policies to handle dynamic elements, such as headers or parameters, that may change based on the dynamic subdirectory path.\nOptions A and D are not directly related to handling dynamic subdirectory paths in the context of a host URL for API requests.
