Azure Table Storage supports delegation for basic filtering and sorting operations. We don't expect something super complex in terms of sorting and filtering in the Canvas app from the users, right? SQL Server does not fully support delegation for all functions. Additionally Azure Table Storage is is designed for scalability and can handle large datasets, which is one of the conditions (large sets of records).
