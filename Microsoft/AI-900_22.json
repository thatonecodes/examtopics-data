Here are the reasons why each option is appropriate or not:\n\nA. Analyze video content: This is not correct because analyzing video content typically involves computer vision techniques, not NLP.\n\nB. Generate speech: While generating speech can be related to NLP (e.g., text-to-speech systems), it is more directly associated with speech synthesis and not purely NLP.\n\nC.
