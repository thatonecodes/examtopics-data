Azure Functions allow you to run small pieces of code (called \"functions\") without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. They are serverless, meaning you only pay for the compute time consumed during execution, which makes them cost-effective for tasks that run periodically or are triggered by events. In this case, you can schedule the Azure Function to run the PowerShell script every hour.

In this case, the PowerShell script can be triggered hourly and run from a central location using the WebJob.\n\nOption A, an Azure logic app, is not the best fit for this scenario since it is a more complex solution that allows you to create workflows using different connectors and services.
