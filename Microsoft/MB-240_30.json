We need to be able to schedule those assets with a technician on a job.\n◦ We also perform our own maintenance on internal assets\n◦ These would not be needed for RS\n\nDesired Functionality. Contract/Agreement Management\n\n• Generate Planned Maintenance jobs 3 months in advance for capacity planning\n• Tickler system to notify customers of expirations\n• Track covered equipment and related entitlements\n\nDesired Functionality. Mobile Technician Capability\n\n• Offline\n• Digitized Inspections\n• Geo-fencing for no-touch arrival and departure\n• \"Uber-like\" functionality, notifying customers when a technician will be arriving\n• Remote Assist functionality to quickly get junior technicians in the field and increasing first time fix rate\n\nDesired Functionality. Scheduling\n\n• Schedule Boards visible to each region\n• Assign resources based on skills and proficiency\n• Visibility to access resources from other regions\n• Drip Scheduling for inspection jobs\n• Scheduling optimization for small jobs\n• Automated crew assignment for installation jobs\n\nDesired Functionality. Returns Management\n\n• RMA's\n◦ Tied to Customer Service\n◦ Track open Returns to reduce part/asset leakage & charge for not returned items\n◦ The biggest issue we face today is that we can't track an item that a customer has returned\n\n• RTV\n◦ Ability to send in-warranty parts back to vendor for credit or exchange\n\n\nDesired Functionality. IoT\n-\n\n• IoT devices will be place on all new and existing equipment.\n• Devices will measure compressor temperature and motor pressure of the equipment.\n• Azure Machine Learning is desired to predict failure based on trends of compressor temperature and pressure readings.\n• Currently, there is no way to capture backflow pressure because it can only be measured during the onsite inspection by a technician.\n• Contoso Compressor would like to capture that value and feed it back to the machine-learning algorithm to better measure performance and predict failure.\n\n\nYou are the lead consultant on a Dynamics 365 Field Service implementation for Contoso Compressor.\n\nOne of your assignments is to set up the system for a technician to create inspections on assets, while working on another job at a customer site.\n\nWhich five actions should you perform in sequence to manage this process? To answer, move the five appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area. Arrange the five actions in the correct order.\n\n//IMG//","timestamp":"2024-10-25 16:44:00"},{"id":"QMtZW533xcHibihMhx80","question_text":"You are in the process of setting up calendars and working hours in Dynamics 365 Field Service.\n\nYou are setting up working hours templates.\n\nWhat are three capabilities of using working hours and calendars in Dynamics 365 Field Service?

A template resource can be assigned to the bookable resource so that the working hours will match.\n\nThis is true. You can assign a working hours template to a bookable resource, ensuring that the working hours defined in the template will apply to the resource.\nC. The same set of working hours can be assigned to multiple resources.\n\nThis is true. A single working hours template can be applied to multiple resources, making it easier to manage scheduling and availability for multiple users or resources.\nE.
