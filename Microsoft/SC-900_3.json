Azure Policy creates a managed identity for each assignment, but must have details about what roles to grant the managed identity. If the managed identity is missing roles, an error is displayed during the assignment of the policy or an initiative. When using the portal, Azure Policy automatically grants the managed identity the listed roles once assignment starts. When using SDK, the roles must manually be granted to the managed identity. The location of the managed identity doesn't impact its operation with Azure Policy."},{"timestamp":"1636202460.0","comment_id":"473454","poster":"nipsey","upvote_count":"12","content":"3.

Remediation is accomplished through remediation tasks that deploy the deployIfNotExists template or the modify operations of the assigned policy on your existing resources and subscriptions, whether that assignment is on a management group, subscription, resource group, or individual resource. \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview\nAzure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to the per-resource, per-policy granularity. It also helps to bring your resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources.","timestamp":"1682346720.0","poster":"zellck","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"786503","upvote_count":"4","poster":"MoneyStacking","content":"Only > is always no","timestamp":"1674562860.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1657626060.0","comment_id":"630500","content":"Appeared on exam 12/07/2022","poster":"johnegil"},{"poster":"AbhiM","timestamp":"1648153980.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"I think answer is correct as per the link given as well.","comment_id":"574654"}],"unix_timestamp":1630360560,"topic":"1","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nFor each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true.
