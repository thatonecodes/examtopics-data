Bonus depreciation must be taken before any other depreciation calculations.\n\nBox 2: Consumption -\nDepreciate a company vehicle based on the number of miles it has traveled.\nIf you set up a depreciation profile for fixed assets and select Consumption in the Method field on the Depreciation profiles page, fixed assets are assigned to the depreciation profile based on their usage. You don't have to set up percentages and intervals on the Depreciation profiles page. After you create a depreciation profile that uses the Consumption method, you can set up the method in various ways.\nIncorrect:\n* When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select 150% reducing balance in the Method field on the Depreciation profiles page, fixed assets that are assigned the depreciation profile are depreciated by the same percentage in each depreciation period. This percentage is calculated based on the service life of the asset. For example, if an asset has a service life of five years, the percentage is calculated as 30 percent (150% ֳ· 5).\n* When you set up a fixed asset depreciation profile and select Straight line service life in the Method field in the Depreciation profiles page, the assets that have this depreciation profile assigned to them are depreciated based on the total service life of the asset. This generally is the same depreciation amount in each depreciation period.\nThe difference in the depreciation amount that is calculated between straight line service life remaining and straight line service life is when there is an adjustment posted to the asset.\nTo set up straight line service life depreciation, you must also select options in the Depreciation year and Period frequency fields in the Depreciation profiles page.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/fixed-assets/bonus-depreciation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/fixed-assets/consumption-depreciation","timestamp":"2022-10-19 10:04:00","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04326/0032900001.jpg"],"discussion":[{"content":"correct\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/fixed-assets/consumption-depreciation\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/fixed-assets/bonus-depreciation","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"698799","timestamp":"1729325040.0","poster":"AliK1i"}],"answer_ET":""},{"id":"McLUB8RzxjaIpdQU9IXK","question_id":259,"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Cost","D":"Investment","E":"Fixed price","C":"Internal","A":"Time and material"},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2022-10-19 21:27:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/85944-exam-mb-310-topic-5-question-16-discussion/","question_text":"A company uses Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Project Operations.\nThe company must be able to estimate the costs of a project and create a fixed asset by using the project cost estimate.\nYou need to ensure that the company can create a fixed asset from a project.\nWhich project type should you use?","answer":"D","exam_id":81,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726337160.0","poster":"AlexMukandila","content":"Selected Answer: D\nInvestment","comment_id":"839227"},{"content":"Correct","timestamp":"1713554820.0","poster":"AliK1i","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"699304"}],"topic":"5","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"Investment -\nInvestment projects are projects that do not produce immediate earnings. They are typically used for long-term internal projects in which the costs have to be capitalized. The following are also true of investment projects:\nOnly costs for items, hours, and expenses can be recorded for an investment project.\nCosts in an investment project are tracked and controlled by using the Project management and accounting Estimate feature.\nInvestment projects can be set up with an optional maximum capitalization limit.\nAs an investment project progresses, you record its costs in WIP accounts, where the costs are held until the project is completed. When the project is eliminated, you transfer the WIP value to a fixed asset, a ledger account, or a new project.\nIncorrect:\n* Time and material\nIn Time and material projects, the customer is billed for all costs that are incurred on a project. These include costs for hours, expenses, items, and fees.\n* Cost project\nLike Investment projects, Cost projects are typically used to track internal projects, and only hours, expenses, and items can be recorded for costs projects. Cost projects are usually of shorter duration than investment projects. Unlike Investment projects, Cost projects cannot be capitalized to balance sheet accounts.\nInstead, their project transactions are posted only to profit and loss accounts.\n* Internal\nInternal projects are used to track costs on a project that is internal to your organization. This type of project can provide a planning tool to manage resource consumption\n* Fixed-price\nThe invoices in fixed-price projects consist of on-account transactions. These projects are invoiced according to a billing schedule that is based on a project contract. Revenue for a fixed-price project can be calculated and posted throughout the project by using the completed percentage method, or when the project is finished, by using the completed contract method. Companies can often benefit from using the value of the work in process 5(WIP) to calculate the degree of completion of a project or group of projects.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/about-project-types","unix_timestamp":1666207620},{"id":"RWOgGhfroAU4bUGnWiNU","unix_timestamp":1666207740,"answer_ET":"AD","discussion":[{"poster":"Milliongiz","content":"A.
