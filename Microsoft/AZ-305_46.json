Premium SKU Azure Container Registry.\n\nAzure Container Registry is a managed Docker registry service used for storing private Docker container images. It's tightly integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and provides streamlined Docker image builds, storage, and retrieval.\n\nThe premium SKU of Azure Container Registry supports several advanced features, including the geo-replication of registries. Geo-replication enables an Azure container registry to function as a single registry, serving multiple regions with multi-master regional registries. This means that when you push an image to your registry, it is available across all geo-replicated regions, which would meet the requirement to automatically replicate updated container images across all Azure regions hosting the AKS clusters.","timestamp":"1688399940.0","upvote_count":"10","comments":[{"comment_id":"952325","content":"Here's a link to the details: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-registry/","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689421860.0","poster":"NotMeAnyWay"}]},{"timestamp":"1731513420.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","comment_id":"1311422"},{"timestamp":"1677423000.0","comment_id":"822553","poster":"zellck","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-skus\nPremium registries provide the highest amount of included storage and concurrent operations, enabling high-volume scenarios.
