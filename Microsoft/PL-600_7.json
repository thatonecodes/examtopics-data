Although Microsoft AppSource provides a marketplace for third-party solutions, it does not guarantee the uptime of those solutions. The uptime of each solution listed on AppSource depends on the solution itself and the infrastructure it is hosted on.\n\nOption B, \"Azure Active Directory federated single sign-on (AAD federated SSO)\", is also not a benefit of using Microsoft AppSource. While AppSource supports Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication, it does not specifically offer AAD federated single sign-on as a benefit.
