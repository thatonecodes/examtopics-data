When you create a quality order, the quantity that you specify for an item is blocked. The sampling plan that is associated with a quality order controls only the quantity of items that must be inspected, not the quantity that is blocked.

Your explanation is correct that it will block the inventory if the sampling plan is set up that way.\n\nThe reason why this Solution for the question is wrong is that the requirement is to block inventory.
