Modify the address space used by VNET1.\n\n- Even if we have resources connected to one of our subnets (VM1) we are able to resize it. \n\nB. Modify the address space used by Subnet1.\n\n- This is not possible, as VM1 is connected to Subnet1 and we therefor can't change the address space anymore.\n\nC. Create a subnet named GatewaySubnet on VNET1.\n\n- This would be the first step when creating a VPN GW. \n\nD. Create a local network gateway.\n\n- This would be the second preparation step. But we first need to create a GatewaySubnet. So this point can be ruled out IMHO. \n\nE. Delete Subnet1.\n\n- We can't delete the subnet, as we have VM1 connected to it.
