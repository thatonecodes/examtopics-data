No\n\nEnabling automated investigation and response (AIR) alone does not meet the goal. While AIR can investigate and respond to threats, it requires that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is active or that other components of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), are operational.\n\nSince Microsoft Defender Antivirus is in passive mode, it cannot actively scan and detect malicious artifacts that were missed by the third-party antivirus. To achieve the goal, you need to enable EDR in block mode in addition to AIR. EDR in block mode works even when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is in passive mode, allowing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to detect and remediate threats that the third-party antivirus missed.\n\nThus, simply enabling AIR is not sufficient to protect the devices in this scenario.","timestamp":"1735591080.0","poster":"Shingie","comment_id":"1334402","upvote_count":"3"}],"comment_id":"1333946","poster":"Madzius","timestamp":"1735542180.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCould someone explain if this answer is correct"}],"unix_timestamp":1735542180,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","answer":"B","choices":{"B":"No","A":"Yes"},"timestamp":"2024-12-30 08:03:00","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":61,"question_text":"Note: This section contains one or more sets of questions with the same scenario and problem.
