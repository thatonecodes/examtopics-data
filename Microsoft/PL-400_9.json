So it is an old one. \n\nThe provided answer is to add a timeout: This option ensures that if the parts department does not respond within a specified time (e.g., one week), the flow can take appropriate action, such as escalating the request or notifying someone else. This addresses the issue of CustomerC not receiving a response within the expected timeframe.\n\nWhile an approval hierarchy could be part of the solution, it does not specifically handle the timeout scenario.
