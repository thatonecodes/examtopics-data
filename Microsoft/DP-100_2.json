The Replace with median option replaces missing values in a dataset with the median value of the corresponding column. This method of imputing missing values can provide a good balance between preserving the overall distribution of the data and avoiding the introduction of extreme values. By using the Clean Missing Data module with the Replace with median option, you can help ensure that your dataset is cleaned and ready for use in creating a machine learning model, satisfying the requirements.","timestamp":"1727337900.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/clean-missing-data#bkmk_ReplaceMissing\n\n- Replace using MICE (Multivariate Imputation using Chained Equations)\n- Custom substitution value\n- Replace with mean\n- Replace with median: Calculates the column median value, and uses the median value as the replacement for any missing value in the column.

The median is a suitable option for replacing missing values in numerical features because it's less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean.\n\nBy choosing this option, the module will identify columns with missing values and replace those missing values with the median value of each respective column. This can help maintain the integrity of your dataset and ensure that your machine learning model receives meaningful input data.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the choice of replacement strategy can also depend on the nature of your data and the specific requirements of your machine learning problem. It's always a good practice to assess the impact of different imputation methods on your model's performance to find the best strategy for your particular case.","poster":"mefor","timestamp":"1692019980.0","comment_id":"980825","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nWe simply dont have enough information about the dataset to know if Median substitution will work, so the answer is No","timestamp":"1686248760.0","poster":"endeesa","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"918568"},{"poster":"ManuelHenriques","content":"Selected Answer: B\nYou should not assume that it is correct to use median if you don't know if data is continuous or not so B","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1677498360.0","comment_id":"823615"},{"content":"Replace with median: Calculates the column median value, and uses the median value as the replacement for any missing value in the column.\n\nApplies only to columns that have Integer or Double data types.
