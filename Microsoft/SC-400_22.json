By excluding the folder path, the sensitive documents will be protected while allowing Tailspin to access other files. This solution will block Tailspin from accessing sensitive documents on the computers without preventing the application from accessing other documents, which is the goal.\n\nIt is important to note that this solution relies on the assumption that the sensitive documents are stored in a specific folder and that Tailspin has access to that folder.
