The process of an assignment includes the creation of resources, and you have to have a subscription to hold actual resources (i.e. - a mgmt group, unto itself, cannot hold resources). Also, the idea that \"subscription owners will have permission to change/delete the Blueprint assignment\"....that's only true if you use DON'T LOCK as the resource locking mode (which is the default, but that is under the control the assignee). Plus if you use the portal, subscription is the only option to do an assignment.
