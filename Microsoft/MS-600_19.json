They are used in a very similar way to bots: you @mention them on a chat or channel, and then type your message. The difference is that when you send the message, it will go directly to the external system or service (e.g., your HR system). There isn't a custom-built bot background service in between. The external service then completes a task based on the message and can reply back to the user in Teams.\nNote: If you are just looking for a simple way of integrating an existing external system to Teams, webhooks can offer you a very quick and easy solution for that.\nThere are three different types of webhooks:\n✑ Outgoing webhooks (for sending a message from Teams to an external system\n✑ Incoming webhooks (for sending a message from an external system to Teams)\n✑ Connectors (productized/packaged webhooks by you, Microsoft or third parties)\nReference:\nhttps://laurakokkarinen.com/how-we-can-extend-teams-with-custom-apps-the-non-technical-explanation/","unix_timestamp":1663828140,"question_id":91,"choices":{"B":"Add an Adaptive Card-based task module to a tab.","C":"Add an incoming webhook to the Microsoft Teams bot.","D":"Add an outgoing webhook to the Microsoft Teams bot.","A":"Specify the command for the extension in the manifest file."},"answer_images":[],"exam_id":108},{"id":"P8xJpt79Tz8veIHqS0MQ","timestamp":"2022-10-06 21:30:00","choices":{"A":"The bot must be granted admin access to the users.","B":"The Teams app must be added for each user.","D":"The bot must be approved in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).","C":"The users must send at least one message to the bot."},"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1665084600,"question_id":92,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/84552-exam-ms-600-topic-4-question-32-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_description":"A proactive message is any message sent by a bot that isn't in response to a request from a user.
