This sounds promising, as demand forecast details allow you to view or adjust specific forecast lines. However, it’s a more granular action that assumes a forecast already exists. It’s not the primary step for enabling the automatic creation of planned orders in master planning—it’s more of a refinement tool.\nThe best action to start with is C.

This shift aligns firming more closely with when the order needs to begin (e.g., procurement or production start) rather than when it's needed, factoring in lead times more explicitly. In the Legacy Planning Engine, automatic firming is based on the requirement date (end date of the planned order).

Master planning is the built-in, standard engine, while Planning Optimization is an optional, more advanced upgrade. The question doesn’t specify that you’re using add-ons, and \"master planning\" is the foundational term. Master planning’s firming time fence can be configured to firm orders automatically based on the order date, meeting your requirement directly. Planning Optimization enhances this but isn’t necessary unless specified. The question emphasizes a planning engine with automatic firming, D. Master planning is the most straightforward and universally applicable choice. It’s the default engine and supports your needs without assuming additional tools.","poster":"globeearth","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740496620.0"},{"poster":"pu22","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"922297","timestamp":"1718288460.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC for Planning Optimization"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is the correct answer, with planning optimization, Auto-firming is based on the order date (start date).

Intra-class conversions, however, are for units within the same class (e.g., metric tons to kilograms, both weight).
