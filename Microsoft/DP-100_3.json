You should consider configuring the use of Azure Notebooks.\n\nExplanation:\nAzure Notebooks is a free service that provides Jupyter notebooks that are hosted in the cloud. The service allows users to write and execute Python (among other languages) code in their browsers without the need for any configuration or installation of software on the local machine. This makes it an ideal solution for scenarios where learners do not have administrator permissions to install software and cannot access Azure subscriptions directly.
