So let me explain few things. Duration value is only used for data range - how much data autoscaling system has to aggregate to determine if rule applies or not. Cooldown - how much time has to pass before next autoscale operation to trigger. So once you start you app the first autoscale may happen not earlier than after duration value (because you need specific data range). Each next will happen every cooldown value. So:\n- first scale out will happen after 10 minutes (duration value)\n- next scale out will happen after 15 minutes (+5 minutes of cooldown)\nTherefore answer for first question is 3 instances\n\nSecond one is simpler.

When it's said \"Cooldown - how much time has to pass before next autoscale operation to trigger\", the correct term is: \"Cooldown - how much time has to pass before next RULE CHECK to DETERMINE IF ANOTHER AUTOSCALE OPERATION WILL trigger\". Imagine the scenario that it's 80% cpu for 14 minutes and 69% for 1 minute. There will be 1 check for rule that results in scale out in minute 10, 5 min cooldown, then on minute 15 there will be another check for the rule, which will consider data range from minute 5 up to minute 15. In this time range will eventually result in an average CPU still greater than 70% (9 minutes 80% + 1 minute 69%).
