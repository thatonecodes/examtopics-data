Set up purchase order multiples for the items.\n\nSetting up purchase order multiples allows you to define specific quantities in which items should be ordered. By setting the purchase order multiples to match the predefined package quantities (12 or 24 in this case), you ensure that customers purchase the products in these quantities. This helps streamline ordering processes and ensures consistency in packaging for customers.","poster":"useradmin"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1134764","timestamp":"1706517480.0","content":"B, because Purchase multiples are only applied on purchase order.
