SharePoint Folder:\n\nSince OneDrive is backed by SharePoint, you can use the SharePoint Folder connector to access the file. The SharePoint connector ensures that the file is accessible and refreshable in Power BI.\nWhy Not the Other Options?\nB. Excel Workbook:\nWhile this connector works for local Excel files, it does not guarantee refreshability when the file is stored in OneDrive.\nC.

Text/CSV:\nThis connector is used for text or CSV files, not for Excel files."},{"poster":"Odidepse","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1337804","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nTested this myself, A is the first obvious answer, you use the 'Excel Workbook' connector and it will grab to a one drive folder as stated on the question Microsoft Excel file in a Microsoft OneDrive folder. The other one is a definite web, as the excel file is on the one drive path and nothing is mentioned on the sharepoint folder, these are the steps that I took: Navigate the excel file stored on one drive, go to file, copy path. Then go to powerbi desktop app, get datasource, use 'web' connector and on the URL section, paste the path. SharePoint folder required root url of the sharepoint, nothing on the question outlines that the excel document is stored on sharepoint.","timestamp":"1736306280.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BE\nB.
