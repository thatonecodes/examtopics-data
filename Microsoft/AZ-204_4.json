Yes\n\nThe solution meets the goal of configuring back-end authentication for the API Management service instance. By configuring Client cert gateway credentials for the Azure resource, you can authenticate and secure the communication between the API Management gateway and the back-end service hosted in the Azure App Service instance.\n\nClient certificate authentication involves using X.509 client certificates to verify the identity of the client requesting access to the API Management gateway. This authentication method ensures that only clients with valid certificates can access the back-end service.\n\nBy configuring Client cert gateway credentials, you establish a secure and authenticated connection between the API Management gateway and the Azure App Service instance, thereby meeting the requirement for back-end authentication.","poster":"BikashKatwal","comment_id":"917665"},{"timestamp":"1684656900.0","poster":"deathRac3","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"903026","content":"Selected Answer: A\nLooks right"},{"timestamp":"1677031140.0","poster":"forgetfulalligator","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen client certificate authentication is used for the API Management gateway, a client must provide a client certificate in the header of each request to access the API. The client certificate is then validated by the gateway before forwarding the request to the back-end API. This can provide a high level of authentication and help prevent unauthorized access to the back-end API.\n\nClient certificate authentication is a more secure mechanism than Basic authentication, as it uses a secure communication channel and cryptographic keys to authenticate clients. Additionally, it provides better scalability, as it does not require the gateway to maintain a large number of user credentials.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"817366"},{"comments":[{"content":"No. They don't have access to official answers.
