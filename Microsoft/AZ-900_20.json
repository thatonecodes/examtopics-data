They can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks, such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information, on to automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. Users converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a sophisticated conversation that intelligently provides access to services.\nBox 2:\nAzure Machine Learning uses past trainings to provide predictions that have high probability.\nMachine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. By using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.\nForecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might want based on what you've bought.\nBox 3:\nAzure Functions provides serverless computing functionalities.\nAzure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.\nBox 4:\nIoT Hub (Internet of things Hub) provides data from millions of sensors.\nIoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud- hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-ml https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nMatch the Azure service to the correct description.\nInstructions: To answer, drag the appropriate Azure service from the column on the left to its description on the right.
