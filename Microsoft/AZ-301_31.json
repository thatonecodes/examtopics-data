Traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher network security group (NSG) flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. With traffic analytics, you can:\n✑ Identify security threats to, and secure your network, with information such as open-ports, applications attempting internet access, and virtual machines (VM) connecting to rogue networks.\n✑ Visualize network activity across your Azure subscriptions and identify hot spots.\n✑ Understand traffic flow patterns across Azure regions and the internet to optimize your network deployment for performance and capacity.\n✑ Pinpoint network misconfigurations leading to failed connections in your network.\n\nBox 2: Azure Service Map -\nService Map automatically discovers application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. With Service Map, you can view your servers in the way that you think of them: as interconnected systems that deliver critical services. Service Map shows connections between servers, processes, inbound and outbound connection latency, and ports across any TCP-connected architecture, with no configuration required other than the installation of an agent.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/service-map","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYour company deploys several Linux and Windows virtual machines (VMs) to Azure.
