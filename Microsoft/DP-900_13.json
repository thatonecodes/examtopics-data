The integration runtime provides the compute environment for executing activities, which are the building blocks of data pipelines in Azure Data Factory.\n\nSSIS packages are a type of data integration solution that can be run on premises or in the cloud. They can be integrated with Azure Data Factory, but they are not a component of the Data Factory compute environment. A control flow is a logical representation of the steps that are required to execute a workflow, and a pipeline is a collection of activities that are organized into a workflow. While both of these components are important for building data pipelines in Azure Data Factory, they do not provide the compute environment for executing activities.","comment_id":"835601","poster":"Azurre","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"830506","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Kseetha","timestamp":"1693959840.0","content":"Ans: B (an Integration runtime)"},{"comment_id":"586223","timestamp":"1665817620.0","poster":"RichMelbourne","upvote_count":"3","content":"Shown on test 15/04/2022"}],"answer":"B","question_text":"Which Azure Data Factory component provides the compute environment for activities?","choices":{"B":"an integration runtime","A":"SSIS packages","C":"a control flow","D":"a pipeline"},"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1635422640,"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":73,"question_id":61,"timestamp":"2021-10-28 14:04:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"The Integration Runtime (IR) is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory to provide the following data integration capabilities across different network environments:\n✑ Data Flow\n✑ Data movement\n✑ Activity dispatch\n✑ SSIS package execution\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-integration-runtime"},{"id":"TDInJ7eVaNgZgju5qeWq","exam_id":73,"answer_ET":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/49668-exam-dp-900-topic-1-question-155-discussion/","question_id":62,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1633734780.0","comment_id":"331595","content":"Correct!","poster":"Drummer","upvote_count":"18"},{"poster":"seeyainthecloud","timestamp":"1690371780.0","comment_id":"788765","content":"Paginated \n\np as in printing\na as in archiving \n\nthank me later","upvote_count":"13","comments":[{"timestamp":"1696829520.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"865306","content":"thank you now :-)","poster":"Pranava_GCP"}]},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1163398","timestamp":"1725178260.0","poster":"AGTraining","content":"Paginated reports"},{"upvote_count":"5","poster":"mamahani","timestamp":"1697109420.0","content":"I took the exam 12.04.2023; this question appeared,correct answer\npaginated report","comment_id":"868247"},{"comment_id":"452912","poster":"AzureDP900","timestamp":"1648426680.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"This is correct answer!"},{"content":"Paginated reports","comment_id":"423779","timestamp":"1644694080.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Marcin118"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1641313800.0","comment_id":"398439","content":"100% Correct!!","poster":"Anasuya"}],"isMC":false,"answer":"","answer_description":"Paginated Reports in Power BI now allows users to generate these fixed-layout documents optimized for printing and archiving, such as PDF and Word files.\nThese document-style reports with visualizations that provide additional control, like which tables expand horizontally and vertically to display all their data and continue from page to page as needed.\nReference:\nhttps://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-paginated-reports-in-power-bi-general-availability/","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04277/0016500001.jpg"],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04277/0016500002.jpg"],"timestamp":"2021-04-09 01:13:00","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nTo complete the sentence, select the appropriate option in the answer area.\nHot Area:\n//IMG//","unix_timestamp":1617923580,"topic":"1","answers_community":[]},{"id":"7eyixQpHGe3SMUntQuXg","question_text":"What are two uses of data visualization?
