Review the attributes where a semantic type is automatically identified. These attributes are listed under Review mapped fields. Only attributes with the same type can be combined in the Unified customer fields step. Semantic types are used to automatically suggest insights. Ensure the types you chose are consistent across all the selected entities.\n\n5. For attributes that aren't automatically mapped to a semantic type, select a semantic type field, enter your custom attribute-type name, or leave them unmapped. These attributes are listed under Define the data in the unmapped fields.","poster":"Iker","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"640419"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1666642860.0","poster":"rbsound","content":"Should be C, D","comment_id":"591224"}],"topic":"2","question_id":36,"exam_id":79,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/74366-exam-mb-260-topic-2-question-4-discussion/","answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"IXI79tFBtU96HNNwnALo","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"You can add additional entities to the data source using Get Data functionality in the Power Query.","B":"Power Query automatically recognizes header rows in files when you use the Text/CSV connector.","C":"After you save a Power Query data source, you have to manually trigger the initial refresh process.","A":"You must create a separate Power Query data source for each entity you wish to ingest."},"question_images":[],"question_text":"You are a Customer Data Platform Specialist.
