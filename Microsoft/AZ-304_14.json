Industrial machines, automobiles, medical equipment, cameras, household appliances, airplanes, vending machines and toys are among the myriad possible hosts of embedded systems.\n\nBox 2: Client Credentials -\nHow to include additional client data\nIn case you need to store additional details about a client that don't fit into the standard parameter set the custom data parameter comes to help:\n\nPOST /c2id/clients HTTP/1.1 -\n\nHost: demo.c2id.com -\n\nContent-Type: application/json -\nAuthorization: Bearer ztucZS1ZyFKgh0tUEruUtiSTXhnexmd6\n{\n\"redirect_uris\" : [ \"https://myapp.example.com/callback\" ],\n\"data\" : { \"reg_type\" : \"3rd-party\",\n\"approved\" : true,\n\"author_id\" : 792440 }\n}\nThe data parameter permits arbitrary content packaged in a JSON object.

The state parameter preserves some state object set by the client in the Authorization request and makes it available to the client in the response.\nReference:\nhttps://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/04/10/oauth-authorization-code-grant-type https://connect2id.com/products/server/docs/guides/client-registration","exam_id":53,"isMC":false,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2021-04-30 23:04:00"},{"id":"VyUChnsXNXluqgKO7Tdf","timestamp":"2021-05-31 19:58:00","answer_ET":"A","question_id":70,"topic":"2","answer_description":"The Network Watcher Network performance monitor is a cloud-based hybrid network monitoring solution that helps you monitor network performance between various points in your network infrastructure.

The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen,\nIP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.\nIP flow verify looks at the rules for all Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to the network interface, such as a subnet or virtual machine NIC. Traffic flow is then verified based on the configured settings to or from that network interface. IP flow verify is useful in confirming if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview","unix_timestamp":1622483880,"exam_id":53,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer":"A","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/53982-exam-az-304-topic-2-question-49-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1634631660.0","comment_id":"464547","upvote_count":"16","poster":"sharepoint_Azure_pp","content":"This was there as 2nd set of 3 Y/N question.\nAzure network watcher is correct \nChoose the same cleared with 900 on 17th October 2021"},{"upvote_count":"6","poster":"pentium75","comment_id":"427188","comments":[{"comment_id":"511030","content":"Valid observation.","poster":"examineezer","timestamp":"1640690580.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"I think it's clearly \"Yes\" what they are after.
