Custom connector is the recommended option to integrate the Microsoft Power Platform solution with the API hosted on Azure. \n\nCustom connectors are a way to extend the Power Platform by creating connectors to any RESTful API. The Power Platform provides an easy way to create custom connectors that can be used across Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI. With a custom connector, you can define the API endpoint, specify authentication details, and map the API response to Power Platform data structures. This will allow you to create flows and apps that leverage the API data and capabilities."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741035420.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB correct","poster":"ajelizi","comment_id":"1364585"},{"comment_id":"1228704","poster":"wsjones","timestamp":"1718148480.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nGoing with Parth91 as the explanation is spot on!","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"962160","timestamp":"1690242300.0","poster":"pedsab","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"765599","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAgree with B","timestamp":"1672834440.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Edi41"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"758780","timestamp":"1672158420.0","content":"agree custom connector","poster":"rayista"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Brooklyn_Itself","timestamp":"1668098400.0","comment_id":"715392","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCustom connector.
