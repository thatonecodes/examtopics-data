I just did a POC in a VM with latest version of Dynamics On-premise installed. If you update the last name and the username of a user in the Active Directory and then you update or change the username of the same user in Dynamics, Dynamics will be able to sync that update with the AD and also update the name of all the records under that user's ownership. So below are the steps that I followed:\n1. Created a new user in AD with username \"fahad.ali\" (Fahad Ali)\n2. Added the user in Dynamics and assigned a role\n3. :Logged in with fahad.ali and Created a Contact. The owner of this record is now Fahad Ali\n4. Changed the last name to Liu in AD and also updated the logon username to \"fahad.liu\"\n5. Opened the user record in dynamics and changed the login name to \"domain\\fahad.liu\"\npressed tab\n6. Dynamics pulled the updated Last Name \"Liu\" in the Full name field\n7. Saved the user record. \n8. Opened the Contacts view and checked the owner name of the Contact that was created in step 3 above.

You cannot make changes to the username as it will go out of sync with the AD and you will not be able to save the record if the username is wrong or doesn't matches the AD record, or it will point to a different user if any such user is found in the AD. I am not sure of the scenario that if a new user is created in the AD for Elizabeth with the latest Last Name and can we make changes in the user name of an existing user in Dynamics with out creating a new user. \nFor me, a more logical thing to do will be do update the last name of Elizabeth's user in Dynamics.
