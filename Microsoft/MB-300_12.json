This placeholder step doesn't appear when the task guide is viewed, and it isn't run during maintenance of a recording. It's used only by the Regression suite automation tool (RSAT) or the X++ code generator that enables an X++ test to be created from a task recording. When the code generator creates an X++ test, it automatically adds a method stub to the generated code. The developer can then add X++ code into this method stub. The automated code will call the validation when the generated test is run at the point in the recording where this placeholder was added.\nNote: The project manager is concerned that a critical field must have validation scripts run against it during automated testing. The developers will be required to write the custom validation script. The user creating the test script must document the step in the test script that the specific validation script must be run for the developers.\n\nBox 2: Task Recorder Edit Step -\nNote: The developers will be required to write the custom validation script.\n\nEnriching steps in a recording -\nThere are various options for enriching a step in a recording. For example, you can adjust the text that is associated with a step and add information about a specific step. This section describes the step enrichment capabilities that are available. To access these options, click the Edit step button on a specific step of a recording.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/user-interface/task-recorder","topic":"15","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1689624480.0","poster":"Newb007","comment_id":"954583","content":"Add developer placeholder\n\"Add developer placeholder lets the user add a placeholder step to the list of recorded steps.

Funnel: The funnel is a visual representation of a sales or marketing process that shows the conversion rates at each stage. While funnels can be useful in analyzing sales pipelines, they are not directly related to configuring the customer service representative's screen. The requirements in the case study do not mention the need for a funnel feature for customer service representatives, so option A is not applicable.\n\nE. Security: Security is an important aspect of any system configuration, including Dynamics 365. However, in the context of configuring the customer service representative's screen, security is not one of the specific features that need to be configured. The case study mentions that security needs to be applied to the customer service reps as a group and not at the individual level. This indicates a broader security configuration rather than a specific feature for the representative's screen. Therefore, option E is not directly related to configuring the screen for customer service representatives.","poster":"rspl382"},{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1673843040.0","content":"Selected Answer: ADE\nI don't think the question mentioned the sales representatives need any sort of reporting.
