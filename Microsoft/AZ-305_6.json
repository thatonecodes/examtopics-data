Entitlement management allows delegated non-admins to create access packages that external users from other organizations can request access to. One and multi-stage approval workflows can be configured to evaluate requests, and provision users for time-limited access with recurring reviews. Entitlement management enables policy-based provisioning and deprovisioning of external accounts.\n\nNote: Access Packages -\nAn access package is the foundation of entitlement management.
