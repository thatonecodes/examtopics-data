This is because in the context of the Azure Machine Learning environment, the build parameter is used to specify the configuration for building the environment, including specifying the Docker image to be used.\nC. build: This is the correct parameter. Within the Environment class in SDK v2, the build parameter is used to define the build context, which includes specifying the Docker image.
