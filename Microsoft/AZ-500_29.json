Security groups are used to group users and devices, not applications. The relationship between security groups and enterprise applications works in the opposite direction:\nSecurity groups (with assigned membership) can be added to enterprise applications for access control.\nUsers and devices can be assigned to security groups.\nEnterprise applications can then use these security groups to manage access.\nThis approach allows for more efficient management of application access by grouping users and devices, rather than adding applications to groups.
