It's not a logical network on the switch. The SLB uses the pool of addresses and assigns /32 networks for tenant workloads. On the switch routing table, these /32 IPs are advertised as an available route via BGP. This network contains the external-accessible or public IP addresses. The Azure Stack infrastructure reserves the first 31 addresses from this public VIP network while the remainder is used by tenant VMs. The network size on this subnet can range from a minimum of /26 (64 hosts) to a maximum of /22 (1022 hosts).

When you register Azure Stack Hub, you provide credentials for an account that's an owner of the subscription. The account you use to register Azure Stack Hub can be different from the admin account that you use for deployment. Furthermore, the two accounts do not need to belong to the same domain; you can deploy using the tenant that you already use. For example, you can use ContosoCSP.onmicrosoft.com, then register using a different tenant; for example, IURContosoCSP.onmicrosoft.com. Remember to sign in using ContosoCSP.onmicrosoft.com when you perform daily Azure Stack Hub administration. You sign in to Azure using IURContosoCSP.onmicrosoft.com when you need to perform registration operations.\nCSP subscriptions\nCSP subscriptions are the preferred choice for registration when a CSP reseller or an end customer operates Azure Stack Hub.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/manage-usage-billing-azure-stack-hub/5-usage-bill-multitenant-scenarios","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Eltooth","timestamp":"1643680680.0","comment_id":"537579"},{"timestamp":"1617420420.0","content":"A is the right answer.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Sjn9","comment_id":"327141"}]}],"exam":{"name":"AZ-600","id":57,"numberOfQuestions":59,"isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"provider":"Microsoft","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":6},"__N_SSP":true}
