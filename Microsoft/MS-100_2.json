Yes\n\nPass-through authentication and seamless SSO with password hash synchronization is a solution that enables users to authenticate to on-premises resources using the same credentials they use for cloud resources. This solution can be used to authenticate users with smart card-based certificates and also permits the use of SSO to connect to on-premises and Microsoft 365 services.\nPass-through authentication allows users to authenticate directly against on-premises Active Directory and Seamless SSO automatically signs in users when they are on their corporate devices connected to the corporate network.\nPassword hash synchronization syncs a hash of the users’ on-premises AD password with Azure AD, enabling SSO experience for cloud services.\n\nSo overall the solution meets the goal by allowing sign in via smart card-based certificates and also permitting the use of SSO to connect to on-premises and Microsoft 365 services.","comment_id":"788493","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"RiTh73","timestamp":"1645708740.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect","comment_id":"555284"},{"content":"answer is correct","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Davidchercm","comment_id":"424746","timestamp":"1628937660.0"}],"question_id":6,"exam_id":98,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-08-14 12:41:00","answer_description":"References:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-ad-choose-authn","choices":{"A":"Yes","B":"No"},"answer":"A","answer_images":[]},{"id":"XRrbe5K9UFlmTevXeywc","choices":{"B":"The users with the Security administrator and the User administrator roles.","C":"The users with the Password administrator and the Security administrator roles.","D":"The user with the Password administrator role only.","A":"The users with the Password administrator and the User administrator roles."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/63335-exam-ms-100-topic-1-question-15-discussion/","exam_id":98,"question_id":7,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1633080720.0","upvote_count":"32","comment_id":"455448","content":"A is correct\n\nHelpDesk Admins\n • Reset password - users only\n • Manage service requests\n • Monitor service health\n\nUser Management Admin\n • Reset passwords\n • Monitor service health\n • Add/delete user accounts - users only\n • Manage service reqeusts\n\nSecurity and Compliance\n • Archiving\n ○ Enable / disable users' archive mailboxes\n • DLP\n ○ Create DLP policies - protect sensitive info \n ○ Prevent inadvertent disclosure\n • Device management\n ○ Create policies to manage devices\n • Permissions\n ○ Grant explicit permissions as required\n • Retention\n ○ Create retention policies\n • Auditing and investigation\n ○ Alerts and monitoring\n ○ Audit logs","comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference","poster":"xofowi5140","timestamp":"1634294820.0","comment_id":"462540","upvote_count":"2"}],"content":"Good information and resources..
