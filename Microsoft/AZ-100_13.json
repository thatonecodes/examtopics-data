In this section, you will perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g., copy and paste, ability to navigate to external websites) will not be possible by design.\nScoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for that task.\nLabs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam in the time provided.\nPlease note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be able to return to the lab.\n\nTo start the lab -\nYou may start the lab by clicking the Next button.\nYou plan to allow connections between the VNET01-USEA2 and VNET01-USWE2 virtual networks.\nYou need to ensure that virtual machines can communicate across both virtual networks by using their private IP address.

When connecting VNets from different subscriptions, the subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.\nConfiguring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a good way to easily connect VNets. Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet connection type (VNet2VNet) is similar to creating a Site-to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both function the same way when communicating.\nThe local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order to route traffic.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1599099600,"exam_id":42,"topic":"4","choices":{"D":"Move VM1 to Subscription2.","A":"Move VNet1 to Subscription2.","C":"Provision virtual network gateways.","B":"Modify the IP address space of VNet2."},"answer_ET":"C","question_id":62,"question_text":"You have two subscriptions named Subscription1 and Subscription2.
