Select Add Exiting > Automation > Dataflow.\nNote: A typical use case is for an independent software vendor (ISV) to develop a solution containing a dataflow, that extracts and transforms data from a data source to Dataverse tables, in a sandbox environment. The ISV would then move that dataflow and destination tables to a test environment to test with their test data source to validate that the solution works well and is ready for production. After testing completes, the ISV would provide the dataflow and tables to clients who will import them into their production environment to operate on client's data. This process is much easier when you add both the dataflows and tables they load data to into solutions, and then move the solutions and their contents between environments.\n\nBox 2: Turn off -\nAfter you create a cloud flow, it's turned on by default.\nAt times, you might want to turn off a cloud flow to prevent it from running.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/dataflows/dataflow-solution-awareness https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/disable-flow"}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"name":"PL-200","numberOfQuestions":296,"isImplemented":true,"id":115,"provider":"Microsoft","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false},"currentPage":30},"__N_SSP":true}
