This process works great if you want to track product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board, or break PBIs and bugs down into tasks on the taskboard.\n\nBox 2: Agile -\nChoose Agile when your team uses Agile planning methods, including Scrum, and tracks development and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the taskboard.\n\nBox 3: CMMI -\nChoose CMMI when your team follows more formal project methods that require a framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.\nIncorrect Answers:\nXP:\nThe work tracking objects contained within the default DevOps processes and DevOps process templates are Basic, Agile, CMMI, and Scrum\nXP (Extreme Programming) and DevOps are different things.

When you save a logic app that starts with a webhook trigger, or when you change your logic app from disabled to enabled, the webhook trigger subscribes to the specified service endpoint by registering a callback URL with that endpoint. The trigger then waits for that service endpoint to call the URL, which starts running the logic app. Similar to the Request trigger, the logic app fires immediately when the specified event happens. The webhook trigger unsubscribes from the service endpoint if you remove the trigger and save your logic app, or when you change your logic app from enabled to disabled.\nFor example, the Office 365 Outlook connector's Send approval email action is an example of webhook action that follows this pattern. \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/connectors-native-webhook","poster":"prashantjoge"}],"timestamp":"1608439080.0","comment_id":"248380","content":"What is confusing is that if we are talking about the type of trigger on the alert is HTTP Webhook but if we are talking the type of trigger on the Logic App Side start with an HTTP trigger.
