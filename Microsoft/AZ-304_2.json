Here is the answer for 4. \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-retention\" User retention analysis for web applications with Application Insights.\nThe retention feature in Application Insights helps you analyze how many users return to your app, and how often they perform particular tasks or achieve goals. For example, if you run a game site, you could compare the numbers of users who return to the site after losing a game with the number who return after winning. This knowledge can help you improve both your user experience and your business strategy.","comment_id":"558538","upvote_count":"4","poster":"AD3","timestamp":"1646104380.0"}],"poster":"airairo","content":"I searched again:\n\n1) Azure Log Analytics\n2) Azure Service Map\n3) Azure Application Insights\n4) Azure Application Insights","upvote_count":"79","comment_id":"234745"},{"content":"answer is \nAzure Monitor Logs\\Azure Log Analytics\nAzure Application Insights\nAzure Application Insights\nAzure Application Insights\n\nfollowing is the justification :-\nAzure Monitor Logs\\Azure Log Analytics (whatever option is available in exam for sure both wont come in choice ,if both are present in choice then preffered answer is Azure Monitor Logs.\nAzure Log Analytics :-You can send data about the application and resource usage to Azure Log Analytics.
