In general, it is desired that firewall would block everything that isn't approved. so the idea of that rule is that you create other rules with higher priority ( lower number) which allow specific traffic that you want. for example RDP and internet connections. when traffic comes in it gets evaluated from the top priority to bottom until a rule is found that allows it or denies it in particular. so if there is a rule to allow rdp at the top, the RDP traffic comes in, the NSG goes through the list, finds the RDP rule first and stops reading other rules because it already got a pass. vice versa if there wasnt an RDP rule, the NSG would check all of the rules until it reached DenyALL and deny the connection based on that.\n\nto put it simply, the denyall rule at the end is put in so you wouldn't have to type out a couple of hundred different ports that you want to block and instead would need to allow just a couple of ports that you do actually need"}],"content":"So what exactly is the \"DenyAllInBound\" rule doing?"},{"poster":"Rams_84zO6n","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1680019620.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\n\"Computer1 is connected to the Internet.\" - that threw me off a bit.
