The notification bar shows warnings in cases where, for example, an entity has no forms or views, or the app doesn't contain any components. An error might appear if a site map isn't configured for the app.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nWith Solution checker, you can inspect your code against a set of best practice development rules specific to customizing and extending the CDS for Apps platform. Get access to rich detailed reports listing issues identified, severity, locations, and sometimes the line code, with linkage to detailed prescriptive guidance on how to fix the problem.\nPowerApp Checker checks your solution for any usage of code that was deprecated or any performance or security issues in the code. It checks the plugin code as well as web resources.\nBox 2: Service Performance in Power Apps Analytic\nRegarding Microsoft Power Apps Canvas Driven Apps: for reviewing performance bottlenecks and API calls, admins can leverage the Service Performance report for connection health. Admins can gain insights into the least and best performing services, the mean response time and success rate for connectors and the 50th,\n75th and 95th percentile markers for response time.

SaveData.\n\nExplanation:\nThe SaveData method is used in Power Apps to store data locally on a device, enabling offline functionality. This is particularly useful in scenarios where mobile devices may lose network connectivity, as it allows data to be saved locally and synchronized later when the device reconnects.\n\nHere’s how the methods relate:\n\nSaveData: Stores data locally for offline use.\nupdateView: Updates the user interface when data changes (used in custom PCF components but not for offline storage).\ninit: Initializes the component when it loads.\ngetClient: Retrieves the client type (web, mobile, etc.), but it doesn’t handle offline data storage.\nTherefore, SaveData is the correct method to support offline capabilities.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"KucaStonojka"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nPCF only have updateView and init.

This method is typically used in offline-capable apps to ensure that data is not lost even if the network connection is lost. In this case, since the requirement is to capture multiple values from lab test results on mobile devices, and to ensure that the data is not lost in case of network disconnection, using a \"SaveData\" method would be an appropriate solution.\n\"UpdateView\" is a method that is used to refresh or update the display of the user interface. It is typically used to reflect changes in the data or state of the app, such as changes made by the user or changes received from a server. In this case, \"UpdateView\" would not be an appropriate method for ensuring that the data is saved in case the mobile device loses connection to the network.","timestamp":"1675057320.0","comment_id":"792439","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nbased on comments it's clear that A is not sure","comment_id":"735955","timestamp":"1670246280.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Fyrus"},{"comment_id":"606681","poster":"pkatsa","content":"Selected Answer: B\nin exams 24/5 . savedata was not an option anymore","timestamp":"1653393480.0","upvote_count":"11"},{"poster":"jkaur","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1645111500.0","content":"UpdateView","comment_id":"549484"},{"timestamp":"1631872260.0","comment_id":"446518","upvote_count":"3","poster":"BunkMoreland","content":"Can we not create the canvas app as the interface and then use SaveData ?
