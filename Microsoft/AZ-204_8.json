Azure would distribute the VM across the 20 domain update domains, with each update domain containing three virtual machines. These Fault Domains can hold multiple Update Domain Groups. For Example, Fault Domain 1 could hold Update Domain Group 1 - 6. So if I were to do maintenance to Update domain 1, my clients would still have available for update domains 2 - 6.

The Data Management Gateway tool is not typically used for migrating MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB.\n\nThe correct answer is B. mongorestore.\n\nTo migrate MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB, you can use MongoDB native tools like mongodump and mongorestore. These tools are designed to handle the export and import of MongoDB data efficiently.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729773420.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nGot this on the Microsoft documentation: \"The MongoDB native tools are a set of binaries that facilitate data manipulation on an existing MongoDB instance. Since Azure Cosmos DB exposes an API for MongoDB, the MongoDB native tools are able to insert data into Azure Cosmos DB. The focus of this doc is on migrating data out of a MongoDB instance using mongoexport/mongoimport or mongodump/mongorestore. Since the native tools connect to MongoDB using connection strings, you can run the tools anywhere, however we recommend running these tools within the same network as the MongoDB instance to avoid firewall issues.\"","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727068560.0","poster":"Mol_","comment_id":"1010642"},{"timestamp":"1727068560.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nData Management Gateway: This tool is used for connecting on-premises data sources (like SQL Server) to Azure Analysis Services or Power BI for data visualization and reporting.

This statement is incorrect.\n\nThe Data Management Gateway tool is used to connect on-premises data sources to Azure services, including Power BI, PowerApps, and Microsoft Flow. It provides a secure and reliable connection between on-premises data sources and cloud-based services.\n\nHowever, in the context of migrating MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB, the Data Management Gateway tool is not relevant.
