In practical terms you can open a lot of ports by creating many rules and it will work fine.\n\nThe other, less invasive scenario, with the possibility of maintaining the organization of the logs and even saving copies of the machine's logs. I'm talking about Windows Event Subscription. The stream of events from a source to a collector is called a subscription.\n\nBased on the statement, it is understood that it is necessary to maintain a level of security, the Firewall must be activated.
