Active geo-replication\nActive geo-replication supports the creation of up to four readable secondary replicas within the same or different Azure regions. It provides automatic replication between primary and secondary replicas, and you can initiate failover manually when needed. The recovery time objective (RTO) for active geo-replication is less than 30 seconds, which meets the requirement of a 15-minute RTO.","timestamp":"1680451200.0"},{"upvote_count":"9","content":"\"Azure SQL Database\" and \"Active geo-replication\".\nActive geo-replication covers the first two requirements (multiple read replicas and automatic replication):\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/active-geo-replication-overview?view=azuresql\nPlease see the note which states \"Active geo-replication is not supported by Azure SQL Managed Instance.\"\nAlso in the following page it's stated that the Hyperscale tier can only have one geo-replica:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tier-hyperscale-replicas?view=azuresql&tabs=portal#geo-replica\nSo the tier can only be \"Azure SQL Database\".","timestamp":"1679339940.0","poster":"steel72","comments":[{"comment_id":"845174","upvote_count":"1","poster":"steel72","timestamp":"1679339940.0","content":"Please also check the following page which states that auto-failover groups do not support multiple replicas:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/business-continuity-high-availability-disaster-recover-hadr-overview?view=azuresql#compare-geo-replication-with-failover-groups\nFurthermore the requirements do not state that the failover should be automatic.\n\nAnd the following article which also states that standard geo-replication only supports one replica:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-sql-database-standard-geo-replication/"},{"content":"Agree on this.","poster":"EXzw","comment_id":"847182","timestamp":"1679498160.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"845173"},{"timestamp":"1679223720.0","poster":"malcubierre","comment_id":"843660","content":"Azure SQL Managed Instance + auto-failover groups seems to cover multiple secondary read replicas.... : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/features-comparison?view=azuresql#resource-limits","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1678306620.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"vb3d","content":"Reading all comments and lots of documentation I found that the main hint here is that Auto-failover doesn't support multiple replicas. so must be Azure SQL Database with active geo replication","comment_id":"833350"},{"timestamp":"1677934260.0","content":"I asked Bing AI and it said Azure SQL Managed Instance with auto-failover groups. :)","comment_id":"828933","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]"},{"poster":"SH_22","comments":[{"timestamp":"1676547180.0","content":"Or could be Hyperscale too instead of Azure sql, but I see no specification of big data in the requirements","comment_id":"810592","upvote_count":"1","poster":"SH_22"}],"comment_id":"810587","timestamp":"1676546700.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://youtu.be/oJCwbllnrwY?t=23\n\nfrom this Azure intro video auto failover does not support multiple replicas => its not.\nStandard repl keeps offline copy => its not\nonly active geo-replication is an option which belongs to Azure SQL Premium\nI think MI+Auto-failover group cannot be the choice. \n\nI would go for Azure SQL + active geo-replication"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"808564","poster":"mscbgslt","content":"\" Azure SQL Managed Instance supports one secondary read-only replica.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/read-scale-out?view=azuresql-mi","timestamp":"1676391420.0"},{"comment_id":"808412","timestamp":"1676381280.0","poster":"Blues99","content":"Correct:-\nHyperscale: Named replicas support for up to 30 named replicas (for each primary replica).\n\nSQL Database : Up to four geo-secondaries can be created for a primary. \n\nAzure SQL Managed Instance supports one secondary read-only replica.","upvote_count":"2"},{"comments":[{"poster":"GarryK","comment_id":"799218","timestamp":"1675634760.0","content":"The pb is that the question mix between Databases (DB or MI) and service tier (General Purpose/Standard\nBusiness Critical/Premium\nHyperscale)","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"1 built-in + 1 geo-replica = 2 replicas.
