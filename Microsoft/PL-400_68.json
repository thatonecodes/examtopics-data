By enabling change tracking, you can efficiently check the current inventory status before retrieving the inventory record.\n2. If-Match: Etag.If-Match header with the Etag value when making a PATCH request to update the quantity on the inventory record. This ensures that the update is only applied if the inventory record's Etag (entity tag) matches the one you provide in the request header. If the Etag doesn't match, it means that the inventory record has been modified by someone else since you retrieved it, and the update will fail.

A problem arises when two or more update or delete operations on the same piece of data happen at the same time. This situation could potentially result in data loss. The optimistic concurrency feature provides the ability for your applications to detect whether a table record has changed on the server in the time between when your application retrieved the record and when it tries to update or delete that record.\n\nBox 2: If-Match: Etag -\nUse If-Match and If-None-Match headers with ETag values to check whether the current version of a resource matches the one last retrieved, matches any previous version or matches no version. These comparisons form the basis of conditional operation support. Dataverse provides ETags to support conditional retrievals, optimistic concurrency, and limited upsert operations.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/optimistic-concurrency https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/perform-conditional-operations-using-web-api","answer":"","answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0044600001.png"],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0044500001.png"],"question_id":336,"exam_id":117,"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nAn online store has a custom web page that allows customers to place their orders against a Microsoft Dataverse database that uses custom products.

A webhook is a lightweight HTTP pattern for connecting web APIs and services with a publish-and-subscribe model. Webhook senders notify receivers about events by making requests to receiver endpoints with some information about the events.\nWebhooks enable developers and ISVs to integrate Dataverse data with their own custom code hosted on external services.\n\nBox 2: Azure Service Bus -\nService Bus provides a secure and reliable communication channel between Dataverse runtime data and external, cloud-based line-of-business apps. This capability is especially useful in keeping disparate Dataverse systems or other Dataverse servers synchronized with business data changes.\n\nBox 3: Azure Event hub -\nAzure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored by using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.\nNote: The most popular approaches in Dataverse involve webhooks, Azure messaging (Service Bus, Event Hubs), Azure Logic Apps, or Power Automate.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/why-cds-any-type-app","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1612204800,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0042200001.png"],"answer_ET":"","answer":"","question_id":339,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0042100001.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/43709-exam-pl-400-topic-7-question-2-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"324420","poster":"Puneet80","upvote_count":"36","content":"Correct Answer - Webhook, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hub.\n1. Webhook \n- We know the first one is not Azure service bus because they ask for synchronous. Service Bus is only asynchronous. \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/use-webhooks#create-or-configure-a-service-to-consume-webhook-requests \n2. Azure Service bus \n- Azure Service Bus works for high scale processing, and provides a full queueing mechanism if Common Data Service is pushing many events. Webhook can only scale to the point at which your hosted web service can handle the messages. \n3. Azure Event Hub \n- They want a hybrid.
