A storage access tier.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo reduce the backup storage costs, you can move the backup files from the hot tier to the cool tier or the archive tier of the Azure Blob Storage. These tiers provide lower-cost storage for data that is not frequently accessed.\n\nSo, you should implement a storage access tier to move the HANA backups from hot to the cool tier or the archive tier. By doing this, you can save on storage costs while still retaining the backup copies for one year. A stored access policy is used to grant shared access to your storage account.
