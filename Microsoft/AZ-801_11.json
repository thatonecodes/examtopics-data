So to actually increase the priority of Server2 you *have* to tick it. Otherwise you're *NOT* changing the priority. The question however doesn't state that you tick it. \n\nSo is the question asking if you know this? Or is it assuming that you know that the only way to actually change the priority is to tick them first? \n\nAs it stands, if you assume that you actually change the priority then you have to tick Server2 to do so and the answer is Yes. If you change the Priority order without ticking then it is the same as moving the server up, wont change the order, will leave it without a preferred owner (so it won't fail over to Server1 anyway) but it doesn't fulfil the requirement of *Ensuring* that it won't fail over to Server1 so the answer is No.","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"862426","timestamp":"1680722820.0","poster":"Fastdruid"},{"comment_id":"1352260","content":"Selected Answer: A\nMay be A","poster":"BlackCat9588","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1738829400.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"starseed","timestamp":"1726668000.0","comment_id":"1285767","content":"Correct answer is Yes A"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf server2 has to switch, it will do so whether it is priority or not.

It aligns more closely with the scenario's requirements.\n\nSo, while iWARP could potentially be considered, RoCEv2 is generally the more suitable choice in this scenario because it directly addresses the requirement to eliminate the need for DCB.","timestamp":"1713958920.0","poster":"NazerRazer"}],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"topic":"2","answer":"C","exam_id":61},{"id":"Oe37ULUfQYVXrVuqpY2C","question_id":55,"answer_description":"The Maximum failures setting is used to determine when the cluster determines that a node is offline.
