Since LRS is built specifically for this use case, it can indeed be the right choice for your scenario","poster":"bingomutant","comment_id":"1289582","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727366520.0"},{"timestamp":"1699369740.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1064917","content":"A. Log Replay Service (LRS)\n\nHere's why LRS is suitable for your scenario:\n\nLog Replay Service: This service, also known as Azure Database Migration Service (DMS), supports online migrations with minimal downtime.

Log shipping: While log shipping could be used for migration and would involve less administrative effort than some other methods, it typically incurs more downtime during the cutover to the new environment because it is not as seamless as LRS.\nC. Transactional replication: Transactional replication is generally used for keeping data synchronized across SQL Server instances. It is not designed for one-time database migrations and can be complex to set up for this purpose.\nD. SQL Data Sync: This service is used to synchronize data across multiple SQL databases and is not optimized for one-time migrations of large databases, as it can be slower and less reliable than LRS for this use case.","timestamp":"1699369740.0"},{"timestamp":"1722629940.0","content":"The answer is correct, however\n\"Log Replay Service: This service, also known as Azure Database Migration Service (DMS), \"\nthis is not true, they are different tools","comment_id":"1260017","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Natali"}]},{"poster":"zafara55","upvote_count":"4","content":"Answer A.\nThe Log Replay service LRS is only used with Azure SQL Managed Instance.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/log-replay-service-migrate?view=azuresql-mi&tabs=sas-token","timestamp":"1689686220.0","comment_id":"955455"},{"content":"Answer A.\nLess administrative effort compared to transactional replication\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/log-replay-service-migrate?view=azuresql&tabs=sas-token","timestamp":"1689348540.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"jm2015","comment_id":"951638"},{"comment_id":"950667","content":"C seems right","timestamp":"1689252240.0","poster":"Surjit24","comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"975407","content":"it is A, I've done this a couple of times.","timestamp":"1691487960.0","poster":"testdumps2017"}],"upvote_count":"2"}],"question_text":"You have an on-premises datacenter that contains a 2-TB Microsoft SQL Server 2019 database named DB1.\n\nYou need to recommend a solution to migrate DB1 to an Azure SQL managed instance.
