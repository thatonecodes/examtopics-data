So it basically means if someone already logged into a location (corporate network with USA-based IP range) and now he is logged into a China network then it is likely the user is compromised (assume the organization doesn't have any traffic/record/association with China network). Moreover it is based on geographically distant locations within a time period shorter. So in my example China is too far from USA.\n\n\"Activity from infrequent country\" is a bit different.
