There is really no given order for the actions, plus the solution is not even complete.\n\nCorrect answer are indeed steps 1, 5, 2, however the order is speculative. You can exchange these steps however you like and as long as you do all of them, it will work. The question even misses one last step, which is creating a an extension for the menu item, that references the controller class (it must reference our controller extension class).. Plus in step 1 we should rename (best to add some suffix) the report, so we can distinguish it from the original one, so we can make the controller point to this duplicate.\n\nHowever I would settle with following order:\n1 (Duplicate report [+ rename it?] and add the desired field), \n5 (Extend the DP class, fill the value there),\n2 (Extend the Controller class and make it point to our (duplicated) report)","comment_id":"246257","upvote_count":"8"},{"timestamp":"1729063740.0","comment_id":"1298597","content":"Not sure the description corresponds to the possible answers.
