The read scale-out feature allows you to offload read-only workloads using the compute capacity of one of the read-only replicas, instead of running them on the read-write replica. This way, some read-only workloads can be isolated from the read-write workloads, and will not affect their performance. The feature is intended for the applications that include logically separated read-only workloads, such as analytics\"\n\nLetter A mentioned transactional workloads which makes it wrong. Analytical workloads typically use read-only systems that store vast volumes.","poster":"imcee_","comment_id":"192533","timestamp":"1601757660.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"comment_id":"190440","poster":"mgarcia","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1601479980.0","content":"I think it is A"},{"comment_id":"189487","upvote_count":"9","poster":"jackondeck","content":"I will go with A","timestamp":"1601361840.0"},{"poster":"pablokoba","upvote_count":"9","content":"I think the answer is A","comment_id":"188676","timestamp":"1601246520.0"},{"poster":"Dhiva_","upvote_count":"5","content":"C is correct because they state 'in the event of a regional outage'","comment_id":"176793","comments":[{"comment_id":"182923","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1600601580.0","content":"But question does not say that the replica is a part of Always-On schema, does it?","poster":"ZVV"},{"poster":"David_986969","timestamp":"1606246920.0","comment_id":"226919","content":"That is what the answer says not what the questions says, so it could be A","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"1599697320.0"},{"comment_id":"172865","content":"Answer: A,C","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1599158760.0","poster":"SP365"}],"timestamp":"2020-09-03 20:46:00","answers_community":["A (89%)","11%"],"question_id":283,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1599158760,"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"exam_id":73,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/30512-exam-dp-900-topic-1-question-92-discussion/","choices":{"B":"You need to audit the transactional application.","D":"You need to improve the recovery point objective (RPO).","A":"You need to generate reports without affecting the transactional workload.","C":"You need to implement high availability in the event of a regional outage."},"question_text":"You have a transactional application that stores data in an Azure SQL managed instance.\nWhen should you implement a read-only database replica?","question_images":[]},{"id":"PoLOHOdUnknsCmW6XvdR","answer_ET":"","unix_timestamp":1599633720,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/30899-exam-dp-900-topic-1-question-93-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04277/0011000002.png"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"46","poster":"ANath","timestamp":"1634062440.0","comment_id":"334173","content":"correct"},{"content":"Reference Reading: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/clustered-and-nonclustered-indexes-described?view=sql-server-ver15#:~:text=Clustered%20indexes%20sort%20and%20store,stored%20in%20only%20one%20order.","timestamp":"1615279320.0","upvote_count":"19","comment_id":"176313","poster":"jasu"},{"comment_id":"1162655","upvote_count":"2","content":"option D","poster":"AGTraining","timestamp":"1724932980.0"},{"timestamp":"1703600160.0","content":"Was on exam 24/6/2023","poster":"globy118","comment_id":"934402","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1696447620.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Ejake","comment_id":"861443","content":"Correct"},{"timestamp":"1693790520.0","content":"Correct Answer","comment_id":"828618","upvote_count":"2","poster":"chiiiweiii"},{"comment_id":"725123","poster":"SAIVEENA","upvote_count":"12","timestamp":"1684838880.0","content":"4th Option is correct.\n1.Relational databases are static schema so option A is wrong.\n2.data stored as key/value pairs is JSON (semi-structured data)relationalDB are structured data.
