A Power Pages site must be able to handle 100 concurrent external site visitors.\nExplanation: This is a functional requirement because it relates directly to the performance and scalability of the site. Understanding how many users the site should support at a time is important for ensuring that the site infrastructure is appropriately sized to meet the company's needs. This includes considerations like server capacity and load balancing, which are critical for the user experience.\nE.

Model-driven app: Model-driven apps are built on top of Dataverse and are primarily designed for internal users within an organization.
