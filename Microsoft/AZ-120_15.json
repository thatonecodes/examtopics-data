To enable the Azure Backup service to discover databases, a preregistration script must be run on the HANA server as a root user.\n✑ This script creates AZUREWLBACKUPHANAUSER DB user and a corresponding key with the same name in hdbuserstore. Refer to the setting up permissions section to understand more about what the script does.\n✑ Azure Backup Service now installs the Azure Backup Plugin for HANA on the registered SAP HANA server.\n✑ The AZUREWLBACKUPHANAUSER DB user created by the preregistration script is used by the Azure Backup Plugin for HANA to perform all backup and restore operations. If you attempt to configure backup for SAP HANA DBs without running this script, you might receive the following error:\nUserErrorHanaScriptNotRun.\n✑ To configure backup on the databases that are discovered, choose the required backup policy and enable backups.\n✑ Once the backup is configured, Azure Backup service sets up the Backint parameters at the DATABASE level on the protected SAP HANA server.\n✑ The Azure Backup Plugin for HANA maintains all the backup schedules and policy details.
