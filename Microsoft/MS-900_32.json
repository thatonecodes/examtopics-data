Service-level encryption using customer-provided key: This ensures that data is encrypted when it's at rest or in transit between datacenters. The customer has full control over the encryption keys used to secure their data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it.\n\nD. Data transfer using transport-layer security (TLS): This ensures that data is encrypted when it's in transit between devices and servers. TLS is used to secure data transfer in many protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and FTP.
