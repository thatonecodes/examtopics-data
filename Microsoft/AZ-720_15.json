This is often the first thing that should be checked when a VPN connection fails to establish. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nA. Identify the shared key by running this PowerShell cmdlet: Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnectionSharedKey.\n\nThis cmdlet retrieves the pre-shared key for the specified Azure site-to-site VPN connection, which can then be compared with the pre-shared key configured on the on-premises VPN device to ensure they match. If the keys don't match, the VPN connection will fail to establish. \n\nThe other options are not as relevant:\n\n- Option B, the cmdlet Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnectionVpnDeviceConfigScript, is used to generate a configuration script for the on-premises VPN device, which is useful, but not the first step in troubleshooting.\n\n- Options C and D refer to certificate files that are relevant in certificate-based authentication scenarios, not a pre-shared key (PSK) authentication scenario, which is typically used in site-to-site VPNs.","poster":"terawatt","timestamp":"1689946500.0"},{"comment_id":"878138","poster":"cris_exam","timestamp":"1682242440.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/get-azvirtualnetworkgatewayconnectionsharedkey?view=azps-9.6.0"}]},{"id":"rPW2Ag1xWrFy7iH8KNn8","timestamp":"2023-04-23 11:38:00","answer":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nA company is deploying Azure Bastion to provide secure clientless access to its Azure VMs. The company configures a network security group named NSG1.\nDuring deployment, the following error displays: Network security group NSG1 does not have necessary rules for Azure Bastion Subnet AzureBastionSubnet.\nYou need to fix the inbound rules for NSG1.\nHow should you complete the configuration?
