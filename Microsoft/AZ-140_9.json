No. Configuring the Address space settings of the virtual network that contains the session hosts does not prevent users from accessing the internet from Azure Virtual Desktop sessions. The Address space settings define the range of IP addresses that can be used by the virtual network and its subnets1. They do not control the outbound traffic from the session hosts to the internet.\n\nTo prevent users from accessing the internet from Azure Virtual Desktop sessions, you need to configure a network security group (NSG) or a firewall that blocks outbound internet access for the session hosts, while allowing access to the required Microsoft services23. You can also use Azure Firewall or Azure Firewall Manager to centrally manage and enforce network security policies for your Azure Virtual Desktop environment45.","timestamp":"1720046460.0","comment_id":"1113248"},{"comment_id":"853258","poster":"kshum","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1695905880.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nthe correct answer is: B"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1671912480.0","comment_id":"621808","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNo - B is correct answer.","poster":"pappkarcsiii"},{"comment_id":"579492","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct answer.","timestamp":"1664628600.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Eltooth"},{"content":"Got this question on exam today.","comment_id":"498054","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1654803840.0","poster":"Justin0020"},{"poster":"SCT","timestamp":"1650873960.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"correct","comment_id":"467339"}],"exam_id":46},{"id":"9KE7BaEwqQqrjp5tQsDY","answer_images":[],"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1639086300,"question_id":44,"exam_id":46,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"topic":"2","timestamp":"2021-12-09 22:45:00","answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1205052","timestamp":"1730468280.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTo filter AVD hosts network traffic you can use either NSG or AZ FW","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1724947740.0","poster":"T10T","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nPassed with a 919 on 02/29/2024.
