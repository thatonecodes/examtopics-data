If your application runs within a corporate network with strict firewall restrictions, gateway mode is the best choice because it uses the standard HTTPS port and a single DNS endpoint. The performance tradeoff, however, is that gateway mode involves an additional network hop every time data is read from or written to Azure Cosmos DB.
