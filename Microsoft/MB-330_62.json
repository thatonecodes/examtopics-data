Cycle counting work is automatically created when the threshold limit is reached.\nA cycle counting plan creates cycle counting work either immediately or periodically through a batch job. When cycle counting work is created, the counting work line includes information about the location to count. The on-hand inventory that is associated with this location isn't blocked, and is therefore available for reservation and outbound processing, even though open counting work exists.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"lidijalide","comment_id":"763678","timestamp":"1719913020.0"},{"poster":"Pir","comments":[{"timestamp":"1658046540.0","content":"I believe C is the correct answer, and the main condition is the quantity.

If you use a counting plan that runs every week, there can possibly be a week where the quantity will not be below 10.
