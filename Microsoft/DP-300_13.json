Licensing Agreement\n\nADatum has a Microsoft Volume Licensing agreement that includes Software Assurance.\n\nExisting Environment. Network Infrastructure\n\nADatum has an on-premises datacenter and an Azure subscription named Sub1.\n\nSub1 contains a virtual network named Network1 in the East US Azure region.\n\nThe datacenter is connected to Network1 by using a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.\n\nExisting Environment. Identity Environment\n\nThe on-premises network contains an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forest.\n\nThe forest contains a single domain named corp.adatum.com.\n\nThe corp.adatum.com domain syncs with a Microsoft Entra tenant named adatum.com.\n\nExisting Environment. Database Environment\n\nThe datacenter contains the servers shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nDB1 and DB2 are used for transactional and analytical workloads by an application named App1.\n\nApp1 runs on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined servers that run Windows Server 2022. App1 uses Kerberos authentication.\n\nDB3 stores compliance data used by two applications named App2 and App3.\n\nDB3 performance is monitored by using Extended Events sessions, with the event_file target set to a file share on a local disk of SVR3.\n\nResource allocation for DB3 is managed by using Resource Governor.\n\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes\n-\n\nADatum plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Deploy an Azure SQL managed instance named Instance1 to Network1.\n• Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Instance1.\n• Migrate DB3 to Azure SQL Database.\n• Following the migration of DB1 and DB2, hand over database development to remote developers who use Microsoft Entra joined Windows 11 devices.\n• Following the migration of DB3, configure the database to be part of an auto-failover group.\n\nRequirements. Availability Requirements\n\nADatum identifies the following post-migration availability requirements:\n\n• For DB1 and DB2, offload analytical workloads to a read-only database replica in the same Azure region.\n• Ensure that if a regional disaster occurs, DB1 and DB2 can be recovered from backups.\n• After the migration, App1 must maintain access to DB1 and DB2.\n• For DB3, manage potential performance issues caused by resource demand changes by App2 and App3.\n• Ensure that DB3 will still be accessible following a planned failover.\n• Ensure that DB3 can be restored if the logical server is deleted.\n• Minimize downtime during the migration of DB1 and DB2.\n\nRequirements. Security Requirements\n\nADatum identifies the following security requirements for after the migration:\n\n• Ensure that only designated developers who use Microsoft Entra joined Windows 11 devices can access DB1 and DB2 remotely.\n• Ensure that all changes to DB3, including ones within individual transactions, are audited and recorded.\n\nRequirements. Management Requirements\n\nADatum identifies the following post-migration management requirements:\n\n• Continue using Extended Events to monitor DB3.\n• In Azure SQL Database, automate the management of DB3 by using elastic jobs that have database-scoped credentials.\n\nRequirements. Business Requirements\n\nADatum identifies the following business requirements:\n\n• Minimize costs whenever possible, without affecting other requirements.\n• Minimize administrative effort.\n\n\nYou need to recommend which service and target endpoint to use when migrating the databases from SVR1 to Instance1.
