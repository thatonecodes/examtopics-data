DROP -\nYou have an Azure subscription.\nYou plan to build a data warehouse in an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool named pool1 that will contain staging tables and a dimensional model.\nPool1 will contain the following tables.\n//IMG//\n\nYou need to design the table storage for pool1. The solution must meet the following requirements:\nâœ‘ Maximize the performance of data loading operations to Staging.WebSessions.\nâœ‘ Minimize query times for reporting queries against the dimensional model.\nWhich type of table distribution should you use for each table? To answer, drag the appropriate table distribution types to the correct tables. Each table distribution type may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","answer_ET":"","question_id":75,"isMC":false,"exam_id":67,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/80428-exam-dp-203-topic-1-question-60-discussion/","answer":"","discussion":[{"poster":"anks84","comment_id":"660541","timestamp":"1662410700.0","upvote_count":"37","content":"Replicated (Because its a Dimension table)\nHash (Fact table with High volume of data)\nRound-Robin (Staging table)"},{"timestamp":"1731460920.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Piantoni","content":"Correct","comment_id":"1311023"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"CORRECT","poster":"ff5037f","comment_id":"1302830","timestamp":"1729853460.0"},{"comment_id":"1196190","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Alongi","content":"Correct","timestamp":"1713210660.0"},{"timestamp":"1693814520.0","content":"Replicated (Because its a Dimension table)\nHash (Fact table with High volume of data)\nRound-Robin (Staging table)","poster":"kkk5566","comment_id":"998346","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"933300","content":"Shouldn't the fact table has round-robin as well since we need to prioritize data loading, hash will definitely improve the read query performance but will impact the data load speed?","timestamp":"1687673220.0","poster":"spramanik_de","comments":[{"comment_id":"984247","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1692343740.0","poster":"wanchihh","content":"The requirements stated are:\n- Maximize the performance of data loading operations to Staging.WebSessions.\n- Minimize query times for reporting queries against the dimensional model.\n\nSo only the staging table needs fast data loading."}]},{"content":"Given answer is correct","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1675440540.0","poster":"SHENOOOO","comment_id":"797185"},{"content":"The dimension should be a replicated one. so that it will be available in all noes for a better performance \n\nfact table should be a HASH\nstaging table is always Round_ROBIN","timestamp":"1674342240.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"DindaS","comment_id":"783806"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"correct","comment_id":"762195","timestamp":"1672421880.0","poster":"nb1000"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"683500","poster":"allagowf","timestamp":"1664537640.0","content":"the giving answer is correct, as the requirements"}],"unix_timestamp":1662410700,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04259/0012600002.jpg"],"topic":"1","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04259/0012500001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04259/0012600001.jpg"]}],"exam":{"id":67,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Microsoft","numberOfQuestions":384,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"name":"DP-203","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":15},"__N_SSP":true}
