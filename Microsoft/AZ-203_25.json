While users may tolerate a certain amount of slowness, Impact gives you insight into how best to balance optimization and performance to maximize user conversion.\n\nBox 3: Retention -\nThe retention feature in Azure Application Insights helps you analyze how many users return to your app, and how often they perform particular tasks or achieve goals. For example, if you run a game site, you could compare the numbers of users who return to the site after losing a game with the number who return after winning. This knowledge can help you improve both your user experience and your business strategy.\n\nBox 4: User flows -\nThe User Flows tool visualizes how users navigate between the pages and features of your site. It's great for answering questions like:\nHow do users navigate away from a page on your site?\nWhat do users click on a page on your site?\nWhere are the places that users churn most from your site?\nAre there places where users repeat the same action over and over?\nIncorrect Answers:\nFunnel: If your application involves multiple stages, you need to know if most customers are progressing through the entire process, or if they are ending the process at some point. The progression through a series of steps in a web application is known as a funnel.
