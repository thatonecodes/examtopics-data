When an event triggers an alert, the alert is generated and displayed on the Alerts page and a notification is sent. If the same event occurs within the aggregation interval, then Microsoft 365 adds details about the new event to the existing alert instead of triggering a new alert. The goal of alert aggregation is to help reduce alert \"fatigue\" and let you focus and take action on fewer alerts for the same event.","poster":"Tomtom11","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1166563","timestamp":"1709651340.0"},{"content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/alert-policies","comment_id":"1166553","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709650860.0","poster":"Tomtom11"}]}],"exam":{"provider":"Microsoft","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":377,"name":"MS-102","isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":100},"currentPage":20},"__N_SSP":true}
