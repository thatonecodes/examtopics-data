No\n\nThe solution mentioned does not meet the goal of monitoring the compute performance of the deployed API models in Azure Machine Learning Studio.\n\nCreating environment files alone does not provide monitoring capabilities for compute performance. Environment files in Azure Machine Learning Studio are used to define the dependencies and configurations required for running experiments and training models. They specify the software packages, Python versions, and other environment settings.\n\nTo monitor the compute performance of the deployed API models, you would need to implement additional monitoring solutions. Azure Machine Learning Studio does not provide built-in monitoring features for compute performance. Instead, you could consider using Azure Monitor or other performance monitoring tools to track and analyze metrics related to the deployed models, such as CPU and memory usage, response times, and resource utilization.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rveney","comment_id":"930736"},{"timestamp":"1615948380.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"312896","comments":[{"content":"The answer provided is correct.

The model can analyze the streaming data locally on the devices and identify any anomalies present.
