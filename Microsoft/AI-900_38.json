There are multiple reasons it's classification\n- The training data is already tagged as with the correct type of hemorrhage\n- Classification can be done for more than two classes (which people seem to not realize based on the comments)\n- You do clustering on a group of inputs. For example, the scans of 10 people. You can't cluster a single input. Clearly you get a new scan of a new patient and you want to know what that scan shows, you don't have a group of scans to cluster.\n- Clustering gives NO labels.
