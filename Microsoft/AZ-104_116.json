In this scenario, you need to create an alert rule that will run App1 if VM1 stops, and for this purpose, you need to create an action group. An action group defines the set of actions to be taken when an alert is triggered, such as running an Azure function, sending an email, or creating an Azure ticket.\n\nBy creating an action group and associating it with the alert rule, you can automate the process of running App1 if VM1 stops, without the need for manual intervention. This helps ensure that critical systems, such as App1, are automatically activated when necessary, improving the overall reliability and availability of your Azure services.","timestamp":"1675653360.0"},{"upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1674295080.0","content":"Create an action group.\nIn Home > Monitor | Alerts > Action groups > Create action group > Actions tab, select action type \"Azure Function\" and choose the Function app and Function.","comment_id":"783158","poster":"HMKM"},{"poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1728732840.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","comment_id":"1296478"},{"content":"B is right","comment_id":"1179446","timestamp":"1711040400.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Amir1909"},{"poster":"babakeyfgir","content":"It was in EXAM, thanks Examtopic.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1118626","timestamp":"1704895800.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer C","timestamp":"1695216900.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1012365","poster":"Credally"},{"timestamp":"1676173140.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"C: It sounded most right.

The \"Closed\" status signifies that the alert is no longer active and does not require further attention.\nIf a new issue arises or a similar condition occurs again, a new alert will be generated with a \"New\" status to capture and notify users about the new incident.\nHowever, it's important to note that specific workflows and configurations can vary depending on the implementation and customization of Azure Monitor within an organization. In some cases, organizations may have specific processes or automation in place that could potentially reopen a closed alert under certain conditions. These configurations would be specific to the organization's setup and requirements.
