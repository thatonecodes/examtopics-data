Additionally, there are no write latency benefits on using strong consistency with multiple write regions because a write to any region must be replicated and committed to all configured regions within the account. This scenario results in the same write latency as a single write region account.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels#strong-consistency-and-multiple-write-regions","comments":[{"content":"but the question didn't mention that there will be multiple WRITE regions ?","poster":"Weam","comment_id":"1063628","timestamp":"1699258680.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"comment_id":"1061416","timestamp":"1699013700.0"},{"poster":"RikinPatel","comment_id":"1022769","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1696217160.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nstrong is correct ans.:\nStrong consistency: Strong consistency offers a linearizability guarantee.
