This gives you a discounted price on the resource for the reservation period.\n\nBox 2: No -\nThere are other factors that influence the cost of a virtual machine such as the virtual hard disks attached to the virtual machine. You could have multiple virtual machines with the same 'size' (B2S in this case) but with different virtual hard disk configurations.\n\nBox 3: Yes -\nWhen a virtual machine is stopped (deallocated), the virtual machine is unloaded/dismounted from the physical server in Azure. In this state, you are not charged for the virtual machine itself. However, you are still charged for the storage costs of the virtual hard disks attached to the virtual machine.\nIf the virtual machine is stopped but not deallocated (this happens if you shut down the virtual machine from the operating system of the virtual machine), the virtual machine is still mounted on the physical server in Azure and you are charged for the virtual machine itself as well as the storage costs.
