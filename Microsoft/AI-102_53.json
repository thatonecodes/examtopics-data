Bot Framework Composer integrates these pieces into dialogs, a single interface for constructing the building blocks of bot functionality.\n\nEach dialog represents a portion of the bot's functionality and contains instructions for how the bot will react to the input. Dialogs can include custom business logic, calls to cloud APIs, training data for language processing systems, and importantly, the actual content used in conversations with the bot's end users.
