(you could also use the old fashioned way starting from the CRM using “Access Advanced Settings from Settings.” And it automatically navigates you to power admin center once you select users in the security – though it is not forbitten, in this process here just “Access Advanced Settings from Settings.” Does not say from where and disrupts the process).\nOn the other hand, you cannot select just the user name after selecting the environment, you first need to select “users” we have a disruption here.
