Makers and administrators can now configure apps to be available offline on a user's device, and users can continue to complete their tasks against the local cache on their phone even with intermittent or no network connectivity. When the network is re-established, the users' changes are seamlessly synchronized back to the cloud.\nBox 2: Enable attachments on the Wildlife Details entity and enable Wildlife Details entity for mobile offline.\nBox 3: Create a business process.\nBusiness process flows. Ensure that people enter data consistently and follow the same steps every time they work in an app by creating a business process flow.\nNote: Power Automate includes several types of processes, each designed for a different purpose:\n✑ Automated flows. Create a flow that performs one or more tasks automatically after it's triggered by an event.\n✑ Button flows.\n✑ Scheduled flows. Create a flow that performs one or more tasks on a schedule such as once a day, on a specific date, or after a certain time.\n✑ Business process flows. Ensure that people enter data consistently and follow the same steps every time they work in an app by creating a business process flow.\nWorkflows and actions. Dynamics 365 customizers may be familiar with the classic Microsoft Dataverse processes, which are workflows and actions.\n\nReference:\nhttps://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/mobile-offline-for-power-apps/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/guide-staff-through-common-tasks-processes","topic":"2","answer":"","unix_timestamp":1625063700,"exam_id":114,"question_id":81,"isMC":false,"timestamp":"2021-06-30 16:35:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/56388-exam-pl-100-topic-2-question-19-discussion/","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nRangers in national parks report wildlife they encounter during patrols.
