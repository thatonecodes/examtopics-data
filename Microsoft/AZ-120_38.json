Yes.\n\nDeploying an Azure Standard Load Balancer can meet the goal of ensuring that all traffic is routed through the network virtual appliance. Standard Load Balancer can route traffic to multiple virtual machines or network virtual appliances in a single availability zone or multiple availability zones. By configuring the backend pool of the load balancer to include the network virtual appliance and the appropriate subnets, traffic can be forced to flow through the network virtual appliance for security and monitoring purposes.","timestamp":"1682248680.0","comment_id":"878247","upvote_count":"2","poster":"tmtrg000"}],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1682248680,"answer_description":""},{"id":"OkXimIv3wWV6CrHFFZLF","unix_timestamp":1682248800,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"B":"No","A":"Yes"},"answer":"B","question_images":[],"topic":"4","question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.

No\n\nConfiguring route filters for Microsoft peering will only affect traffic between Azure and the on-premises network that is routed through Microsoft peering. It will not affect traffic between Azure subnets. Therefore, this solution does not meet the goal of ensuring that all traffic is routed through the network virtual appliance. A better solution would be to configure user-defined routes to route all traffic through the network virtual appliance.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"tmtrg000"}],"timestamp":"2023-04-23 13:20:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/107159-exam-az-120-topic-4-question-15-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","answer_description":""},{"id":"9KzCz8mTSrc4X6dEzYhX","exam_id":45,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","topic":"4","answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"No","A":"Yes"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/156052-exam-az-120-topic-4-question-17-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1738868340,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1352595","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sap/large-instances/hana-backup-restore\nSAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) offers two backup and restore options:\n\nYou can use a third-party data protection tool to create backups.
