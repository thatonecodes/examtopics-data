CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.\nAzure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).\n\nBox 2: Azure Redis Cache -\nAzure Cache for Redis is based on the popular software Redis. It is typically used as a cache to improve the performance and scalability of systems that rely heavily on backend data-stores.
