We maintain an equivalent of 3 copies\n(replicas) of your data within the primary location as described in our SOSP paper; this ensures that we can recover from common failures (disk, node, rack) without impacting your storage account's availability and durability.\n\nBox 2: Access tier -\nChange the access tier from Hot to Cool.\nNote: Azure storage offers different access tiers, which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:\nHot - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.\nCool - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.\nArchive - Optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements (on the order of hours).\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/data-series-introducing-locally-redundant-storage-for-windows-azure-storage/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers","unix_timestamp":1632934500,"topic":"3","answers_community":[],"exam_id":44,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04223/0018300001.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04223/0018400001.png"],"answer":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou have an Azure subscription.\nYou create the Azure Storage account shown in the following exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nUse the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nHot Area:\n//IMG//","discussion":[{"content":"Both of them are correct.\n\n- LRS has 3 copies of data\n- Access tier has the \"cool\" option to store infrequently accessed data.","upvote_count":"70","comments":[{"content":"Answer valid!
