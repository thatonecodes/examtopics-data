To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\nHot Area:\n//IMG//","answers_community":[],"isMC":false,"answer_description":"Box 1: ID -\nScenario: Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.\nID token - A JWT that contains claims that you can use to identify users in your application. This token is securely sent in HTTP requests for communication between two components of the same application or service. You can use the claims in an ID token as you see fit. They're commonly used to display account information or to make access control decisions in an application. ID tokens are signed, but the're not encrypted. When your application or API receives an ID token, it must validate the signature to prove that the token is authentic. Your application or API must also validate a few claims in the token to prove that it's valid.\nDepending on the scenario requirements, the claims validated by an application can vary, but your application must perform some common claim validations in every scenario.\n\nBox 2: Oid -\nOid - The immutable identifier for the \"principal\" of the request - the user or service principal whose identity has been verified. In ID tokens and app+user tokens, this is the object ID of the user. In app-only tokens, this is the object ID of the calling service principal. It can also be used to perform authorization checks safely and as a key in database tables. This ID uniquely identifies the principal across applications - two different applications signing in the same user will receive the same value in the oid claim.\nIncorrect:\nAud - Identifies the intended recipient of the token. For Azure AD B2C, the audience is the application ID. Your application should validate this value and reject the token if it doesn't match. Audience is synonymous with resource.\nIdp - Records the identity provider that authenticated the subject of the token. This value is identical to the value of the Issuer claim unless the user account not in the same tenant as the issuer - guests, for instance. If the claim isn't present, it means that the value of iss can be used instead. For personal accounts being used in an organizational context (for instance, a personal account invited to an Azure AD tenant), the idp claim may be 'live.com' or an STS URI containing the\nMicrosoft account tenant.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens","answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04273/0027900001.png"],"topic":"10","answer":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04273/0027800001.png"],"exam_id":48,"timestamp":"2022-09-21 12:28:00"},{"id":"qFTHO1g8HSu3IAoBZkju","answer_ET":"AD","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1651497600,"timestamp":"2022-05-02 15:20:00","choices":{"E":"Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Cosmos DB.

Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks.\nApplication Gateway supports autoscaling, SSL offloading, and end-to-end SSL, a web application firewall (WAF), cookie-based session affinity, URL path-based routing, multisite hosting, redirection, rewrite HTTP headers and other features.\nNote: Both Nginx and Azure Application Gateway act as a reverse proxy with Layer 7 load-balancing features plus a WAF to ensure strong protection against common web vulnerabilities and exploits.\nYou can modify Nginx web server configuration/SSL for X-XSS protection. This helps to prevent cross-site scripting exploits by forcing the injection of HTTP headers with X-XSS protection.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/ag-overview https://www.upguard.com/articles/10-tips-for-securing-your-nginx-deployment","unix_timestamp":1622544000,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04273/0029200001.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04273/0029200004.png"],"answer":"","topic":"11","answers_community":[],"question_id":45,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04273/0029100001.jpg"]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":452,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Microsoft","name":"AZ-204","id":48,"isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":9},"__N_SSP":true}
