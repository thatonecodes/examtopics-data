Hereâ€™s why this is necessary:\n\nMaintain Transaction Order: By unapplying the second payment first, you maintain the chronological order of transactions. This helps avoid any confusion or errors in the ledger entries.\nClear Dependencies: The second payment might depend on the first payment being unapplied. Unapplying the second payment first clears any dependencies, making it easier to unapply the first payment without issues.\nAccurate Reapplication: Once both payments are unapplied, you can reapply the second payment correctly. This ensures that the second payment is accurately linked to the correct transaction, maintaining the integrity of your financial records.\nThis process helps keep your records clean and accurate, ensuring that all transactions are correctly accounted for.","timestamp":"1728780360.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"1638041400.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"bouali2","content":"I think that is incorrect.\n1- Payment is not removed at all.\n2-Why to unapply the second payment and applied again."}],"question_text":"Two cash receipts were applied to a posted sales transaction.
