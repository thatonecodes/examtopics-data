Authentication type?\nOption 1 - Application registration in Azure AD.\n\nFor each app (App1 and App2), you should register a separate application in Azure AD. This will allow users to authenticate using their contoso.com credentials and will enable you to request access tokens for accessing protected resources like the calendar.\n\nQuestion 2. Authorization type?\nOption 3 - Delegated permissions.\n\nDelegated permissions allow the apps to perform actions on behalf of the signed-in user, such as reading or writing to their calendar.
