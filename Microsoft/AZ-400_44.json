Azure Artifacts allows you to host and share packages within your organization, making it a perfect choice for your use case.\n\nPublish a package: After creating the Azure Artifacts feed, the next step is to publish your NuGet package to this feed. You'll need to make sure you've properly configured your package for publishing, which includes providing the necessary metadata in the .nuspec file.\n\nConnect to an Azure Artifacts feed: Once the package is published, you or your development team will need to connect to the Azure Artifacts feed to consume the package. This typically involves adding the feed to your NuGet configuration in Visual Studio or another development environment.\n\nInstall a package: The final step in verifying that the package can be consumed is to actually install it. Using the NuGet CLI or the package management functionality in your development environment, you can install the package from the Azure Artifacts feed and confirm that it works as expected.","comment_id":"903742","upvote_count":"2","poster":"DGladiator","timestamp":"1684734600.0"},{"poster":"grimstoner","comment_id":"730386","comments":[{"poster":"resonant","comment_id":"956952","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1689805740.0","content":"Your answer is wrong.
