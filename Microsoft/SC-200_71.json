Two automation rules assigned to Rule1\nðŸ’¡ Explanation:\n\nTo assign incidents to different groups based on the originating domain (contoso.com or fabrikam.com) with minimal administrative effort, the best approach is to:\n\n Create two automation rules, each with a condition to check for indicators (like hostname, domain, or event source).\n\n Use the rules to automatically assign incidents to Group1 or Group2.\n\nâœ… Why two automation rules (Option D) is correct:\n\n Automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel can act on incident properties such as title, custom details, or mapped entities.\n\n Each domain (contoso.com / fabrikam.com) would likely be identifiable via a field in the alert/incident (e.g., domain name, hostname suffix).\n\n Creating one rule per domain ensures precise and maintainable logic, with clear ownership per domain.\n\n Requires less overhead than scripting or maintaining complex playbooks.","timestamp":"1744365000.0"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/167657-exam-sc-200-topic-7-question-24-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-03-10 08:05:00","answer_images":[],"answer":"D","question_id":352,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","topic":"7","choices":{"C":"one automation rule assigned to Rule1","A":"a playbook that is triggered by the creation of an incident","B":"a playbook that is triggered by the creation of an alert","D":"two automation rules assigned to Rule1"},"unix_timestamp":1741590300},{"id":"12jcOWRUuBRT5ZuucpWV","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/153841-exam-sc-200-topic-7-question-25-discussion/","exam_id":122,"question_id":353,"question_text":"You have a Microsoft 365 subscription.\n\nYou have the following KQL query.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nYou need to ensure that you can create a Microsoft Defender XDR custom detection rule by using the query.\n\nWhat should you add to the query?","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1735888020,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sc-200/image339.png"],"choices":{"D":"| summarize (Timestamp)=range(Timestamp), count() by DeviceId","A":"| summarize (Timestamp, ReportId)=arg_max(Timestamp, ReportId), count() by DeviceId","B":"| summarize (ReportId)=make_set(ReportId), count() by DeviceId","C":"| summarize (Timestamp, DeviceName)=arg_min(Timestamp, DeviceName), count() by DeviceId"},"answer":"A","topic":"7","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1735888020.0","poster":"Madzius","comment_id":"1335924","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt was om the test."}],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-01-03 08:07:00","answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"Sv6eWG5RTQNXTwyLuxuo","timestamp":"2025-01-29 13:46:00","unix_timestamp":1738154760,"topic":"7","exam_id":122,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sc-200/image355.png"],"question_id":354,"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription that uses Microsoft Defender for Office 365.\n\nYou need to build a hunting query that will list events involving potentially malicious emails that were detected but NOT removed successfully from mailboxes after delivery.
