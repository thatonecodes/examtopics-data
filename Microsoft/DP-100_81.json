This is important because, in this scenario, the content of the downstream data source has been updated. If allow_reuse is set to True, the pipeline run would reuse the outputs of the previous run, which means it would not fully process the updated content.\n\nBy setting allow_reuse to False, the pipeline ensures that each step is re-executed, starting from the updated data source. This guarantees that the new run of pipeline1 fully processes the updated content and incorporates the changes made to the downstream data source."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nShould be yes","comment_id":"898917","timestamp":"1700122680.0","poster":"karu_m","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"853878","poster":"sap_dg","timestamp":"1695949620.0","content":"It should be Yes"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"esimsek","content":"Should not it be yes?","comment_id":"851943","timestamp":"1695805140.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
