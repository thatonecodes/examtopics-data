They provide a mechanism that lets external systems receive notifications from finance and operations apps1. However, Business Events alone cannot post a message to a Microsoft Teams channel. They need to be used in conjunction with another tool that can take the output of the Business Event and perform the required action21.\n\nThatâ€™s where Power Automate comes in. Power Automate can listen for the Business Event triggered by Dynamics 365 Finance, and then post a message to a Microsoft Teams channel2. This is why both Dynamics 365 Finance workflow (which can trigger a Business Event) and Power Automate (which can listen for the Business Event and post a message to Teams) are needed for this scenario23.","comment_id":"1042412"},{"comment_id":"718977","poster":"yuri_rusanov","upvote_count":"1","content":"I think the most correct answer would be Workflow which has a business event which calls Power Automate, like here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/workflow-approvals-through-power-automate-microsoft-dynamics-khan","timestamp":"1668532560.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"\"A business action that a user performs can be either a workflow action or a non-workflow action.

It will allow run sessions for third-party applications that run before or after Finance and Supply Chain Management is run. Essentially, you will be able to trigger an integration in some portal and then verify the outcomes in Finance and Supply Chain Management. It's the same as if you were doing with the C# NUnit framework and selenium WebDrivers, although, in this case, you likely won't require coding. The main idea is to be able to do integration scenario testing and be able to do that without developer help. Since development can be expensive it's not something that customers really aim to do. We will get this feature in general availability and in public preview within the next few months, so stay tuned and follow the latest Microsoft improvements so you don't miss out!\nReference:\nhttps://companial.com/blog/how-to-automate-integration-testing-in-microsoft-dynamics-365-fscm/","timestamp":"2024-01-02 16:27:00","isMC":true},{"id":"sUvBVkSwKaq9RKSdTLLe","discussion":[{"content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/deployment/cloud-deployment-overview","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ying","comment_id":"1122800","timestamp":"1705263120.0"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"3","content":"UAT test, tier2 is good enough, the question asks \"with minimal costs\"","poster":"Daniel73847","comment_id":"1022219","timestamp":"1696161240.0"}],"timestamp":"1690979580.0","content":"UAT tier 5 yes ?","comment_id":"970157","poster":"ntxtraining","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":[],"topic":"5","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/117114-exam-mb-300-topic-5-question-74-discussion/","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nYou plan environment tiers for life cycle phases.\n\nYou need to select environment tiers to use for each life cycle phase with minimal costs.\n\nWhich tier should you recommend for each purpose?
