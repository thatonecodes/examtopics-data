Send to Log Analytics. Here's why:\n- Log Analytics is designed for monitoring and alerting scenarios in Azure\n- It has built-in capabilities to create alerts based on metrics without requiring custom development\n- You can easily set up alert rules based on database connection metrics\n- It provides real-time monitoring capabilities\n- Compared to the other options, it requires minimal development effort since the alerting functionality is built-in\n\nOptions B and C are less suitable because:\n- Event Hub would require additional code to process the events and create alerts\n- Storage Account is more suited for long-term archival and wouldn't provide real-time alerting capabilities\n\nTherefore, sending diagnostics data to Log Analytics would be the most efficient solution that minimizes development effort while meeting the requirement to alert on simultaneous connections.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1340171","timestamp":"1736831520.0","poster":"Freyr"},{"poster":"AymanAkk","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726224720.0","content":"the other options are werid","comment_id":"1006501"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"977353","content":"Selected Answer: A\nGiven answer is correct","poster":"yana_b","timestamp":"1723270800.0"},{"timestamp":"1708856400.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"821368","content":"According to chatgpt answer is eventhub","poster":"mohiniu"},{"poster":"ABC666","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect!","comment_id":"761255","timestamp":"1703867160.0"},{"poster":"syu31svc","content":"Selected Answer: A\n100% is A","comment_id":"639623","timestamp":"1690709580.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nOn exam 20220727.","poster":"tjeerd","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1690516740.0","comment_id":"638416"},{"comment_id":"634875","timestamp":"1689980700.0","content":"Azure log analytics query using KQL","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Govcomm"},{"comment_id":"597869","poster":"UnknowMan","timestamp":"1683404220.0","content":"Correct, A to create an alert","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorrect. the simplest way to archive data and to generate the alert","poster":"rdemontis","timestamp":"1678977660.0","comment_id":"569127"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Optimist_Indian","comment_id":"542501","content":"Got this question in Feb-2022 exam (scored 910+).
