These include items such as pens, pencils, paper, notebooks, chalk, desks, acrylic paints, blackboards, dry erase markers, and whiteboard paint. Due to increased demand for colored pencils, lead times are longer for these pencils. School of Fine Art plans to expand sales into this market.\n\nSchool of Fine Art plans to implement Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to manage the business.\n\nCurrent environment. Company structure\n\nSchool of Fine Art consists of two legal entities.\n\n\nPrimary company\n-\n\n• Located in Dublin, Ireland.\n• Has a single named warehouse.\n• Is the primary distribution center for both companies.\n\n\nSecond company\n-\n\n• Is located in Glasgow, Scotland.\n• Includes the following warehouses: Glasgow1, Glasgow2.\n○ Glasgow1 is used primarily to supply items regionally.\n○ Glasgow2 serves as local storage for vendor-owned inventory and bulk storage for School of Fine Art's inventory.\n\nCurrent environment. General processes\n\nSchool of Fine Art uses a combination of spreadsheets and paper forms to manage the business.\n\n• All sales, purchases, and inventory are tracked in spreadsheets that are password protected by managers.\n• Managers frequently share spreadsheet passwords so that other users can make edits on their behalf. Inventory quantities and values are unreliable.\n• The spreadsheets are often incorrectly updated, have entry errors, and broken formulas for calculations.\n• Purchase order receipts, picking lists, packing slips, and invoices are all handwritten on pre-printed, three-part forms.\n• Late summer is the company's busiest time. During this time, workers are typically on the warehouse floor or making rush deliveries to schools to meet last-minute needs.\n\nCurrent environment. Inventory and warehousing\n\n• School of Fine Art values inventory by using FIFO costing methods.\n• Inventory in the warehouses cannot be distinguished as available inventory or inventory that is sold to a customer and waiting to be picked. This creates inventory inflation during cycle counts and later shortages because warehouse workers count items that are already promised to customers and waiting to be shipped.\n• Glasgow2 space is fully allocated to vendors.\n• Due to space constraints, school orders for photocopiers are shipped from the vendor to the school.\n• Crayons are stored as separate item numbers depending on whether they are in a box or a case. This creates issues when counting inventory to determine the total number of crayons in stock.\n• Lack of inventory controls has led to shortages on sales orders, creating backorders and unhappy schools.\n• Inventory is ordered quarterly due to the seasonality of the business.\n• Items can change annually based on popular sizes, colors, and styles for each new school season. The creation of the different configurations is a manual process, which creates so much overhead that temporary workers are brought in to do the data entry.\n\nCurrent environment. Purchasing\n\n• Reordering is manually managed by the buyers looking at the seasonal spikes for the start of the school year, slowing around the end-of-year holidays until the following school year.\n• Pens are readily available products that are rarely discounted for sale.\n• Photocopiers are only available for sale on the Glasgow region.\n• Photocopy paper and construction paper are ordered by the pallet into Dublin1 and must be broken down into smaller sizes. The pallets are typically broken down and then split between what stays in Dublin1 and what is shipped to Glasgow1.\n• Chalk and blackboards are slower sellers, so many vendors do not carry these items. School of Fine Art purchases these products from a single vendor. There are no alternative vendors available.\n• School of Fine Art agrees to purchase a new line of smartboards from a vendor. The agreed-upon smartboard purchase prices will have a cost price per 55-inch, 75-inch, or 85-inch smartboard.\n• The company purchases pencils for the following warehouses:\n○ Glasgow1:\n• standard pencils from Vendor A\n• colored pencils from Vendor B\n○ Dublin1:\n• standard pencils from Vendor A\n• colored pencils from Vendor A\n• As whiteboard paint grows in popularity, so does the demand. This causes supply shortages. Whiteboard paint is ordered six months in advance.\n\nCurrent environment. Customer sales\n\n• The company contractually agrees to prices for some items with schools prior to the start of each school year.\n• Schools may order bulk cases of products and choose to distribute further breakdowns, such as a case of crayons, which are then distributed to classrooms by the box.\n• Pens do not require contracts with schools because they are low margin and do not have supply chain shortages.\n• Painting supplies such as acrylic paint, canvases, and easels do not require a special contract and are sold at regular list price to all schools.\n• Schools that offer painting classes are part of a program that provides special pricing on the painting supplies.\n• Chalk and blackboards are ordered less frequently than they were in past years. Schools are choosing to use whiteboard paint, which is a lower cost than ordering and installing the whiteboards.\n\nRequirements. Customers and sales\n\n• The system must have the ability to limit product purchase amounts by a single school to prevent stock shortages for other schools.\n• Schools are obligated to purchase the agreed amount for specific items per the school year.\n• Customer service must be able to easily enter items for sales orders and identify stock shortages.\n• Sales of whiteboard paint must be limited so that one school does not buy all the inventory and force backorders for other schools.\n• Schools must agree to the amount of whiteboard paint they will purchase for the whole school year.\n\nRequirements. Inventory costing\n\n• Inventory must have associated costs except for the vendor storage in Glasgow2.\n• The vendor storage must still contain quantities but not include cost in inventory valuations.\n• At the end of each month, the costing manager must be able to identify how many items will not be fully settled.\n• Annual configuration changes to items must be automatically created where possible.\n• The company must be able to track costs for colored pencils and standard pencils separately.\n\n\nRequirements. Inventory\n-\n\n• Warehouse workers must be able to use their mobile phones and the mobile app to take calls and create transactions in the warehouse.\n• The desks must use a single item number and barcode regardless of year manufactured and the vendor.\n• Water-based paints from the vendor must be received in pails.\n• Acrylic paint must be managed by batches and expiration dates.\n• Pencils must be categorized as colored pencils or standard pencils. The individual colors of each colored pencil (such as red, green, and blue) will not be tracked.\n• The creation of unique smartboard items must be kept to a minimum.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n• WarehouseWorker1 works in Glasgow2. The worker receives a request to ship pallets of paper from the warehouse to Glasgow1 and Dublin1. WarehouseWorker1 must create the shipments in the system to transfer the pallets of paper from Glasgow1 to Dublin1.\n• The number of backorders for desks has increased. Customer service representatives struggle to select a desk item number that has inventory on hand. The desks are the same item, but the manufacturer vendor and year differ.\n• A school calls customer service to report that its photocopier is broken. The school needs expedited shipment of a replacement.\n• A school that is part of the special paint program reports that a sale price on canvas last month was a better price than its paint program price. The school requests a price adjustment.\n• A school reports that different shipments of acrylic paints are slightly different in color.\n• The sales team decides to have a flash sale on pens for one month only. The person entering the Sales order line should be able to communicate the information to the customer on the Sales order line.\n• Schools are reporting that chalk and blackboards are broken upon receipt. A worker in Dublin1 opens some cases of these products in the warehouse and finds that they are also broken. You must implement processes to enforce inventory inspection for a percentage of each purchase order line received. You must block all inventory for a purchase order line if the inspection fails.\n\n\nYou need to configure the conversions for the items.\n\nWhich measurement type should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate unit of measure types to the correct requirements. Each unit of measure type may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","answer_ET":"","timestamp":"2025-02-28 17:55:00","unix_timestamp":1740761700,"answer_description":"","exam_id":83,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"content":"a- Standard\nb- Inter Class\nfor crayons, specific instructions are given like \n* Crayons are stored as separate item numbers depending on whether they are in a box or a case.

Coho Vineyard is based in Medford, Oregon. The vineyard grows the grapes and then produces and bottles the wine. Coho Winery, based in Grants Pass, Oregon, distributes packaged wine to businesses and consumers. The winery sells imported cheese and olive oil in addition to the wines.\n\nCurrent environment. Technology landscape\n\n• Coho Vineyard & Winery requires financial reporting from both Coho Vineyard and Coho Winery. The parent company consolidates financials in a third-party tool.\n• Coho Winery currently manages inventory and financials on spreadsheets separately from the parent company.\n\nCurrent environment. Inventory and warehousing\n\n• The entire warehouse is temperature controlled. A refrigerated section of the warehouse is used for items that require colder storage.\n• The items do not have fixed locations in the warehouse.\n• Coho uses smart numbering for cheese items today. The items start with F for France and U for United States such as the following:\n• F11234 = French cheese\n• U14567 = US cheese\n• Currently, wine does not use smart numbering.\n• Inventory is valued at First In, First-Out (FIFO).\n• Olive oil has a 12-month shelf life.\n• WineA is expensive and not regularly stocked in the warehouse.\n• WineB must be in the refrigerated section of the warehouse.\n• WineC is non-refrigerated wine and is the majority of inventory in the warehouse.\n\nCurrent environment. Vendors and procurement\n\n• Cheese is purchased from vendors in two countries: France and United States.\n• Non-cheese items can be purchased from vendors in other countries or regions.\n• Olive oil is bought and sold in full cases of six each.\n• When Coho Vineyard produces more wine than expected in a season, rebate programs are offered to any company whose monthly purchases exceed $5,000.\n\n\nRequirements. General -\n\n• The Coho Vineyard & Winery parent company, as well as Coho Vineyard, will not be considered in the implementation of Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management for Coho Winery.

The rebates must be claimed from Coho Vineyard.\n• Purchase orders (POs) must be maintained online with tracked changes between the vendors and the buyers.\n• The controller decides WineA must not be held in financial inventory on the Coho Winery books. The winery makes an agreement with the vendor that WineA will be owned by the vendor until a later date.\n• Vendor1 sends bulk shipments. Coho Winery does not always have enough warehouse staff to receive inventory. The company requires Vendor1 to send advanced shipping notices (ASNs).\n• The operations coordinator must schedule inbound loads. The company requires automation of inbound load creation where possible.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• The warehouse is at maximum capacity. Empty bin locations are not always available.\n• The warehouse manager wants to establish fast moving locations for WineB on the floor and refill locations from higher rack storage.\n• Coho Winery recently conducted an internal audit risk assessment. The risk assessment found that inventory value reports were stored in spreadsheets. The spreadsheets can easily be edited and lack controls.\n• After olive oil is counted, multiple cases are destroyed due to shelf life. The inventory planner must determine if a new PO should be placed for olive oil.\n• The vendor rebates claims are often rejected because the claims were miscalculated by not including discounts.\n• The purchasing manager receives multiple complaints regarding POs:\n• Issue 1: PO changes are not accepted and confirmed, resulting in out-of-stock issues.\n• Issue 2: Vendors do not have control on responses to POs. Instead, the vendors rely on emails.\n\n\nYou must configure the olive oil case requirements.\n\nWhich two configurations should you use for PO creation by using MRP?

Set strict validation on default order quantities: This enforces rigid adherence to default order quantities (e.g., minimum, maximum, or multiples). It prevents POs from being created outside these parameters, ensuring consistency with full-case requirements.\nC. Set the inventory unit of measure to cases: This defines the base unit for inventory tracking and ordering as \"cases\" rather than individual bottles. MRP will then plan and generate POs in cases, aligning with the \"full cases only\" requirement.\nD. Enter multiples on default order settings: This allows you to specify that orders must be in multiples of a certain quantity (e.g., multiples of 1 case).

Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm does not produce or provide canning services for any items.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nMunson's Pickles and Preserves Farm has an accounting system that is disconnected from the warehousing system. This has caused issues with controlling and valuing inventory. With these core drivers, Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm decides to implement Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.\n\n\nWarehousing -\n• Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm has a single warehouse that serves as the distribution center for all products.\n• The warehouse has bulk locations as well as racking, but location names and numbers do not exist.\n• Bulk locations are for storage of extra inventory that will not fit into the picking locations.\n• The warehouse is temperature-controlled, with locations grouped into two zones: refrigerated and non-perishable.\n• Inventory adjustments are made regularly due to lack of inventory controls.\n\n\nInventory Data -\n\n• Item numbers are inconsistent and were set up as “smart-numbering,” such as 1-23-PKL and 44-24-PICK.\n• Cucumbers are not grown by Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm and may be sourced from local farmers.\n• Pickles come in bottle sizes of 8 oz, 16 oz, 32 oz. The bottles are packed in cases.\n• Pickles may be spear, chip, or whole shapes within the bottles. This does not impact the cost of the pickles when they are the same flavor.\n• Pickle flavors are sweet, spicy, and dill. The flavors vary in price.\n• Preserves come in multiple flavors, such as mango, strawberry, and grape. These are seasonal items only. Due to the varying flavors and quantities, the preserves are owned by the vendor until they are sold. The mango preserves require refrigeration. The other preserves do not require refrigeration.\n• Many items are sold as accessories or supplies for pickling.\n• Some items within inventory have an expiration date, such as vinegar.\n• Fast-moving items are identified by inventory turns per quarter. Sweet and spicy pickles are the most popular.\n\n\nPurchasing and Sales -\n\n• Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm has an online store that can be found at munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com.\n• The online store is limited to a subset of products that are accessories only, such as bottles and jars.\n• A new product line of kosher pickles is going to be distributed by Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm.\n• VendorA is the largest vendor that Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm buys products from. Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm’s second largest vendor is VendorB.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nWarehousing -\n\n• The warehouse manager requires fast-moving items to be easily accessible to the order pickers in AisleA, with no more than one item per bin location in AisleA. Both sweet and spicy pickles have more inventory than will fit in AisleA, resulting in bulk location storage. o Spicy pickles must have no less than half of a pallet in AisleA at any time. o Sweet pickles must have enough inventory in AisleA prior to creating waves for warehouse work.\n• Strawberry preserves are selling slowly this season. They are put away in higher bin locations because they are not considered fast-moving items\n\n\nInventory & Data -\n\n• Item numbers must be set up to create a streamlined numbering system. Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm requires that the old item number be stored in Dynamics 365 for cross reference purposes. Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm has settled on 0000001 as the item format for pickles instead of 1-23-PKL. PKL will be stored as an attribute.\n• Item numbers for pickles must be consolidated where possible into a single item number, regardless of bottle size.\n• Cucumbers must be sold at actual cost because they are a special order.\n• Kosher pickles must be set up in the item master. The kosher pickles are the same size jars and flavors as the other pickles, except that they have a kosher designation and will be slightly more expensive.\n• Vinegar and other perishable items must have date tracking for the manufacturer's batch number and expiration date of the product.\n• A batch of mango preserves had to be thrown away because the warehouse workers put away the product into the non-perishable zone.\n\n\nPurchasing & Sales -\n\n• Cucumbers must be sourced from local vendors for special orders only.\n• Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm recently signed an exclusivity agreement with VendorA, and buyers must now only purchase from VendorA.\n• VendorA recently purchased a competitor company, VendorB. VendorA wants to ensure that all agreements with VendorA also apply to VendorB while they work on merging the two companies into one.\n• VendorC sells preserves to Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm and requires the following: o Shipment requirement: VendorC owns the product after shipment to Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm until the time of sale. o On-hand requirement: VendorC has access to view on-hand preserve inventory at Munson’s Pickles and Preserves Farm warehouse.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• CustomerD reports that the vinegar they ordered had a week left before it expired when they received it. This did not give CustomerD enough time to use the vinegar before they had to dispose of it. CustomerD now requires that all vinegar has more than 30 days left before the expiration date.\n• A customer calls and states that they ordered kosher pickles and received regular pickles. Inventory Control Clerk 2 reports that kosher and non-kosher pickles of the same variety are in the same warehouse location, contributing to the picking errors.\n• A salesperson reports that the margin is incorrect on a customer’s special order because the cucumber cost was for the most recent receipt of cucumbers, not the cucumbers received for the specific customer order.\n• An internal audit revealed that large quantities of pickles were missing and written off as damaged on multiple occasions cover the past year. No documentation or explanation of the write offs exist. There is no documentation of disposal, and no approval from management to substantiate that the pickles were not stolen.\n• Jars of pickles are received as eaches. Case counts of pickle jars vary by size: o 8 oz jars are 12 per case o 16 oz jars are 6 per case o The varied counts in each case create overhead in the warehouse.\n\n• The receiving clerk in the warehouse wants to ensure that broken bottles of vinegar are moved to a damage location named LocationA. Expired vinegar should be moved to a return-to-vendor location named LocationB. All other vinegar should be put away and sold according to normal location directives.\n• Operator1 is picking a pallet of strawberry preserves from a location to the shipping dock. While picking up the pallet, Operator1 drops the pallet. Operator1 must make sure that the strawberry preserves are not available for shipment until the damage is evaluated.\n• Operator2 tries to print wave labels that contain item 0000001. The labels start to print and then jam. At the same time, the printer battery needs to be recharged and the labels need to be reprinted.\n\n\nYou need to make changes based on the internal audit findings.\n\nWhich feature should you enable?","timestamp":"2025-02-17 10:29:00","choices":{"B":"Inventory journal workflows","D":"Tag counting","C":"Scrap method","A":"Quarantine order"},"question_images":[],"question_id":125,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1363400","timestamp":"1740806760.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nRecommended Choice: B. Inventory Journal Workflows. Here’s why:\nDocumentation: When inventory is written off (e.g., via an Inventory Adjustment Journal), workflows can require users to enter a reason or description (e.g., \"damaged pickles from batch X\").\nApproval Process: Workflows can route the journal to management for approval before the write-off is finalized, ensuring oversight and preventing unauthorized adjustments.\nAudit Trail: Dynamics 365 logs all journal postings, including who initiated them, the approval details, and timestamps, providing the missing traceability identified in the audit.\nContext Fit: Munson’s is a distribution company, not a manufacturer, so the issue is about controlling inventory adjustments rather than isolating defective stock (quarantine) or managing production scrap.","poster":"globeearth"},{"comment_id":"1357711","timestamp":"1739784540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Max2969","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
