It enables bi-directional communication, allowing you to send data from the devices to the cloud for processing and analysis, as well as send commands or configuration changes from the cloud back to the devices.\n\nBy using Azure IoT Hub, you can easily connect and manage your hundreds of hardware devices, ingest sensor data at scale, and process it using various Azure services such as Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Functions, or Azure Machine Learning. Additionally, Azure IoT Hub supports device twin and direct methods, which allow you to store device configurations and send commands to update them.","timestamp":"1687285440.0","poster":"rveney","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"928685"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"603506","poster":"ManAtWorkAtNight","timestamp":"1652910180.0","content":"write back -> biderectional -> Azure IoT hub"}],"answer_description":"References:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/functions-js-iot-hub-processing/","timestamp":"2020-12-06 16:57:00","answer":"A","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":39,"topic":"3","unix_timestamp":1607270220,"choices":{"D":"Microsoft Azure Notification Hubs","A":"Microsoft Azure IoT Hub","B":"API apps in Microsoft Azure App Service","C":"Microsoft Azure Event Hubs"}},{"id":"EcMp2AZNRYn2paLZPw3B","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-howto-index-cosmosdb","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03857/0015600001.png"],"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou have an intelligent edge solution that processes data and outputs the data to an Azure Cosmos DB account that uses the SQL API.\nYou need to ensure that you can perform full text searches of the data.\nWhich three actions should you perform in sequence?
