You can have up to three DPTs (each with a different action) per policy.\nThe answer 'No' probably still stands as an archive mailbox is not mentioned. If it is implicitly assumed, then the solution with two DPTs should be possible: one DPT to archive and the other to delete content.

As mentioned earlier, a retention policy can have one DPT that uses the Move to Archive action and one DPT that uses either the Delete and Allow Recovery or Permanently Delete action. The DPT with the Move to Archive action must have a lower retention age than the DPT with a deletion action. For example, you can use a DPT with the Move to Archive action to move items to the archive mailbox in two years, and a DPT with a deletion action to remove items from the mailbox in seven years. Items in both primary and archive mailboxes will be deleted after seven years.","comment_id":"264345","timestamp":"1610322120.0","poster":"donathon"}]}],"question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
