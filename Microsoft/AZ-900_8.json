The Archive access tier is one of the four access tiers for Azure Blob Storage, and it is set at the storage account level.\n\nThe statement “The Hot access tier is recommended for data that is accessed and modified frequently” is true. The Hot access tier is optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently.\n\nThe statement “The Cool access tier is recommended for long term backups” is false. The Cool access tier is optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified, but still needs to be available for reading and writing. The Archive access tier, on the other hand, is optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1697359200.0"},{"poster":"FutureAdmin","timestamp":"1696125420.0","content":"This was on exam. 9/30/23","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1021964"},{"content":"Got this question. 23-07-15","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1689453900.0","poster":"user0102030405","comment_id":"952694"},{"poster":"20142365","content":"NYN\n\nGot this question on June 30, 2023","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1688265060.0","comment_id":"940453"},{"comment_id":"919814","poster":"furq2904","timestamp":"1686375000.0","content":"This appeared in the exam (10th June 2023)","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"magzen","comment_id":"903883","content":"According to OpenAI The Archive access tier in Azure Storage is set at the storage account level.","comments":[{"content":"But according to the Microsoft training modules, the Archive tear can only be set at the resource level.
