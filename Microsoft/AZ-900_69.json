To access this data, you need to rehydrate it to an online tier, such as the Hot or Cool tier.

This means each session host will have a roughly equal number of user sessions1.\nDepth-first: Fills up one session host to its maximum capacity before moving on to the next1.\nSession Limits:\nThe maximum number of sessions per host can be configured based on the VM size and the expected workload2. For example, a host might support 5 to 10 users depending on the resources allocated to it2.\nIn theory, you can set a very high maximum session limit, but practical limits depend on the performance and resource requirements of the applications being used3.\nSo, a host pool with 20 session hosts can support more than 20 simultaneous user connections, depending on how you configure the session limits and the load balancing strategy.","poster":"lara400","comment_id":"1285109","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1726563300.0"},{"poster":"mhayek","timestamp":"1700360280.0","content":"Answer is NNY.
