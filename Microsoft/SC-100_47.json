Pay attention to disabled vs deleted backups\nAs part of adding an extra layer of authentication for critical operations, you're prompted to enter a security PIN when you perform Stop Protection with Delete data and Change Passphrase operations.\n\nMulti-user authorization (MUA) for Azure Backup allows you to add an additional layer of protection to critical operations on your Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. For MUA, Azure Backup uses another Azure resource called the Resource Guard to ensure critical operations are performed only with applicable authorization. MUA protects against disabling backups and reducing retention for backups.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1704197400.0"},{"content":"i think now the recommendation MUA for Azure Backup, so i go with A","comment_id":"1092886","timestamp":"1702244640.0","poster":"juanpe147","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1701717900.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1087896","poster":"Arjanussie","content":"A : f you have a compromised administrator account, you should configure multi-user authorization by using Resource Guard for your vaults.
