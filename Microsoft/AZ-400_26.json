Yes\n\nExplanation:\nAn action group in Azure Monitor is a core component of Azure's alerting mechanism. When an autoscale event occurs (scale-in or scale-out), it triggers an alert in Azure Monitor, which can invoke an action group. The action group defines how the alert is handled, such as sending an email notification, making it sufficient to meet the requirements.\n\nThe documentation you referenced highlights that Azure Monitor integrates with action groups to send notifications or trigger automated actions when there’s an issue with the infrastructure or application.
