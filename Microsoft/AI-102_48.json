Then, you can use that accessor to get and manipulate that property of your bot's state.\n\nThe accessors allow the SDK to get state from the underlying storage, and update the bot's state cache for you. The state cache is a local cache maintained by your bot that stores the state object for you, allowing read and write operations without accessing the underlying storage.

Bots preserve and manage their state through the usage of storage objects and state management.\n\nYes is CORRECT because the Bot Framework SDK allows the bot to create and maintain objects like ConversationData in the underlying in-memory storage during the bot's runtime. In-memory storage is used to store and access state properties such as ConversationData and UserProfile through state accessors. While this storage is volatile and cleared when the bot restarts, it functions as the underlying storage layer during the active session.\n\nNo is CORRECT. When the Bot Framework we defined is terminated it will lose all access to previous conversational data as the data stored in memory is temporary and disappears when the Bot Framework runtime terminates.","comment_id":"1355919","timestamp":"1739410020.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1731866580.0","content":"Save some time and ignore Bot Framework.
