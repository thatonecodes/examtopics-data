This means that salespeople would only be able to see the columns that they need to see, such as the customer's name, address, and email address. They would not be able to see the credit card information, which would be encrypted and hidden from them.\n\nAlways Encrypted is a good option for protecting sensitive data that needs to be accessed by multiple users. However, it is not as suitable for this scenario because it encrypts the entire table, including the columns that salespeople need to see. This would make it difficult for salespeople to do their jobs.\n\nHere is a summary of why column-level security is the better choice in this case:\n\nColumn-level security is more granular and allows you to control access to specific columns.\nColumn-level security does not impact the performance of queries as much as Always Encrypted.\nColumn-level security is easier to implement and manage.","comment_id":"1132134","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Azure_2023","comments":[{"comment_id":"1402259","content":"From what i understand from the link in the bottom always encrypted can be used on column and cell level?
