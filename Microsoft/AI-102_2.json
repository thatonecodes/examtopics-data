Like other PaaS services in Azure, you can deploy your service with public access (i.e. in this case they just call it public endpoint) and configure your private access after with a private endpoint.

Here's why: By deploying the search service and the endpoint to the same virtual network, you create a private, secure connection between the web app and the search service. And by using Azure Private Link, you're creating a private, dedicated connection between the two services, which means traffic doesn't have to go over the public internet. This not only increases security but also improves performance and reliability. So, deploying the service to a new virtual network and configuring Azure Private Link would definitely meet the goal of connecting app1 directly to service1 without using the public internet.","poster":"natgurulearning","timestamp":"1701441180.0","upvote_count":"3","comments":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1177903","upvote_count":"1","content":"I misread.
