Consider the following before making the switch:\nUsers with full access (users that are assigned the Global Administrator or Security Administrator directory role in Azure AD), are automatically assigned the default Defender for Endpoint administrator role, which also has full access. Additional Azure AD user groups can be assigned to the Defender for Endpoint administrator role after switching to RBAC. Only users assigned to the Defender for Endpoint administrator role can manage permissions using RBAC.\nUsers that have read-only access (Security Readers) will lose access to the portal until they are assigned a role.
