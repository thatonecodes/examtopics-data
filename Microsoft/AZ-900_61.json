When you enable LRS for your storage account, Azure automatically replicates your data within the same region to three different storage clusters, which are located in separate fault domains.\n\nWith LRS, you get three copies of your data within the same region, which helps to ensure that your data is available and protected against potential disasters or outages.\n\nLRS is typically used to protect data that does not require the highest level of durability or availability, such as test or development data.
