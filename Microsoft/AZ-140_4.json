Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\n\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\n\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.\n\n\nTo start the case study\n-\nTo display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. If the case study has an All Information tab, note that the information displayed is identical to the information displayed on the subsequent tabs. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nOverview\n-\n\nLitware, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company that has a main office in Boston, United States, and a remote office in Chennai, India.\n\nExisting Environment. Identity Environment\n\nThe network contains an on-premises Active Directory domain named litware.com that syncs to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named litware.com.\n\nThe Azure AD tenant contains the users shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nAll users are registered for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n\nExisting Environment. Cloud Services\n\nLitware has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription associated to the Azure AD tenant. All users are assigned Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 licenses.\n\nLitware has an Azure subscription associated to the Azure AD tenant. The subscription contains the resources shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nLitware uses custom virtual machine images and custom scripts to automatically provision Azure virtual machines and join the virtual machines to the on-premises Active Directory domain.\n\nExisting Environment. Network and DNS\n\nThe offices connect to each other by using a WAN link. Each office connects directly to the internet.\n\nAll DNS queries for internet hosts are resolved by using DNS servers in the Boston office, which point to root servers on the internet. The Chennai office has caching-only DNS servers that forward queries to the DNS servers in the Boston office.\n\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes\n-\n\nLitware plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Deploy Azure Virtual Desktop environments to the East US Azure region for the users in the Boston office and to the South India Azure region for the users in the Chennai office.\n• Implement FSLogix profile containers.\n• Optimize the custom virtual machine images for the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.\n• Use PowerShell to automate the addition of virtual machines to the Azure Virtual Desktop host pools.\n\nRequirements. Performance Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following performance requirements:\n\n• Minimize network latency of the Azure Virtual Desktop connections from the Boston and Chennai offices.\n• Minimize latency of the Azure Virtual Desktop host authentication in each Azure region.\n• Minimize how long it takes to sign in to the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.\n\nRequirements. Authentication Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following authentication requirements:\n\n• Enforce Azure MFA when accessing Azure Virtual Desktop apps.\n• Force users to reauthenticate if their Azure Virtual Desktop session lasts more than eight hours.\n\nRequirements. Security Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following security requirements:\n\n• Explicitly allow traffic between the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts and Microsoft 365.\n• Explicitly allow traffic between the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts and the Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure.\n• Use built-in groups for delegation.\n• Delegate the management of app groups to Admin2, including the ability to publish app groups to users and user groups.\n• Grant Admin1 permissions to manage workspaces, including listing which apps are assigned to the app groups.\n• Minimize administrative effort to manage network security.\n• Use the principle of least privilege.\n\nRequirements. Deployment Requirements\n\nLitware identifies the following deployment requirements:\n\n• Use PowerShell to generate the token used to add the virtual machines as session hosts to an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool.\n• Minimize how long it takes to provision the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts based on the custom virtual machine images.\n• Whenever possible, preinstall agents and apps in the custom virtual machine images.\n\n\nUser Profile Requirements\n-\n\nLitware identifies the following user profile requirements:\n\n• In storage1, store user profiles for the Boston office users.\n• Ensure that the user profiles for the Boston office users replicate synchronously between two Azure regions.\n• Ensure that Admin1 uses a local profile only when signing in to the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.\n\n\nYou need to configure a conditional access policy to meet the authentication requirements.\n\nWhat should you include in the policy configuration? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/117465-exam-az-140-topic-1-question-24-discussion/","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-140/image232.png","https://img.examtopics.com/az-140/image233.png","https://img.examtopics.com/az-140/image234.png"],"unix_timestamp":1691310480,"answer_ET":"","isMC":false},{"id":"JX9vfrqIdOcLnReSfmW8","answer":"","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1301985","timestamp":"1729676760.0","content":"Host pool: Pooled\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/terminology\nLoad-balancing algorithm: Breadth-first \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/configure-host-pool-load-balancing?tabs=portal","poster":"barxan1","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/150106-exam-az-140-topic-1-question-25-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-10-23 11:46:00","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nPlease sort new questions by topic.\n\nYou have an Azure Virtual Desktop deployment.\n\nYou plan to create a new host pool that meets the following requirements:\n\n• Supports up to 25 user connections\n• Contains 10 Windows 11 multi-session hosts\n• Evenly distributes user sessions across the session hosts\n\nYou need to recommend which type of host pool and load-balancing algorithm to use.\n\nWhat should you recommend?
