Only dialogs for now. MS recommends replacing asyn workflows with PA flows, but real-time workflows still work and have not been deprecated in any way.\nIn this case, PA is async, so it doesn't make sense to \"prompt\" the user. Only JS and real-time workflows can do it. \nBut the only way a real-time workflow can prompt the user is by forcing an error..... and then opp will not be closed (because same transaction). And also, if it is done like this, any attempt to close an opportunity will fail, not only those that the user tries to close from the form but any attempt to close the opportunity, therefore it is not a valid option.\nSo, better answer is A (JavaScript)","poster":"rogrod","upvote_count":"3"}],"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"638883"},{"comment_id":"627548","content":"Business Rule + JavaScript.
