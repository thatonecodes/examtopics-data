This cmdlet is specifically designed for querying Group Policy Objects in a Windows environment and provides detailed information about each policy, including those that have been applied to Microsoft Edge.\nOn the other hand, the \"gpresult\" command with the \"/H\" parameter is a general-purpose command that provides information about the policies applied to a computer, but it may not provide as much detail as the Get-GPO cmdlet. Additionally, \"gpresult\" is an older tool that is not specifically designed for querying GPOs in a Windows environment, and its functionality is limited compared to the newer \"Get-GPO\" cmdlet.\nIn conclusion, if you need to generate a report that contains all the Microsoft Edge policy settings applied to a computer, it is recommended to use the \"Get-GPO\" cmdlet from PowerShell for more accurate and detailed results.","comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"Actually A is completely wrong.\n\nWe need to get the LGPO as well, I forgot to read again the statement in the question: \"and local Group Policy Objects (GPOs)\".\n\nD will be right and complete.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1677342240.0","comment_id":"821637","poster":"flabezerra"}],"poster":"flabezerra","comment_id":"821629","timestamp":"1677341760.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Considering that this cmdlet is exclusive for domain, you might be right about this answer.\n\nsource: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/get-gpo?view=windowsserver2019-ps"}],"timestamp":"1676194980.0","poster":"CSue"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nsince \"edge://policy\" is not an option I'll go with D","comment_id":"709848","timestamp":"1667397540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Saad91"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1665585840.0","poster":"Szaier","comment_id":"693176","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI vote for D"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"The Get-GPOReport cmdlet is \"for a specified Group Policy Object (GPO) or for all GPOs in a domain.\"\nThis doesn't include local policy.
