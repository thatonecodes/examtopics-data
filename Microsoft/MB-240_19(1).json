Monday to Friday every other week. Wednesday to Sunday every other week.\n• Installers\n- Work 8am-6pm Monday to Friday.\n- Assigned to multiple stores in a geographic region.\n• Repair Technicians\n- Normal work hours 8am-6pm Monday to Friday.\n- Nights and weekends for emergencies only, based on availability.\n- These are all subcontractors.\n• Dispatchers\n- Assigned to all territories in the region.\n- Assign repair and installation work to technicians based on skill.\n\nAll internal delivery, repair and installation employees will utilize the Field Service mobile app. Litware, Inc. employees will have full-service licenses, while subcontractors will not.\n\n\nOverview. Regions\n-\n\nDispatchers can see all work request data for their region, including resources.\n\nThe United States regions are:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nCanadian regions are broken down by province where Litware, Inc. either has stores or provides services:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nExisting Environment. Data management structure\n\nLitware, Inc, store employees can see data within their region. This is to provide better support of customers and stores within the regions.\n\nThe current data access structure appears as follows:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nExisting Environment. Field Service difficulties\n\nTypical job assignment is as follows:\n• Appliance Delivery & Hookup: 2 resources - subcontracted out\n• Landscaping: minimum 2 resources. 1 expert\n• Carpeting: 2-3 resources\n• Tile Flooring: 2 resources\n• Kitchen Cabinets: 3 resources\n• Hardwood Flooring: 2 resources\n• Repairs: 1-2 resources\n\nA spreadsheet tracks the skills and certifications earned by each internal employee. They are:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe Skill Proficiency Model used at Litware, Inc. is as follows:\n1- Novice\n2 - Inexperienced\n3 - Moderate Experience\n4 - Experienced\n5 - Expert/Certified\n\nFor each type of job, there must be at least one certified or highly experienced resource on the job. Their current system does not have a way to share technical documents and instructions with the technicians and have them review it while onsite.\n\nAll work is printed out and the provided to the resources. Contractors are currently emailed the job details to which they need to confirm availability. Contractors sometimes decline work. In some of these cases, the Litware, Inc. dispatch team does not react quickly to this information and the customer’s work or delivery is delayed.\n\nExisting Environment. Customer base\n\nCurrently all customers and their data are held in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (D365 F&O).\n• Most store employees do not have access to this data as it is currently being implemented for backend features, such as inventory and invoicing.\n• Designers and those scheduling can pull up a customer and their pending orders and installations, but they cannot see the payment details and terms.\n\n85% of Litware’s customers are households.\n\n15% are construction-based companies that either purchase or hire Litware, Inc. for specific jobs.\n• Most of these companies receive a 5-10% discount on supplies and 10% discount on labor.\n• Some are Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) and they receive a flat 15% discount.\n\n\nRequirements.
