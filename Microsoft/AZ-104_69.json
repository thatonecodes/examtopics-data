AI answer to this is as follows:\nResizing an Individual VM:\nWhen you change the size (SKU) of an individual VM within the VMSS (e.g., from a smaller size to a larger one), only that specific VM is resized.\nThe other VMs in the VMSS remain unaffected.\nThe resized VM may need to be restarted to apply the new size.\nIn summary, resizing an individual VM within a VMSS does not automatically resize all VMs in the set. You’ll need to manage each VM’s size independently. \nSo the answer is 1 for Box 1. \n Box 2= 1\nAutomatic OS updates update 20% of the VMs at once, with a minimum of 1 VM instance at a time.

The three modes for the upgrade policy are:\n\nAutomatic - In this mode, the scale set makes no guarantees about the order of VMs being brought down. The scale set may take down all VMs at the same time.\nRolling - In this mode, the scale set rolls out the update in batches with an optional pause time between batches.\nManual - In this mode, when you update the scale set model, nothing happens to existing VMs.\n1:\nHow does automatic OS image upgrade work?\nAn upgrade works by replacing the OS disk of a VM with a new disk created using the latest image version. Any configured extensions and custom data scripts are run on the OS disk, while persisted data disks are retained. To minimize the application downtime, upgrades take place in batches, with no more than 20% of the scale set upgrading at any time.","timestamp":"1612985820.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"mikl","timestamp":"1612816920.0","content":"The answer is 4 and 1.
