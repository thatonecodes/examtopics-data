I would go with 6 VMs for scale out . However for the scale-in, I would go with 4 VMS. \nMy reason for 4 VMS, is that Azure measure the average after the scale down. So, If it will scale down to 2 machines, all the load will go to those 2 machines which gives 50% CPU usage. it should 25*4 / 2 = 50 % which is okay, however after few seconds, the average would be 50* 4 / 2 which means 100%.
