This is typically used when you want to expose a service hosted in a container to the public.\n\nPrivate networking type would not allow you to configure DNS name label scope reuse because it doesn't expose the container instance to the public internet, and it typically operates within a virtual network (VNet) for private communication.\n\nCreating a new subnet on VNet1 (Option C) is related to configuring the network settings of the virtual network and isn't directly related to configuring DNS name label scope reuse for the container instance.\n\nA confidential SKU (Option D) is not related to DNS name label scope reuse or networking configurations.

According to my test (and also the answer from chatGPT), the private DNS zone has priority. It is the only one which is used if the request is going to a domain hosted by the private DNS zone. If the request is going to a domain which is not in the provate DNS zone, then the default or custom DNS for the VNET is used. Based on this, the answers are Y-Y-Y Why - because both VM1 and VM2 are linked to the private DNS zone, where we have the record for server1.contoso.com -> 131.107.3.3 Also, asuming that the missing explanation of the second table says \"VM4 is DNS server and it has the following records\", and VM3 points to this DNS server, it will see and resolve the server2.contoso.com -> 131.107.2.4.
