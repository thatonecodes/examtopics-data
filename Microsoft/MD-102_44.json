A required assignment ensures automatic installation. Since the requirement is based on users belonging to the marketing department, a user group assignment is appropriate. Intune will handle the installation on any Windows 11 device associated with that user.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1351158","content":"App2 (Line of Business app for Android): An Available assignment to a user group\nReasoning: App2 should be available for download for users in the HR department on personal Android devices that are not enrolled in Intune. An available assignment allows users to choose to download and install the app themselves. Since it's for users in HR, a user group assignment is correct. Because the devices are personal and not enrolled, Intune cannot require the installation.
