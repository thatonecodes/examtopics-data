In addition to providing regular maintenance for the properties of its clients, the company also offers manufacturing and installation of concrete landscaping blocks and edging.\n\nEmployees are divided into three areas:\n\n• Salespeople who primarily work remotely.\n• Office staff who are responsible for administrative tasks like accounting and estimating.\n• Service staff who take part in landscaping projects or the manufacturing process.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. uses Dynamics 365 Sales to manage accounts, contacts, and leads. The company estimates landscaping and concrete jobs by using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The spreadsheets contain calculations for labour and materials costs.\n\n\nCurrent estimation process -\n\n1. Salespeople go onsite to visit potential clients and initiate estimates by using a paper form to capture details of the work needed.\n2. When salespeople return home at the end of the day, they add any needed notes and drawings to the forms of the clients they visited. When the forms are complete, the salespeople email the forms to a designated member of the office staff.\n3. An office staff member enters the information into an Excel spreadsheet.\n4. The office manager assigns the jobs to one of two office staff responsible for creating estimates.\n5. The estimators work through the jobs from the oldest job to the newest.\n6. If an estimate is greater than $50,000, it must be reviewed by the office manager before work can begin.\n7. After a job is estimated and approved, it is sent to the service staff to implement.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. plans to continue its processes by using Microsoft Power Platform tools to allow users to work more efficiently.\n\n• Office workers and the office manager must be able to do the following: o Use a model-driven app. o Use email as their primary method of communication. o Be contacted automatically when they have been assigned an estimate to complete or review.\n• Salespeople must be able to do the following on their mobile device and while offline: o Calculate the cost of concrete. o Record notes and area measurements to calculate material costs. o Capture multiple pictures and drawings.\n• Both salespeople and office workers must be able to calculate the cost of the concrete portion of a job by using the same tool.\n• All data must be stored in Microsoft Dataverse.\no Quotes must be used to create estimates.\n A new column must be added to track approval status.\no A custom table must be used to store data collected by salespeople. o A Microsoft Power Automate flow must be used to convert the data captured by the salespeople into a quote. o Area measurements must be converted to the quantity of units required to cover the area. The unit conversion must round up for quote lines. o Quotes must only display lines that have values greater than 0.\n• Customizations must be done by using out-of-the-box tools.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• Salespeople are unable to save data to the custom table.\n• The Power Automate flow that creates quotes returns an error when a math function is used for measurements that contain no value.\n\nYou need to create the Power Automate flow to create a quote.\n\nWhich trigger should you use?","choices":{"D":"Instant, manually triggered from the mobile device","B":"Automated, when a record in the custom table is created","A":"Automated, 8 hours after a record in the custom table is created","C":"Scheduled, daily at 6:00 PM"},"question_id":137},{"id":"UAGjdswAc5uF2lBbbTTS","discussion":[{"content":"I think the correct Model is \"Form Processing\"","comments":[{"content":"you right !","comment_id":"288830","timestamp":"1613129880.0","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Faridee"}],"poster":"Mashmawy","upvote_count":"28","timestamp":"1601957040.0","comment_id":"193931"},{"content":"Answer is 'no' - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/prebuilt-entity-extraction","timestamp":"1608627060.0","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"249965","poster":"Zeus6"},{"comment_id":"1118557","timestamp":"1704891540.0","poster":"ericwy","upvote_count":"1","content":"Based on the AI models proposed by Microsoft on January 2024, I think the correct answer is \"Document processing\".
