No. Time groups are more to block than to make a schedule.\n\nWhile time groups can be useful for organizing schedules into broader categories (like morning and afternoon sessions), they don't inherently create the precise 30-minute slots required in this scenario. Time groups would be more appropriate if the requirement was to divide the day into larger blocks of time, rather than consistent short intervals.\nIn this case, using intervals set to 30 minutes will create a daily schedule for pediatricians that meets both stated requirements: 30-minute frequency for each slot and a full-day schedule with clear start and end times for each appointment. but the stress is more on the duration than the exact start time (every full hour).","timestamp":"1727754000.0","poster":"MrEz","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1291763"},{"content":"Fulfillment preferences break down into two features:\n• Intervals: Intervals display schedule assistant results in time slots that dictate start time of subsequent bookings.\n• Time groups: Enable schedulers to search and view results as blocks of time when using the schedule assistant.
