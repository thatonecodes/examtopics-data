According to the online documentation, the mechanism to supply these variables is handled by the event listener that calls the setContextProvider. If this listener isn’t running, then the context variables won’t be set when new chats are initiated, which matches the reported issue. In contrast, methods like getContextProvider are used to retrieve the variables once they’re set, rather than populating them.","timestamp":"1743222240.0","comment_id":"1411608"}]},{"poster":"Candy2002","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSounds logical to me","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1717545720.0","comment_id":"914969"}],"question_id":276,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"CtxYDA4vhhvIsQ9nJe4X","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/111142-exam-mb-230-topic-7-question-8-discussion/","answer_ET":"BCE","choices":{"A":"In Power Virtual Agents, enter the Power Virtual Agents Application ID.","B":"In the Power Virtual Agents topic, add the Transfer to Agent node in the End the conversation node.","E":"In Power Virtual Agents, select Transfer to agent.","C":"In the Omnichannel Administration app, add a user as a virtual agent.","D":"In Power Virtual Agents, disable the Teams channel."},"exam_id":77,"topic":"7","answer":"BCE","discussion":[{"poster":"Nyanne","comment_id":"1411611","content":"Selected Answer: ABE\nI think its A, E, B\nRefer to intial setup settings on this video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1n5IG-Ca3g","timestamp":"1743223980.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1718505120.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"wwhung","content":"The question is a bit outdated as Omnichannel Admin app is going to be deprecated in April 2023.\n\nRef: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-service/oc-admin-center\nWith the release of the Customer Service admin center app that consolidates admin experiences across the Customer Service suite, we announce that the following admin experiences are deprecated and no longer supported after April 2023.\n\nService Management area in the Customer Service Hub app\nOmnichannel admin center\nApp profile manager: Is removed in April 2023.","comment_id":"924803","comments":[{"content":"Agree.
