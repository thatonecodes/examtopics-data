Custom policies can enforce compliance but do not directly manipulate resources like NSGs.\n\nEffect of Policies: Policies can audit or deny the creation of resources that do not comply with defined rules. However, for the specific requirement of automatically blocking traffic (like TCP port 8080) between virtual networks, you would still need to implement the NSG rules manually or automate the deployment of NSGs with predefined rules.\n\nIn summary, a custom policy can help ensure that resources conform to certain standards, but it doesn't automatically configure NSGs to block specific traffic upon their creation.
