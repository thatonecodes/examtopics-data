Connectivity to Azure VNets is established by using virtual network connections. The global transit network architecture based on a hub-and-spoke connectivity model. The cloud hosted network ‘hub’ enables transitive connectivity between endpoints that may be distributed across different types of 'spokes'.\n\nSo the 3 on prem sites are Virtual WANs that connect to one hub either of the regions using Azure's internal networks to speed up the communication between regions.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"322334","timestamp":"1616899800.0","poster":"ddb116","comments":[{"comments":[{"comment_id":"323037","content":"The answer is B","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1616981700.0","poster":"ddb116"}],"comment_id":"323034","timestamp":"1616981640.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about\nThe above is wrong the offices are hubs and all together makes on Virtual WAN.","poster":"ddb116"}]},{"poster":"blablabla987","timestamp":"1616257440.0","comments":[{"poster":"isa_pr","content":"Right, but I really doubt here.
