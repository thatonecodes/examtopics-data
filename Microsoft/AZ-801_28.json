It does not inherently include the Log Analytics agent or configure the collection of Windows Firewall logs for Sentinel. Without additional steps (e.g., installing and configuring the Log Analytics agent separately), MDE onboarding alone does not enable Microsoft Sentinel to collect these logs.\n\nEven if MDE could be configured to send some data to a Log Analytics workspace (an optional and non-default setup), it is not the primary mechanism for collecting Windows Firewall logs, and the question specifies only the act of onboarding, not additional configurations.\n\nConclusion\nOnboarding Server1 to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint does not meet the goal of ensuring that Microsoft Sentinel can collect Windows Firewall logs from Server1. The solution lacks the necessary log collection mechanism (the Log Analytics agent) required by the Windows Firewall data connector.","timestamp":"1740355860.0","poster":"Krayzr","comment_id":"1360784"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Azure Bastion: Azure Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to virtual machines through the Azure portal over SSL. However, it requires the VM to have a functional network stack to establish a connection, which is not the case in this scenario where the network stack fails to initialize.\n\nC. Just-in-time (JIT) VM access: JIT VM access is a feature that allows controlled access to VMs by opening up inbound network connectivity for a limited period of time. Similar to Azure Bastion, it relies on the VM having a functional network stack, which is not possible when the network stack fails to initialize.\n\ntherefore option B is the correct answer\nthe Serial Console provides direct access to the VM's console without relying on a functional network stack, which is essential in this scenario where the network stack fails to initialize."}],"question_text":"You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server.\n\nThe operating system on VM1 fails to fully initialize its network stack, and you cannot establish a network connection.\n\nYou need to establish an interactive shell session.\n\nWhat should you use?","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/139969-exam-az-801-topic-5-question-26-discussion/","answer":"B","question_id":138,"timestamp":"2024-05-03 16:08:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Azure Bastion","B":"Serial console","C":"just-in-time (JIT) VM access"},"answer_description":""},{"id":"fI9BDYh1fUw6SBvzhkga","timestamp":"2024-08-01 15:09:00","question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
