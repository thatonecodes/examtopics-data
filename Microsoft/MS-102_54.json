Require password change is the MS recommendation for a compromised account (user with a high risk or high sign-in risk).\n\nFor the first one the question is unclear. To identity a user with compromised credentials we would go the the \"Risky Users\" blade. But if the question is about configuring a rule that apply an action on account with credentials shared on the dark Web (or the regular Web like GitHub repos), we would create either a conditional access policy (new way with only an Azure AD P1 license) or either a risk user policy inside the Azure AD Identity Protection blade (legacy way that require an Azure AD P2 license).\n\nTherefore the second one should be correct too, assuming that the question about configuring a rule that apply a specific action to compromised account (MS also say \"leaked credentials\" is some documentations).","comments":[{"comment_id":"1066545","content":"Thanks for sharing new way!","timestamp":"1699547340.0","poster":"NrdAlrt","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1694973720.0","content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk-user?source=recommendations \n\n\"admins with P2 can create CA policies incorporating Identity Protection risk policies\"\n\nalso references p2 required to utilize user risk in CA policies: \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-risk-based-sspr-mfa","upvote_count":"1","poster":"amurp35","comment_id":"1009995"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct (as expected :) ) but since I dont see the CA policy option as an answer they must be looking for the old risk policy option to set these up.

I am looking at the user risk policy setting that says \"allow access\" with a check box for require password change. And my vent means nothing - but I have to say it. How stupid is it that if a user's credentials are compromised and shared on the dark web you think requiring a password change is a good idea? Couldn't the person that has the credentials execute the password change and still have access because they know what they changed the password to? Wouldn't it make more sense to require multi factor authentication? More sense in a practical sense - not in a what do I have to answer in order to pass the exam sense.
