It is also NOT self-deploying profile as the option to prompt the user to accept the license agreement is GREYED OUT when configuring a self-deploying profile. Self-deployment mode is also specifically for shared devices/kiosks and isn't intended for individual users. A user-driven profile is our best answer here, although it's incomplete. To answer this question, we'd need to first create a NEW user-driven profile that allows the user to accept the license agreement.
