Certificate & C. Secret\nExplanation:\n\nTo allow App1 in your Azure tenant to authenticate and access App2 in the partner organization's Azure tenant, you typically use app-to-app authentication with OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow.\n\nThe two valid credential types for this authentication are:\n\n✅ A. Certificate – Apps can use a public-private key pair (certificate) for authentication, which is considered more secure than secrets.\n\n✅ C. Secret – Apps can use a client secret (a password-like string) to authenticate, though it's less secure than certificates.\nWhy not the others?\n\n❌ B. Managed Identity – Managed identities are used only within a single tenant and cannot be used across different Microsoft Entra tenants.\n\n❌ D. User Account – The client credentials flow does not involve interactive user authentication. Instead, App1 authenticates as itself.\n\n❌ E. One-time password – OTPs are for human users, not for app-to-app authentication.","timestamp":"1739716980.0","comment_id":"1357271","poster":"Shingie"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"armid","timestamp":"1739577780.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nteachically you could use guest user account, no?

A managed identity\nExplanation:\n\nTo ensure that VM1 and VM2 can retrieve data from SQL1 (Azure SQL Managed Instance) with minimal administrative effort, you should use Azure Managed Identity.\n\n✅ Managed identities allow Azure resources (like VMs) to authenticate and access other Azure services (like SQL Managed Instance) securely without storing credentials.\nWhy not the others?\n\n❌ A. A certificate – While certificates can be used for authentication, managing them requires more administrative overhead than a managed identity.\n\n❌ B.
