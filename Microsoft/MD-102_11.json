Here's why:\n\n Device restrictions (Windows 10 Team): This template focuses on restrictions for shared Windows 10 Team devices, not general OMA-URI settings.\n Identity protection: This template mainly deals with security configurations and access controls, not specifically OMA-URI settings.\n Device restrictions: Similar to the first option, this template targets device-wide restrictions and limitations, not general OMA-URI configuration.\n\nIn contrast, the \"Custom\" template allows you to directly define and configure settings using key-value pairs, including OMA-URI settings.
