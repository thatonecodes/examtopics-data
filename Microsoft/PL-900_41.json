The camera control in the canvas app is used to capture a photo of the receipt. This photo is then passed to the receipt processing model for analysis.\n\nThe photo token is the unique identifier for the photo or image captured by the camera control, and it's necessary to pass this token to the receipt processing model so that the model can process the receipt data (such as extracting the total amount, vendor name, date, and other details).\n\nSo, when implementing this, you need to capture a receipt image using the camera control and then provide the corresponding photo token to the AI Builder receipt processing model for it to process the receipt data.\n\nIn summary, yes, a photo token is required for receipt processing when using the camera control in a canvas app.","timestamp":"1744221360.0"}],"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nA company uses the receipt processing model of AI Builder in a canvas app to process expenses.\n\nFor each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true.

In this case, the notification points out that one of the company's stores has a higher sales value than the target sales value for the previous quarter. This type of observation typically indicates a significant anomaly because the sales performance is notably different from expectations (in this case, higher than the target), which is the basis for the notification.\n\nWhy not the other options?\nA.
