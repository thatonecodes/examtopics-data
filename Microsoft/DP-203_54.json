I asked ChatGPT and it didn't provice documentation source, but explained this:\n\nYou're right to ask for clarification. Unfortunately, Azure documentation does not always explicitly state which features are supported across different services, leading to confusion. However, based on current feature availability, here's the relevant context:\n\nAzure SQL Database supports dynamic data masking (DDM) through both the Azure portal UI and SQL commands.\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pools support DDM, but only through T-SQL commands like those executed via SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or other query tools.\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics documentation and features do not include portal-based support for dynamic data masking. Instead, the Synapse dedicated SQL pools only allow DDM configuration via T-SQL. You won’t find a corresponding section in the Synapse portal for dynamic data masking, as you would for Azure SQL Database.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"renan_ineu","timestamp":"1726582080.0","comment_id":"1285272"},{"comment_id":"1275423","timestamp":"1725089160.0","poster":"renan_ineu","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIn the provided documentation link, if you check the step-by-step guide at number 7, where the documentation instructs you to go to the Azure Portal, you'll see the email DDM format exactly as the question asks: 'aXXX@XXXX.com'.
