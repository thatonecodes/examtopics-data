While there may be some similarities in terms of configuration options, they are not identical.\n\nIn on-premises deployments, organizations typically have full control over their hardware and software configurations, which allows for a greater degree of customization and flexibility. However, this also requires significant upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure, as well as ongoing maintenance and upgrades.\n\nCloud computing, on the other hand, provides a more flexible, scalable and cost-effective alternative to on-premises deployments. Cloud providers offer a wide range of configuration options, but they may not always be identical to those available in on-premises environments. For example, some hardware and software configurations that are possible in on-premises deployments may not be available in the cloud, while cloud providers may offer additional configuration options that are not available on-premises.","comment_id":"894507"},{"poster":"Rohit2023","comment_id":"807361","upvote_count":"4","content":"I'll go with Yes | Yes | Yes\nSame configuration or more of that of onpremises deployment.","timestamp":"1676290440.0"},{"timestamp":"1675801320.0","poster":"Toto_OS","upvote_count":"3","content":"I think it should be Y-Y-Y. \nCould computing offfer same CONFIGURATIONS as on-prem.","comment_id":"801403"},{"poster":"azirila","timestamp":"1674125760.0","comment_id":"781035","upvote_count":"4","content":"answer is correct Yes/Yes/YES because second one is asked same configuration yes cloud offer the same configuration."},{"timestamp":"1673727660.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kazan","comment_id":"775897","content":"Y?Y.

In simplest terms, there are 3 copies per region with GRS or GZRS, so, yes, 6 copies.
