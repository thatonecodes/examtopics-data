Assigning the Reader role at the subscription level to Admin1 would not be sufficient to enable Traffic Analytics for an Azure subscription. The Reader role allows you to view all resources, but not make any changes. Enabling Traffic Analytics is considered a “write” operation, which cannot be performed under the Reader role.\n\nTo enable Traffic Analytics, Admin1 needs to have one of the following Azure roles at the subscription scope: Owner, Contributor, or Network Contributor. These roles include the Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write permission, which is required to enable Traffic Analytics. If none of these roles are assigned to Admin1, a custom role that supports the necessary actions at the subscription level should be assigned1.","poster":"stanislaus450","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1707707520.0"},{"content":"Answer is NO\n\n\nOwner\nContributor\nNetwork contributor and Monitoring contributor","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1145367","timestamp":"1707471300.0","poster":"RockyChak"},{"timestamp":"1705516260.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1125217","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAccording to the below link only the following roles have the required privileges\nOwner\nContributor\nNetwork contributor\nMonitoring contributor\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics#prerequisites","poster":"0byte"},{"poster":"Libny","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1121288","content":"seems like this was updated now only Onwer, Contributor or Network Contributor are allowed to do this. \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics#prerequisites","timestamp":"1705117740.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705038720.0","comment_id":"1120468","poster":"31c21da","content":"The question is not clearly stated.
