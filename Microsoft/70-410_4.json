When printing to a printer pool, the spooler will send waiting jobs to alternate ports. If the original or alternate ports are not available\nA printing pool is one logical printer connected to multiple printers through multiple ports of the print server. The printer that is idle receives the next document sent to the logical printer. This is useful in a network with a high volume of printing because it decreases the time users wait for their documents.\nA printing pool also simplifies administration because multiple printers can be managed from the same logical printer on a server. If one device within a pool stops printing, the current document is held at that device.\nThe succeeding documents print to other devices in the pool, while the delayed document waits until the nonfunctioning printer is fixed. Efficient printer pools have the following characteristics:\nAll printers in the pool are the same model.\nPrinter ports can be of the same type or mixed (parallel, serial, and network). It is recommended that all printers be in one location. Because it is impossible to predict which printer will receive the document, keep all printers in a pool in a single location. Otherwise, users might have a hard time finding their printed document.\nYou can create a printing pool to automatically distribute print jobs to the next available printer. A printing pool is one logical printer connected to multiple printers through multiple ports of the print server. The printer that is idle receives the next document sent to the logical printer.","answer_ET":"Explanation","isMC":true,"answer":"Explanation","unix_timestamp":1588939320,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/20044-exam-70-410-topic-2-question-38-discussion/","exam_id":37},{"id":"Df8Yvs4Dbwn5ln5izWOV","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1588955940.0","poster":"Joadeika","comment_id":"85776","upvote_count":"1","content":"B.
