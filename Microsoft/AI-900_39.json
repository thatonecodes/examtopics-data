So the answer will be Yes or No. That at the first look is sounding classification. Then it is talking about medical history - which means data is available (and would be labelled). That shows it is supervised; which again indicates that is could be classification (not clustering). But the question doesn't clearly tells whether the data is balanced or not. In true sense, all supervised anomaly at its core are classification but the major difference is the balance of data. Ideally, classification has balanced data so that there can be good distribution of cases between classes (two or more).. but when the data is imbalanced (say 98% vs 2%), then classification becomes difficult and special algorithms are used - such as anomaly detection. Normally medical cases in whole population are generally low compared to healthy. Now debate could be - should all such medical related use cases be used with anomaly algorithm or not?

It is a common metric for evaluating regression models.\nExplanation: Balanced accuracy is a classification metric used to handle imbalanced datasets. It calculates the average of recall obtained on each class.\nRelevance: Not applicable to regression.\nConclusion:\nFor evaluating a regression model, the correct metrics are:\n\nR² (Coefficient of Determination)\nRMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)"},{"poster":"rdemontis","comment_id":"909840","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nanswer and explanation are correct","timestamp":"1732944420.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1731682740.0","poster":"alexein74","comment_id":"898291","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nit's correct"},{"comment_id":"526542","upvote_count":"3","content":"RMSE , R2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) -> regression . remaining others regression in general","comments":[{"content":"correction --#remaining others classification#","timestamp":"1689672000.0","comment_id":"526543","poster":"TJ001","upvote_count":"1"}],"poster":"TJ001","timestamp":"1689672000.0"},{"content":"A and C are correct answers","timestamp":"1683041280.0","poster":"Marskmen","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"471741"}],"choices":{"B":"F1 score","D":"area under curve (AUC)","C":"root mean squared error (RMSE)","E":"balanced accuracy","A":"coefficient of determination (R2)"},"topic":"1","answers_community":["AC (100%)"],"question_id":194,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/65335-exam-ai-900-topic-1-question-51-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"AC","unix_timestamp":1635874080},{"id":"9ZH1OqiVZGmDRoYzQ9q4","timestamp":"2021-11-02 18:28:00","answer_ET":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0006100001.jpg"],"question_id":195,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/65336-exam-ai-900-topic-1-question-52-discussion/","topic":"1","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0006100002.jpg"],"unix_timestamp":1635874080,"answer":"","answers_community":[],"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nTo complete the sentence, select the appropriate option in the answer area.\nHot Area:\n//IMG//","exam_id":41,"isMC":false,"discussion":[{"poster":"47d9efb","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1344199","content":"Regression is the correct answer.
