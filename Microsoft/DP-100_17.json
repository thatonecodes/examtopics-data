Secondary access key\nExplanation:\nTo configure permanent access to an Azure Files share from an Azure Files datastore in an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you generally use the primary or secondary access key of the Azure Storage account that contains the file share. This provides long-term access without the need to renew credentials, as the access keys remain valid until they are manually regenerated.\n\nWhy the Other Options Don’t Meet the Goal:\nB. Anonymous access: Azure Files does not support anonymous access. Access requires authentication through either account keys, SAS tokens, or identity-based methods.\n\nC. Account SAS key: While an Account SAS key provides scoped access to storage resources, it is typically short-lived and must be regenerated periodically, making it unsuitable for permanent access.\n\nD. Service SAS key: Similar to the Account SAS, a Service SAS key is also short-lived and used for temporary access to specific resources. It must be renewed, so it does not meet the requirement for permanent access."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAccount SAS and Service SAS are both types of Shared Access Signatures in Azure, but they differ in terms of scope and control.\n\nAccount SAS:\n\nGrants access to resources within a storage account, such as blobs, files, queues, or tables.\n\nOffers broader permissions and can cover multiple services within the storage account.\n\nAllows you to specify permissions, including read, write, delete, list, and more for the entire account.\n\nService SAS:\n\nGrants access to specific resources within a single service, like a specific blob or file share.\n\nOffers more fine-grained control compared to Account SAS.\n\nAllows you to specify permissions and set constraints, like IP ranges, protocols, and expiration times, but only for the specified resource.","poster":"Arvindu89","comment_id":"1303469","timestamp":"1730000880.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1729777620.0","poster":"kfgg","comment_id":"1302480","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA user delegation SAS has a maximum expiry interval of 7 days, regardless of the SAS expiration policy.\n\nI think answer should be A?\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/sas-expiration-policy?tabs=azure-portal#configure-a-sas-expiration-policy\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nI never came across service sas key, only account sas key","poster":"jefimija","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1728906720.0","comment_id":"1297500"}],"answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_images":[]},{"id":"cfXLruZVJ53YNWLSIZcM","answer_ET":"D","topic":"2","unix_timestamp":1604861400,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/36488-exam-dp-100-topic-2-question-14-discussion/","timestamp":"2020-11-08 19:50:00","discussion":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1728106320.0","comment_id":"1293337","upvote_count":"1","poster":"dadofworld","content":"haha they will not metioned everything."},{"content":"it did mention oversampling","timestamp":"1628482380.0","comment_id":"421919","poster":"ckkobe24","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"578622","content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/component-reference/smote\n\nThe link is from Azure ML documentation.
