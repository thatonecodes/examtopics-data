Hence, you choose Capture on the existing host and ensure its operating system is in a Generalized state. This allows subsequent VMs created from that image to each receive a unique host name.","timestamp":"1738755780.0","poster":"hwoccurrence","comment_id":"1351838"}],"question_id":261,"exam_id":46,"answer_description":"","isMC":false,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/155470-exam-az-140-topic-6-question-37-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1737973980,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-140/image340.png"]},{"id":"yzpXQNOUVvUb98ISIsms","answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"2","C":"3","D":"4","A":"1"},"timestamp":"2024-10-29 15:27:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (86%)","14%"],"answer_description":"","answer":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. 1\nAccording to the documentation (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/vnet-peering):\nAzure Bastion works with the following types of peering:\nVirtual network peering: Connect virtual networks within the same Azure region.\nGlobal virtual network peering: Connecting virtual networks across Azure regions.\n\nSo, we will set up a \"Global virtual network peering\"","timestamp":"1732632300.0","comment_id":"1318124","upvote_count":"2","poster":"soysoliscarlos"},{"comment_id":"1308139","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAzure Bastion works with any type of Peering and since VNET1, VNET2 and VNET3 are peered together 1 Azure Bastion service is enough.","poster":"jeff1988","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1730924940.0"},{"timestamp":"1730573760.0","comment_id":"1306285","poster":"kam247","upvote_count":"2","content":"A - Is correct answer.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/vnet-peering"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIt seems incorrect, I think the correct answer is B\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/vnet-peering","comment_id":"1304491","comments":[{"comment_id":"1310282","content":"Azure Bastion can indeed work across peered virtual networks.
