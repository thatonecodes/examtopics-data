However, you can configure the health probe to check other ports, such as port 8080 in this case. If the application gateway determines that a backend server is unavailable, it can automatically redirect traffic to the other available backend server.","comment_id":"811045","upvote_count":"3"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"A","choices":{"D":"Add a new listener","A":"Create a health probe","B":"Add a new rule","C":"Change the port on the listener"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":58,"answer_images":[],"question_id":186,"unix_timestamp":1664217540,"topic":"3","question_text":"You have an Azure application gateway configured for a single website that is available at https://www.contoso.com.\nThe application gateway contains one backend pool and one rule.

Associating a connection to a route table allows the traffic to be sent to the destination indicated as routes in the route table.
