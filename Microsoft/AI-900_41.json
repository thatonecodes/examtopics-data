The trained model can then be used to make predictions.\n\nBox 2: Clustering -\nClustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation.\nOver the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.\n\nBox 3: Classification -\nTwo-class classification provides the answer to simple two-choice questions such as Yes/No or True/False.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/linear-regression","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0006800002.jpg"]},{"id":"aGHOPuObXf6YJh35SkpI","answer":"","answer_ET":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/33961-exam-ai-900-topic-1-question-6-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0000900002.png"],"question_id":203,"isMC":false,"answer_description":"Reliability and safety:\nAI systems need to be reliable and safe in order to be trusted.
