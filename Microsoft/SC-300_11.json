Here’s why:\n\nUser1 is already a guest in the tenant (B2B account). Since they have an existing guest identity in Fabrikam’s Azure AD, they can sign in with their existing credentials rather than needing a one‐time passcode.\n\nUser2 has never accessed Fabrikam, so when first invited, they are treated as a new external user. Because the tenant’s settings allow guests from “any domain” and one‐time passcodes are enabled, User2 will be emailed a passcode for sign‐in.\n\nUser3 is an internal user in Fabrikam (same domain), so they already have a native Fabrikam account. They will authenticate as a regular member, not via a guest passcode flow.\n\nThus, with the tenant configured for one‐time passcodes (and no existing guest account for User2), User 2 is the only one who will receive an emailed passcode.","timestamp":"1741869600.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer B:\nWhen does a guest user get a one-time passcode?\n\nWhen a guest user redeems an invitation or uses a link to a resource that has been shared with them, they’ll receive a one-time passcode if:\n\n- They don't have a Microsoft Entra account.\n- They don't have a Microsoft account.\n- The inviting tenant didn't set up federation with social (like Google) or other identity providers.\n- They don't have any other authentication method or any password-backed accounts.\n- Email one-time passcode is enabled.","comment_id":"1365854","timestamp":"1741260060.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"d1e85d9"},{"comment_id":"1364444","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhas to be B","poster":"mediamarkt","timestamp":"1741012680.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737497520.0","comment_id":"1344418","poster":"PD1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nUser2 only"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"josemariamr","timestamp":"1733387640.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOutlook is Microsoft account and is autheticated by Microsoft itself whithout needing passcodes.","comment_id":"1322278"},{"comment_id":"1306566","content":"This is currently in the test bank of questions and has a different option toggled for Guest Invite Settings.
