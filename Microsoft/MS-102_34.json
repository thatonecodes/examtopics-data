By modifying the list of allowed outbound domains to include the necessary domains for Azure AD Connect, you ensure that the synchronization can complete successfully.\n\nB. This option deals with configuration within Azure AD Connect, not addressing firewall restrictions that are causing the sync to fail.\n\nC Inbound rules are not typically the issue for directory synchronization; outbound access is necessary for Azure AD Connect to communicate with Azure AD services.\n\nD. Staging mode is used for testing and disaster recovery, not for resolving firewall issues.\n\nE. While allowing IP ranges could work, it's more practical and secure to allow specific domain names due to the dynamic nature of cloud service IP addresses."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/125012-exam-ms-102-topic-1-question-249-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"Your network contains an Active Directory domain and an Azure AD tenant.\n\nThe network uses a firewall that contains a list of allowed outbound domains.\n\nYou begin to implement directory synchronization.\n\nYou discover that the firewall configuration contains only the following domain names in the list of allowed domains:\n\n• *.microsoft.com\n• *.office.com\n\nDirectory synchronization fails.\n\nYou need to ensure that directory synchronization completes successfully.\n\nWhat is the best approach to achieve the goal?

You can set them up to recur at a defined interval (like 30 days) and require group owners to confirm that each guest user still needs access.\n\nHere's why the other options are not the best fit:\n\nGroup expiration policies: These are used to automatically expire and delete groups after a certain period of inactivity. This doesn't address the specific need to validate guest user membership.\nRetention policies: These are focused on preserving or deleting data, not on managing user access.\nConditional Access policies: These are used to control access to resources based on conditions like location, device, and user risk. While they can be part of a security strategy, they don't directly address the requirement for periodic guest user validation.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview","poster":"Krayzr","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1736606460.0","comment_id":"1339191"},{"timestamp":"1723097400.0","content":"C is correct","comment_id":"1144245","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Amir1909"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-11-05 23:07:00"}],"exam":{"provider":"Microsoft","isMCOnly":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"id":100,"name":"MS-102","numberOfQuestions":377},"currentPage":34},"__N_SSP":true}
