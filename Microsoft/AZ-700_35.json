Each rule consists of a listener, which specifies the protocol, port, and hostname to listen for, and a backend pool or target, which specifies the destination for traffic that matches the listener's criteria.\n\nIn this case, you can create a rule for each web app, specifying the hostname www.contoso.com and the URL path for the web app (e.g. /app1, /app2, etc.) as the listener criteria, and the corresponding virtual machine hosting the web app as the backend pool or target. This will allow you to control the flow of traffic based on the URL path, directing traffic to the appropriate virtual machine for each web app.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: rules.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Nicolas_UY","comment_id":"746704","timestamp":"1671157560.0"},{"content":"this question is around Path based routing, which can be configured under Routing Rule, answer C","timestamp":"1665104280.0","poster":"Prutser2","comment_id":"688182","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nURL path rules for routing to /app1 and /app2 etc.","timestamp":"1663817760.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"675712","poster":"AdityaGupta"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Alessandro365","timestamp":"1663695120.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC = rules","comment_id":"674386"},{"comment_id":"586038","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1649976180.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIs Correct.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/configuration-request-routing-rules","poster":"Edward1"},{"poster":"ronieto","timestamp":"1647351660.0","comment_id":"568425","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC Rules","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. rules","poster":"d0bermannn","comment_id":"558535","timestamp":"1646103780.0"},{"content":"This question was on the exam on 18th Feb 2022.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1645614420.0","poster":"rockethack","comment_id":"554405"},{"timestamp":"1644942600.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"547878","content":"Selected Answer: C\nPath based routing can be configured in Routing rules","poster":"Vinit_Singh"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Appeared in exam on 17/01/2022 with variation","timestamp":"1642410060.0","comment_id":"525607","poster":"Contactfornitish"},{"content":"on exam 1/6/2022","timestamp":"1641501060.0","comment_id":"518594","poster":"Pravda","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1638680100.0","poster":"Pamban","comment_id":"494079","upvote_count":"2","content":"appeared on exam 5th Dec 2021"},{"poster":"teamaws","timestamp":"1636624380.0","comment_id":"476118","content":"Correct, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/configuration-request-routing-rules#rule-type","upvote_count":"5"}],"exam_id":58,"question_text":"You have five virtual machines that run Windows Server.
