By distributing your virtual machines across multiple availability zones, you protect your services from failures at a single data center within the region, meeting the goal stated.","poster":"a9b26e8","comment_id":"1410694","timestamp":"1743038940.0"},{"upvote_count":"5","content":"I got this Ques on 6/3/2023.","poster":"RaviBanavath","timestamp":"1725604500.0","comment_id":"830644"},{"poster":"Sarmad_Mansour","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"775023","timestamp":"1720914300.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct!"},{"comment_id":"757254","poster":"buiducvu","timestamp":"1719383580.0","content":"A.
