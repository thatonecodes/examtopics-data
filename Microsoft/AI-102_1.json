Enabling CMK encryption will increase index size and degrade query performance. Based on observations to date, you can expect to see an increase of 30%-60% in query times, although actual performance will vary depending on the index definition and types of queries. Because of this performance impact, we recommend that you only enable this feature on indexes that really require it.
