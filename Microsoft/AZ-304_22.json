Second option is very obvious but first one is very strange.

Account because we specify MongoDB Server version we want to use for the account. But it is my understanding that CosmosDB uses wire protocol, meaning that MongoDB compatibility (i.e. Server version) is equivalent to API version. This is why we do not have create new Account to upgrade or downgrade MongoDB API.
