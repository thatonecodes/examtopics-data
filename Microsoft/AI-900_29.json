Language\n\nThe Language service, specifically the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component, is designed to extract meaning and intent from text inputs. It can analyze and understand the user's intent or purpose behind a given statement. By utilizing techniques such as intent recognition and language understanding models, the Language service can identify that the user's intent in the given input is to request a callback at a later time.\n\nAzure Cognitive Search (A) is a service focused on providing full-text search capabilities over structured and unstructured data, but it does not directly handle intent extraction from user inputs.\n\nTranslator (B) is a service that facilitates language translation between different languages, which is not directly related to intent extraction.\n\nSpeech (D) refers to services related to speech recognition and synthesis, focusing on converting spoken language into written text or generating speech from text. While speech recognition may be involved in processing the user input, it is not specific to intent extraction from text inputs.","comment_id":"930563","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1687439880.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"943428","poster":"takusui","content":"I think you meant to reply to Q228.","timestamp":"1688542380.0"},{"poster":"PeteColag","content":"Language is not part of the choices.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1074795","timestamp":"1700415960.0"}],"poster":"redsoxfred"}],"exam_id":41,"answer_description":""}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":246,"name":"AI-900","id":41,"provider":"Microsoft","isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":29},"__N_SSP":true}
