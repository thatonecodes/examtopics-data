The question talks only about mail forwarding. I think the transcription might be wrong, but either it's a deal where the user enabled forwarding and is trying to complain that email is NOT being forwarded; or it's a deal where the user enabled forwarding, is reporting that forwarding is working, but the org doesn't want that. Either way, it's Anti-Spam. To enable or disable forwarding organization-wide, you make an Anti-Spam policy: Microsoft 365 Admin Center -> Show All -> Security -> Email and Collaboration -> Policies and Rules -> Anti-Spam Policies -> Create Policy -> Outbound -> Next -> Next. Now you're on the \"Protection Settings\" screen, and there's a menu right in the middle, \"Forwarding Rules / Automatic Forwarding Rules\" with choices \"Automatic\", \"On\", and \"Off\". This is where you enable or disable forwarding.\nFor these reasons, my vote is A: Anti-Spam"},{"timestamp":"1674586860.0","poster":"TtotheA2021","content":"Selected Answer: B\nexactly, it's confusing but I guess it's about sensitive information that has been shared.....\n\nData Loss Prevention (DLP) rules are used to detect and prevent sensitive information from being sent outside of the organization. DLP rules can be used to block or quarantine email that contains certain keywords, phrases, or patterns. DLP rules can also be used to block email from being forwarded to external recipients.\n\nYou can use DLP rule to prevent email from being forwarded to external recipients, this can be done by creating a DLP policy and configure a rule to detect and block emails that are being forwarded to external recipients.\n\nAnti-spam policy is used to protect the organization from unwanted email, it is not related to the issue of automatic email forwarding.\n\nAnti-phishing policy is used to detect and block phishing emails, it is not related to the issue of automatic email forwarding.\n\nConnection filter policy is used to block unwanted email based on IP address, domain, or other criteria, it is not related to the issue of automatic email forwarding.","comment_id":"786826","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1670420280.0","poster":"Chrissie73","upvote_count":"1","content":"Thanks, exactly my thought on it","comment_id":"737905"},{"comment_id":"727131","poster":"Glen711","content":"I'm confused here.\n1.
