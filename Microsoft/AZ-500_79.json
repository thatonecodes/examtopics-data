As a result of long tests, I would choose User1 only for the second box as we saw Key Vault Contributor could not add all settings for Network of Azure key vault.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Box-1: User1, User3, \nBox:2- User1","comment_id":"1240646","poster":"Jimmy500","comments":[{"timestamp":"1741711080.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"These are the Contributor role permissions\n\"actions\": [\n \"*\"\n ],\n \"notActions\": [\n \"Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete\",\n \"Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write\",\n \"Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/Action\",\n \"Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/write\",\n \"Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/delete\",\n \"Microsoft.Compute/galleries/share/action\",\n \"Microsoft.Purview/consents/write\",\n \"Microsoft.Purview/consents/delete\",\n \"Microsoft.Resources/deploymentStacks/manageDenySetting/action\",\n \"Microsoft.Subscription/cancel/action\",\n \"Microsoft.Subscription/enable/action\"","poster":"Hot_156","timestamp":"1741783140.0","comment_id":"1387867","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1387539","content":"I did test this, and I can manipulate Network properties with the Key Vault contributor role\n\nBox 2 - User 1 and User 4","poster":"Hot_156"}],"timestamp":"1719910980.0"}]}]}],"upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Delegate permissions for ContosoKey1: User 1 and User 3 Configure network access to ContosoKey1: User 1 and User 4\nKey Vault Contributor role definition includes Microsoft.KeyVault/*, which means it has full rights and can therefore modify network access\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#key-vault-contributor","poster":"wardy1983","timestamp":"1699307880.0","comment_id":"1064296"},{"comment_id":"1043278","upvote_count":"1","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1697274660.0","content":"Tested in the lab \nConfigure network access to ContosoKey1: User 1 and User 4\nI gave User 4 keyvault contributor and was able to add my public IP to the network allow list, when I was logged in as User4","comments":[{"comment_id":"1240626","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Jimmy500","timestamp":"1719907080.0","content":"You can not any vnet with just Key Vault Contributor Access , you can only do 2 things 1-Allow Public access from all networks in the firewall and virtual network settings, and second one is Disable public access, there is nothing else besides these you can do with just Key vault contributor role"}]},{"poster":"TheProfessor","timestamp":"1696737180.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answers are correct.\n\nKey Vault Contributor\nManage key vaults, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, and does not allow you to access secrets, keys, or certificates.
