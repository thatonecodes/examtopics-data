When a forest trust is created, a transitive trust is created between the forest root domains in both forests. This allows all the members in the forest to exchange authentication information with the other forest. The forest trust is also called an explicit trust between the two forests. If an additional forest trust is created between one of the original forests and a third forest, an implicit trust with the other original forest is not established to the third forest.

First off the question doesn't make explicit whether these are transitive or non-transitive trusts and one way or two way.
