Processes help guarantee consistency for the people who are involved in cases, and also help employees resolve cases faster and more efficiently.

To control which employees have access to view, create, and update different types of cases, you can assign security roles to case category types. You must determine which security roles should have access to the various case category types.\n\nBox 3: Case workflow -\nYou can setup cases in a deeper way by using workflows in Organization administration.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/plan-case-management","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1703281380.0","comment_id":"1103734","upvote_count":"2","poster":"zbiti","content":"1.
