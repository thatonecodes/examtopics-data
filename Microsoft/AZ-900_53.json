As 1 and 2 are obvious for question 3 consider below:\n\nThe statement is partially correct, but it has a misleading element. A platform as a service (PaaS) solution, such as Azure App Service, indeed hosts web apps and provides tools and services to streamline development and deployment processes. However, it does not inherently include professional development services to continuously add features to custom applications.\n\nPaaS solutions offer infrastructure, development frameworks, and other resources that enable developers to build, test, and deploy applications efficiently. It's up to organizations or developers themselves to add features or maintain custom applications. They might employ their own development team or outsource this work to professional developers—but that's not directly provided by the PaaS solution.\n\nTo retain: \" it does not inherently include professional development services\", this is an add-on possibility!","comment_id":"1410278","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742975580.0","poster":"Janaf"},{"timestamp":"1741755120.0","content":"NYN\n PaaS abstracts the underlying infrastructure, including the operating system, so you do \nnot have full control over it.

Azure offers a free account option that allows users to try out various Azure services for free. However, this free account has certain limitations and restrictions, and it does expire after a specific period of time if you do not upgrade to a paid account. \nThe Azure free account provides you with a limited amount of free services for 12 months, including access to popular Azure products such as Virtual Machines, App Service, and Storage. You also get free monthly credits to use toward other Azure services during that period. After the 12-month period, your account will be converted to a pay-as-you-go account, and you will be charged for any usage beyond the free services that were provided during the free trial.\nIt's important to keep track of your usage and monitor your billing to avoid unexpected charges.
