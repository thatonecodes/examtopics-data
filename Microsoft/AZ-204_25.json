When the app is scaled down to 0 instances, no requests are being processed, and the scale rule does not have any effect.\n\nTherefore, if you want the HTTP scale rule to work, you need to ensure that there are at least one or more instances of the app running.","timestamp":"1710938160.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1707577800.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1146392","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThough Enable Ingress, Set Scale rule to Http is correct, it will work based on Http traffic coming in when the Instance is already running. But it doesn't address the problem mentioned in the question - where it already scaled down to 0 instances. So to address this first, we need to ensure that there is at least one instance of the container app running to handle incoming requests. This may involve adjusting the scaling settings, configuring minimum instance limits, or implementing a health check mechanism to keep at least one instance running at all times, even during periods of low traffic.","poster":"Ushakanth"},{"content":"A is correct since scale rule can be HTTP\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/scale-app?pivots=azure-cli#:~:text=Scale%20rules%20are%20implemented%20as%20HTTP%2C%20TCP%2C%20or%20custom.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705403460.0","poster":"emysa341","comment_id":"1124125"},{"content":"Answer is A:\nEnabling Ingress: This would allow external traffic to reach the container app, which is necessary for users to access the app from outside the Azure network.\nCreating an HTTP Scale Rule: Azure Container Apps can automatically scale based on various metrics, including HTTP traffic.

Ingress relates to the network traffic coming into the app, and scale rules define when and how the app scales based on certain conditions. However, they won't directly bring the app back to running instances if it has scaled down to 0.\n\nTo address the issue of the app having 0 instances, you might need to investigate why the app scaled down and take appropriate action, such as adjusting the scaling settings, reviewing resource constraints, or identifying any issues in the app itself.","poster":"manopeydakon","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1117379"}],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2024-01-09 11:20:00","exam_id":48,"answer":"B","question_id":125,"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Microsoft","id":48,"isImplemented":true,"name":"AZ-204","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":452,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":25},"__N_SSP":true}
