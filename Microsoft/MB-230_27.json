The activity can then be assigned to a user or team that has access to the queue. This helps to categorize and prioritize the activities based on their type or purpose.\n\nQueues for cases: When a case is created, it can be added to a specific queue based on its type or priority. The case can then be assigned to a user or team that has access to the queue. This helps to categorize and prioritize the cases based on their type or priority.\n\nBy categorizing activities and cases using queues, it becomes easier to manage and prioritize work based on its type, purpose, or priority.
