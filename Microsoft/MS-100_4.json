With pass-through authentication, user sign-in credentials are verified against the on-premises Active Directory, providing a secure and highly available authentication method. User passwords are not stored in the cloud, ensuring that they remain on-premises.\n\nSeamless SSO further simplifies the user experience by allowing users to access Microsoft 365 services without having to enter their credentials again. This is accomplished through the use of Kerberos authentication, which enables the user's on-premises credentials to be used for authentication to Microsoft 365 services.\n\nBoth pass-through authentication and seamless SSO can be implemented using the current server infrastructure, without the need for additional hardware or software.
