Yes\n\nExplanation:\n\nRegistering the MLflow model in the Azure Machine Learning workspace is a necessary step before deploying the model to a batch endpoint. The model must be registered so that it can be referenced during deployment. Once registered, you can create a batch deployment that uses the model along with the appropriate compute resources. Therefore, registering the model meets the goal of ensuring that the model can be deployed to the batch endpoint.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730204760.0","poster":"jefimija"}],"exam_id":64,"choices":{"A":"Yes","B":"No"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/149364-exam-dp-100-topic-2-question-128-discussion/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-10-14 13:39:00","question_id":76,"unix_timestamp":1728905940,"topic":"2","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":""},{"id":"pNKvGfWWxeBcbsTLLfSJ","answer":"C","exam_id":64,"choices":{"B":"Azure Databricks","A":"Azure Data Lake Analytics","C":"Azure Container Service","D":"Apache Spark for HDInsight"},"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1592327820,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/23269-exam-dp-100-topic-2-question-13-discussion/","topic":"2","isMC":true,"question_id":77,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-06-16 19:17:00","answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"poster":"cenkersoy","comment_id":"111778","timestamp":"1592327820.0","content":"Should it not say \"deploying the trained model\" instead of \"workspace\" ?","upvote_count":"18"},{"comment_id":"125350","poster":"modschegiebsch","timestamp":"1593749340.0","comments":[{"timestamp":"1622400360.0","comment_id":"370396","content":"no, its not retired. its still used fir development","poster":"prashantjoge","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1605725580.0","comment_id":"222183","content":"You are right.

It provides a collaborative and scalable environment specifically designed for data engineering and data science tasks. With Azure Databricks, you can leverage the power of Apache Spark for distributed data processing and machine learning tasks, making it an ideal compute target for data science workloads.\n\nAzure Container Service, on the other hand, is a container orchestration service that supports various container runtimes, such as Docker and Kubernetes. While it can be used to deploy machine learning models encapsulated in containers, it is not optimized for the specific requirements of a data science workspace and may not provide the same level of integration and ease of use as Azure Databricks.\n\nTherefore, in this context, the recommended choice for deploying the data science workspace using Azure Machine Learning service is B.

Azure Databricks is the most accurate answer if you're looking to deploy a data science workspace using Azure Machine Learning service as a compute target. Azure Databricks is a fast, easy, and collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics platform that helps you build and deploy machine learning models. It provides a seamless integration with the Azure Machine Learning service and offers features such as auto-scaling, collaboration and management of the machine learning workflow, and a secure and scalable infrastructure for running your data science projects.\nWhile you can run machine learning models inside containers in Azure Container Service, it doesn't provide the seamless integration and specific features for managing and deploying machine learning models that Azure Databricks does.
