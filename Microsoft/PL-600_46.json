This is because creating an app for each job role allows for customization based on the specific needs and tasks of each role, such as IT staff and managers. This approach simplifies maintenance, updates, and training while providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience for employees.\n\nOption C (one app for all employees of the team) might be easier to implement initially, but it may not address the unique needs and requirements of each job role as effectively as option A.
