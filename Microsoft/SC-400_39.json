Trainable classifiers in Microsoft 365, specifically sensitive information types, can be trained to recognize patterns in data, including file names, and apply actions based on the identified patterns.\n\nIn this scenario, you would create a trainable classifier that recognizes the naming format of the project documents (e.g., files with names like \"aei_AA989.docx\"). Once trained, you can use the trainable classifier to create an auto-apply retention label policy that automatically applies the label to documents that match the specified naming pattern.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
