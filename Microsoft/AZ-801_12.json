If Node3 fails, App1 will fail over to Node2 automatically.\nNo\n\nThe Failover tab does not specify a direct failover target, such as Node2, for App1. The General tab shows that App1 is currently running on Node2, but the preferred owners are listed in the following order: Node1, Node3, and Node4. If Node3 fails while hosting App1, the cluster will attempt to fail over to the next available preferred owner based on this list. Since Node1 is the most preferred owner, the cluster would try to move App1 to Node1 if it is available, or to Node4 if Node1 is not available.

However, the General tab lists the preferred owners as Node1 (most preferred), Node3, and Node4. After App1 fails over from Node3 to another node (e.g., Node1 or Node4) and Node3 is repaired, automatic failback would prioritize the most preferred owner, Node1, if it is available. The configuration does not explicitly state that App1 will automatically fail back to Node3 specifically. Instead, failback behavior depends on the cluster’s policies and the availability of higher-preference nodes like Node1.
