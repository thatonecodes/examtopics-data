A site map is a navigation menu that shows the different areas and subareas of an app, such as Sales, Marketing, Service, etc. A site map can help the user find the app or table that contains a business process flow, but it does not display the steps and stages of the flow itself. For example, if the user wants to access the Lead to Opportunity Sales Process, they can use the site map to go to the Sales area, and then select the Leads table. However, to see the actual business process flow, they need to use the command bar at the top of the app. Does that make sense?","poster":"Edriska"}],"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ananana","content":"Selected Answer: D\ncorreto","comment_id":"962028","timestamp":"1690230960.0"}],"exam_id":114,"answer_description":"","answer":"B","choices":{"D":"site map","B":"command bar","C":"dashboard","A":"form"},"answer_images":[],"question_id":131,"unix_timestamp":1690230960,"answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-07-24 22:36:00","answers_community":["B (75%)","13%","13%"],"topic":"2","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/116340-exam-pl-100-topic-2-question-64-discussion/","question_text":"You create a model-driven app for salespeople.\n\nUsers must interact with a business process flow that involves multiple tables.\n\nYou need to instruct users where to find the business process flow.\n\nWhich component should you use?"},{"id":"dQCpRRcFhh9qWeoHrfJE","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1702968780,"exam_id":114,"question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nYou use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales.\n\nBusiness processes must use data from multiple applications.\n\nYou need to implement the correct type of automation.\n\nWhich flow type should you use?

In addition to providing regular maintenance for the properties of its clients, the company also offers manufacturing and installation of concrete landscaping blocks and edging.\n\nEmployees are divided into three areas:\n\n• Salespeople who primarily work remotely.\n• Office staff who are responsible for administrative tasks like accounting and estimating.\n• Service staff who take part in landscaping projects or the manufacturing process.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. uses Dynamics 365 Sales to manage accounts, contacts, and leads. The company estimates landscaping and concrete jobs by using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The spreadsheets contain calculations for labour and materials costs.\n\n\nCurrent estimation process -\n\n1. Salespeople go onsite to visit potential clients and initiate estimates by using a paper form to capture details of the work needed.\n2. When salespeople return home at the end of the day, they add any needed notes and drawings to the forms of the clients they visited. When the forms are complete, the salespeople email the forms to a designated member of the office staff.\n3. An office staff member enters the information into an Excel spreadsheet.\n4. The office manager assigns the jobs to one of two office staff responsible for creating estimates.\n5. The estimators work through the jobs from the oldest job to the newest.\n6. If an estimate is greater than $50,000, it must be reviewed by the office manager before work can begin.\n7. After a job is estimated and approved, it is sent to the service staff to implement.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\nVanArsdel, Ltd. plans to continue its processes by using Microsoft Power Platform tools to allow users to work more efficiently.\n\n• Office workers and the office manager must be able to do the following: o Use a model-driven app. o Use email as their primary method of communication. o Be contacted automatically when they have been assigned an estimate to complete or review.\n• Salespeople must be able to do the following on their mobile device and while offline: o Calculate the cost of concrete. o Record notes and area measurements to calculate material costs. o Capture multiple pictures and drawings.\n• Both salespeople and office workers must be able to calculate the cost of the concrete portion of a job by using the same tool.\n• All data must be stored in Microsoft Dataverse.\no Quotes must be used to create estimates.\n A new column must be added to track approval status.\no A custom table must be used to store data collected by salespeople. o A Microsoft Power Automate flow must be used to convert the data captured by the salespeople into a quote. o Area measurements must be converted to the quantity of units required to cover the area. The unit conversion must round up for quote lines. o Quotes must only display lines that have values greater than 0.\n• Customizations must be done by using out-of-the-box tools.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• Salespeople are unable to save data to the custom table.\n• The Power Automate flow that creates quotes returns an error when a math function is used for measurements that contain no value.\n\n\nYou need to create a Dataverse table view for the office workers who create estimates.\n\nWhich two actions should you perform?
