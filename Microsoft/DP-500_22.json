Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.\n\nTo start the case study -\nTo display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. If the case study has an All Information tab, note that the information displayed is identical to the information displayed on the subsequent tabs. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\nOverview -\nContoso, Ltd. is a company that sells enriched financial data to a variety of external customers.\nContoso has a main office in Los Angeles and two branch offices in New York and Seattle.\n\nExisting Environment -\n\nData Infrastructure -\nContoso has a 50-TB data warehouse that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.\nThe data warehouse populates an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace that is accessed by the external customers. Currently, the customers can access all the data.\nContoso has one Power BI workspace named FinData that contains a single dataset. The dataset contains financial data from around the world. The workspace is used by 10 internal users and one external customer. The dataset has the following two data sources: the data warehouse and the Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool.\nUsers frequently query the Synapse Analytics workspace by using Transact-SQL.\n\nUser Problems -\nContoso identifies the following user issues:\nSome users indicate that the visuals in Power BI reports are slow to render when making filter selections.\nUsers indicate that queries against the serverless SQL pool fail occasionally because the size of tempdb has been exceeded.\nUsers indicate that the data in Power BI reports is stale. You discover that the refresh process of the Power BI model occasionally times out.\n\nPlanned Changes -\nContoso plans to implement the following changes:\nInto the existing Power BI dataset, integrate an external data source in JSON that is accessible by using the REST API.\nBuild a new dataset in the FinData workspace by using data from the Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool.\nProvide all the customers with their own Power BI workspace to create their own reports. Each workspace will use the new dataset in the FinData workspace.\nImplement subscription levels for the customers. Each subscription level will provide access to specific rows of financial data.\nDeploy prebuilt datasets to Power BI to simplify the query experience of the customers.\nProvide internal users with the ability to incorporate machine learning models loaded to the dedicated SQL pool.\nYou need to integrate the external data source to support the planned changes.\nWhich three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.\n//IMG//","topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"I believe this is the correct answer. \nFor more info check this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/json#load-from-the-web","comment_id":"743209","poster":"nbagchi","timestamp":"1670871840.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"content":"Create\nExpand\nPublish","comment_id":"923782","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"* Create a web source","poster":"Eltooth","timestamp":"1686810660.0","comment_id":"923783"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1686810660.0","poster":"Eltooth"},{"comment_id":"870405","poster":"DarioReymago","content":"is ok ok ok","timestamp":"1681497480.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"correct","poster":"Saffar","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1673550720.0","comment_id":"773813"}],"answer":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-500/image2.png"],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2022-12-12 20:04:00","answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-500/image1.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/91267-exam-dp-500-topic-1-question-3-discussion/"},{"id":"kPZT9T3rVr7XyfKQ2dJU","unix_timestamp":1670812440,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-12-12 03:34:00","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B","poster":"Schwami","upvote_count":"17","comment_id":"742333","timestamp":"1670812440.0"},{"content":"I think A is correct.\nRef = https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-accessibility-creating-reports","timestamp":"1671891000.0","comments":[{"poster":"Chk88","content":"Correct, option B is too generic and can be confusing, everyone can have diff perspective of what the shape supposed to me","comment_id":"755667","timestamp":"1671974820.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"upvote_count":"6","poster":"Maazi","comment_id":"754924"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Ihueghian","comment_id":"1220108","timestamp":"1716888780.0","content":"I will go for A, because B: While changing icons to different shapes can help differentiate between categories, it doesn't specifically address the accessibility needs of users with color vision deficiency."},{"timestamp":"1707314340.0","comment_id":"1143371","poster":"LearningUser","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA is meaningless -- if you have color deficiency and you apply solution on A; then user need to check each row if it is below or up the target -- b option would be nicer and easy to check","timestamp":"1703750880.0","poster":"Akin_Eren","comment_id":"1107553"},{"poster":"Deloro","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1011155","content":"i would go for B, since A is only applicable to screen readers. it's not mentioned that the customers are only screen reader users ... also in the ms page: use text or icons ... my ideal answer would be A & B but solo I would take B","timestamp":"1695116400.0"},{"timestamp":"1691483280.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIf you change the icon shape to a unique shape for each color, you still need to explain what does that shape mean.
