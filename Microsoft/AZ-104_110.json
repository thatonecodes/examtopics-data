It's barely using its CPU resources except the occasional spikes - probably because some job is running at that time. To save on costs and have better resource optimisation, I would scale it down.

If not, then I don't really care if the CPU peaks 100% and it would be better to have constant usage, let's say in the 50-60% on average with the occasional 100% spikes than just keeping the CPU almost idle for the majority of the time.
