Precision is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. A precision of 100% means that all detected objects were correct, implying there were no false positives.\n\nThe value for the number of true positives by the total number of true positives and false negatives is 25 because recall is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. The recall in the graphic is 25%, which indicates that the true positives are 25% of the total true positives and false negatives.","timestamp":"1739341620.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1355491","poster":"syupwsh"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"got this in Oct 2024 exam","poster":"4371883","comment_id":"1297459","timestamp":"1728901980.0"},{"poster":"mrg998","timestamp":"1726560960.0","content":"0 & 25","comment_id":"1285090","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1225484","poster":"NagaoShingo","content":"1. 0\n2. 25","timestamp":"1717677180.0"},{"poster":"takaimomoGcup","timestamp":"1716636840.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1218259","content":"1. 0\n2. 25"},{"poster":"Tin_Tin","content":"The answer is correct. \nSee https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Custom-Vision-Service/get-started-build-detector","timestamp":"1686892080.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"924864"},{"content":"It is true.\n#1:Precision = 100%\n#2:recall = 25%","timestamp":"1686725640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"973b658","comment_id":"922817"}],"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou are building a model to detect objects in images.\n\nThe performance of the model based on training data is shown in the following exhibit.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nUse the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/ai-102/image49.png","https://img.examtopics.com/ai-102/image50.png"],"answer":"","isMC":false,"answers_community":[],"topic":"2","question_id":108,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/112135-exam-ai-102-topic-2-question-31-discussion/","exam_id":40,"timestamp":"2023-06-14 08:54:00","unix_timestamp":1686725640,"answer_ET":""},{"id":"N4ZmG8ix9L69N9JUWV13","choices":{"A":"Computer Vision Image Analysis","D":"Azure Cognitive Service for Language","B":"the Read API in Computer Vision","C":"Form Recognizer"},"unix_timestamp":1696465500,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/122477-exam-ai-102-topic-2-question-32-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"rdemontis","timestamp":"1699097520.0","comment_id":"1062051","content":"Selected Answer: B\nTo me the correct answer is B.
