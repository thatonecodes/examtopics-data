The event pipeline is divided into the following events and stages:\n\nBox 1: PreValidation -\n\nPre-event/Pre-Validation -\nThis stage executes before anything else, even before basic validation if the triggering action is even allowed based on security. Therefore, it would be possible to trigger the plug-in code even without actually having permission to do so and great consideration must be used when writing a pre-validation plug-in. Also, execution in this stage might not be part of the database transaction.\nExamples:- security checks being performed to verify the calling or logged on user has the correct permissions to perform the intended operation.\n\nBox 2: PreOperation -\n\nPre-event/Pre-Operation -\nThis stage executes after validation, but before the changes has been committed to database. This is one of the most commonly used stages.\nExample uses:\nIf and \"update\" plug-in should update the same record, it is best practice to use the pre-operation stage and modify the properties. That way the plug-in update is done within same DB transaction without needing additional web service update call.\n\nBox 3: PostOperation -\nPlug-ins which are to execute after the main operation. Plug-ins registered in this stage are executed within the database transaction.\nThis stage executed after changes have been committed to database. This is one of the most used stages.\nExample uses:\nMost of the \"Create\" plugins are post-event. This allows access to the created GUID and creation of relationships to newly created record.\nIncorrect Answers:\nMainOperation:- main operation of the system, such as create, update, delete, and so on. No custom plug-ins can be registered in this stage.\nReference:\nhttps://community.dynamics.com/crm/f/microsoft-dynamics-crm-forum/216569/ms-crm-plugin-execution-pipeline","answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03197/0011500001.png"],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03197/0011600001.png"],"answer":"","timestamp":"2020-06-17 21:11:00","question_id":47,"unix_timestamp":1592421060,"exam_id":85},{"id":"TGqr79BqDDnX52ZA8ANN","question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nA company imports data from files.\nThe following code is created to import the files.
