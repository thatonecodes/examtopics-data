Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other question on this case study.\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next sections of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.\n\nTo start the case study -\nTo display the first question on this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. If the case study has an All Information tab, note that the information displayed is identical to the information displayed on the subsequent tabs. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\nPolicy service -\nYou develop and deploy a stateful ASP.NET Core 2.1 web application named Policy service to an Azure App\nService Web App. The application reacts to events from Azure Event Grid and performs policy actions based on those events.\nThe application must include the Event Grid Event ID field in all Application Insights telemetry.\nPolicy service must use Application Insights to automatically scale with the number of policy actions that it is performing.\n\nOther -\n\nAnomaly detection service -\nYou have an anomaly detection service that analyzes log infrmation for anomalies. It is implemented as an\nAzure Machine Learning model. The model is deployed as a web service.\nIf an anomaly is detected, an Azure Function that emails administrators is called by using an HTTP WebHook.\n\nHealth monitoring -\nAll web applications and services have health monitoring at the /health service endpoint.\n\nIssues -\n\nPolicy loss -\nWhen you deploy Policy service, policies may not be applied if they were in the process of being applied during the deployment.\n\nPerformance issue -\nWhen under heavy load, the anomaly detection service undergoes slowdowns and rejects connections.\n\nNotification latency -\nUsers report that anomaly detection emails can sometimes arrive several minutes after an anomaly is detected.\n\nPolicies -\n\nLog policy -\nAll Azure App Service Web Apps must write logs to Azure Blob storage. All log files should be saved to a container named logdrop. Logs must remain in the container for 15 days.\n\nAuthentication events -\nAuthentication events are used to monitor users signing in and signing out. All authentication events must be processed by Policy service. Sign outs must be processed as quickly as possible.\n\nPolicyLib -\nYou have a shared library named PolicyLib that contains functionality common to all ASP.NET Core web services and applications. The PolicyLib library must:\n✑ Exclude non-user actions from Application Insights telemetry.\n✑ Provide methods that allow a web service to scale itself.\n✑ Ensure that scaling actions do not disrupt application usage.\nRelevant portions of the app files are shown below.
