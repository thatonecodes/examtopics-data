The IT department takes too long to generate the reports and often misunderstands the report requirements.\n\nExisting Environment. Data Sources\n\nNorthwind Traders uses the data sources shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nSource2 is exported daily from a third-party system and stored in Microsoft SharePoint Online.\n\nExisting Environment. Customer Worksheet\n\nSource2 contains a single worksheet named Customer Details. The first 11 rows of the worksheet are shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nAll the fields in Source2 are mandatory.\n\nThe Address column in Customer Details is the billing address, which can differ from the shipping address.\n\nExisting Environment. Azure SQL Database\n\nSource1 contains the following tables:\n\n• Orders\n• Products\n• Suppliers\n• Categories\n• Order Details\n• Sales Employees\n\nThe Orders table contains the following columns.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe Order Details table contains the following columns.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe address in the Orders table is the shipping address, which can differ from the billing address.\n\nThe Products table contains the following columns.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe Categories table contains the following columns.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe Suppliers table contains the following columns.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe Sales Employees table contains the following columns.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nEach employee in the Sales Employees table is assigned to one sales region. Multiple employees can be assigned to each region.\n\nRequirements. Report Requirements\n\nNorthwind Traders requires the following reports:\n\n• Top Products\n• Top Customers\n• On-Time Shipping\n\nThe Top Customers report will show the top 20 customers based on the highest sales amounts in a selected order month or quarter, product category, and sales region.\n\nThe Top Products report will show the top 20 products based on the highest sales amounts sold in a selected order month or quarter, sales region, and product category. The report must also show which suppliers provide the top products.\n\nThe On-Time Shipping report will show the following metrics for a selected shipping month or quarter:\n\n• The percentage of orders that were shipped late by country and shipping region\n• Customers that had multiple late shipments during the last quarter\n\nNorthwind Traders defines late orders as those shipped after the required shipping date.\n\nThe warehouse shipping department must be notified if the percentage of late orders within the current month exceeds 5%.\n\nThe reports must show historical data for the current calendar year and the last three calendar years.\n\nRequirements. Technical Requirements\n\nNorthwind Traders identifies the following technical requirements:\n\n• A single dataset must support all three reports.\n• The reports must be stored in a single Power BI workspace.\n• Report data must be current as of 7 AM Pacific Time each day.\n• The reports must provide fast response times when users interact with a visualization.\n• The data model must minimize the size of the dataset as much as possible, while meeting the report requirements and the technical requirements.\n\nRequirements. Security Requirements\n\nAccess to the reports must be granted to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) security groups only. An Azure AD security group exists for each department.\n\nThe sales department must be able to perform the following tasks in Power BI:\n\n• Create, edit, and delete content in the reports.\n• Manage permissions for workspaces, datasets, and reports.\n• Publish, unpublish, update, and change the permissions for an app.\n• Assign Azure AD groups role-based access to the reports workspace.\n\nUsers in the sales department must be able to access only the data of the sales region to which they are assigned in the Sales Employees table.\n\nPower BI has the following row-level security (RLS) Table filter DAX expression for the Sales Employees table.\n\n[EmailAddress] = USERNAME()\n\nRLS will be applied only to the sales department users. Users in all other departments must be able to view all the data.\n\n\nYou need to create the semantic model.\n\nWhich storage mode should you use for the tables in the semantic model?","topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1278615","content":"I agree with C as reports are updated at 7am only and needs fast response times.","timestamp":"1725509040.0","upvote_count":"14","poster":"Tex02"},{"poster":"9d92039","timestamp":"1725948300.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nImport for the excel file, DirectQuery for the tables on SQL server","comment_id":"1281383","upvote_count":"11"},{"timestamp":"1743653040.0","comment_id":"1425366","poster":"BhavnishM","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSeen similar question in measure up as well, C is the correct answer :\nDirectQuery doesn't supports RLS and since Dual is a combination of import and direct query, Dual is not supported as well.
