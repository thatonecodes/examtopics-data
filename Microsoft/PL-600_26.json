Do not be confused about virtual tables. You cannot \"Add and Update\" data into dataverse because it basically acts as a pointer, but you can certainly add and update data; it just goes directly to the the external data source. That's the entire point of Virtual Tables. So you can create a model driven app with forms to add and update data so it updates the actual source. This helps in where you do not have to create a 2 way data sync. But, unfortunately Virtual tables features still do not exist in the PowerApps GCC (Government) or above environment.\n\nTrust, I feel this pain everyday in having to maintain 2 way syncs to Dataverse.

A virtual table is a custom table in Microsoft Dataverse that has columns containing data from an external data source. Virtual tables appear in your app to users as regular table rows, but contain data that is sourced from an external database, such as an Azure SQL Database.
