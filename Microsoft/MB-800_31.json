Return Receipt on Credit Memo: This setting allows the system to automatically post a return receipt when a credit memo is posted. This affects inventory levels as the returned items are added back into inventory.\n\nD. Shipment on Invoice: This setting allows the system to automatically post a shipment when an invoice is posted. This reduces inventory levels as the shipped items are removed from inventory.\n\nThe other options, Stock warning (B) and Document Default Line Type (C), are not directly related to automatically posting inventory-related documents when posting sales transactions. Stock warning is a setting that alerts users when inventory levels are low, and Document Default Line Type determines the default line type for new lines in sales and purchase documents.","poster":"ivanrlg"},{"comment_id":"1205506","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730556960.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nAD are correct","poster":"marcot_cooperparry"},{"poster":"fhamidi","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nyes correct","comment_id":"981336","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707983100.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AD\nthe correct answer is AD","comment_id":"928132","upvote_count":"1","poster":"lbalage","timestamp":"1703050440.0"},{"comment_id":"927545","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nmakes more sense than A C.
