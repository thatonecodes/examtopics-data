To better understand its customers, Northwind Traders invests in a team of researchers who gather data from multiple sources. The company stores the data it collects in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nEnvironment\n-\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\nData\n-\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\nWeb API\n-\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nCustom connector\n-\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\nProcess\n-\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\n\nYou need to configure a Dataverse trigger and action in a Power Automate flow so researchers can update account records with data from the Web API even if they do not have edit privileges on the record.\n\nWhat should you configure for each trigger and action requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","exam_id":117,"question_id":215,"answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pl-400/image429.png"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pl-400/image428.png"],"discussion":[{"comments":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1741138980.0","poster":"Juan0414","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1365214","content":"For question 2 it says that power automate flow need to work in a way that researchers \"can update account records with data from the Web API even if they do not have edit privileges on the record\".
