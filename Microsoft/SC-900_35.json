Some Azure resources, such as virtual machines allow you to enable a managed identity directly on the resource. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity:\n- A service principal of a special type is created in Azure AD for the identity. The service principal is tied to the lifecycle of that Azure resource. When the Azure resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the service principal for you.\n- By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Azure AD.\n- You authorize the managed identity to have access to one or more services.\n- The name of the system-assigned service principal is always the same as the name of the Azure resource it is created for. For a deployment slot, the name of its system-assigned identity is <app-name>/slots/<slot-name>.","comment_id":"883097"},{"poster":"TATTIF","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1681324680.0","comment_id":"868710","content":"managed identity is correct"},{"timestamp":"1667996880.0","comment_id":"714557","content":"managed identity = correct answer","poster":"FBrabble","upvote_count":"5"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"correct","poster":"abilioneto","comment_id":"689833","timestamp":"1665279480.0"},{"comment_id":"686437","content":"Correct Answer","poster":"Emmuyah","timestamp":"1664918520.0","upvote_count":"4"}],"exam_id":125,"answer":""},{"id":"sHbUTc5LmW8PyA8q4EBe","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"exam_id":125,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/81426-exam-sc-900-topic-1-question-56-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1662735120,"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nSelect the answer that correctly completes the sentence.\nHot Area:\n//IMG//","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04254/0004900001.png"],"timestamp":"2022-09-09 16:52:00","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/incidents-overview?view=o365-worldwide","answer":"","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04254/0004900002.png"],"answer_ET":"","discussion":[{"poster":"pallmall","timestamp":"1663694100.0","comment_id":"674370","upvote_count":"7","content":"Incident:alert"},{"comment_id":"705805","poster":"Yindave","upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1666893540.0","content":"its a bit of a strange sentence, but yeah, Incident's the correct awnser"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"The answer is incidents\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/mdo-sec-ops-manage-incidents-and-alerts","timestamp":"1728314580.0","poster":"LegendaryZA","comment_id":"1294360"},{"comment_id":"873832","timestamp":"1681833840.0","content":"Yes, Incident - Alert:\nMicrosoft 365 Defender automatically aggregates the alerts and their associated information into an incident.","poster":"Daniel_Angelo","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"810850","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Nicochet","timestamp":"1676562300.0","content":"Incidents"},{"poster":"FBrabble","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1667997060.0","comment_id":"714558","content":"yes Incident since it is a thing that happened triggering an alert"},{"content":"Correct","comment_id":"699020","upvote_count":"3","poster":"IXone","timestamp":"1666182420.0"},{"timestamp":"1662735120.0","poster":"Zeus009","upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct","comment_id":"664713"}],"isMC":false,"question_id":172},{"id":"RAOquUab7vvmDl2WDktg","answers_community":["AD (100%)"],"question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1626340260,"discussion":[{"poster":"An_is_here","upvote_count":"35","comment_id":"406945","timestamp":"1626340260.0","content":"Answers are CORRECT\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint offers automatic investigation and remediation capabilities that help reduce the volume of alerts in minutes at scale.
