This means that it would only detect when a banned app is already in use, rather than when it is requesting access. On the other hand, the \"Permission level\" filter type is used to filter activities based on the level of permissions requested by the app. This means that it would detect when a banned app is requesting access to user information or data, even if it has not yet been approved or denied.\n\nTherefore, using the \"Permission level\" filter type is more appropriate for detecting when a banned app requests permission to access user information or data in the subscription."}],"content":"Policy type: Activity\nFilter type: Permission level\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps is a cloud access security broker (CASB) solution that provides visibility and control over your cloud applications.
