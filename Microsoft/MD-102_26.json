You can create configuration profiles in Intune to deploy the onboarding package and necessary settings. For Linux servers, Ansible is one of the supported deployment options. It allows for automated deployment and configuration of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux systems. It’s worth noting that while these are the recommended methods, there are other options available for both platforms:\n• For macOS, you can also use scripting or other MDM solutions if Intune is not available.\n• For Linux, besides Ansible, you can use Puppet, scripting, or other configuration management tools.\nThe choice between these methods may depend on your organization's existing infrastructure and management tools.","timestamp":"1738104180.0","poster":"Meek_Learner","comment_id":"1348222","upvote_count":"2"}],"poster":"MR_Eliot","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1725967860.0","comment_id":"1170344"},{"content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/linux-install-with-ansible?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac?view=o365-worldwide","poster":"h38jhd38k","timestamp":"1713916620.0","upvote_count":"5","comment_id":"1052363"},{"content":"Correct","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Amir1909","comment_id":"1119958","timestamp":"1720707420.0"},{"poster":"yosry","content":"SEEMS CORRECT","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1103959","timestamp":"1719130080.0"},{"content":"Correct","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Amir1909","timestamp":"1718858580.0","comment_id":"1101310"}],"isMC":false,"question_id":126,"answer":""},{"id":"ynei9YM6zf2AZomZENDO","question_id":127,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-10-18 07:53:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC: KIOSK","timestamp":"1722006720.0","poster":"ergacharsk","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1255771"},{"comment_id":"1103961","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1703326200.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSEEMS CORRECT","poster":"yosry"},{"timestamp":"1703198400.0","comment_id":"1103030","poster":"JN_311","content":"Selected Answer: C\nEasy one","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1065905","timestamp":"1699473120.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nKiosk mode is most suited for it","poster":"LiamAzure"},{"content":"Agreed","poster":"VirtualJP","comment_id":"1046600","timestamp":"1697608380.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"You have a Windows 10 device named Computer1 enrolled in Microsoft Intune.\n\nYou need to configure Computer1 as a public workstation that will run a single customer-facing, full-screen application.\n\nWhich configuration profile type template should you use in Microsoft Intune admin center?","unix_timestamp":1697608380,"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/123934-exam-md-102-topic-1-question-212-discussion/","topic":"1","answer":"C","choices":{"A":"Shared multi-user device","B":"Device restrictions","C":"Kiosk","D":"Endpoint protection"},"question_images":[],"exam_id":97},{"id":"SOk126c2bHsKPQPKN8W4","isMC":true,"answer":"D","timestamp":"2023-10-24 11:36:00","unix_timestamp":1698140160,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","exam_id":97,"question_images":[],"question_id":128,"question_text":"You have a Microsoft 365 subscription that uses Microsoft Intune Suite.\n\nYou use Microsoft Intune to manage Windows 11 devices.\n\nYou create a new policy set named Set and add five device configuration profiles for Windows 10 and later.\n\nYou create a device compliance policy named Policy1.\n\nYou need to ensure that when users are assigned the device configuration profiles in Set1, they are always assigned Policy1 also.\n\nWhat should you configure?","answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/124561-exam-md-102-topic-1-question-213-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. the Set1 configurations\n\nYou can include the following management objects in a policy set:\nApps\nApp configuration policies\nApp protection policies\nDevice configuration profiles\nDevice compliance policies\nWindows autopilot deployment profiles\nEnrollment status page\nSettings catalog policies\n\nWhile creating a Policy Set, you can configure the Device Compliance Policy you need.

If you want Policy1 (the device compliance policy) to always be assigned along with the device configuration profiles in Set1, you need to include Policy1 within Set1's configuration or assignments.
