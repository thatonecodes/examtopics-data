That's why enabling FlowLog1 in a network security group (NSG) associated with the subnet of VM1 is recommended (D). By doing so, you can ensure that outbound flows to virtual machines are captured, even if traffic bypasses the ExpressRoute gateway due to FastPath. This will be crucial for successful troubleshooting and resolving of the reported connectivity issues."},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is the answer.\n\n\"We don't recommend that you log flows on an Azure ExpressRoute gateway subnet because traffic can bypass that type of gateway (for example, FastPath). If an NSG is linked to an ExpressRoute gateway subnet and NSG flow logs are enabled, then outbound flows to virtual machines might not be captured. Such flows must be captured at the subnet or NIC of the VM.\"\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview#network-security-group-on-an-expressroute-gateway-subnet","poster":"cris_exam","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"877990","timestamp":"1682235000.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"869197","timestamp":"1681371600.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI agree with feeeb due to the link explanation.","poster":"MarshalLaw"},{"timestamp":"1681217880.0","comment_id":"867327","poster":"feeeb","content":"Answer is D - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview#network-security-group-on-an-expressroute-gateway-subnet","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"838789","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kanoniermalri","content":"Selected Answer: C\nincorrect, I go with C","timestamp":"1678793940.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/102573-exam-az-720-topic-5-question-53-discussion/"},{"id":"ys1r2u4DRcRPdaDrErgG","topic":"5","timestamp":"2023-04-09 22:17:00","answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/105678-exam-az-720-topic-5-question-55-discussion/","answer":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-720/image108.png"],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1681071420,"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\n\nA company uses Azure Standard Load Balancer which is configured to export metrics to Azure Monitor.\n\nYou receive an email alert for a potential outbound port exhaustion issue from an Azure virtual machine.

Add a user-defined route to the subnets route table.\n\nWhen Azure needs to route traffic, it uses some pre-defined system routes. However, you can override these routes by creating a user-defined route (UDR) in the subnet's route table. This enables you to make traffic follow a path that you specify.\n\nIn this case, to ensure that traffic uses global VNet peering instead of ExpressRoute private peering, you should create a user-defined route and associate it with the subnets that the VMs are connected to. This will direct the traffic from the VMs to the peered VNet, rather than routing it over the ExpressRoute connection.\n\nThe other options (B, C, D) do not provide a valid solution to the problem.
