Let me explain:\n\nAdding a data connector to Azure Sentinel is the first step to use the existing logic app as a playbook in Azure Sentinel. The data connector allows Azure Sentinel to trigger the Logic App as part of a playbook. Once the data connector is added, you can proceed to modify the trigger in the Logic App to ensure that it can be invoked by Azure Sentinel.\n\nIt's important to note that modifying the trigger in the Logic App (option D) is also a crucial step in the process.

For example, you could trigger the logic app when a new user is created in Azure AD, or when a specific security alert is generated in Azure Sentinel.\n\nOnce the trigger in the logic app has been modified, you can proceed to the next steps, which may include adding a data connector to Azure Sentinel, configuring a custom Threat Intelligence connector, and creating a scheduled query rule.","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Lone__Wolf"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675716060.0","comment_id":"800252","content":"Correct answer is D","poster":"Matshedy"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"789546","timestamp":"1674820020.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think maybe is B.
