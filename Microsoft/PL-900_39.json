This choice determines the size and shape of the canvas on which you'll build your app. After you make that choice, you can make a few more choices if you select Settings > Display. You can choose portrait or landscape orientation and screen size (tablet only). You can also lock or unlock the aspect ratio and support device rotation (or not).\n\nModel-driven apps are also responsive by design and will render themselves according to whatever device you use.'\n\nIn the case of a specific tablet sized device (question 1), Canvas would be the answer, since you can set it to the exact size you need to build on.","poster":"Bangarng","timestamp":"1724772480.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/create-responsive-layout","poster":"Astone","comment_id":"1132050","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721933160.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/132157-exam-pl-900-topic-1-question-287-discussion/","question_id":191,"question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nA company uses Microsoft Power Apps and Microsoft Azure to modernize its mobile workforce.\n\nThe company needs to identify solutions for three use cases:\n\n• An app to audit retail store displays with a tablet-specific layout for its unique screen dimensions\n• An app to create sales orders that uses business process flows\n• An app to display product information that uses data from a Microsoft Dataverse instance, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft SharePoint\n\nYou need to identify the correct app types to use.\n\nWhich apps should you use?
