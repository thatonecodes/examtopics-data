This ensures that there is no data loss in the event of a failover, as all changes are fully replicated to the secondary database. However, synchronous replication can have a higher impact on performance than asynchronous replication.\n\nAzure Site Recovery is a disaster recovery solution that can be used to replicate and failover virtual machines, but it is not specifically designed for SAP HANA databases.\n\nAlways On availability group is a SQL Server feature and is not applicable for SAP HANA databases.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1713863820.0"}],"exam_id":45,"question_images":[],"question_text":"You have an SAP production landscape that uses SAP HANA databases on Azure.\n\nYou need to deploy a disaster recovery solution to the SAP HANA databases.

Run the SQL Server setup and specify the /ACTION=INSTALL and /SQLMAXMEMORY switches.\n\nWhen deploying SQL Server on Azure virtual machines, it's recommended to use a custom script extension in the Azure Resource Manager templates to automate the installation and configuration of SQL Server. By specifying the /ACTION=INSTALL and /SQLMAXMEMORY switches during the installation, you can ensure that SQL Server is configured with the appropriate maximum memory allocation for the virtual machine.
