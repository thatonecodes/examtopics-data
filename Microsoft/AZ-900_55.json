As a cloud computing service, Azure provides customers with the ability to consume computing resources on a pay-per-use basis, which is typically classified as an operating expense (OpEx) rather than a capital expense (CapEx).\n\nCustomers can use Azure to access a wide range of computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, without the need to purchase and maintain their own hardware. This pay-as-you-go model allows customers to scale up or down their usage of computing resources based on their business needs, and pay only for what they use, similar to a utility bill.\n\nWhile Azure may not provide CapEx in the traditional sense, it does allow customers to potentially reduce their CapEx by reducing the need to purchase and maintain their own hardware. Additionally, Azure offers some purchasing options, such as reserved instances, which can provide cost savings for customers who commit to using specific computing resources for a set period of time."},{"comment_id":"794736","poster":"Kanders","timestamp":"1675210200.0","upvote_count":"5","content":"1.
