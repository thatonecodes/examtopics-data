Premium\n\nThe Premium plan is the best fit for this scenario. It supports both longer execution times and event-driven scaling, which are the requirements specified in the question. \n\nAzure Functions on a Premium plan can run for a longer period, up to 60 minutes (or indefinitely if the host.json \"functionTimeout\" setting is null), making it suitable for the estimated request processing times of five to 20 minutes. The Premium plan also supports event-driven autoscaling.\n\nThe Consumption plan supports event-driven autoscaling but only allows functions to run for up to 10 minutes, so it wouldn't support the estimated request processing times of five to 20 minutes. \n\nThe Dedicated and App Service plans can run for a longer period, but they do not support event-driven autoscaling. The Dedicated plan is also the most costly option and should be used when you need the most control over the function app environment.","comment_id":"942983","timestamp":"1688487420.0","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","upvote_count":"24"},{"comment_id":"870191","upvote_count":"15","poster":"azkumar305","content":"Got this on 14-Apr-2023","timestamp":"1681476720.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1311458","timestamp":"1731515640.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct"},{"comment_id":"1200476","poster":"Lazylinux","timestamp":"1713847620.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGiven Answer D is correct as per \nScale-in behaviors\nEvent-driven scaling automatically reduces capacity when demand for your functions is reduced. It does this by draining instances of their current function executions and then removes those instances. This behavior is logged as drain mode. The grace period for functions that are currently executing can extend up to 10 minutes for Consumption plan apps and up to 60 minutes for Premium plan apps.
