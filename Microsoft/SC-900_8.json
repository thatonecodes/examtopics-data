Active Directory uses a structured data store as the basis for a logical, hierarchical organization of directory information.\n\nThis data store, also known as the directory, contains information about Active Directory objects. These objects typically include shared resources such as servers, volumes, printers, and the network user and computer accounts.","poster":"marsot"}],"question_text":"What can be created in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)?","exam_id":125,"isMC":true,"question_id":36,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/93648-exam-sc-900-topic-1-question-131-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1672740300,"timestamp":"2023-01-03 11:05:00","topic":"1","choices":{"B":"computer accounts","A":"line-of-business (LOB) applications that require modern authentication","D":"mobile devices","C":"software as a service (SaaS) applications that require modern authentication"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","answer_description":""},{"id":"4ieMXqEburfcQqBeDaOj","unix_timestamp":1672740300,"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nSelect the answer that correctly completes the sentence.\n\n//IMG//","isMC":false,"timestamp":"2023-01-03 11:05:00","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sc-900/image185.png"],"question_id":37,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/93649-exam-sc-900-topic-1-question-132-discussion/","answer_ET":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sc-900/image184.png"],"answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"answer":"","exam_id":125,"discussion":[{"content":"Correct","upvote_count":"8","poster":"ETU69","timestamp":"1672740300.0","comment_id":"764390"},{"upvote_count":"6","timestamp":"1675148040.0","poster":"Barbados","comment_id":"793742","content":"Correct.
