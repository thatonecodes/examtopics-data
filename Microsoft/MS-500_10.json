When users sign in to Azure AD-connected applications, their passwords are validated against your on-premises Active Directory, so there's no need to store passwords in the cloud. Additionally, PTA supports the use of Azure AD Identity Protection risk policies, which help to detect and prevent risky sign-ins.\n\nThe other two authentication methods in Azure AD Connect are \"Password Hash Synchronization\" and \"Active Directory Federation Services\" (AD FS).
