It helps to ensure that you have enough capacity to run your applications while minimizing costs. While it may not minimize provisioning time to the same extent as virtual nodes, it does support autoscaling for Windows Server containers.","poster":"NotMeAnyWay","comment_id":"867446","timestamp":"1681226820.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"808355","timestamp":"1676376960.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with custom metrics: HPA automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment based on CPU utilization or other metrics. To support autoscaling of Windows Server containers, you can use HPA with custom metrics to scale based on the memory or CPU usage of the containers running on Windows Server nodes. By scaling based on custom metrics, you can ensure that the scale-out operation is efficient and minimizes the time it takes to provision compute resources.\n\nNote that the AKS cluster should be configured to use Windows Server 2019 nodes by specifying the appropriate node image in the AKS node pool configuration.","poster":"Eusouzati"},{"poster":"VBK8579","timestamp":"1675400220.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Cluster Autoscaler is a Kubernetes controller that automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster based on the resource usage of pods. It does this by checking the resource utilization of pods and adding or removing nodes as necessary to ensure that all pods have sufficient resources.

This is because Virtual Kubelet allows you to use Azure Container Instances (ACI) as a virtual node in your AKS cluster, allowing you to scale out your cluster with ACI resources as needed.
