Collect: This function is used to add records to a collection variable. While it primarily deals with collections, you can use it to create and update variables by storing values in a collection.\n\nD. Set: The Set function is used to create and update variables. You can set the value of a variable using this function.\n\nE. UpdateContext: This function is used to create and update context variables, which are often used for temporary storage of values within a screen's context.\n\nB. Patch: The Patch function is primarily used to modify or create records in a data source (e.g., SharePoint list or SQL database). It's not typically used for managing variables within a screen's scope.\n\nC.
