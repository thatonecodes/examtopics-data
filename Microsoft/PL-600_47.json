The line (or needle) represents the goal or target value. The shading represents the progress toward that goal. The value inside the arc represents the progress value. Power BI spreads all possible values evenly along the arc, from the minimum (left-most value) to the maximum (right-most value).\n\nIn this example, you're a car retailer tracking the sales team's average sales per month. The needle represents a 140 cars sales goal. The minimum possible average sales is 0 and the maximum is 200. The blue shading shows that the team is averaging approximately 120 sales this month.\nBox 2: Add an inspection order to the work order form\nYou can add inspections to work orders in Dynamics 365 Field Service.\nField Service inspections are digital forms that technicians use to quickly and easily answer a list of questions as part of a work order. The list of questions can include safety protocols, pass-and-fail tests for a customer asset, an interview with a customer, or other audits and assessments performed before, during, or after a work order.\nExample:\n\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/field-service/inspections","answer_ET":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","poster":"ClairFraser","comments":[{"poster":"WASSIM2020","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1342600","content":"Chatgpt say yes the answers are correct!","timestamp":"1737220020.0"}],"timestamp":"1662381600.0","comment_id":"660176","content":"Seems correct"},{"poster":"Grif53","content":"Question 1: Power BI - The reason is because the values need to be customizable by the inspectors (instantly removes custom from being correct).

Adding a form to a form would give technicians the ability to see more information about a single inspection, from a single machine record.
