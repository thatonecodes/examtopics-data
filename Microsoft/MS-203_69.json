Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.\nWhen the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g., copy and paste, ability to navigate to external websites) will not be possible by design.\nScoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for that task.\nLabs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam in the time provided.\nPlease note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be able to return to the lab.\n//IMG//\n\nUse the following login credentials as needed:\nTo enter your username, place your cursor in the Sign in box and click on the username below.\nTo enter your password, place your cursor in the Enter password box and click on the password below.\nMicrosoft 365 Username: admin@abc.com\n\nMicrosoft 365 Password: xxxxxx -\nIf the Microsoft 365 portal does not load successfully in the browser, press CTRL-K to reload the portal in a new browser tab.\nThe following information is for technical support purposes only.\n\nLab Instance: XXXXXX -\nYou need to prevent email messages that contain attachments that have the .js file extension from being delivered to any recipients in your organization.\nTo complete this task, sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1053779","timestamp":"1729864860.0","poster":"Nyamnyam","content":"I love the mighty mail flow rules.\nJust wondering if an alternative will be accepted as correct answer: Edit the default anti-malware policy under Email & Collaboration > Policies & Rules > Threat policies > Anti-Malware, Enable the common attachments filter under the Protection Settings, and add js to the list.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Forkbeard","content":"In case you're wondering: create a mail flow rule blocking any attachment if \"file extension includes these words\": js.\nAttachments with an extension of \"js\" will be blocked whereas attachments with an extension of \"jsa\" will not be blocked.","comment_id":"792501","timestamp":"1706598360.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_ET":"See explanation below.","isMC":false,"answer":"See explanation below.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/97205-exam-ms-203-topic-4-question-65-discussion/","answers_community":[]}],"exam":{"id":103,"isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Microsoft","isBeta":false,"name":"MS-203","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":392},"currentPage":69},"__N_SSP":true}
