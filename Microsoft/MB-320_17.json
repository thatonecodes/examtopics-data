During the manufacturing process, raw seafood is purchased, cleaned, and packaged into various- sized boxes. Each box may have a different weight.\nProduct is sold by the box and priced by the pound.\nYou need to ensure that you can perform transactions at the box level and record the net weight of goods shipped to a customer.\nSolution: Set up the product with a sales unit measure of pounds and inventory unit measure of box. Set a standard unit conversation for the product from box to pounds.\nDoes the solution meet the goal?","topic":"2","discussion":[{"comment_id":"573527","content":"B.

This change will add an additional processing step as the second step.\nThe existing version must be phased out and replaced by the new version.\nYou need to ensure that the engineering change takes affect at the end of the month.\nSolution:\n✑ Edit the existing production flow and set the expiration date to the end of the month.\n✑ Using the existing production flow, create a production flow and version. Set the expiration date to the end of the month. Create an activity for the new process step and add it in the proper sequence.\n✑ Create a Kanban rule that uses the last day of the month as the effective date.\n✑ Edit the existing Kanban rule. Set the expiration date to the end of the month.
