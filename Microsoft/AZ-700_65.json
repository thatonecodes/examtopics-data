The subscription contains a virtual network named VNet1, a storage account named storage1, an Azure App Service app named App1, and an Azure SQL database named DB1. VNet1 contains two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2. Subnet1 and Subnet2 each has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.224.\n\nYou plan to perform the following actions:\n\n• On Subnet1, configure a service endpoint to connect to storage1 and a service endpoint to connect to the Microsoft Entra tenant.\n• On Subnet2, configure a private endpoint to connect to App1 and a private endpoint to connect to DB1.\n\nHow many IP addresses will be available on each subnet once the planned actions are complete?
