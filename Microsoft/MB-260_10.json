They operate in the cities (and surrounding metropolitan areas) of Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Houston, and Seattle.\n\nThese grooming services are offered as packages at multiple price points, such as \"basic bath\" for $50 and \"premium bath with nail trim\" for $75.\n\nContoso also sells branded merchandise (hats, shirts, etc.) and dog accessories (toys, leashes, collars, etc.) through its own eCommerce website.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Customer Service\n\nContoso maintains a single contact center from which its customer service agents book appointments and handle customer complaints for each geographic market Contoso serves.\n\nCustomer service agents use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service to document inbound customer booking inquiries and complaints that are received via phone call, text message and web chat.\n\nCustomer service agents schedule grooming appointments using a third-party, web-based scheduling application.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Marketing\n\nThe marketing team manages an informational website and is responsible for running campaigns through web advertising platforms and social media channels. The marketing team also produces a weekly email newsletter that contains educational content relevant to dog owners as well as promotions for Contoso’s services and products.\n\nContoso uses a third-party marketing automation platform to send email and SMS messages to customers. These communications currently include:\n\n1. All unique email addresses from the booking system, ecommerce system and Dynamics 365 Customer Service receive the weekly email newsletter described above. The same customer will receive multiple emails if the customer is associated with different email addresses in different systems.\n2. Customers receive SMS reminders the day before a scheduled grooming appointment.\n3. Each customer who purchases grooming services is sent an email with a link to a satisfaction survey on the first Tuesday following the grooming appointment. The survey link is the same for all customers, and the survey requires customers to enter their names, phone numbers and (optionally) email addresses as part of the submission.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Challenges\n\nCurrently, the customer service team does not have any way to relate survey responses back to individual customer records in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service.\n\nThe marketing team cannot access customer feedback data collected by the customer service team. Both the customer service team and marketing team cannot access any data from the ecommerce system.\n\n\nBusiness Objectives -\n\nContoso business leadership identifies three major objectives to address by the end of the current fiscal year:\n\n1. Improve customer retention - Current customer attrition rates exceed 40 percent each month.\n2. Maximize customer value for services - The leadership team believes customer service agents should be upselling more customers on premium grooming packages. The leadership team is also considering partnering with other organizations to offer related services like dog training and dog walking to its existing customers.\n3. Maximize customer value for merchandise and accessory sales - Fewer than five percent of grooming customers have ever made a purchase from the ecommerce site. The leadership team believes there are significant opportunities for new revenue by increasing ecommerce sales.\n\n\nProject Overview. Overview -\n\nThe customer service and marketing leaders believes a Microsoft Customer Data Platform will help achieve Contoso’s business objectives.\n\nThe information technology (IT) team starts a pilot implementation of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.\n\n\nProject Overview. Pilot Project -\n\nThe pilot implementation will use the following sources of data from Contoso's operational systems:\n\n• Bookings - Customer demographic data and completed grooming appointments\n• Web purchases - Customer demographic data and ecommerce purchases totals summarized by customer, type (branded merchandise or accessories) and date\n• Survey responses - Respondent demographic data and response data\n• Customer interactions - Customer demographic data, interaction history (phone calls, emails, web chat), customer feedback, and inquiries\n\nThere is no common customer key across the different data sources, and none of the customer tables store customer keys from the other sources. Every table in a specific data source can be associated back to a customer record from the same data source using the corresponding customer's primary key.\n\nWhen managing system refreshes, Contoso requires data refreshes to begin within one hour of the scheduled arrival time for flat-file sources.\n\nNo Microsoft Azure storage services have been provisioned in support of the project, but the Customer Data Platform specialist may request the provisioning of any Azure services necessary to achieve the stated business objectives.\n\nThe goal of the pilot project is to demonstrate that Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights will provide marketing and customer service users with relevant data and insights. These data and insights will allow users to reduce churn, increase services revenue, and increase eCommerce spend.\n\n\nData Sources. Bookings -\n\nThis data source consists of two Parquet files that are uploaded to a secure file transport protocol (SFTP) site at noon (12 PM) and midnight (12 AM) every day.\n\n1. Customers.parquet - customer id (primary key), name, customer physical address, city, state, postal code, phone number, residence type (“house”, “apartment”, etc.), email address\n2. Appointments.parquet - appointment id (primary key), customer id, dog name, dog breed, appointment datetime, appointment price, grooming package name (“basic bath”, “premium bath”, etc.)\n\n\nData Sources. Web Purchases -\n\nThis data source consists of two CSV files that are programmatically uploaded to a SFTP site at midnight every day.\n\n1. WebCustomers.csv - customer id (primary key), name, customer address, city, state, postal code, phone number, email address\n2. TransactionTotals.csv - transaction id (primary key), customer id, merchandise total price, accessories total price, transaction datetime\n\n\nData Sources. Survey Responses -\n\nThis data source consists of two JSON files that are programmatically uploaded to a Microsoft SharePoint folder container at 6 PM every Friday.\n\n1. Respondents.json - customer id (primary key), name, phone number, email address\n2. Responses.json - response id (primary key), customer id, satisfaction score (1-5), comments, response date\n\nNote: The satisfaction survey asks for a single satisfaction score on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 meaning extremely dissatisfied and 5 meaning extremely satisfied. Respondents may optionally include comments.\n\nData Sources. Customer Interactions\n\nThis data source consists of a connection to data from the Contoso Dynamics 365 Customer Service application through a Microsoft Dataverse managed data lake. The relevant tables are all system tables.\n\n1. Contacts - all system attributes are available\n2. Activities - all system attributes are available\n3. Cases (Incidents) - all system attributes are available\n\nNote: Customer inquiries and feedback are stored as case (incident) records in the customer service application. Inquiries are tracked using the standard “question” case type value, and feedback are tracked using the standard “problem” case type value.\n\n\nContoso's marketing manager wants to add personalized recommendations from the eCommerce site to the weekly email newsletter for the product category accessories.\n\nYou need additional entities to configure a product recommendation with the currently available data in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. You request that the IT team provide additional entities.\n\nWhich two entities will provide you with the required data? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.","unix_timestamp":1712827800,"timestamp":"2024-04-11 11:30:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"topic":"3","exam_id":79,"answer":"AB","choices":{"A":"The order details entity with attributes for transaction id, transaction date, product category, product value, and “purchase or return” flag","C":"The product catalog entity with attributes for product id, product name, and product price","B":"The product catalog entity with attributes for product id, product name, and product category","D":"The order details entity with attributes for transaction id, product id, product value, and “purchase or return” flag"}}],"exam":{"name":"MB-260","isBeta":false,"id":79,"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":92,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Microsoft"},"currentPage":10},"__N_SSP":true}
