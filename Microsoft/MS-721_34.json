Create a separate organizational unit (OU) in Active Directory and block Group Policy Object (GPO) policy inheritance.\n\nHere's why this step is crucial before joining Microsoft Teams Rooms devices to the domain:\n\nOrganizational Unit for Management: Creating a dedicated OU for Teams Rooms devices allows for tailored management and control over the policies that apply to them. This helps prevent unintended conflicts with policies intended for user devices or other computer systems.\nBlocking Policy Inheritance: By blocking policy inheritance for this OU, you ensure that GPOs from parent containers won't automatically apply to the Teams Rooms devices. This prevents potential issues caused by settings that might not be compatible with these specialized devices."}],"question_text":"Your network contains an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named contoso.com\n\nYou have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription.\n\nYou are deploying 10 Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows devices.\n\nYou need to join all the devices to contoso.com.\n\nWhat should you do before you join each device to contoso.com?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/129271-exam-ms-721-topic-1-question-75-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2023-12-24 06:06:00","choices":{"D":"Create a separate organizational unit (OU) in Active Directory and enable No Override for the parent Group Policy Object (GPO) policies.","C":"Modify the authentication settings in the SkypeSettings.xml file of each device.","A":"Disable Windows Update on each device.","B":"Create a separate organizational unit (OU) in Active Directory and block Group Policy Object (GPO) policy inheritance."},"unix_timestamp":1703394360,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_id":166,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[]},{"id":"Gx8T6z9qYVk3v7Y8mzHO","question_id":167,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/131432-exam-ms-721-topic-1-question-76-discussion/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732719180.0","poster":"35e71fe","content":"Answers are correct:\n\n1.
