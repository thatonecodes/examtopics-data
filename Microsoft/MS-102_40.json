You could, for example, use administrative units to delegate the Helpdesk Administrator role to regional support specialists, so they can manage users only in the region that they support. Note that if you assign a role to a user that is not a member of an administrative unit, the scope of the role is the entire tenant.\n\nAdding a group to an administrative unit brings the group itself into the management scope of the administrative unit, but not the members of the group. In other words, an administrator scoped to the administrative unit can manage properties of the group, such as group name or membership, but they cannot manage properties of the users or devices within that group (unless those users and devices are separately added as members of the administrative unit)."},{"content":"No\nYes\nNo","comment_id":"1263839","timestamp":"1723358520.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"APK1"},{"poster":"Gim99","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1254135","timestamp":"1721798340.0","content":"User1 can reset the password of User2:\n\nUser1: User Administrator for AU1\nUser2: Member of AU1 (through Group2)\nConclusion: Yes, User1 can reset the password of User2 because User1 is a User Administrator for AU1, and User2 is within AU1.\nUser2 can modify the membership of Group1:\n\nUser2: Global Administrator (Global scope)\nGroup1: Part of AU2\nConclusion: Yes, User2 can modify the membership of Group1 because User2 is a Global Administrator and has permissions over all administrative units, including AU2.\nUser1 can reset the password of User3:\n\nUser1: User Administrator for AU1\nUser3: Not a member of AU1 (User3 is in AU2)\nConclusion: No, User1 cannot reset the password of User3 because User1’s scope is limited to AU1, and User3 is not within AU1.\nAnswer Selections:\nUser1 can reset the password of User2: Yes\nUser2 can modify the membership of Group1: Yes\nUser1 can reset the password of User3: No","comments":[{"timestamp":"1723798320.0","poster":"APK1","content":"First Answer is: No\nUser Administrator cannot change password of another administrator especially Global Administrator.","comment_id":"1266926","upvote_count":"2"}]}],"answers_community":[],"answer":"","exam_id":100,"timestamp":"2024-04-24 07:49:00","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have a Microsoft 365 subscription that contains two administrative units named AU1 and AU2.\n\nThe subscription contains the users shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe subscription contains the groups shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nFor each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true.
