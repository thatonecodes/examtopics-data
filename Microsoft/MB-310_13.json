Customer dimension is optional.\n✑ Revenue accounts (4000-4999) require department and division and allow project and customer dimensions.\n✑ Liability accounts (2000-2999) should not have any dimensions posted.\n✑ Expense account (6999) requires department, division, project and customer dimensions with all transactions.\nYou need to configure the account structure to meet the requirements.\nSolution:\n✑ Configure two account structures: one for liability accounts listing the (2000-2999) range with no following dimensions and one for Expense and Revenue accounts.\n✑ For Expense accounts (6000-6998) and Revenue accounts (4000-4999), configure asterisks in all dimension columns.\n✑ For Expense account (6999), configure asterisks in all dimensions.
