If that scaling is happening AUTOMATICALLY, then we are talking about Elasticity. \n* Elasticity is the ability to quickly expand or decrease computer processing, memory, and storage resources to meet changing demands without worrying about capacity planning and engineering for peak usage. It is typically AUTOMATED so it doesn't have to rely on human administrators around the clock, and offers continuous availability of services by avoiding unnecessary slowdowns or service interruptions.\n\nWith that out of the way\n* The term that represents the ability to increase the computing capacity of a virtual machine by adding memory or CPUs is VERTICAL SCALING. Vertical scaling, also known as scaling up, involves increasing the resources (such as memory or CPUs) of a single virtual machine to enhance its performance and capabilities\nIN SHORT: Horizontal scaling refers to adding additional nodes, vertical scaling describes adding more power to your current machines","poster":"Super63","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1711261320.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nVertical scaling","poster":"anakinr","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1181342"},{"timestamp":"1698151200.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"This showed up today.

One of its key features is isolation and segmentation.\n\nIsolation: Azure VNets provide a high level of isolation by default. Each VNet is logically isolated from other VNets in Azure, ensuring that resources within one VNet are not accessible from another VNet unless explicitly connected. This isolation is critical for maintaining security boundaries between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, or between different departments within an organization.\n\nSegmentation: Within a VNet, you can further segment your network using subnets. Subnets allow you to divide your VNet into smaller, more manageable sections, each with its own unique IP address range. This segmentation can improve security and performance by controlling traffic flow, implementing network security groups (NSGs) to enforce access controls, and enabling the use of route tables for custom routing.","upvote_count":"8","poster":"VaibhavGawali","comment_id":"1231439","timestamp":"1718554080.0"},{"comment_id":"757088","upvote_count":"2","poster":"buiducvu","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1672033560.0"},{"upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"756080","timestamp":"1672008540.0","content":"Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure.
