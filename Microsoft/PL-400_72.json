Documentation states this:\n\nRetry an asynchronous plug-in\nWith an asynchronous plug-in step, you can retry when a plug-in fails. The cause of the failure may be due to a network error or some other retriable error calling an external resource.\n\nTo retry your plug-in, use the InvalidPluginExecutionException(OperationStatus, Int32, String) constructor using the OperationStatus Enum Retry member value.\n\nWhen your plug-in throws this type of exception, the asynchronous service attempts to execute your plug-in four times. If the plug-in execution doesn't succeed within four attempts, the call fails.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/handle-exceptions#retry-an-asynchronous-plug-in","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1365930"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nExplanation:\nAsynchronous plug-ins in Dataverse do not automatically retry upon failure. Even if an InvalidPluginExecutionException is raised, Dataverse does not retry asynchronous plug-ins by default.\nRetries in plug-ins are only applicable to synchronous transactions within the same execution pipeline. However, the requirement here is to retry when an external REST API returns a 500 status code, which is an external system failure, not an internal Dataverse transaction failure.","poster":"loftuscheek","comment_id":"1361945","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740577560.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"busitecgmbh","comment_id":"1327306","timestamp":"1734349440.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNo, if a InvalidPluginExecutionException is raised the process is cancelled and can't be configured to retry."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nRaising an InvalidPluginExecutionException does not fulfill the retry requirement.","poster":"KucaStonojka","timestamp":"1732206900.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1315907"},{"poster":"sudoaptupgrade","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1306856","timestamp":"1730712000.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nYes, because this time it is configured to retry after raising the exception"}],"answer":"B","question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
