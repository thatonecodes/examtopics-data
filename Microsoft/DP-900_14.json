Transactions (updates) tend to be lots of writes and fewer reads and writes are more expensive because of ACID: so B with \"heavy writes and light reads\" (whatever \"heavy\" and \"light\" mean here and it's terminology that isn't used in the current DP-900). But, in fact, overall OLTP systems tend to have more reads than writes -- we look up more data than we change. Most of the other aswers relate to structured data, not to OLTP system -- semi-structured data is also used for OLTP (in fact, for online applications processing lots of transactions per seconds). Transactions/ACID still matters even in semi-structured database: You don't want to write out half a JSON document, for example...I suppose we could call what happens with semi-structured data, OLP.
