These are the built-in chart types for canvas apps that you can insert from the Charts menu on the Insert tab. You can use these charts to show data in a line, pie, or bar chart in canvas apps.\n\nIf you want to access additional chart types, such as funnel, radar, scatter, candlestick, and gantt charts, you can use the Canviz Power Apps Chart Components. This is an open source component that you can download and import into your app. It offers a range of nine chart types that you can configure with your data.","comment_id":"968221","poster":"Edriska"},{"comment_id":"950272","timestamp":"1689214500.0","poster":"Robinmanaf","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answers are correct.\nPie\nLine\nColum or Bar"},{"timestamp":"1682694900.0","content":"Selected Answer: ADE\nGiven answers are correct","poster":"Sri2020","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"883582"},{"timestamp":"1657644480.0","content":"Column charts = bar charts","poster":"Wonderama","comment_id":"630628","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: ADE\nCorrect","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1654233780.0","poster":"ssoul04","comment_id":"610931"},{"comment_id":"451434","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct.

The edit form on Screen_AccountDetail will display the details of the selected account from Gallery_Accounts. The Navigate function will allow the user to switch between the two screens.

You can learn more about how to create a master-detail app here: [Create a master-detail app].\n\nSome additional information that might interest you are:\n\nYou can also use a display form instead of an edit form to show the account details. A display form is optimized for viewing data and does not allow editing. You can set the Default Mode of the display form to View as well.\nYou can customize the appearance and layout of the gallery and the form by using properties such as TemplateFill, TemplatePadding, BorderColor, BorderStyle, and BorderThickness.
