Defender for Cloud issues security recommendations based on these assessments.\n\nBy default, when you enable Defender for Cloud on an Azure subscription, the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) compliance standard is turned on. It provides recommendations. Defender for Cloud provides an aggregated secure score based on some of the MCSB recommendations.
