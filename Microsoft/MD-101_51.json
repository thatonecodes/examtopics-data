In this case, the user will be prompted for MFA despite having MFA disabled at the user level.\n\nConditional Access policies in Azure AD have a higher priority than user-level settings. When a user attempts to access a resource or sign in, the Conditional Access engine evaluates the policies that are applicable to that user based on the conditions defined in the policies. If a Conditional Access policy requires MFA for the user, it will be enforced, overriding any user-level MFA settings.\n\nIt's worth noting that if a Conditional Access policy does not require MFA for a user, the user-level MFA setting will be honored, and the user will not be prompted for additional authentication factors.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Adar_14","comment_id":"916637"},{"content":"No for all, what i understood after some reading is \nbox1: no because its not trusted location, so CA policy will not apply\nBox2&3: no because it is trusted location in azure and in MFA, so MFA will be bypassed.\nThis is a tricky one..\nreference:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/vpn-settings-windows-10#apps-and-traffic-rules","timestamp":"1677243060.0","comment_id":"820485","poster":"AliNadheer","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"BRoald","content":"I think NO, NO & NO\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates#azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-user-states\n\nAlso it states:\nIf needed, you can instead enable each account for per-user Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication.
