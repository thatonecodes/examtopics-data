For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects together with their coordinates in the image. You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same tag in an image.\nThe Detect API applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the image. There is currently no formal relationship between the tagging taxonomy and the object detection taxonomy. At a conceptual level, the Detect API only finds objects and living things, while the Tag API can also include contextual terms like \"indoor\", which can't be localized with bounding boxes.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-object-detection","question_id":227,"exam_id":41,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0009100001.jpg"],"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/54524-exam-ai-900-topic-1-question-81-discussion/","isMC":false,"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0009200001.jpg"],"answer_ET":"","topic":"1","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"11","comment_id":"521297","timestamp":"1689046380.0","poster":"mudassirsmk27","content":"this question came today...Answer is correct"},{"content":"Answer is correct","timestamp":"1700099040.0","poster":"ydu7312","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"602340"},{"timestamp":"1732951500.0","poster":"rdemontis","content":"correct answer","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"910827"},{"comment_id":"587290","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1697554980.0","content":"In test on 17 April 2022","poster":"heenak55"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"On exam 3.3.2022","comment_id":"565202","poster":"Pravda","timestamp":"1694399100.0"},{"timestamp":"1677618180.0","content":"Answer is correct","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Amstel","comment_id":"435758"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1679264340.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"pms2005","content":"what percentage of questions from this dump appeared in the real test?","comment_id":"447834"}],"timestamp":"1675090260.0","content":"Was on Exam 30.07.21","poster":"IrinaWeiss","comment_id":"417388","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1673197380.0","content":"Correct Answer","comment_id":"402005","poster":"Chaz79"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct","comment_id":"389904","timestamp":"1671923100.0","poster":"Venila"},{"timestamp":"1671080940.0","content":"correct answer","poster":"Vanshhh123","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"382307"},{"content":"answer is correct","timestamp":"1670159880.0","poster":"Ati1362","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"374287"}],"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nMatch the types of computer vision workloads to the appropriate scenarios.\nTo answer, drag the appropriate workload type from the column on the left to its scenario on the right.

An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels to apply.\nNote: The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. You, the developer, must submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according to the needs of your app. You can also export the model itself for offline use.\nIncorrect Answers:\nComputer Vision:\nAzure's Computer Vision service provides developers with access to advanced algorithms that process images and return information based on the visual features you're interested in.
