From VM1 traffic destined to the Azure Key Management Service will be routed to the network virtual appliance. \n\n> If \"Azure Key Management Service\" refers to an \"Azure Key Vault\" which is missing on the picture, then the default behaviour would be to reach it via public IP/internet. However there is no clear hint in the picture. Still I would answer \"Yes\" \n\n2. From VM1, traffic destined to the Azure file share will be routed to the internet. \n\n> This won't be routed through the internet, as there is a service endpoint. This adds an additional route that will have a longer prefix and therefor directly route traffic to it. So answer is \"No\"\n\n3. From VM1, traffic destined to the Azure SQL database will be routed to the internet. \n\n> I think we can assume SQL DB having a public IP (picture shows no private link). Now VM1 looks up it's local routing table, doesn't find a match and forwards it to it's default gateway. Now the UDR kicks in and forwards it to the NVA. From here on I'd say we can only guess.
