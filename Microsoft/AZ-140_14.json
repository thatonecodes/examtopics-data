Each image version can be replicated to different regions depending on what makes sense for your organization. One example is to always replicate the latest image in multi-regions while all older image versions are only available in 1 region. This can help save on storage costs.\n\nThe regions that a resource is replicated to can be updated after creation time. The time it takes to replicate to different regions depends on the amount of data being copied and the number of regions the version is replicated to. This can take a few hours in some cases. While the replication is happening, you can view the status of replication per region. Once the image replication is complete in a region, you can then deploy a VM or scale-set using that resource in the region.\n\nAnd oc the images needs to be generalized.","comment_id":"1065325","poster":"Judith1969","timestamp":"1699420740.0","upvote_count":"4"},{"timestamp":"1696020540.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThey really don't give you enough info.
