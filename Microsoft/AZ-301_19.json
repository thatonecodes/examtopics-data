In Azure AD you need to configure or define apps as a Service Application and select what access it has, and how it accesses the graph api (Oauth). Now because, here I am not dealing with Graph API but I have my own apps to be called by various apps. Hence, within Azure API management, I need to configure them to be called on OAUTH.

Microsoft identity platform access tokens are JWTs, Base64 encoded JSON objects signed by Azure. Clients should treat access tokens as opaque strings, as the contents of the token are intended for the resource only. For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode JWTs using a site like jwt.ms. Your client can get an access token from either the v1.0 endpoint or the v2.0 endpoint using a variety of protocols.\n\nWhen your client requests an access token, Azure AD also returns some metadata about the access token for your app's consumption. This information includes the expiry time of the access token and the scopes for which it's valid.
