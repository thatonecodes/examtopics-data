By using Conditional Access policies, you can apply the right access controls when needed to help keep your organization secure and stay out of your user's way when not needed. Conditional Access analyses signals such as user, device, and location to automate decisions and enforce organizational access policies for resources.\n\nBox 2: DLP policy -\nDLP policies enforce rules for which connectors can be used together by classifying connectors as either Business or Non-Business. If you put a connector in the\nBusiness group, it can only be used with other connectors from that group in any given app or flow. Sometimes you might want to block the usage of certain connectors altogether by classifying them as Blocked.\n\nBox 3: Exfiltration blocking -\nEmail exfiltration controls for connectors\nMicrosoft Exchange enables admins to disable email autoforwards and autoreplies to remote domains for external recipients. Exchange does this by using message-type headers, such as Auto Forward received from Outlook and Outlook on web clients.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/restrict-access-online-trusted-ip-rules https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/block-forwarded-email-from-power-automate","answer_ET":"","isMC":false,"discussion":[{"poster":"vpatel1826","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"748440","content":"Correct","timestamp":"1718653560.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1741218600.0","content":"Conditional access: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/guidance/adoption/conditional-access\n\n\nDLP policy: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention\n\nExfiltration blocking: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/block-forwarded-email-from-power-automate","comment_id":"1365632","poster":"Juan0414"}],"topic":"6","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0036800001.png"],"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/91941-exam-pl-400-topic-6-question-11-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04332/0036800002.png"],"unix_timestamp":1671313560,"answer":"","question_id":286,"timestamp":"2022-12-17 22:46:00","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou are a Power Platform developer.\nUsers report several access issues.\nYou need to resolve the user access issues.\nWhat should you use?

These templates can be used to limit the number of records that the connector returns, by filtering the data based on specific criteria. In this case, you can use a connector policy template to filter the incidents returned from ServiceNow to only those that are assigned to each user.
