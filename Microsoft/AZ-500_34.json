However one of the challenges with deploying a Conditional Access policy in your organization is determining the impact to end users. It can be difficult to anticipate the number and names of users impacted by common deployment initiatives such as blocking legacy authentication, requiring multifactor authentication for a population of users, or implementing sign-in risk policies.\n\nReport-only mode is a new Conditional Access policy state that allows administrators to evaluate the impact of Conditional Access policies before enabling them in their environment.","timestamp":"1714572960.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"zellck"},{"comment_id":"827793","upvote_count":"3","poster":"majstor86","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Only the user principal name (UPN) and display name of each user\n\nWhen using the Bulk add members feature in Azure Active Directory, you should include a file that contains the user principal name (UPN) and display name of each user you want to add to the administrative unit. This information helps Azure AD identify the users and place them into the appropriate administrative unit (AU1) within your organization's directory.\n\nThe user principal name (UPN) is a unique identifier for each user in Azure AD, and the display name provides a human-readable name associated with the user. Including both UPN and display name in the file ensures that Azure AD can accurately match the users and add them to the specified administrative unit.","timestamp":"1693262580.0","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"886374","poster":"zellck","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the answer.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/admin-units-members-add#add-users-to-an-administrative-unit-in-a-bulk-operation\nEdit the downloaded CSV template with the list of users you want to add.\n- Add one user principal name (UPN) in each row.","timestamp":"1682950440.0"},{"timestamp":"1679368440.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. only the user principal name (UPN) of each user\n\n\"In the Bulk add members pane, download the comma-separated values (CSV) template.\nEdit the downloaded CSV template with the list of users you want to add.\nAdd one user principal name (UPN) in each row.
