Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.\nAfter you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.\nYou are a Customer Data Platform Specialist. Your company's information technology department already ingested a CSV file with column names in the first row into audience insights. You are asked to clean and transform the data to get it ready for unification.\nWhat can you do to satisfy the requirements?\nSolution: Clean the data by transforming the first row to be used as headers, defining column types to be appropriate field types, and naming the query. Create a full name column if it does not exist by merging the columns for the first name and last name. Click `Next` and your data is now ready for unification.\nDoes this meet the goal?","choices":{"B":"No","A":"Yes"},"timestamp":"2022-04-24 22:50:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732420500.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"excelfp","comment_id":"905419","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI think it should be no, because of the full name is not necessarily"},{"poster":"phuongha","timestamp":"1712986140.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"693632","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNo requirement for full name."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nNo requirement for full name.","poster":"Mittun","timestamp":"1709222820.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"654101"},{"poster":"Mittun","timestamp":"1709027580.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"it should be No.","comment_id":"652504"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1708182060.0","poster":"MatzeB","comment_id":"648090","content":"why do I need a full name column?"},{"poster":"rbsound","comment_id":"591230","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect","timestamp":"1698180600.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"B","topic":"2"},{"id":"7fRj7CFaBjdzH52mKeFt","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/77858-exam-mb-260-topic-3-question-1-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"poweruser06","comment_id":"995446","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1725133080.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect"},{"comment_id":"857612","poster":"Niranjan1","content":"C is Correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711951020.0"},{"timestamp":"1695060180.0","comment_id":"672652","poster":"Vikash","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect","comment_id":"659873","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mick72","timestamp":"1693899840.0"},{"timestamp":"1690874760.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/relationships#non-editable-system-relationships","poster":"Iker","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"640430"}],"question_text":"You are a Customer Data Platform Specialist.
