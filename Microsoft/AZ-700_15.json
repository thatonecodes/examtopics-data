Currently you can only configure the first integration through Azure portal. The second integration must be created using Azure Resource Manager templates or Azure CLI commands.\n\nThe suggested answer assumes you use the VNET integration model to connect to VNET1, and the Gateway required VNET integration model to connect to VNET2. No interconnectivity between VNET1 and VNET2.\n\nThe documentation is not clear on if these 2 models can exist together.
