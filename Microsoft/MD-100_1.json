The question says she's logging in using an Active Directory (AD) account, not an Azure Active Directory (AAD) account. If you want to activate the 365 E3 license on a user basis, you need to log in to the PC using your AAD account, not AD. So either she has to login using her AAD account instead, or she could perform an Autopilot-reset to trigger a device-based license activation. It feels like some info is missing in the question, but triggering an Autopilot-reset for a device-based license activation is a possibility and it would explain why she's not trying any of the other methods. So I'd vote for D indeed.","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"486545","comments":[{"content":"Agreed.

In this scenario, Mia Hamm is using a computer named Computer1 that is not activated. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that Mia Hamm has a valid Windows 10 Enterprise license and then activate Computer1 using that license.\n\nSince all users in the domain have been issued Microsoft 365 E3 licenses, we can assume that Mia Hamm already has a valid license.

Remove that statement and try to answer the question. First, there is no such thing as an \"local autopilot reset\". You would do a local reset and then have the user join log in with an O365 Account \"Autopilot is set up in the background\" to use that \"E3\" license. None of that was stated, so, the correct answer is C since it already has the Enterprise version on the computer. You can't buy Enterprise, thaf version comes with VLK.
