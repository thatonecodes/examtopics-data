Meaning takes packets coming from a location and routes them to another location. IT DOES NOT CREATE ROUTES. In principle, all routes are used user-defined. However, Azure may create some by default for you. The protocol is used to propagate these routes and other Gateway information between gateways. But it does not create routes. \n\nSomething that you can use the protocol for is to learn if a defined route is not available. Based on that the BGP can decide to re-route it through a secondary location.\n\nThus, to me the correct answers are:\n1. User-defined routes (I don’t think that the requested route, “Outbound traffic to the Internet from workloads hosted on the virtual networks must be routed through the closest available on-premises site”, is part of the Azure defaulted routes.\n2.
