The PAW configuration includes security controls and policies that restrict local administrative access and productivity tools to minimize the attack surface to only what is absolutely required for performing sensitive job tasks. This makes the PAW device difficult for attackers to compromise because it blocks the most common vector for phishing attacks: email and web browsing.\nD: As shown in the diagram, privileged access management builds on the protection provided with native encryption of Microsoft 365 data and the role-based access control security model of Microsoft 365 services. When used with Azure AD Privileged Identity Management, these two features provide access control with just-in-time access at different scopes.\n\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/privileged-access-devices https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/privileged-access-management-overview?view=o365-worldwide","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"Just-in-time (JIT) access","C":"Privileged Access Workstations (PAW) devices","A":"Device compliance","B":"IP address range restrictions"},"answers_community":[]},{"id":"mpst7useU9mZlRfHpg4F","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"899973","upvote_count":"2","content":"Given answers are correct","poster":"Murtuza","timestamp":"1731845400.0"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1684318200,"answer_ET":"AD","question_images":[],"answer_description":"A: You can place a mailbox on Litigation hold to retain all mailbox content, including deleted items and the original versions of modified items. When you place a user mailbox on Litigation hold, content in the user's archive mailbox (if it's enabled) is also retained. When you create a hold, you can specify a hold duration (also called a time-based hold) so that deleted and modified items are retained for a specified period and then permanently deleted from the mailbox. Or you can just retain content indefinitely (called an infinite hold) or until the Litigation hold is removed.\nD: In Exchange Online, you can use archive policies to automatically move mailbox items to personal (on-premises) or cloud-based archives. Archive policies are retention tags that use the Move to Archive retention action.\nYou can modify retention tags included in the default policy to meet your business requirements. For example, you can modify the archive DPT to move items to the archive after three years instead of two.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/create-a-litigation-hold?view=o365-worldwide https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/modify-archive-policies","answer_images":[],"answer":"AD","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/109514-exam-ms-900-topic-1-question-277-discussion/","question_id":198,"timestamp":"2023-05-17 12:10:00","exam_id":113,"question_text":"A company uses Microsoft 365 for email.
