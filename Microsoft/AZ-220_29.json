Through Azure Private Link, you can set up a private endpoint for your IoT hub to allow services inside your VNet to reach IoT Hub without requiring traffic to be sent to IoT Hub's public endpoint.\nSimilarly, your on-premises devices can use Virtual Private Network (VPN) or ExpressRoute peering to gain connectivity to your VNet and your IoT Hub (via its private endpoint). As a result, you can restrict or completely block off connectivity to your IoT hub's public endpoints by using IoT Hub IP filter or the public network access toggle. This approach keeps connectivity to your Hub using the private endpoint for devices.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/virtual-network-support","discussion":[{"comment_id":"881933","timestamp":"1682534340.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1687962660.0","poster":"Yameo","comment_id":"936774","content":"I think that ip filtering and private endpoint are the correct solutions.
