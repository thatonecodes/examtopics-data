No\n\nIncreasing code coverage in your test suite means that more parts of your source code are tested, which can potentially improve the overall quality of your application by identifying bugs and issues early in the development process. However, in the context of your issue — intermittent failures in TestSuite1 that are not related to changes in the source code or the execution environment — increasing code coverage may not directly address the problem.\n\nIntermittent test failures, especially when they are unrelated to code changes, often point to issues such as flaky tests, timing issues, resource constraints, or external dependencies that may be unreliable. These types of problems are not typically resolved by simply increasing code coverage. Instead, strategies like identifying and managing flaky tests, reviewing and optimizing test conditions, or investigating external dependencies would be more effective in minimizing the troubleshooting effort for these specific test failures.","comment_id":"1103040","poster":"freeolive_guru","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.
