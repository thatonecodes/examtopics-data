This includes:\n1:1 chats: Direct messages between two users.\nn:1 chats: Group chats involving multiple users.\nGeneral channels: Public channels accessible by all members of a team.\nPrivate channels: Restricted channels accessible only to authorized team members.\nSince the DLP policy is applied to the overall \"Teams chat and channel messages\" location for both User1 and User2, it will provide protection across all these Teams entities.\n\nThere are no inherent limitations in the scenario that would restrict DLP to specific channel types.

For instance, site owners have overarching control over all documents within that site.\n\nSharing and Permission Changes: The initial owner (uploader) can share the document with others and adjust permissions, potentially assigning ownership or editing rights to other users.\n\nMetadata and Versioning: SharePoint also tracks the document metadata, including who last modified the document, providing a detailed history of document interactions."},{"comment_id":"865142","content":"As mentioned earlier, \"Block everyone\" option dont block the content owner, last modifier and site admin\n\nYes, Owners of the file are not blocked by the DLP policies\nYes, last modifiers are not blocked by the DLP policies\nYes, site admins are not blocked by the DLP policies","poster":"xswe","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1680994860.0","comments":[{"content":"there is no evidence user1 is owner of the file, he just uploaded it","timestamp":"1681738740.0","poster":"luissaro","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"872733"},{"content":"It is question if there exists permission \"owner\" on Sharepoint file, User1 is rather Author\nUser2 is content owner (member of owner group of site) and last modifier.\nSo it should be: NO, YES, YES","poster":"pokus00132","timestamp":"1682174640.0","comment_id":"877348","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"I agree with NO, YES, YES - no mention that user1 is the content owner.","timestamp":"1687018860.0","comment_id":"926114","poster":"cris_exam"}],"upvote_count":"3"}]}],"topic":"2","answer_ET":"","answer_description":""},{"id":"RUEu3bqiqE6B36WrKwoK","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"comment_id":"980479","timestamp":"1723614300.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCloud app discovery monitors network traffic to discover apps in the cloud, not local executable","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Davidf"},{"comment_id":"865620","poster":"pokus00132","content":"B is right.
