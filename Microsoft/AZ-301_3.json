Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)\n- encrypts the storage of an entire database at rest only \n\nB. Azure Storage Service Encryption\n- only encrypts data at rest and won't help with our database \n\nC. Always Encrypted with randomized encryption\n- is transparent \n- is currently supported in .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server (so matches our technology stack)\n- more secure than \"deterministic encryption\"\n\nD. Always Encrypted with deterministic encryption\n- same applies then answer C, although not that secure \n\nConclusion: Answer C)","comment_id":"139199","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1595230800.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1594958820.0","comment_id":"136888","poster":"Wildsheep","content":"I don't see any specific requirements for deterministic encryption, I'd go for randomized"},{"comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Wildsheep","timestamp":"1594958760.0","content":"Only the historical transaction query system is being migrated to cosmosdb, not the payment processing system","comment_id":"136886"}],"content":"they are migrating the db to cosmos db.
