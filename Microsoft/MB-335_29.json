This ensures that the rework is tracked accurately and tied to the correct material batch.\nSet the batch order as a rework batch (C): Designate the batch order explicitly as a rework batch. This classification helps differentiate it from regular production orders and ensures that it follows the appropriate rework processes.\nReserve the reworked inventory after estimation (E): Reserve the inventory for the rework process once the estimation is complete.
