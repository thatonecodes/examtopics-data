For example, low sensitivity levels will use system suppressions (built-in detections that are always suppressed); tenant suppressions (common activities based on previous activity in the tenant); and user suppressions (common activities based on a user’s previous behavior). High sensitivity levels will suppress only system-level detections.","comment_id":"1115277"},{"poster":"chepeerick","content":"medium and add IP address","timestamp":"1698278220.0","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1054162"},{"content":"The first one should be Medium.\n\nSeverity Medium: \"for example a sign-in attempt from an unusual location.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-overview","comment_id":"1008791","timestamp":"1694828520.0","poster":"trashbox","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"billo79152718","timestamp":"1691061360.0","content":"Correct","comment_id":"971039","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"2","answer_ET":"","question_id":109},{"id":"7NWophPX6snD7XapATFH","question_text":"You provision a Linux virtual machine in a new Azure subscription.\nYou enable Azure Defender and onboard the virtual machine to Azure Defender.\nYou need to verify that an attack on the virtual machine triggers an alert in Azure Defender.\nWhich two Bash commands should you run on the virtual machine?
