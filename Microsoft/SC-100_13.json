Yes, creating private endpoints for the web app and the database layer is a recommended solution to secure the connection between the two layers and meet the Zero Trust model.\n\nPrivate endpoints allow you to access your Azure PaaS services over a private IP address within your virtual network. By creating private endpoints for both the web app and the MongoDB database, traffic between them can be routed through the private network, making it more secure by preventing access from the public internet.\n\nThis approach is recommended because it limits access to only the virtual network where the web app and database are deployed, and it helps to minimize the surface area of potential attacks.
