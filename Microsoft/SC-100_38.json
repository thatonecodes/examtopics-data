The accounts are locked based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. After a password is tried 10 times unsuccessfully (the default attempt threshold), a one-minute lockout occurs. The next time a login is unsuccessful after the account is unlocked (that is, after the account has been automatically unlocked by the service once the lockout period expires), another one-minute lockout occurs and continues for each unsuccessful login.
