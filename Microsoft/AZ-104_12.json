Dynamic groups and conditional access policies.\n\nTo automate the configuration for the finance department users, we need to dynamically assign them to appropriate groups and enforce conditional access policies based on their group membership. Dynamic groups are Azure AD security groups whose membership is based on user or device attributes, such as department, job title, or location. We can create dynamic groups for the finance department users based on their department attribute. Then we can use conditional access policies to restrict access to specific applications or resources based on the users' group membership. For example, we can enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for users in the finance group when they access sensitive financial applications. Dynamic groups and conditional access policies meet the technical requirements by ensuring that user access is controlled based on their group membership and by automating the process of assigning users to the appropriate groups.","comment_id":"868762","timestamp":"1681329660.0","poster":"Madbo"},{"poster":"obaali1990","comment_id":"849678","content":"I passed today March 24, 2023.
