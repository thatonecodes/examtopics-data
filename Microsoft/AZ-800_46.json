This involves making changes to domain controllers. Reason being is that when client try to access \\\\contoso.com, they will end up accessing domain controllers because the domain name contoso.com points to all domain controllers of that domain.\n\nEffectively you will need to create a share named \"document\" on domain controller, within the share create two shortcuts that points to \\\\SRV1\\%sharename% respectively.","comment_id":"1195231"}]},{"id":"ggirRjebl79plKMDaIZn","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1716465660,"exam_id":60,"question_text":"Your network contains an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named contoso.com.
