Company Information -\n\nContoso, Ltd. is an international manufacturing company that has 2,000 employees.\n\nContoso currently uses a third-party meeting service. The company plans to migrate the meeting service to Microsoft Teams and replace all legacy video teleconferencing (VTC) devices.\n\n\nOverview. Physical Locations -\n\nContoso has offices in Toronto, New York, Rome, and London. The company has a global sales team that works remotely.\n\nExisting Environment. Active Directory Environment\n\nThe on-premises network contains an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forest named contoso.com.\n\nExisting Environment. Microsoft 365 and Teams Environment\n\nContoso has a Microsoft 365 subscription. All users are licensed for Microsoft 365 E5 and Teams Premium. All users are enabled for Teams Phone by using Operator Connect.\n\nThe contoso.com domain syncs to Microsoft 365 by using Azure AD Connect cloud sync. All users use the Microsoft Authenticator app for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to cloud services.\n\nA Microsoft Surface Hub device is deployed to the boardroom in each office.\n\nThe reception area at the Toronto office is configured to use a phone number of +14165555555 in Teams.\n\nExisting Environment. Problem Statements\n\nContoso identifies the following issues:\n\n• A user in the London office cannot locate the recorded files from a recurring Teams meeting.\n• Executives in the New York office report having to use Microsoft Authenticator to access their Microsoft OneDrive files from the Surface Hub.\n• A user in the Toronto office reports receiving incoming calls while attending Teams meetings instead of having calls sent automatically to voicemail.\n\n\nRequirements. Planned Changes -\n\nContoso plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Deploy a new Teams-certified endpoint to all the boardrooms and huddle spaces in all the offices.\n• Start a pilot project to deploy an Intelligent Speaker to the boardroom in the Rome office and evaluate transcription and voice attribution capabilities.\n• Deploy a Teams shared device to the lunchroom in the Toronto office. Calls placed to +14165555555 must ring in both the reception area and the lunchroom.\n\nRequirements. Technical Requirements\n\nContoso identifies the following technical requirements:\n\n• The endpoint deployed to each boardroom must include a console on the table. The endpoint must automatically invite the existing Surface Hub when joining a Teams meeting.\n• The sales team must be able to temporarily sign in to the endpoints deployed to the huddle spaces to respond to Teams messages and attend video calls.\n• The endpoints deployed to the huddle spaces must allow only outbound emergency calls when a user is NOT signed in.\n• During Teams meetings, the sales team must have a watermark displayed on shared content.\n\n\nYou need to implement the planned changes for the huddle spaces. The solution must meet the technical requirements.\n\nWhich two types of policies should you configure?
