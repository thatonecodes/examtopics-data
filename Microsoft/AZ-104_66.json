The automatic cluster scaling component can check for pods in your cluster that cannot be scheduled due to resource restrictions. Once problems are detected, the number of nodes in a node pool is increased to meet application requirements. The nodes are also regularly\n\nTo adapt to changing application requirements, e.g. between working day and evening or on a weekend, clusters often need a way to scale automatically. AKS clusters can be scaled in two ways:\n\nAutoscale for clusters checks for pods that cannot be scheduled for nodes due to resource restrictions. In this case, the cluster automatically increases the number of nodes.\nWith horizontal automatic pod scaling, the metric server in a Kubernetes cluster monitors the resource requirements of the pods.
