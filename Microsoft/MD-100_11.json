A is correct answer \nif you go for D, you need KMS server at least\n\nTo force Windows to attempt an online activation, run the following command.slmgr.vbs /ato. If you’re using a retail edition of Windows, this will force Windows to attempt online activation with Microsoft’s servers. If the system is set up to use a KMS activation server, it will instead attempt activation with the KMS server on the local network. This command can be useful if Windows didn’t activate due to a connection or server problem and you want to force it to retry.","poster":"Junhhhch","timestamp":"1619079900.0"}]}],"question_text":"Your company deploys Windows 10 Enterprise to all computers.
