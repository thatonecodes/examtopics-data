In the flow, check if the autonumber value for the record cleanly divides by 10 (i.e., the remainder is zero).\n\nAssign to QV Queue: If the condition is met, assign the record to the QV queue.\n\nThis method is straightforward and ensures that approximately 10 percent of the records are consistently assigned to the QV queue.","poster":"killionb12","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735412280.0","comment_id":"1333118"},{"timestamp":"1728174300.0","poster":"33a7f9e","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1293652","content":"I believe it is A as well.\n\nOption C involves creating a roll-up column on the Service Request table to count qualification records and then generating a random number to assign records. While this approach could work, it introduces additional complexity and dependencies on the Service Request table, which might not be necessary.\n\nOption A, creating an autonumber column on the Qualification table and assigning records based on whether the number cleanly divides by 10, is simpler and more direct. It ensures that approximately 10 percent of the records are assigned without needing to generate random numbers or rely on roll-up columns."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nwhile Option C is technically feasible, Option A is more straightforward and better suited for consistently achieving the requirement of assigning 10 percent of the Qualification records.
