IngredientC for unscented liquid cleaning solution is stored in inventory in 50-liter barrels and allocated in 50-liter increments. Two barrels of IngredientC are uses to produce a barrel of unscented liquid cleaning solution.\nCurrent environment. Production sites\nThe Eastern United States facility manufactures equipment.\nThe Western United States facility manufactures liquid cleaning solutions.\nRaw materials and finished products are stocked at the warehouse and distributed from the warehouse.\nCurrent environment. Warehouse facilities\nThe warehouse consists of the following zones:\n//IMG//\n\nRequirements. Cleaning equipment manufacturing\nYou identify the following requirements for manufacturing cleaning equipment:\nProduction is Make to Stock and must be scheduled at an operational level.\nMachine equipment is produced on an assembly line. Scheduling must be based on production orders.\nFinished products must be packaged and shipped directly from the warehouse.\nTo reduce delivery times and excess inventory, equipment must be produced as needed.\nThe ability to schedule production must be based on resource capacity and the availability of required materials.\nProduction order operations must be scheduled to start only when capacity and materials are available at the same time and in the required quantities.\nRequirements. Liquid cleaning solution manufacturing\nProduction is Make to Order and is scheduled at the job level. Products must be manufactured in batches.\nFinished products must be packaged and shipped directly from the warehouse.\nYou must be able to calculate the estimated consumption of ingredients and ensure that the amount is divisible by the number of units the raw material is available.\nFormula changes must be reviewed and approved. You must ensure that approved formulas cannot be deleted or edited. Approved formulas may be deactivated.\nAn ingredient used to manufacture unscented cleaning solution is defined as a restricted product. You must be able to automatically print a product safety data sheet (PSDS) with the packing slip for any order that includes unscented cleaning solution.\nProduction must be scheduled to start by date and time according to the order that is specified by the production route.\nYou must implement a scheduled Kanban rule that meets the following requirements:\nPrevent overloading a work cell for scheduled Kanbans.\nVisualize excess inventory in a supermarket.\nStore products in supermarkets before they are consumed or shipped.\nYou must link relevant financial dimension data to the inventory transactions at each site to ensure that you can trace profit and loss figures directly to East site and West site respectively.\nYou must set up production operations for sub-contracting of Pine scent and Orange scent solution to VendorA to ensure that a purchase order is automatically created based on estimation of a production order.\n\nRequirements. Costing -\nThe price of raw materials used for manufacturing unscented cleaning solution must be tracked based upon commodity exchange pricing. The margin and cost multiplier must be set up for commodity traded raw material.\nYou must set up cost calculation groups to ensure that indirect costs that originate in the manufacturing of finished goods are recognized and absorbed into the product cost.\nThe production manager needs to set up picking list journals and BOM item consumption.\n\nRequirements. Reporting -\nProduction control parameters must be setup for reporting of automatic BOM and Route consumption.\nYou must create reports that include information about cost records and categories for items, and calculation formulas for indirect costs.\nYou must treat manufactured items as purchased items for cost roll-up purposes during BOM calculations and reporting.\nYou must configure automatic route consumption in connection with the automatic running of Report as finished.\n\nRequirements. Inventory control -\nYou must not be required to track the lot number for items when you enter inventory information into the system. Lot numbers for items must be entered when items are picked from inventory.\n\nIssues -\nUsers report the following issues:\nThe production manager observes that items are being deducted from inventory two times on production jobs. A shop supervisor mistakenly registers the process for assembling batteries for the pressure washers to Registered as prepared. You must reschedule the process for a future date.\nCustomer1 orders 20 barrels of unscented solution. The order is confirmed. Production must be scheduled to start on December 21 to meet the customers delivery deadline.\nUser2 reports that costs for manufactured items are twice as high as expected.\nUser1 reports that the formula for the liquid cleaning solution sometimes changes during production. You must enforce the policies regarding formula editing for current and future use.\nYou need to plan scheduling for Customer1’s order of unscented solution.\nWhat are two possible ways to achieve the goal?
