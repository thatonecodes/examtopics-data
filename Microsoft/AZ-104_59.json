When you want to add your custom DNS name to the web app, just scale your plan up to the Shared tier. Later, when you want to create an SSL binding, scale your plan up to Basic tier. When you want to have staging environments, scale up to Standard tier. When you need more cores, memory, or storage, scale up to a bigger VM size in the same tier.\n\nThe same works in the reverse.
