As a result, you might see flow log entries for flows from internet IP addresses, if the flow is destined to a port in the range of ports assigned for SNAT.

Routes will be necessary in order to route traffic from and to VNET1/VNET3 thru VM2 appliance.\n\nWrong Answers:\n\nA. On the peering connections, use remote gateways.\n\nThis will make spoke VNETs able to use a remote gateway say, in VNET2, but the question doesn't present such scenario.\n\nC.
