What B2B setting are we configuring? I assume that the answer is external collaboration settings, since there's no mention about collaborating with another Microsoft Entra organization.\n\nMicrosoft says:\nB2B collaboration is enabled by default, but comprehensive admin settings let you control your inbound and outbound B2B collaboration with external partners and organizations:\n\nFor B2B collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations, use cross-tenant access settings. Manage inbound and outbound B2B collaboration, and scope access to specific users, groups, and applications. Set a default configuration that applies to all external organizations, and then create individual, organization-specific settings as needed. Using cross-tenant access settings, you can also trust multi-factor (MFA) and device claims (compliant claims and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined claims) from other Microsoft Entra organizations.","poster":"penatuna"}],"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"isMC":false,"answer":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/sc-300/image307.png"],"unix_timestamp":1698997680}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":383,"provider":"Microsoft","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"name":"SC-300","isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false,"id":123},"currentPage":12},"__N_SSP":true}
