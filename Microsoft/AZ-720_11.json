If an endpoint is healthy and functioning correctly, it should respond with a 200 status code.\n\nPlease note that this method does not directly check the status of the Azure Traffic Manager's health probe. To directly verify the status of a Traffic Manager endpoint, you would typically use the Get-AzTrafficManagerEndpoint cmdlet.

Here's a bit of context:\n\nThe default standard email protocol (SMTP) uses port 25 for email communication.\nHowever, many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and cloud services, including Azure, block outbound SMTP traffic over port 25 to prevent spam.\nGiven the situation, the problem could be that the email traffic is being sent over port 25, which might be blocked. Hence, it's not an issue with the priority of the rules, the protocol, or the application of the NSG itself. The issue is likely related to the port being used for the email traffic.\n\nAzure recommends using port 587 for secure email transmission or SMTP relay.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nB.
