Template app\n\nTo allow vendors to view a Power BI report using their own tenant environment, a Template app should be used. A Template app is a pre-built solution that contains a collection of dashboards, reports, and datasets that can be customized and shared with specific users or groups of users. When a vendor views a Template app, they are accessing a version of the app that is hosted within their own tenant environment, which means they can securely view the report without needing to be given direct access to the original report.\n\nDashboards, mobile apps, and workspaces are not the best options for this scenario as they do not provide the same level of tenant-level isolation and control as a Template app. Dashboards are typically used for monitoring specific KPIs, mobile apps are designed for on-the-go access to data, and workspaces are used for collaboration between team members.","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"834155","timestamp":"1678377900.0","comments":[{"content":"Don't rely on Chat4GPT I failed my renewal with Chat4GPT (50% was wrong)","comment_id":"1017484","timestamp":"1695711300.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"RickertDP"}],"poster":"Sreyas"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731360540.0","poster":"52f8a31","content":"C: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-apps","comment_id":"1310330"},{"content":"A.

Publish to Web: If the report doesn’t contain sensitive data and is meant for wide distribution, you can use “Publish to Web.” This option allows you to publicly publish your reports to the web, including blog posts, websites, emails, or social media. Viewers won’t need a Power BI Pro license to access these reports, but be aware that there’s no authentication feature, so anyone on the internet can view them1.\n\n2. Embedding using an iFrame: For more secure access, consider embedding the report into an internal web portal using an iFrame.
