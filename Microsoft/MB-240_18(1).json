General overview\n-\n\nContoso is a large international manufacturing company that has offices around the world with service and scheduling departments in each office. In addition, Contoso has sales reps throughout the world.\n\nContoso has main offices in North America, Europe and Asia, with global headquarters based in Redmond, Washington, USA. Each of the regional offices has their own sales and service teams. The regional HQ locations also include sales and services leaders and executive management. Global HQ houses company executives for various departments, including sales and service.\n\nOffice hours are from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, every day of the week except holidays, which have no work hours. This applies to all offices, using their local time zone.\n\nThird-party contractors handle work outside of normal work hours at a higher rate.\n\n\nOverview. Field Service staff\n-\n\nContoso's service technicians around the world will be a combination of internal employees and third-party contractors.\n• Pay type is Straight for regular work hours, and Overtime for work on holidays and after hours.\n• All technicians have the capacity of handling just one job at a time, while supervisors can handle 2 jobs at a time.\n\nContoso’s internal field service employees:\n• Begin and end their workday at their home of record.\n• Have a default office location / regional office.\n• Are assigned to multiple territories.\n\nAll third-party contractors:\n• Begin and end their workdays at their office location.\n• Have a default office location / regional office.\n• Are assigned to only one territory.\n\nDispatchers:\n• Work at the Main office for their region.\n• Assigned to all territories in the region.\n• Have privileges to customize their Schedule Boards.\n\nAll field service technicians will utilize the Field Service mobile app.\n• Contoso employees will have full field service licenses, while third-party contractors will not.\n• Field Service technicians will not have access to Leads, Opportunities or other sales-specific data.\n• Dispatchers can see all data for their region, though they will mostly be scheduling for only one territory.\n\nContoso has several classes to distinguish the capability and training level of its field technicians. All work order bookings need to respect these classes and book resources accordingly.\n\nExisting environment. Org structure setup\n\nContoso currently uses Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement for leads, opportunities, quotes and orders. There are currently 200 sales users in North America, 500 in Europe and 400 in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe Contoso physical environment is structured in the following manner, with the roles noted.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nExisting environment. Data management structure\n\nContoso's sales teams currently can only see data within their region. HQ locations for each region have visibility to data for all locations in their regions only. All of the data rolls-up to Contoso Global HQ for executive management reporting. Sales Reps who work with global accounts struggle to obtain the data they need to support their clients.\n\nThe current data access structure appears as follows:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nExisting environment. Field Service structure\n\nContoso's field service technicians respond to all installation work orders with two human resources:\n• One licensed technician (Level 3), and...\n• One apprentice technician. Apprentices can be either Level 1 (new trainee) or Level 2 (halfway through training).\n\nIn many cases installation work also requires the use of specialty tools, depending on what is being installed. The current system does not have any way to track the level of skill for each resource, nor the uses for the specialty tools. This is handled as \"tribal knowledge.\"\n\nPreventative maintenance work orders can be handled by one resource if they are a Level 2. If the resource is a Level 1, they must be accompanied by a Level 3 resource, and vice versa.\n\nAll field service technicians are required to complete OSHA training annually. In their first year of apprenticeship they must complete the full 40-hour course. In the next 2 years they must complete the 8-hour refresher course. This cycle repeats every 3 years for the duration of their employment.\n\nIn the current system, when a technician has finished with a work order, they turn in the paper copy with their notes to the dispatcher. The dispatcher then gives that information to a back-office employee, who will check the work order to ensure accuracy before creating an invoice. Contoso wishes to automate this exact process in the new system.\n\nExisting environment. Customer base\n\nAbout half of Contoso's customer base includes Not For Profit service organizations. The implications for billing are complex, so it's important that Tax Exempt Status be noted for all Accounts and flow through to all Work Orders. NFP Customers who are associated with government entities will pay for travel time: other customers will not. This information should flow from the Billing Account to all associated Service Accounts.\n\nMost Contoso customers sign agreements for Preventative Maintenance. Contoso uses templates and incidents to ensure services standards are the same across all regions. Preventative Maintenance agreements include monthly inspection and quarterly cleaning and inspection, with billing occurring quarterly.\n\nRequirements. Remaining consistent\n\nContoso plans to keep the current data structure and extend it to the new Field Service functionality.\n\nField Service users will fall under the same organizational structure currently implemented for the sales staff.\n• Field service technicians will only be able to see their assigned work orders and bookings.\n• Dispatchers will be able to see all work orders and bookings for the region.\n\n\nRequirements. Planned changes\n-\n\nContoso plans to implement Dynamics 365 Field Service with mobile access. They will be using incidents, work orders, bookings and invoicing. The following requirements were gathered during analysis:\n\n1. Work Orders and Scheduling.\no Automated and suggestion-based scheduling.\no Scheduling based on required technician skills and number of technicians needed.\no Schedule resources based on location, minimizing travel time when possible.\no Technicians must be onsite within 3 hours of an emergency Work Order being assigned to them.\no The travel time should automatically update upon changing a booking.\n2. Agreements\no Setup and create work orders, bookings and invoices for preventative maintenance with work orders automatically created 14 days before PM is due.\no Escalation of Work Orders based upon agreed customer commitment\no Ability to designate clients as Preferred, with special pricing.\n3. Products and Services\no Warehousing and inventory management processes will be implemented, including tracking products moved onto trucks for installation at customer sites.\no Implement a parts return process that includes having a technician uninstall the part to be returned.\no Multiple price lists will be used, divided into Gold, Silver and Bronze levels, based on the spending level of each customer.\no Internal teams need the capability to associate a 3D image to a Customer Asset record.\no Products added to a work order should be set to Allocated.\n4. Resources\no Implement Company Holidays for North American regions,\no Implement Paid Time Off for all regions,\no Specialty equipment will be scheduled on work orders as needed,\no Training and skill levels will be noted as appropriate for resources.\n5. System\no Geocoding will be activated throughout the system.\n\nRequirements. Technical requirements\n\nContoso identified the following technical requirements:\n\n1. Invoicing\no Auto creation of invoices upon work completion.\no The system must track the price of resources based on holidays and after-hours scenarios at a rate of one and a half times the normal billing rate.\no Travel time is billable for all field service technicians, pay type Travel, which should be noted on all Service Accounts.\n2. Resources\no Contractor technicians require access to work order and customer details once assigned to a booking.\no Dispatchers need a schedule board for their region(s).\n3. Products and Services\no All parts that are removed from a customer s equipment must be returned to the Main warehouse.\no Products to be marked as Assets will be configured accordingly.\no All products that will become Assets require installation by a technician.\no All products are received into the Main warehouse.\n4. Work Orders\no The ability to have templates for work orders: The templates will provide guidance for technicians along with recommended products and default services.\no Once a work order is posted it should no longer show on views.\no Contoso will use the ‘out of the box' work order statuses to begin, though they may be changed in later phases of the project\n5. Scheduling\no Once a work order is scheduled, do not change the time.\no Work Orders scheduled to technician(s) who do not have the desired skill set and level should show a warning.\n6. Security and access\no Safeguards must be in place for the data on the Field Service Mobile App if a technician loses his mobile phone or tablet device.\no The Field Service Administrator needs the ability to update the defaults for the schedule assistant.\n7. Accounts\no Any Service Accounts that do not have a Billing Account noted should show a warning.\no Any Billing Accounts that do not have a Price List noted should show a warning.\n\n\nYou need to create a Preventative Maintenance Agreement that meets Contoso standards and requirements.\n\nWhich five steps should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.\n\n//IMG//","answer":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/141307-exam-mb-240-topic-1-question-200-discussion/","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/mb-240/image113.png"],"timestamp":"2024-05-26 21:27:00","discussion":[{"poster":"df1e596","comment_id":"1219126","timestamp":"1716751620.0","comments":[{"poster":"Net_IT","content":"A single agreement can have various booking setups.

Regions\n-\n\nDispatchers can see all work request data for their region, including resources.\n\nThe United States regions are:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nCanadian regions are broken down by province where Litware, Inc. either has stores or provides services:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nExisting Environment. Data management structure\n\nLitware, Inc, store employees can see data within their region. This is to provide better support of customers and stores within the regions.\n\nThe current data access structure appears as follows:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nExisting Environment. Field Service difficulties\n\nTypical job assignment is as follows:\n• Appliance Delivery & Hookup: 2 resources - subcontracted out\n• Landscaping: minimum 2 resources. 1 expert\n• Carpeting: 2-3 resources\n• Tile Flooring: 2 resources\n• Kitchen Cabinets: 3 resources\n• Hardwood Flooring: 2 resources\n• Repairs: 1-2 resources\n\nA spreadsheet tracks the skills and certifications earned by each internal employee. They are:\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nThe Skill Proficiency Model used at Litware, Inc. is as follows:\n1 - Novice\n2 - Inexperienced\n3 - Moderate Experience\n4 - Experienced\n5 - Expert/Certified\n\nFor each type of job, there must be at least one certified or highly experienced resource on the job. Their current system does not have a way to share technical documents and instructions with the technicians and have them review it while onsite.\n\nAll work is printed out and the provided to the resources. Contractors are currently emailed the job details to which they need to confirm availability. Contractors sometimes decline work. In some of these cases, the Litware, Inc. dispatch team does not react quickly to this information and the customer’s work or delivery is delayed.\n\nExisting Environment. Customer base\n\nCurrently all customers and their data are held in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (D365 F&O).\n• Most store employees do not have access to this data as it is currently being implemented for backend features, such as inventory and invoicing.\n• Designers and those scheduling can pull up a customer and their pending orders and installations, but they cannot see the payment details and terms.\n\n85% of Litware’s customers are households.\n\n15% are construction-based companies that either purchase or hire Litware, Inc. for specific jobs.\n• Most of these companies receive a 5-10% discount on supplies and 10% discount on labor.\n• Some are Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) and they receive a flat 15% discount.\n\n\nRequirements.

The duration (1 hour) might be unnecessary for a flat fee, but the core pricing and locking logic fits. This is correct.\n\nB. - This establishes the delivery charge as a billable service item, which is necessary for it to be added to work orders and invoiced upon completion.

This is incorrect due to redundancy and context.\n\nE. - While \"Non-Inventory\" could technically work, \"Service\" (option B) is more appropriate for a delivery charge, as it’s a performed action tied to invoicing upon completion, not a non-stocked physical item.
