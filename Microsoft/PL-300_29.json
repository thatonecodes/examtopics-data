Comment and vote carefully.\nThe answer is A&E. \nTo choose reference or duplicate or copy, the points are:\n1: Reference, duplicate, copy queries will all make the file bigger to a similar size.\n2: Choose Reference if you want the referenced queries to change when the original query changes. Choose Duplicate or Copy if you don’t want that. Reference queries is more common in many real-world scenarios because the fact table is always changing.\n3: Copy and Duplicate copy the transformation steps but reference not.\nDisable the load for the Sales Data query will : (1) It will be cleaner in Power BI desktop because you won’t see the Sales data query. (2) improve performance. The star schema is normally the best in Power Bi modelling because of the performance. And this is the reason why we need to separate the main table into different tables(Normalization). The main table itself should not be included in a star scheme."},{"content":"Selected Answer: AE\nAgreed, A & E are correct","upvote_count":"16","comment_id":"972908","poster":"pverde","timestamp":"1691231700.0"},{"poster":"5bf040d","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1395554","timestamp":"1741941900.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA. Reference the Sales Data query to create the new queries.\n• Referencing the Sales Data query allows you to create new queries (Product Dimension and Sales Fact) that are based on the original data without duplicating it.\nE. Disable the load for the Sales Data query.\n\nDisabling the load for the Sales Data query ensures that the data from this query is not loaded into the data model, which helps minimize the size of the dataset. The Product Dimension and Sales Fact queries will still have access to the data, but the original Sales Data query won't consume additional resources by being loaded into the model."},{"content":"Selected Answer: AE\nThe correct answer is AE because: In Power BI, \"reference\" means creating a new query that is linked to an original query, so any changes made to the original query will automatically update the reference query, while \"duplicate\" creates a completely independent copy of a query, where modifications to the duplicate won't affect the original query; essentially, a reference keeps the queries connected, while a duplicate separates them completely.","comment_id":"1346527","poster":"SylUK","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737820560.0"},{"comment_id":"1314786","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732033440.0","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nI would vote for A and E.","poster":"jaume"},{"timestamp":"1729604160.0","poster":"23042b9","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nITS A and B in my opinion .

This means that you won’t be able to use it directly for analysis or in relationships with other tables.\n\nImpact on Referenced Queries: If you reference Sales Data for the Product Dimension and Sales Fact queries, those references would not function properly because the source data (Sales Data) is not loaded into the model.","comment_id":"1301600"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1271018","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA & E is correct","poster":"539d541","timestamp":"1724379960.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA, E is the correct one","comment_id":"1268507","poster":"rcaliandro","timestamp":"1724054880.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AE\nReference queries and Disable Sales Data Query works as per real-world scenarios.","timestamp":"1709879280.0","poster":"Rhugved","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1168592"},{"poster":"lukelin08","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nA&E is correct","comment_id":"1124665","timestamp":"1705462200.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1112533","upvote_count":"7","content":"Selected Answer: AE\nTo create two queries named Product Dimension and Sales Fact based on the Sales Data query in Power Query Editor, while minimizing maintenance effort and the size of the dataset, you should perform the following two actions:\n\nReference the Sales Data query to create the new queries: This allows you to reuse the loaded data without the need for additional storage or processing.

That is form to create a calendar table based in the dates of the fact table, for example: if I create based on the fact table, the last date will be the last date of the fact table.\n\n2. Other way of create a calendar table is just to put the days of a number of years that you want, so, in this case the last date will be the last date of the calendar table and not the last date of the fact table. \nSo, in my opinion it is better annul this question, or consider lastnonblankvalue and lastdate correct.","comment_id":"981126","timestamp":"1692050100.0","comments":[{"content":"yep question is confusing indeed","comment_id":"1272129","poster":"539d541","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724589900.0"}],"upvote_count":"5"}],"answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou are creating a Power BI model to analyze inventory.\n\nYou load data into three tables named Date, Product, and Inventory.

The correct inventory quantity for a given product in a month is the last recorded value for that month.\n\nYou need to write a DAX measure that will show the correct inventory value when a user analyzes inventory by year, month, or date.\n\nHow should you complete the measure?
