SQL Managed Instance has near 100% compatibility with the latest SQL Server (Enterprise Edition) database engine, providing a native virtual network (VNet) implementation that addresses common security concerns, and a business model favorable for existing SQL Server customers. SQL Managed Instance allows existing SQL Server customers to lift and shift their on-premises applications to the cloud with minimal application and database changes. At the same time, SQL Managed Instance preserves all PaaS capabilities (automatic patching and version updates, automated backups, high availability) that drastically reduce management overhead and TCO."},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1692247980.0","comment_id":"811578","content":"These types of comments bring ZERO(0) value to the question and the website","upvote_count":"5","poster":"xRiot007"}],"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"807678","poster":"ChristiaanK53","timestamp":"1691943480.0","content":"Marketing 100"}],"question_text":"Which Azure SQL offering provides near-100 percent compatibility with on-premises Microsoft SQL Server instances, while providing automated updates. backups, and maintenance tasks?","question_id":147,"unix_timestamp":1676312280,"exam_id":73,"question_images":[],"answer":"A","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/99090-exam-dp-900-topic-1-question-242-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines","D":"Azure SQL Edge","C":"Azure SQL Database","A":"Azure SQL Managed Instance"},"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-02-13 19:18:00"},{"id":"FbUZGQfSSGzUr5xqhNE0","unix_timestamp":1677548400,"exam_id":73,"answer_ET":"","answer":"","question_id":148,"answer_description":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-900/image24.png"],"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-02-28 02:40:00","discussion":[{"poster":"qcmarco","timestamp":"1693179600.0","content":"Correct answer!","comment_id":"824290","upvote_count":"6"},{"timestamp":"1725429360.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1165378","content":"keys correct","poster":"AGTraining"},{"content":"Relational data uses keys and relationships to enforce relationships between different tables.\n\nIn a relational database, data is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each row represents a single record or entity, and each column represents a specific attribute or property of that record.\n\nKeys play a crucial role in establishing relationships between tables. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring its uniqueness and providing a way to reference that row from other tables. Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables by linking a column in one table to the primary key column in another table.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"947180","poster":"fiksarion","timestamp":"1704807120.0"}],"answers_community":[],"isMC":false,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/dp-900/image23.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/101024-exam-dp-900-topic-1-question-243-discussion/","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nSelect the answer that correctly completes the sentence.\n\n//IMG//"},{"id":"bp88RK1oIEDA6MQf1C5W","answers_community":[],"question_id":149,"answer_description":"","exam_id":73,"answer_ET":"","answer":"","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nSelect the answer that correctly completes the sentence.\n\n//IMG//","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1675888320.0","poster":"ravick4u","upvote_count":"34","comment_id":"802527","content":"Duplicate of #32 and the answer for that question is \"a target data store powerful enough to transform data\"","comments":[{"poster":"danayeonz","timestamp":"1676169300.0","comment_id":"805897","upvote_count":"8","content":"Agreed.
