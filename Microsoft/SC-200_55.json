In Microsoft 365 and Defender for Endpoint, devices are often managed in groups (known as device groups or device collections). By adding the specific devices to a group, you can then configure the rule to apply only to that group. This ensures that the rule is only applied to the 10 devices you intend to target.\nOption D: Assign a tag to the devices.\n\nIncorrect. Assigning a tag to devices can help with organization and management within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, but it doesn’t directly control rule application.
