You still need to separately configure directory or file-level permissions for Azure file shares.\n\nConfigure directory or file-level permissions for Azure Files\nAzure file shares enforce standard Windows file permissions at both the directory and file level, including the root directory. Configuration of directory or file-level permissions is supported over both SMB and REST. Mount the target file share from your VM and configure permissions using Windows File Explorer, Windows icacls, or the Set-ACL command.","poster":"leo_az300"},{"comment_id":"583260","poster":"hertino","content":"In AZ-305 exam, 9 april 22","upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1649499540.0"},{"comment_id":"563848","timestamp":"1646813160.0","poster":"plmmsg","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. an Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS) instance"},{"content":"correct answer is C.
