Azure AD authenticates employees by using on-premises passwords.\nAzure AD Domain Services for hybrid organizations\nOrganizations with a hybrid IT infrastructure consume a mix of cloud resources and on-premises resources. Such organizations synchronize identity information from their on-premises directory to their Azure AD tenant. As hybrid organizations look to migrate more of their on-premises applications to the cloud, especially legacy directory-aware applications, Azure AD Domain Services can be useful to them.\nExample: Litware Corporation has deployed Azure AD Connect, to synchronize identity information from their on-premises directory to their Azure AD tenant. The identity information that is synchronized includes user accounts, their credential hashes for authentication (password hash sync) and group memberships.\n\nUser accounts, group memberships, and credentials from Litware's on-premises directory are synchronized to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect. These user accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available within the managed domain.\nBox 2: User management occurs on-premises. The on-promises domain controller authenticates employee credentials.\nYou can federate your on-premises environment with Azure AD and use this federation for authentication and authorization. This sign-in method ensures that all user authentication occurs on-premises.\n\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-fed","answer":"","answer_ET":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0005400001.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/38719-exam-az-304-topic-2-question-8-discussion/","isMC":false,"topic":"2","unix_timestamp":1607020140,"question_id":92,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1607020140.0","content":"Correct","comment_id":"234241","upvote_count":"49","poster":"mmmore"},{"comment_id":"271540","upvote_count":"14","timestamp":"1611091200.0","content":"Right ans.\n\nSync identity denotes Pass thru authentication or Pass hash sync.

The user’s password hash is synchronized from the on-premises environment to the cloud in what is called a password hash. When using synchronized the one caveat is that if a user is disabled in the on-premises environment, it can take up to three hours for that account status to show up in Azure AD.
