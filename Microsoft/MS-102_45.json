The forest contains all the identities used for user and computer authentication. Each department is represented by a top-level organizational unit (OU) that contains several child OUs for user accounts and computer accounts.\nAll users authenticate to on-premises applications by signing in to their device by using a UPN format of username@fabrikam.com.\nFabrikam does NOT plan to implement identity federation.\n\nNetwork Infrastructure -\nEach office has a high-speed connection to the Internet.\nEach office contains two domain controllers. All domain controllers are configured as DNS servers.\nThe public zone for fabrikam.com is managed by an external DNS server.\nAll users connect to an on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 organization. The users access their email by using Outlook Anywhere, Outlook on the web, or the Microsoft Outlook app for iOS. All the Exchange servers have the latest cumulative updates installed.\nAll shared company documents are stored on a Microsoft SharePoint Server farm.\n\nRequirements -\n\nPlanned Changes -\nFabrikam plans to implement a Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscription and move all email and shared documents to the subscription.\nFabrikam plans to implement two pilot projects:\nProject1: During Project1, the mailboxes of 100 users in the sales department will be moved to Microsoft 365.\nProject2: After the successful completion of Project1, Microsoft Teams will be enabled in Microsoft 365 for the sales department users.\nFabrikam plans to create a group named UserLicenses that will manage the allocation of all Microsoft 365 bulk licenses.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\nFabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:\nAll users must be able to exchange email messages successfully during Project1 by using their current email address.\nUsers must be able to authenticate to cloud services if Active Directory becomes unavailable.\nA user named User1 must be able to view all DLP reports from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\nMicrosoft 365 Apps for enterprise applications must be installed from a network share only.\nDisruptions to email access must be minimized.\n\nApplication Requirements -\nFabrikam identifies the following application requirements:\nAn on-premises web application named App1 must allow users to complete their expense reports online. App1 must be available to users from the My Apps portal.\nThe installation of feature updates for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise must be minimized.\n\nSecurity Requirements -\nFabrikam identifies the following security requirements:\nAfter the planned migration to Microsoft 365, all users must continue to authenticate to their mailbox and to SharePoint sites by using their UPN.\nThe membership of the UserLicenses group must be validated monthly.

However, there might be a potential issue with the first rule. \n\nIn your first rule, you're targeting all users and all locations except a custom trusted location (Public IP Ranges of the company), and you're granting access with MFA + Compliant device. This rule might conflict with the third rule where you're blocking all users from signing in from outside the United States and Canada.\n\nThe issue arises because the first rule could potentially allow users to sign in from outside the United States and Canada if they're using a compliant device and MFA, which contradicts the third rule that aims to block all sign-ins from outside these two countries.\n\nTherefore, it's safer to separate these into two different rules to avoid any potential conflicts or overlaps. This way, you can ensure that each rule is enforced correctly without any unintended consequences. Hence, a total of 5 rules would be needed to meet all the requirements. \n\nPlease note that the actual configuration might vary based on the specific settings and conditions in your environment. It's always a good idea to test the policies in a controlled environment before deploying them in a production environment.","comment_id":"1068012","poster":"golijat","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699726560.0","comments":[{"content":"It wont work like that .
