Select Allow gateway transit on VNet1.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe issue here is that Client1 is not able to connect to VNet2. This is because VNet2 is not connected to the VPN gateway and doesn't have a gateway of its own. To enable traffic from Client1 to VNet2, we need to enable gateway transit on VNet1.\n\nGateway transit allows a virtual network to use the VPN gateway in another virtual network to access resources in that network. In this case, enabling gateway transit on VNet1 will allow Client1 to access resources in VNet2 using the VPN gateway in VNet1.\n\nEnabling gateway transit on VNet2 (option C) is not needed in this scenario because VNet2 doesn't have a VPN gateway. Enabling BGP on VPNGW1 (option D) is not required because the scenario mentions that static routing is being used.\n\nDownloading and re-installing the VPN client configuration package (option A) is not required as the point-to-site VPN connection from Client1 to VNet1 is already established and working.

VM1 is by default allowed to connect to VNET outbound from default rule \"AllowVnetOutBound\". So it works for both. [P.S.] Others say by default VMs on same VNET can connect automatically which is true but idk if the question saying via RDP makes a difference.\n\nHere is the reference and be sure to check the priority of rules to see which one comes first.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview#default-security-rules"},{"content":"Don't meant to throw you guys off but:\nHow do you intend to RDP into VM2 from VM1 when you can't RDP into VM1 in the first place?
