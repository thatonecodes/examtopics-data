Azure Data Factory is the platform that solves such data scenarios. It is the cloud-based ETL and data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating data movement and transforming data at scale. Using Azure Data Factory, you can create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that can ingest data from disparate data stores. You can build complex ETL processes that transform data visually with data flows or by using compute services such as Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Database. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/introduction","poster":"Neetiniti","comment_id":"138381"},{"timestamp":"1614683880.0","comment_id":"301931","upvote_count":"1","poster":"mindtrax","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"301934","upvote_count":"2","content":"Ignore this please AZCopy is for copying files to a Storage Account and here an upload to an Azure SQL DB is required","timestamp":"1614684240.0","poster":"mindtrax"}],"timestamp":"1614684000.0","poster":"mindtrax","content":"There is a question like this in the 304 as well but there minimized costs is mentioned and AZCopy is the selected answer.","comment_id":"301933"}],"content":"ADF is quit an expensive solution for something AZ Copy can do as well.
