You can log IP traffic using either of the two following tools:\ni. NSG Flow Logs (log information about IP traffic flowing through a network security group) or \nii. VNET Flow Logs (log information about IP traffic flowing through a virtual network)\n\nIt is to be noted that NSG flow logs have a retention feature that allows deleting the logs automatically up to a year after their creation. Retention is available only if you use general-purpose v2 storage accounts.\nSo, despite the fact that there is no mention of NSG for VM5, in order to make use of retention feature, NSG flow must be implemented which would need GPv2 storage account.
