For example, a researcher might take measurements of penguins, and group them based on similarities in their proportions.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-classification-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/classification-scenarios\nClassification is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or class, an item belongs to. This machine learning technique can be applied to binary and multi-class scenarios. For example, a health clinic might use the characteristics of a patient (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to predict whether the patient is at risk of diabetes. In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a binary classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.","timestamp":"1687562340.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"917131","timestamp":"1686135480.0","poster":"sam_111","comments":[{"timestamp":"1686136500.0","comment_id":"917143","upvote_count":"5","poster":"sam_111","content":"I find out the answer.
