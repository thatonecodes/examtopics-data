Microsoft Entra Identity Governance\n\nMicrosoft Entitlement Management, part of Azure AD Identity Governance, allows you to implement access reviews and request workflows for applications, including third-party SaaS apps like App1.

Users can request access to App1, provide additional information during the request, and managers can periodically review and verify access.\n\nB.
