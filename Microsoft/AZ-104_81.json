An Azure Firewall can be used with peered networks, but as the question does not mention peering the firewall cannot be applied to networks in another region.\n\"You can deploy Azure Firewall on any virtual network, but customers typically deploy it on a central virtual network and peer other virtual networks to it in a hub-and-spoke model. You can then set the default route from the peered virtual networks to point to this central firewall virtual network. Global VNet peering is supported, but it isn't recommended because of potential performance and latency issues across regions.

After that, when defining your test groups, you are requested to add sources and destinations. For the destinations, you can pick any region you like. However, the source endpoints are limited to the region you chose for the CM resource (the region is grayed out). So to monitor the connection from Azure VMs to your on-prem network, you'd need one CM in each region, to be able to choose the VMs in the region as the source, and your on-prem endpoints as the destination. Therefore, you'd need 2 CM instances. To use just one CM, I guess you'd have to pick your on-prem network as the source, and then add all the Azure VMs as destinations.

This is because Load Balancer is a resource that is used to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs) in a backend pool. The VMs in the backend pool must also be in the same resource group as the Load Balancer and vnet.\n\nWhen you create a Load Balancer, you must specify the vnet it will be used with, and the resource group that both the Load Balancer and vnet belong to. If you try to create a Load Balancer in a different resource group than the vnet, you will receive an error message.\n\nIt's important to note that while the Load Balancer and vnet must be in the same resource group, they can be in different regions.
