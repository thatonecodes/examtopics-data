However relying on the table showing the default permissions you can see that readers and contributors have write access to their own queries and not to the shared ones. Surely a contributor can receive write access from an administrator to shared queries as well. I don't know about the reader. So I decided to test the functionality directly on the Azure DevOps portal and it works. With a reader user I was able to create and save a query to MyQueries. Not only that, I was also able to create the charts. I think Readers is the correct choice also because the access is provided to a project manager who is only interested in monitoring activities and making a report to show to other people (for example customers or managers). In fact it is not required anywhere in the question that the queries are shared. \n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/set-query-permissions?view=azure-devops#default-query-permissions","timestamp":"1648020060.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"rdemontis","comments":[{"timestamp":"1648020480.0","comments":[{"content":"To be honest I'm not so sure readers is the right answer.

Using the steps below, you can set up Azure Automation to talk to Azure using this authentication type.\nStep 1: Find the Azure Active Directory associated with the Azure subscription to manage:\n1. Log in to the Azure portal as the service administrator for the Azure subscription you want to manage using Azure Automation. You can find this user by logging in to the Azure portal as any user with access to this Azure subscription, then clicking Settings, then Administrators.\n\n2. Note the name of the directory associated with the Azure subscription you want to manage. You can find this directory by clicking Settings, then Subscriptions.\n\nStep 2: Create an Azure Active Directory user in the directory associated with the Azure subscription to manage:\nYou can skip this step if you already have an Azure Active Directory user in this directory. and plan to use this OrgId to manage Azure.\n1. In the Azure portal click on Active Directory service.\n\n2. Click the directory name that is associated with this Azure subscription.\n3. Click on the Users tab and then click the Add User button.\n4. For type of user, select ג€New user in your organization.ג€ Enter a username for the user to create.\n5. Fill out the user's profile. For role, pick ג€User.ג€ Don't enable multi-factor authentication. Multi-factor accounts cannot be used with Azure Automation.\n6. Click Create.\n7. Jot down the full username (including part after @ symbol) and temporary password.\nStep 3: Allow this Azure Active Directory user to manage this Azure subscription.\n1. Click on Settings (bottom Azure tab under StorSimple)\n\n2. Click Administrators\n3. Click the Add button. Type the full user name (including part after @ symbol) of the Azure Active Directory user you want to set up to manage Azure. For subscriptions, choose the Azure subscriptions you want this user to be able to manage. Click the check mark.\nStep 4: Configure Azure Automation to use this Azure Active Directory user to manage this Azure subscription\nCreate an Azure Automation credential asset containing the username and password of the Azure Active Directory user that you have just created. You can create a credential asset in Azure Automation by clicking into an Automation Account and then clicking the Assets tab, then the Add Setting button.\n\nNote: Once you have set up the Azure Active Directory credential in Azure and Azure Automation, you can now manage Azure from Azure Automation runbooks using this credential.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/sv-se/blog/azure-automation-authenticating-to-azure-using-azure-active-directory/","isMC":false,"discussion":[{"comments":[{"poster":"Gabsyfire","content":"Just checked now, and that is the perfect answer","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1723013520.0","comment_id":"1143077"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"580617","poster":"rdemontis","content":"agree with you","timestamp":"1664872680.0"}],"timestamp":"1647645660.0","comment_id":"447283","poster":"poplovic","content":"The ask is to install AzureAD powershell module for the automation runbooks.\n1. select the Automation account with the runbook\n2. select Modules, the \"browse gallery\"\n3. search \"AzureAD\" and install it","upvote_count":"23"},{"content":"Took exam today. 8 lab questions were there, so better to practise all simulation questions as well.","poster":"rints","upvote_count":"11","comment_id":"556687","timestamp":"1661512980.0"},{"comments":[{"poster":"eliisiita1","timestamp":"1685377260.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"730721","content":"did you take the exam at home?"}],"upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"544770","content":"No simulation question in Feb-2022 exam.","timestamp":"1660148520.0","poster":"Optimist_Indian"},{"comment_id":"389021","content":"You need to ensure that runbooks can run the Azure PowerShell cmdlets for Azure Active Directory.\nAdd the AzureAD PowerShell Module to the modules section in the automation account.\nDone.\nCredential Object is not a requirement based on the task required.","timestamp":"1640289900.0","upvote_count":"8","poster":"itworxx"},{"poster":"Sylph","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1633427940.0","comment_id":"328546","content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-use-azure-ad"}],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0030700001.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0030700002.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0030800001.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0030900001.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0031000001.png"],"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2021-04-05 11:59:00","question_text":"SIMULATION -\nYou plan to deploy a runbook that will create Azure AD user accounts.\nYou need to ensure that runbooks can run the Azure PowerShell cmdlets for Azure Active Directory.\nTo complete this task, sign in to the Microsoft Azure portal.","topic":"7","exam_id":55,"question_images":[],"question_id":345,"answer_ET":"See explanation below.","answer":"See explanation below."}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Microsoft","numberOfQuestions":558,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"id":55,"name":"AZ-400"},"currentPage":69},"__N_SSP":true}
