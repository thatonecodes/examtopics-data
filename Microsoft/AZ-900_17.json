The web is nothing but a huge WAN composed of many, many LANs. \nC - Whereas logic apps at least tells no conflicting information and implies you can migrate the whole app to it.

Logic Apps simplifies how you design and build scalable solutions for app integration, data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI), and business-to-business (B2B) communication, whether in the cloud, on premises, or both.\nFor example, here are just a few workloads you can automate with logic apps:\n-> Process and route orders across on-premises systems and cloud services.\n-> Send email notifications with Office 365 when events happen in various systems, apps, and services.\n-> Move uploaded files from an SFTP or FTP server to Azure Storage.\n-> Monitor tweets for a specific subject, analyze the sentiment, and create alerts or tasks for items that need review.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview","timestamp":"1640287860.0","poster":"NIk2020"},{"timestamp":"1742456940.0","poster":"RjayC","comment_id":"1400933","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. a Logic App\n\nExplanation:\nAzure Logic Apps is a serverless computing solution specifically designed for automating workflows, such as sending email notifications based on rules.
