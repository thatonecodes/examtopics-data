Currently, Vnet2 and Vnet3 cannot communicate directly.\n\n\nAzure Network Diagram -\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nBusiness Requirements -\n\nLitware wants to minimize costs whenever possible, as long as all other requirements are met.\n\n\nVirtual Networking Requirements -\n\nLitware identifies the following virtual networking requirements:\n\n• Direct the default route of 0.0.0.0/0 on Vnet2 and Vnet3 to the Boston datacenter over an ExpressRoute circuit.\n• Ensure that the records in the cloud.litwareinc.com can be resolved from the on-premises locations.\n• Automatically register the DNS names of Azure virtual machines to the cloud.litwareinc.com zone.\n• Minimize the size of the subnets allocated to platform-managed services.\n• Allow traffic from VMScaleSet1 to VMScaleSet2 on the TCP port 443 only.\n\n\nHybrid Networking Requirements -\n\nLitware identifies the following hybrid networking requirements:\n\n• Users must be able to connect to Vnet1 by using a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN when working remotely. Connections must be authenticated by Azure AD.\n• Latency of the traffic between the Boston datacenter and all the virtual networks must be minimized.\n• The Boston datacenter must connect to the Azure virtual networks by using an ExpressRoute FastPath connection.\n• Traffic between Vnet2 and Vnet3 must be routed through Vnet1.\n\n\nPaaS Networking Requirements -\n\nLitware identifies the following networking requirements for platform as a service (PaaS):\n\n• The storage1 account must be accessible from all on-premises locations without exposing the public endpoint of storage1.\n• The storage2 account must be accessible from Vnet2 and Vnet3 without exposing the public endpoint of storage2.\n\n\nYou need to connect Vnet2 and Vnet3. The solution must meet the virtual networking requirements and the business requirements.\n\nWhich two actions should you include in the solution? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"On the peering from Vnet1, select Allow for Traffic to remote virtual network.","B":"On the peerings from Vnet2 and Vnet3, select Allow for Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network.","A":"On the peering from Vnet1, select Allow for Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network.","E":"On the peerings from Vnet2 and Vnet3, select Use the remote virtual network's gateway or Route Server.","C":"On the peering from Vnet1, select Use the remote virtual network's gateway or Route Server."},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/118199-exam-az-700-topic-1-question-26-discussion/","answer":"BE","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-08-15 20:40:00","unix_timestamp":1692124800,"answer_ET":"BE","answers_community":["BE (75%)","AE (25%)"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image338.png","https://img.examtopics.com/az-700/image339.png"],"exam_id":58,"question_id":19},{"id":"fku4k7sXg8V2NbRwD4d7","answer":"","question_id":20,"timestamp":"2023-09-07 17:21:00","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have an Azure subscription.\n\nYou plan to use Azure Virtual WAN.\n\nYou need to deploy a virtual WAN hub that meets the following requirements:\n\n• Supports 4 Gbps of Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN traffic\n• Supports 8 Gbps of ExpressRoute traffic\n• Minimizes costs\n\nHow many scale units should you configure?
