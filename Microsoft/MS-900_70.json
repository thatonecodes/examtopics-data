Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel)\n\nReasons:\n\nLong-Term Support: Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC is designed for devices that do not need to receive feature updates regularly. It provides extended support, with updates only for security and critical issues, making it suitable for devices that should only be upgraded after a long period.\n\nConsistency: LTSC editions do not receive bi-annual feature updates like other Windows editions, ensuring that the software environment remains stable and consistent over time.\n\nCost Efficiency: Although initial costs might be higher compared to other editions, the reduced need for frequent upgrades and maintenance over a five-year period can lead to overall cost savings.","timestamp":"1722830640.0"},{"timestamp":"1711026360.0","comment_id":"1179253","content":"I don’t understand, this is talking about not upgrading the devices before 5 years is up but during this time they have to be UPDATED continuously.
