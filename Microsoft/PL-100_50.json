Incorrect.\n The default solution does contain all components and customizations from all solutions in the environment. It's a special type of unmanaged solution that you can use to customize system components and create custom components directly in an environment.\n\nB. Incorrect.\n The prefix used when creating components as part of the default solution is set by the system and cannot be changed. It's typically set to \"new_\" or \"custom_\" and is used to prevent naming conflicts between components.\n\nC. Correct. \nThe default solution cannot be exported and distributed to another environment. If you want to distribute customizations to another environment, you should create a new unmanaged solution, add the components you want to distribute, and then export that solution. The default solution is designed to be the container for all components in an environment and is not meant to be distributed.","poster":"Edriska","timestamp":"1690811460.0","comment_id":"968165"},{"poster":"JackJohn","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect","comment_id":"761159","timestamp":"1672326000.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1671527640.0","comment_id":"750700","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThat's right","poster":"DSM_LM"},{"content":"correct","timestamp":"1643549760.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"536160","poster":"petrovig89"},{"content":"Answer is correct, A would be correct if it was to be:\nThe default solution can't be exported; therefore, you can't distribute the default solution to another environment.","poster":"Afro_Ranga","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1631619180.0","comment_id":"444509"},{"poster":"michaelmelo","comment_id":"382871","content":"That's correct.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1623785460.0"},{"poster":"SmileOS","comment_id":"344947","timestamp":"1619653980.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1614305400.0","comment_id":"299495","poster":"samurai","content":"Yup Yup Yup"},{"comment_id":"299178","content":"A is False.
