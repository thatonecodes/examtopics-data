It addresses the allocation failure specifically for the VM that needs resizing while minimizing disruption to other VMs in the availability set.

A fault domain is a group of underlying hardware resources in a data center that share a common power source and network switch, but are physically separated from each other. By distributing virtual machines across fault domains, you can ensure that no single point of failure can take down all of the virtual machines at once.\n\nIn Azure, the maximum value for platformFaultDomainCount is 3. This means that an availability set can have up to 3 fault domains.

Fault domains are essentially physical groupings of resources that provide isolation from hardware failures, power outages, or network issues.\n\nAzure allows for a maximum of 3 fault domains in most regions (and up to 2 fault domains in some regions like classic cloud regions).
