Create a 1:N relationship between the Contact system entity and the Rating entity.\n\nHere's the statement again:\nA travel company plans to track the address of places their clients visit in an entity named Destination.\nClient information is captured as contact records.\nClient records include links to the places that clients visit.\nThe company must be able to link multiple rating records to the new address record.\nYou find a custom Rating entity that is incomplete.\n\n\n\nWhy I have a problem: No part of that statement produces an idea that there should be a relationship between Contact and Rating.\n\nThere is a popular idea: \"but rating has to be done by contact\": yet I don't read that at all.\n\nPlease help!","poster":"Violoncello","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"E is correct. Key thing to note is that the address is stored in the Destination... but question states that this address must be included in the Rating entity.\n\nI dont think it is B because it just wants the Contact in the rating entity... not any of the Contact fields that you would usually map to another entity.","timestamp":"1675575780.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"540796","poster":"MiguelNepomuceno"},{"poster":"Shaishil","timestamp":"1666336680.0","content":"I have tried to implement this to verify.

The mapping Destination - Rating help us. Now remains one focal requirement: include contact inside Rating Form…how can I do? I need at least of the first name and lastname of the correct contact. At this point B can’t solve the requirement so is Wrong.\nD: Best fit is add a contact lookup inside form that reference the original Contact also provided in Address form (this lookup will be filled by mapping from the origin Contact lookup inside Address form). To achieve the lookup I need a “dummy” 1 Contact : N Ratings relationships \nNow, the B could be a good chance but according with the instructions only the 3 F-E-D get points!","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"325300"},{"timestamp":"1647586380.0","content":"I don't have understand if the Address system entity named Destination is a custom entity or the standard entity Address otherwise in the second case it is possible only the following answer: B, D, E","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"313879","poster":"FDC"},{"timestamp":"1647438780.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Yuro","content":"it should be C,E,F because the test says that client destination relationship already exists","comment_id":"312376"},{"timestamp":"1646373600.0","poster":"Dean0918","content":"A: has been done already before because one contact alreay has several links to the Destination.\nThis task is to link rating records to the new address record:\nso F is correct.\nE: after you create F, you can get contact info through destinatin, so no need to map contact and rating,\n you only need to map Destination and Rating.\nD: but rating has to be done by contact, you need create a relationship between rating and contact.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"303128"},{"timestamp":"1643680020.0","content":"Correct answer should be BDF","comment_id":"280908","upvote_count":"2","poster":"michael_w999","comments":[{"content":"Why require mapping between contact and rating?","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1645679580.0","comment_id":"297962","poster":"RahulKate","comments":[{"content":"As stated in question: You need to expand the Rating entity to include contact, address, and rating information in one place.","timestamp":"1656060480.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"389367","poster":"flatrow"}]}]},{"upvote_count":"5","content":"This question does not have any correct answers as long as there should be the Address system entity used, due to the fact, that this entity cannot be used in any custom relationships.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1641894900.0","comment_id":"264611","content":"The Address info is stored in a custom entity named destination\n\"A travel company plans to track the address of places their clients visit in an entity named Destination\"","upvote_count":"8","poster":"PeterPan2"}],"comment_id":"259254","poster":"rrrrrrrrrrrr","timestamp":"1641289080.0"}],"answers_community":["DEF (67%)","11%","11%","11%"],"question_text":"A travel company plans to track the address of places their clients visit in an entity named Destination.
