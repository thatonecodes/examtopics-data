In a sales-driven environment like Wide World Importers, where the sales team negotiates with boutiques and products may not exist in the current list, marking could be used to ensure specific incoming stock (e.g., transfers from California or new purchases) is reserved for a customer’s order. This would cause the inventory to show as \"ordered reserved\" even with the parameter disabled.","comment_id":"1399699","timestamp":"1742226540.0","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"KJcFXzgEMgBbOvGPXe2D","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04068/0013900001.png"],"question_id":68,"unix_timestamp":1697041740,"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/inventory/enable-quality-management","answer_ET":"","exam_id":83,"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04068/0013800001.png"],"answers_community":[],"answer":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/123317-exam-mb-330-topic-18-question-5-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"globeearth","content":"The given answers are correct.\n1.

Create a Disposition Code ✅ Disposition codes are used to categorize inventory based on quality, damage, or testing requirements. You can create a disposition code like \"Pending Quality Check\" or \"Hold for Testing\" and assign it to the brakes from VendorA that need to be tested. This allows tracking the status of the brakes without affecting other inventory movements. -> C. Set Default Inventory Status on the Item ✅ You can set the default inventory status to \"Blocked\" or \"Quality Hold\" for this item. This prevents the brakes from being sold or used until testing is complete. This is the best practice for controlling inventory status during quality checks.","comment_id":"1399708","poster":"globeearth","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742230080.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1733050620.0","poster":"Deciashay","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nseems correct","comment_id":"1085157"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nI would go with A and C.
