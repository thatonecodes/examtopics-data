A Log Analytics workspace is a cloud-based repository that collects and stores data from various sources, such as NSG flow logs. A storage account is a container that provides a unique namespace to store and access your data objects in Azure Storage. You need to enable NSG flow logs and configure them to send data to both the Log Analytics workspace and the storage account. Traffic Analytics analyzes the NSG flow logs and provides insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud.","comments":[{"content":"i voted the wrong answers.
