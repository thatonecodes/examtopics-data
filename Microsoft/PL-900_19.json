Now create 2 new flows - one that sends an email that no intervention is needed, the other that sends a text message that the team needs assistance (trigger will be power apps, action will be Send email v2)\n4. Next, drag 2 new buttons to your blank canvas, name them \"Things are going well\" and \"I need help\", then in the \"OnSelect\" property of each button, type \"Power\" to search and scroll down to the names of the flows you made it step 3 (make sure you're selecting the one with RUN() at end)\n5.
