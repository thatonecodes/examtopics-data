This is evident from the `sku` block in the snippet:\n\n```json\n\"sku\" : {\n\"name\": \"Standard\",\n\"tier\": \"Standard\",\n\"capacity\": 10\n}\n```\n\nIn this block, the `capacity` property is set to `10`, which in the context of a vCore-based purchasing model would indicate the number of vCores. In a DTU-based model, the `tier` and `name` properties would typically be used to specify a performance level that includes a predefined number of DTUs, and you might see values like `Basic`, `Standard`, or `Premium` for the `name` property, along with a specific DTU count or range.\n\nIn summary, the template is utilizing a vCore-based pricing model, not a DTU-based pricing model.","timestamp":"1698944100.0","poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1060699"},{"poster":"vcloudpmp","timestamp":"1689275880.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"950944","content":"Managed instance uses a different resource type:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/create-template-quickstart?view=azuresql-mi&tabs=azure-powershell\ntype\": \"Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances\",\n \"apiVersion\": \"2021-11-01-preview\",\n \"name\": \"[parameters('managedInstanceName')]\",\n \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\","},{"content":"all answers are correct.

Configure service endpoints:\nService endpoints provide secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over the Azure backbone network. They are not typically used for connectivity between on-premises environments and Azure services.\nB. Configure virtual network peering:\nVirtual network peering is used to connect two Azure virtual networks seamlessly. Since your scenario involves an on-premises network and not another Azure virtual network, peering is not applicable.\nC. Deploy an Azure firewall:\nAn Azure firewall is a network security service that protects Azure Virtual Network resources. It could be used to govern the traffic between your on-premises environment and the Azure SQL Managed Instance, but it is not the primary tool for enabling connectivity.\nD. Configure network security groups (NSGs):\nNetwork Security Groups are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces (NIC), VMs, and subnets.
