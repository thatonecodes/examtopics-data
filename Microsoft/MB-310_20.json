The forecasting process uses transaction information that is entered in the system, and the calculation process forecasts the expected cash impact of each transaction.\nNote: In the Purchasing forecast defaults section, you can select default purchasing behaviors for cash flow forecasting. Three fields determine the time of the cash impact: Time between delivery date and invoice date, Terms of payment, and Time between invoice due date and payment date. The forecast will use the default setting for the Terms of payment field only if a value isn't specified on the transaction. Use a term of payment to describe the most typical number of days for each part of the process.\n\nSales tax authority payments -\nThe Cash flow sales tax authority payments feature predicts the cash flow impact of sales tax payments. It uses unpaid sales tax transactions, tax settlement periods, and the tax period payment term to predict the date and amount of cash flow payments.\nIncorrect:\nNot A: A bridged payment is a payment that is posted to the general ledger in two steps.
