Azure Resource Log\n\n\"A network security group (NSG) includes rules that allow or deny traffic to a virtual network subnet, network interface, or both.\n\nWhen you enable logging for an NSG, you can gather the following types of resource log information:\n\nEvent: Entries are logged for which NSG rules are applied to virtual machines, based on a MAC address.\nRule counter: Contains entries for how many times each NSG rule is applied to allow or deny traffic. The status for these rules is collected every 300 seconds.\"","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"e6d6bf4","comment_id":"1332541","timestamp":"1735319220.0","content":"I stand corrected - -> the correct answer is Flow Log as we just want to identify the application logs that got the NGS rules.
