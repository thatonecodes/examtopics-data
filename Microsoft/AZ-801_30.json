The correct command to configure and enable the Windows Event Collector service is wecutil qc. This command configures the service to accept events from remote computers.\nServers: Event forwarding requires the Windows Event Collector service to be enabled on the server that will collect the events (in this case, Server1, the collector). The source server (DC1) needs to be configured to forward events, but the Windows Event Collector service itself runs on the collector server, not the source.
