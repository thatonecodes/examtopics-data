Join all the devices to contoso.com\nHere's why the other options are not ideal:\nB. Deploy Microsoft Entra Application Proxy: This is not necessary for passwordless sign-in. Application Proxy publishes on-premises applications to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) but doesn't directly affect passwordless login functionality.\nC. Deploy X.509.3 certificates to all the users: While certificates can be used for passwordless authentication, it's a more complex solution compared to Azure AD joined devices.\nD. Deploy the Microsoft Authenticator app: While the Microsoft Authenticator app can be used for multi-factor authentication (MFA) which can be part of a passwordless solution, it requires Azure AD joined devices to leverage Windows Hello for passwordless sign-in.\nSince your users are already using Windows 10 devices and you want passwordless sign-in, joining the devices to the Azure AD domain (contoso.com) allows them to leverage Windows Hello for passwordless login with features like fingerprint or facial recognition.
