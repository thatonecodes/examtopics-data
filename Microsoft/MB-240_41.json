The question is referring to a Project Template, this is a term used in the Power Platform Data Integration. Typically you would set the work order to generate an invoice in Field Service when the status is Closed - Posted , then using a Data Integration project, you would integrate the invoice.\n\nThe part that is confusing me is that the question states that the template keeps failing, the only possible reasons for this is connection, mismatching data types, incorrect dimensions or field mapping. \n\nThe question says the Project Template is \"Failing\" therefore a connection must have been established, if failing means the records did not transfer, then B woulk most likely be reason assuming you have configured the filter criteria in Power Query accordingly. I cannot see how A, C or D would solve the issue.","timestamp":"1706592960.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"937823","poster":"Murthy1987","timestamp":"1688029680.0","content":"The Work Order Invoice Creation field must be set to Never, because the invoicing will be done from Supply Chain Management.
