While it's not the lowest-cost option (compared to Free, Basic, or Shared plans), it meets all the outlined requirements, including minimizing costs while still offering the necessary features.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1693329720.0","poster":"AntonioTech"},{"timestamp":"1691922300.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Your developers have created \"10 web applications\" that must be host on Azure.\nmust meet the following requirements:\n‚úë The web apps \"each require 10 GB of storage.\"\n10x10 = 100 GB of storage.\nStandard offers only 50GB...but that's the closest answer.
