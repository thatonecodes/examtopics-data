Item cross-references\n\nExplanation:\n\nItem cross-references in Dynamics 365 Business Central allow you to set up vendor-specific item numbers and descriptions. This feature is useful when vendors use different item numbers or descriptions than those used in your company. When you create a purchase order or other document, you can use the vendor's item number, and Business Central will automatically recognize it as your internal item number.
