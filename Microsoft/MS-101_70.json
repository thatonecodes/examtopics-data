Global Administrators have access to all administrative features and functions, including the ability to modify policies and settings. Since Policy1 is a retention policy, which is a feature of SharePoint and OneDrive for Business, User2 should have the ability to modify it and remove SharePoint sites from it.\n\nWhile it is possible for the organization to restrict User2's ability to modify policies and settings through Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) or other access controls, this information is not provided in the scenario. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, it is reasonable to assume that User2 has the necessary permissions to modify Policy1 and remove SharePoint sites from it.","poster":"Meebler","comment_id":"831077","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1678124280.0"},{"content":"the second is no because:\nSet-RetentionCompliancePolicy Policy1 `\"RestrictiveRetention $true","poster":"EsamiTopici","timestamp":"1679051460.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"841914"}],"poster":"Meebler","timestamp":"1678124280.0","content":"Based on the information provided, the updated answers to the questions are:\n\nA) Yes, User1 can add exchange email as a location to Policy1, as they have the Compliance Data Administrator role which allows them to manage settings for device management, data protection, data loss prevention, reports, and preservation.\n\nB) Yes, User2 can remove SharePoint sites from Policy1, as they have the Global Administrator role which grants them permissions to manage all aspects of Azure AD and Microsoft 365 services, including SharePoint.\n\nC) Yes, User2 can add the word \"Acquisition\" to Policy1, as they are a Global Administrator and have the necessary permissions to manage compliance policies.

With \"-RestrictiveRetention\" you can only edit the policy to ADD content to it.\n\nSee also;\nAfter a policy has been locked, no one can turn off or disable it, or remove content from the policy. And it's not possible to modify or delete content that's subject to the policy during the retention period. The only way that you can modify the retention policy are by adding content to it, or extending its duration. A locked policy can be increased or extended, but it can't be reduced, disabled, or turned off.\n\nLink;\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/set-retentioncompliancepolicy?view=exchange-ps"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/set-retentioncompliancepolicy?view=exchange-ps#:~:text=%24true%3A%20Preservation%20Lock%20is%20enabled%20for%20the%20policy.%20No%20one%20(including%20an%20administrator)%20can%20turn%20off%20the%20policy%20or%20make%20it%20less%20restrictive","poster":"itmaster","timestamp":"1650053700.0","comment_id":"586468"},{"poster":"ajna_","upvote_count":"1","content":"N | N | Y","comment_id":"567005","timestamp":"1647187320.0"},{"content":"When Policy is locked.
