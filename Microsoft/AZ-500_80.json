What happens when you set a managed identity in sql? It will create the user in sys.principals and it will calculate the SID based on the origin. For exaple if you have a user assigned identity, its the object Id or when sing sql data package > 3.0 its client id. When suing system assigned identity its using the name and calculates the SID. if you use SQL Management Studio it will do the sid calculation for you.\n\nAnyway, the keyvault doesnt make sense due to different RG. But is we store a connectionstring in keyvault that is using a contained user, it could work. Not the most secure way btw.. So now the question MI or service endpoint?
