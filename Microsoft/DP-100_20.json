No.\nEntropy Minimum Description Length (MDL) binning is a technique that can be used to group values into bins. However, it is not a normalization technique. Normalization is a technique that is used to scale values so that they have a similar range.\nIn this case, the goal is to normalize values to produce a feature column grouped into bins. However, the solution of applying an Entropy MDL binning mode will not achieve this goal. Instead, you should use a normalization technique, such as min-max normalization or z-score normalization.","timestamp":"1706009280.0","poster":"Ahmed_Gehad"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"B. No\n\nThe solution described does not meet the goal of normalizing values to produce a feature column grouped into bins. Entropy Minimum Description Length (MDL) is a criterion used for model selection and not specifically for binning or normalization of data. MDL is typically used for tasks like feature selection or model complexity estimation, but not for creating bins. To achieve the goal of normalizing values and creating bins, other techniques such as equal-width binning or equal-frequency binning can be used.","poster":"pranav33","comment_id":"929556","timestamp":"1703172240.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1691864280.0","comment_id":"806778","content":"Correct answer B \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/group-data-into-bins","poster":"mamau"},{"content":"No. EMDL binning is used for feature selection, not for feature engineering.","comment_id":"796379","upvote_count":"1","poster":"phdykd","timestamp":"1690998240.0"},{"poster":"Mebyxu","comment_id":"792198","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct answer is B","timestamp":"1690668960.0"},{"poster":"Edriv","upvote_count":"2","content":"Option A (Yes)","comment_id":"744222","timestamp":"1686663720.0"},{"timestamp":"1663212240.0","content":"It is true.
