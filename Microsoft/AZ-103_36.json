Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet connection type (VNet2VNet) is similar to creating a Site-to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both function the same way when communicating.\nThe local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order to route traffic.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal","question_images":[]},{"id":"ys9kpr2KeS2w2A7oD65m","question_id":179,"answer_description":"Step 1: Remove peering between Vnet1 and VNet2.\nYou can't add address ranges to, or delete address ranges from a virtual network's address space once a virtual network is peered with another virtual network.\nTo add or remove address ranges, delete the peering, add or remove the address ranges, then re-create the peering.\nStep 2: Add the 10.44.0.0/16 address space to VNet1.\nStep 3: Recreate peering between VNet1 and VNet2\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-peering","unix_timestamp":1591276080,"topic":"4","exam_id":43,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nYou have an Azure subscription that contains two virtual networks named VNet1 and VNet2.
