But then how does the client find the WDS server? You set option 60 in DHCP.\nThe DHCP option 60, when set to \"PXEClient\" is used only to instruct the PXE clients to try to use a PXE Service bound on UDP port 4011. Actually, if there is a bootp or dhcp service bound on UDP port 67 of a host (usually called a server), a PXE service cannot bind on that port on that host. Since the PXE Service uses\nBOOTP/DHCP packets to send the options 66 and 67 to the clients, it needs to be able to bind to the associated port (bootps) or to an alternated port (4011) that the clients know they must use as the alternate port. And to instruct the clients to use this alternate port, you have to set dhcp option 60 to \"PXEClient\".\nIf Windows Deployment Services and DHCP are running on the same computer, configuring Windows Deployment Services to not respond to any client computers will not work. This is because although Windows Deployment Services will not respond, DHCP will. You should disable WDS if you have both installed and using DHCP.\nTo configure Windows Deployment Services to run on the same computer as Microsoft DHCP\nRight-click the server and click Properties. On the DHCP tab, select Do not listen on port 67 and Configure DHCP Option #60 Tag to PXEClient.\nThis procedure does the following: Sets\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WDSServer\\Parameters \\UseDhcpPorts to 0.\nAdds the option 60 PXEClient tag to all of your DHCP scopes.","question_images":[],"exam_id":37,"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou have a server named Server1.
