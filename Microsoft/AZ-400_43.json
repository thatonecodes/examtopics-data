GitHub uses the libsodium library for its encryption processes, which makes it the correct choice when wrapping secrets.\n\nCryptoNet and BouncyCastle: While these are also encryption libraries, they are not specifically tied to the GitHub API's requirements for secrets management.\n\nhashlib: This library is primarily used for hashing and does not provide encryption functionality necessary for securely wrapping secrets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. libsodium."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nc","comment_id":"1298151","timestamp":"1728981960.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"schwagalla"}],"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/149535-exam-az-400-topic-4-question-76-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"TiehLxESlduIHSTM67KN","answer_ET":"","answer_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-400/image174.png"],"topic":"4","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/149536-exam-az-400-topic-4-question-77-discussion/","exam_id":55,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1304705","content":"Test1: Use the ZAP Baseline Scan for passive scanning.\nTest2: Use the ZAP Full Scan, which will inherently include the ability to perform AJAX spidering if configured correctly.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"MrAZ105","timestamp":"1730236380.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-10-15 10:51:00","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have a GitHub repository named Repo1 and an app named App1.
