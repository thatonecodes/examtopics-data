Because provisioning capacity in such situations isn't required and may be cost-prohibitive, Azure Cosmos DB serverless should be considered in the following use-cases:\n✑ Getting started with Azure Cosmos DB\n✑ Running applications with bursty, intermittent traffic that is hard to forecast, or low (<10%) average-to-peak traffic ratio\n✑ Developing, testing, prototyping and running in production new applications where the traffic pattern is unknown\n✑ Integrating with serverless compute services like Azure Functions\nBox 2: Provisioned throughput capacity mode and autoscale throughput\nThe use cases of autoscale include:\n✑ Variable or unpredictable workloads: When your workloads have variable or unpredictable spikes in usage, autoscale helps by automatically scaling up and down based on usage. Examples include retail websites that have different traffic patterns depending on seasonality; IOT workloads that have spikes at various times during the day; line of business applications that see peak usage a few times a month or year, and more. With autoscale, you no longer need to manually provision for peak or average capacity.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/serverless\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/provision-throughput-autoscale#use-cases-of-autoscale","exam_id":69,"answers_community":[],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04276/0014200001.png"],"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou plan to deploy two Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API accounts that will each contain a single database.
