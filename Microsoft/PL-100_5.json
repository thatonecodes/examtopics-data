Yes, it does**\n\nPower Automate is a service in the Power Platform that helps you create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more. It can indeed be used to send an email to a manager whenever a specified event occurs. This is done by creating a flow that is triggered by the specified event and includes an action to send an email. Remember, always test your flows thoroughly to ensure they work as expected and meet your business requirements. Always refer to the official Microsoft documentation or consult with a Power Platform expert if you're unsure.","comment_id":"1239639","poster":"iamchoy","timestamp":"1719750900.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"crwsbrasil","comment_id":"1123729","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705356240.0","content":"This type of question should only be in PL-900"},{"timestamp":"1674562560.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"jorrit2203","content":"Selected Answer: A\nPower Automate is the way to go here","comment_id":"786494"},{"content":"Correct","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1638990060.0","comment_id":"497096","poster":"antboii"},{"content":"Yes the answer is correct","timestamp":"1638448620.0","comment_id":"492475","poster":"amaljoy","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Miclarsen","timestamp":"1634039400.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Correct","comment_id":"461060"},{"comment_id":"419977","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1628115240.0","poster":"Maxcloud","content":"Correct!"}]},{"id":"dzuhP7RPB4PEfLBqnBT5","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","question_text":"Data loss prevention (DLP) policies are configured in your company's environment.\nAfter creating a Power Automate flow, you find that you are unable to activate the flow.\nYou need to edit the DLP policies that are preventing the flow from activating.\nWhich of the following actions should you take?","exam_id":114,"question_id":22,"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Correct!\n\"To create, edit, or delete DLP policies, you must have either Environment Admin or Power Platform admin permissions.\"\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/prevent-data-loss","poster":"adi0149","upvote_count":"16","comment_id":"453653","timestamp":"1632861840.0"},{"timestamp":"1710498780.0","comment_id":"1174211","content":"Selected Answer: A\nTo create, edit, or delete DLP policies, you must have either Environment Admin or Power Platform admin permissions.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"4e8b388"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"893057","timestamp":"1683632880.0","poster":"EdrisKazemi","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. You should make sure that you have the Environment Admin role assigned.\n\nData loss prevention (DLP) policies are used to prevent the unauthorized transmission of sensitive information outside of an organization. These policies can be configured to prevent the activation of certain Power Automate flows if they contain sensitive data. In order to edit the DLP policies, you need to have the appropriate permissions.\n\nThe Environment Admin role is the most appropriate role for managing DLP policies because it provides full access to the environment, including the ability to create and manage policies. The Environment Maker role allows users to create and manage resources within an environment but does not provide the necessary permissions to manage DLP policies. The System customizer role is focused on customizing Dynamics 365 and does not include the necessary permissions for managing DLP policies. The Portal owner role is specific to managing Dynamics 365 portals and is not relevant to managing DLP policies.\n\nTherefore, to edit the DLP policies that are preventing the flow from activating, you should make sure that you have the Environment Admin role assigned."},{"content":"Correct\nTo create, edit, or delete DLP policies, you must have either Environment Admin or Power Platform admin permissions.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/prevent-data-loss","poster":"YeDA","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"807747","timestamp":"1676316480.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nfor sure A","poster":"dudenKo","timestamp":"1649342400.0","comment_id":"582500","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1639188300.0","comment_id":"499047","upvote_count":"2","content":"A is absolutely right answer","poster":"PBIAANF"},{"timestamp":"1638990120.0","comment_id":"497100","upvote_count":"2","poster":"antboii","content":"A is correct"},{"timestamp":"1634027280.0","poster":"alan000","comments":[{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1634027460.0","poster":"alan000","comment_id":"460984","content":"A is Correct!","upvote_count":"3"}],"timestamp":"1634027460.0","poster":"alan000","content":"Soryy, If answer is System Administrator then choose C","comment_id":"460983","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"460982","upvote_count":"1","content":"i think C is Correct!!"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-09-28 22:44:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/63145-exam-pl-100-topic-1-question-29-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1632861840,"answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"You should make sure that you have the Portal owner role assigned.","C":"You should make sure that you have the System customizer role assigned.","A":"You should make sure that you have the Environment Admin role assigned.","B":"You should make sure that you have the Environment Maker role assigned."}},{"id":"P1CE9GqYHVhN2FVUlGLf","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1625222160,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/56908-exam-pl-100-topic-1-question-3-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"You have been tasked with designing a model-driven app. The app must be configured to permit so that users are able to generate and modify a list of current accounts.\nYou want to make sure that a list of all active accounts is displayed.
