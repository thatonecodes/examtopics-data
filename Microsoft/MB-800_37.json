Special orders from new customers have a 25% prepayment. Established customers have only a 15% prepayment.\n• The company must be able to approve POs by email without opening Business Central.\n• Customers often reorder the same items with similar quantities. The system must be configured to ask the user if recurring lines should be added to sales orders.\n\n\nInvoicing\n-\n\n• Customer revenue must be posted to separate general ledger (G/L) accounts based on customer type. The G/L account must have subcategories for wholesale and retail revenue.\n• Accounts receivable must be posted to separate G/L accounts based on customer type.

The company is unable to associate one invoice with multiple POs in the current environment.\n• Inventory reconciliation was difficult in the company's old system because it allowed users to sell more inventory than was physically available.\n• Users must log in to the system to provide workflow approvals.\n\n\nYou need to resolve the order entry issue.\n\nHow should you complete each action? To answer, move the appropriate recurring sales line configurations to the correct actions. You may use each recurring sales line configuration once, more than once, or not at all.

You can set up different SKUs for the same item at different locations (warehouses), each with its own vendor and pricing information.\n\nD. Item card: The item card is where you set up the basic information about an item. This includes the item's number, description, unit of measure, and other details. You can also link the item to its corresponding SKUs here.\n\nE. Locations: Locations in Business Central represent physical or logical storage places, such as warehouses.
