Plugins, I know the Azure Event Hub seems tempting, but given some overview it does not look to directly address giving notifications of changes within the app. Looking at plug-ins however, Plug-Ins have many oppurtunities through power automate as well as Service Busses and Webhooks to fully take advantage of notifying of \"address\" changes.
