A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it.\n\nBox 1: Yes -\nThe routing table allows connections from VM3 to VM1 and VM2. And as IP forwarding is enabled on VM3, VM3 can connect to VM1.\n\nBox 2: No -\nVM3, which has IP forwarding, must be turned on, in order for VM2 to connect to VM1.\n\nBox 3: Yes -\nThe routing table allows connections from VM1 and VM2 to VM3. IP forwarding on VM3 allows VM1 to connect to VM2 via VM3.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview https://www.quora.com/What-is-IP-forwarding"}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":241,"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Microsoft","isBeta":false,"id":50,"name":"AZ-300","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":5},"__N_SSP":true}
