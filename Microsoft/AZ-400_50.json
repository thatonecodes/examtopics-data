Gradle\n\nGradle is a build automation tool that is commonly used in Java projects. It allows developers to define and automate the build process, including compiling the code, running tests, and generating artifacts such as JAR files. Gradle can also integrate with SonarQube, allowing developers to analyze and monitor the code quality of their Java projects.\n\nB. CocoaPods\n\nCocoaPods is a dependency manager for iOS projects and is not relevant for a Java solution.\n\nC. Grunt\n\nGrunt is a JavaScript task runner that is commonly used for automating front-end web development tasks. It is not relevant for a Java solution.\n\nD. Gulp\n\nGulp is another JavaScript task runner that is similar to Grunt, and is also not relevant for a Java solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Gradle, as it is the build automation tool commonly used in Java projects and can integrate with SonarQube for code analysis and monitoring.","poster":"dmt6263"},{"poster":"Dev0001","timestamp":"1695441840.0","content":"Check question 6 topic 5, \nYour company is building a new solution in Java.\nThe company currently uses a SonarQube server to analyze the code of .NET solutions.\nYou need to analyze and monitor the code quality of the Java solution.\nWhich task types should you add to the build pipeline?\n\nBoth questions are the same but how the answer is different?","comment_id":"847862","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorrect","timestamp":"1663757280.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"rdemontis","comment_id":"572225"},{"timestamp":"1636715460.0","poster":"luclasses","content":"Correct Jacints","comments":[{"upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1637329920.0","content":"Correctamundo dude","comment_id":"361331","poster":"Kinon4"}],"comment_id":"355402","upvote_count":"5"}],"choices":{"B":"CocoaPods","D":"Gulp","A":"Gradle","C":"Grunt"},"answers_community":["A (100%)"]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":false,"id":55,"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":558,"name":"AZ-400","provider":"Microsoft","isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":50},"__N_SSP":true}
