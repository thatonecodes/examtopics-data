Checkpointing is the process of tracking the processing of events within a partition and is essential for ensuring that processing can continue from the exact point at which a failure occurred.\n\n1. Ensure that event process clients mark the position within an event sequence: Again, use Checkpointing. By regularly recording checkpoints, the event processor clients can ensure that they mark their progress through the event stream, allowing for recovery from failures.\n\n\n2.
