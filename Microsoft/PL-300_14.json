Summarize the detail data:\nSince Import mode loads the entire dataset into memory, reducing the amount of detail data (for example, aggregating granular data like daily sales into monthly or yearly totals) can significantly reduce the size of the model in memory. This approach helps minimize memory usage and improves query performance.\nD. Optimize the column data types:\n\nIn Import mode, data is compressed and optimized by the VertiPaq storage engine. Using more efficient column data types reduces memory consumption and ensures better compression when the data is loaded into memory. For instance, using integer or decimal data types instead of string can help achieve better compression and optimize performance. link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-dataset-modes-understand","poster":"Odidepse"}],"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/154487-exam-pl-300-topic-2-question-107-discussion/","answers_community":["AD (100%)"]},{"id":"OpjuOJZy3njANvFyvTyh","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pl-300/image449.png"],"question_text":"You have a Power BI semantic model that contains the following data.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nYou need to create a solution that meets the following requirements:\n\n• Presents transaction amount totals for each month for the current and prior year\n• Follows the star schema modeling approach\n• Minimizes the data model size\n\nWhich three actions should you perform?
