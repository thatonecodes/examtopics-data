It is only a wrong guess by power bi. what power bi does is that whenever a table is loaded into the model, it goes through each column of the table and make a guess of their data types. whenever it sees numeric columns such as date, product cost, and sales amount, it assumes that they are aggregable and automatically creates implicit measures for those columns by adding the summation sign next to those columns as shown in the example. To mitigate this weakness, developers have to manually go through each numeric column in their data model and change the summarization settings for non-aggregable columns just as part B of this question is suggesting.
