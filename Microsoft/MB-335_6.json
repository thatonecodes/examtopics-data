The parts are machined in the same production process to remove excess plastic and add additional holes for assembly. Excess plastic is recycled back into the feedstock of the same color plastic chips for use in the molding process.\n\nMetal parts -\nRaw metal parts are purchased fully machined but without primer or paint. The parts are subcontracted to a vendor for primer and paint based upon the color requirements.\n\nFacility -\nThe company has a single warehouse that supports both the assembly and plastic manufacturing areas.
