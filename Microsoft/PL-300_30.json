Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.\n\nAfter you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.\n\nYou have a Power BI report that imports a date table and a sales table from an Azure SQL database data source. The sales table has the following date foreign keys:\n\n• Due Date\n• Order Date\n• Delivery Date\n\nYou need to support the analysis of sales over time based on all three dates at the same time.\n\nSolution: From the Fields pane, you rename the date table as Due Date. You use a DAX expression to create Order Date and Delivery Date as calculated tables. You create active relationships between the sales table and each date table.\n\nDoes this meet the goal?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1691442600.0","comment_id":"974978","upvote_count":"16","content":"100% Just finish reading about that.","poster":"ApacheKafka"},{"comment_id":"1157241","timestamp":"1708700160.0","upvote_count":"8","poster":"panic_attack","content":"This was on the exam on 22/2/2024 (:"},{"poster":"5bf040d","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAmbiguity in Relationships: Power BI only allows one active relationship between two tables at a time.
