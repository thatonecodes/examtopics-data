An alert policy allows you to define specific conditions and triggers based on various events, including high-severity incidents detected by Microsoft 365 Defender. When the specified conditions are met, the alert policy will generate an alert and notify you or other designated individuals or teams.\n\nThreat policies are used to define specific security rules and settings for protecting your organization from various threats. Custom detection rules allow you to create custom detections based on specific conditions. However, for receiving alerts specifically for high-severity incidents detected by Microsoft 365 Defender, an alert policy is the appropriate choice.\n\nNotification rules are used to configure notifications for specific actions or changes within Microsoft 365 services, but they are not specifically designed for high-severity incident alerts.","comment_id":"954481","timestamp":"1689616560.0"},{"timestamp":"1686094800.0","poster":"Jo696","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWould go with D as an Alert you have to specify an 'Incident' to be alerted of, however with a notification rule it will alert for any incidents from a specific source such as 'Microsoft Defender for Identity'","comment_id":"916712"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nNotification rule, tested on my tenant.","timestamp":"1682530620.0","poster":"GotDamnImIn","comment_id":"881894","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

The policy can be customized to specify the severity level of the incident and the actions to take when the alert is triggered, such as sending an email notification or initiating an automated response.\n\nalert policies provide more functionality than notification rules as they allow you to configure more advanced conditions for triggering alerts, specify actions to take when an alert is triggered, and customize alert notifications. You can also configure alert suppression and exclusions, as well as schedule alerts for specific times.\n\nOn the other hand, notification rules are more basic and only allow you to receive an email notification when a specific type of event occurs. They do not provide the same level of customization and control over the alerting process as alert policies.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, using an alert policy would be a better option than a notification rule, as it provides more flexibility and control over the alerting process.","comments":[{"comment_id":"841151","upvote_count":"3","content":"But the question asks to receive notifications for a high severity, not to customize, should not be notification rule?","poster":"EsamiTopici","timestamp":"1678982520.0"}],"comment_id":"830229","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Meebler"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"819834","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe Answer correct is D","poster":"Lelek","timestamp":"1677191160.0"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"799492","comments":[{"comment_id":"803474","poster":"EsamiTopici","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1675961040.0","content":"i think you are right, but why not Alert?","comments":[{"upvote_count":"6","poster":"hufflepuff","timestamp":"1676275200.0","comment_id":"807160","content":"It specifically asks to be notified about an 'Incident', not just alerts. Below lists Microsoft explanation of what an 'Incident' is, sourced from my original link.\n\nAn incident in Microsoft 365 Defender is a collection of correlated alerts and associated data that make up the story of an attack.\n\nMicrosoft 365 services and apps create alerts when they detect a suspicious or malicious event or activity. Individual alerts provide valuable clues about a completed or ongoing attack. However, attacks typically employ various techniques against different types of entities, such as devices, users, and mailboxes. The result is multiple alerts for multiple entities in your tenant.\n\nBecause piecing the individual alerts together to gain insight into an attack can be challenging and time-consuming, Microsoft 365 Defender automatically aggregates the alerts and their associated information into an incident."},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"EsamiTopici","content":"Maybe the alert policy is for precise events, while the question asks any event in 365 Defender, so the answer should be Notification Rule","timestamp":"1675961220.0","comment_id":"803478"}]}],"poster":"hufflepuff","content":"Selected Answer: D\nLooks like a Notification Rule to me.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/incidents-overview?view=o365-worldwide#create-a-rule-for-email-notifications\n\nGo to Microsoft 365 Defender in the navigation pane, select Settings > Microsoft 365 Defender > Incident email notifications.\n\nOn the Notification Settings set the Alert Severity.\n\nOnce you get the notification, you can go directly to the incident and start your investigation right away.","timestamp":"1675668360.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"Notification rule:\n\nSettings > M365 Defender > Email notifications > Incidents > Source Defender, Alert priority = high","comment_id":"770549","poster":"certacc","timestamp":"1673276820.0"}],"exam_id":99,"answers_community":["D (61%)","C (39%)"],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2023-01-05 18:18:00","isMC":true,"answer":"D","topic":"2"},{"id":"ee6DO8JjHfZltjMdIua5","question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription that contains the users shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nIn Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you have the Policies for Office apps configurations shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nFor each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true.
