To better understand its customers, Northwind Traders invests in a team of researchers who gather data from multiple sources. The company stores the data it collects in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nEnvironment\n-\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\nData\n-\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\nWeb API\n-\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nCustom connector\n-\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\nProcess\n-\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\n\nYou need to configure a Power Automate flow to update account records by using the response from the Web API.\n\nWhich three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.\n\n//IMG//","question_id":344,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/131115-exam-pl-400-topic-7-question-24-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/pl-400/image447.png"],"exam_id":117,"answer":""},{"id":"nKtk5fD9D2DpynaygAZ2","topic":"7","exam_id":117,"question_text":"The communication department for a company plans to add a publicly accessible survey page to the company’s public website.\n\nYou must add the new survey page to the company’s public website and capture data from the page to a Microsoft Dataverse environment.\n\nExplicit user credentials must not be required to write survey data to Dataverse.\n\nYou need to implement authentication.\n\nWhich authentication mechanism should you implement?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1744224420.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1559345","poster":"hulendar","content":"Selected Answer: C\nPlease check the similar questions: Topic 2 Q29, T6Q8, T6Q10, T7Q22.\nCorrect answer is X.509 certificate or Client secret"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Juan0414","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect!\nSimilar question here:\nhttps://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/109762-exam-pl-400-topic-7-question-22-discussion/","timestamp":"1741270800.0","comment_id":"1365902"},{"poster":"pey","comment_id":"1206759","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1730781720.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nBy implementing OAuth 2.0, the survey page on the company's public website can authenticate with Microsoft Dataverse using access tokens, allowing it to securely write survey data without needing explicit user credentials."},{"timestamp":"1727934660.0","comment_id":"1188487","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","poster":"hai297","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1716041640.0","poster":"NNNT","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1074139","content":"D is the Answer"},{"comment_id":"1056533","timestamp":"1714349640.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think it should be D","poster":"smwadi"},{"poster":"At09","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1023460","content":"Answer is\n D","timestamp":"1712093100.0"},{"poster":"HasanAamir11","comment_id":"1018452","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct.","timestamp":"1711523340.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1695791340,"question_id":345,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/121527-exam-pl-400-topic-7-question-25-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (75%)","13%","13%"],"choices":{"B":"Azure guest account","D":"OAuth 2.0","C":"X.509 certificate","A":"Azure AD Conditional Access"},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-27 07:09:00"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":382,"isBeta":false,"name":"PL-400","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":117,"isMCOnly":false,"provider":"Microsoft","isImplemented":true},"currentPage":69},"__N_SSP":true}
