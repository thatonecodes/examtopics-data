The ad response model needs to support 'non-linear decision boundaries'. This is supported by the decision jungle model. So now we have the decision jungle model as one of the three steps.\n2. The decision jungle model uses K-means clusters as inputs, so K-Means comes before the decision jungle model. K-means clustering can be used to identify 'market/customer segments'.\n3. There remains a third step either before K-means or after decision jungle model. The ad response model needs to be 'applied during the event'. It does seem that a recommender model is the more appropriate choice to apply onto the live dataset and serve recommendations during the event. And the recommender model would logically be at the last step.\n4. So the overall flow seems to be identifying market/customer segments using KMeans -> Non-linear decisions using Decision Jungle (frankly I still wonder how this model fits in the end-to-end flow) -> serve recommendations using the recommender model.","timestamp":"1658300220.0","upvote_count":"26","poster":"Indranee","comment_id":"271842"}],"poster":"jackreacher","content":"Is there anybody who can explain this?
