Yes\n\nUsing Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates is a highly effective strategy for automatically creating and managing Azure resources, especially when you have identical requirements for multiple business units. ARM templates allow you to define your infrastructure as code, specifying the resources, configurations, and relationships in a declarative manner.\n\nBy creating ARM templates that represent the required resources, you can deploy them consistently across different business units while ensuring that the configurations are identical. This approach is efficient, repeatable, and scalable, making it a suitable solution for automating resource deployment.\n\nTherefore, recommending the use of Azure Resource Manager templates in the strategy aligns with the goal of automatically creating Azure resources for each business unit.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"then the answer to Q.17 = No. You agree?","timestamp":"1695360840.0","poster":"SAFM","comment_id":"1013632"}]},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"dineshk_aq","timestamp":"1722702840.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nARM is needed anyways for this","comment_id":"1260373"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1231053","content":"Selected Answer: A\nUse of Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) is the correct answer.","poster":"VaibhavGawali","timestamp":"1718468400.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nARM templates are used to automate deployments in a project","timestamp":"1714325460.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Jeenia","comment_id":"1203666"},{"comment_id":"1180951","poster":"Alonsochaves","timestamp":"1711205280.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nARM templates are associated to automatically deployment of Azure resources"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1700446260.0","poster":"intentando","comment_id":"1075072"},{"timestamp":"1688092080.0","poster":"jana90","content":"yes,\nWe can use Azure Resource Manager templates to automate the creation of the Azure resources.

It is a large-scale, distributed, MPP (massively parallel processing) relational database technology in the same class of competitors as Amazon Redshift or Snowflake. Azure SQL\nSynapse Analytics is an important component of the Modern Data Warehouse multi-platform architecture. Because Azure SQL Synapse Analytics is an MPP system with a shared-nothing architecture across distributions, it is meant for large-scale analytical workloads which can take advantage of parallelism.\nBox 2:\nAzure Machine Learning uses past trainings to provide predictions that have high probability.\nMachine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. By using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.\nForecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might want based on what you've bought.\nBox 3:\nAzure Functions provides serverless computing functionalities.\nAzure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.\nBox 4:\nIoT Hub (Internet of things Hub) provides data from millions of sensors.\nIoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud- hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/synapse-analytics/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-ml https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview","question_id":89,"answer":"","question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04227/0020100001.png"],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/46384-exam-az-900-topic-1-question-180-discussion/"},{"id":"zdFTdHGfRwnZbZXNWlwt","timestamp":"2021-03-15 02:10:00","question_text":"You have an Azure environment.\nYou need to create a new Azure virtual machine from a tablet that runs the Android operating system.\nWhat are three possible solutions?
