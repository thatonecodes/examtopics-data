This reduces exposure to attacks while providing easy access when you need to connect to a VM.\nNote: Threat actors actively hunt accessible machines with open management ports, like RDP or SSH. Your legitimate users also use these ports, so it's not practical to keep them closed.\nWhen you enable just-in-time VM access, you can select the ports on the VM to which inbound traffic will be blocked.\nTo solve this dilemma, Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers JIT. With JIT, you can lock down the inbound traffic to your VMs, reducing exposure to attacks while providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed.\nBox 2: A conditional Access policy that has Cloud Apps assignment set to Azure Windows VM Sign-In\nYou can enforce Conditional Access policies such as multi-factor authentication or user sign-in risk check before authorizing access to Windows VMs in Azure that are enabled with Azure AD sign in.

Tags are key-value pairs that can be applied to Azure resources, allowing you to categorize and organize them based on your specified criteria. In this case, you can create tags for environment, owner, department, and cost center.\n\nYou can use Azure Policy to enforce tagging rules by creating policies that require specific tags to be applied to resources upon creation or update.

By creating a policy, you avoid the scenario of resources being deployed to your subscription that don't have the expected tags for your organization.
