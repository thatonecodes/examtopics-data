In the context of this question and the wizard shown, it is a setting that can be modified before finalizing the deployment of new session hosts.\n\nTo allow connections from the public internet, you must enable and configure inbound ports (for example, RDP or other necessary ports). Setting “Public inbound ports” to “None” essentially blocks internet-sourced connections. Therefore, to enable external access, you must open the relevant ports on your new virtual machines.","poster":"hwoccurrence"}],"answer":"","unix_timestamp":1738756500,"answer_description":"","question_id":266,"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou have an Azure Virtual Desktop deployment that contains a host pool named Pool1.\n\nYou are adding Microsoft Entra joined session hosts to Pool1 as shown in the following exhibit.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nUse the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic.\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n//IMG//","answer_ET":"","isMC":false,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/155980-exam-az-140-topic-6-question-41-discussion/","exam_id":46,"timestamp":"2025-02-05 12:55:00","topic":"6","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/az-140/image346.png","https://img.examtopics.com/az-140/image347.png"]},{"id":"hYyiETbEsZuGmkdOwWKj","timestamp":"2024-10-17 20:09:00","answer":"AC","question_id":267,"choices":{"A":"Change the disk type to fixed.","B":"Decrease the disk size to 1 TB.","D":"Change the disk type to differencing.","C":"Change the disk format to VHD.","E":"Change the virtual machine generation to generation 2."},"exam_id":46,"answers_community":["AC (88%)","13%"],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nTo prepare your Hyper-V virtual machine for uploading to Azure, you need to ensure it meets Azure’s requirements.
