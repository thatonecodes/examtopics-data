According to the online documentation, the mechanism to supply these variables is handled by the event listener that calls the setContextProvider. If this listener isn’t running, then the context variables won’t be set when new chats are initiated, which matches the reported issue. In contrast, methods like getContextProvider are used to retrieve the variables once they’re set, rather than populating them.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Nyanne"}],"upvote_count":"5","poster":"mattiaeject","content":"Nope.
