Scrum is one implementation of agile methodology that has every sprint start with a planning activity. Introducing security into this part of the development process should focus on:\n- Threat modeling to view the application through the lens of a potential attacker\n- IDE security plug-ins and pre-commit hooks for lightweight static analysis checking within an integrated development environment (IDE).\n- Peer reviews and secure coding standards to identify effective security coding standards, peer review processes, and pre-commit hooks.","comments":[{"poster":"zellck","timestamp":"1731459120.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/devsecops-controls#actionable-intelligence\nThe tools and techniques in this guidance offer a holistic security model for organizations who want to move at pace and experiment with new technologies that aim to drive innovation. A key element of DevSecOps is data-driven, event-driven processes. These processes help teams identify, evaluate, and respond to potential risks. Many organizations choose to integrate alerts and usage data into their IT service management (ITSM) platform.
