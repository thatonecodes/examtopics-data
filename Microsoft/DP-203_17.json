It also organizes the data by data source and subject area, which simplifies folder security. By using a flat structure, with the data files directly under the year-week folder, query times can be minimized as the data is organized for efficient partition pruning.\n\nOption A is similar but includes an additional level of hierarchy for the year, which is unnecessary given the requirement to filter by year-week.
