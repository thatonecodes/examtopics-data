The app provides an extra layer of security by requiring users to confirm their identity via their phone before accessing their accounts.\nWindows Hello is a biometric authentication feature built into Windows 10, which allows users to sign in to their devices using facial recognition or fingerprint matching. It is a convenient and secure way to authenticate without having to remember complex passwords.\nFast Identity Online (FIDO) is an open authentication standard that enables users to sign in without using passwords by using hardware tokens, such as USB keys, or biometric factors, such as facial recognition or fingerprint matching. OAuth is a related standard that allows users to log in to third-party applications or services without sharing their passwords with those services. Together, FIDO and OAuth provide a secure and easy way to authenticate without relying on passwords."},{"timestamp":"1701616920.0","upvote_count":"12","comment_id":"1086889","content":"i should get my money back .","poster":"japjap"},{"timestamp":"1725036660.0","content":"In exam 08/30/24, I went with yes for all three. \nRegarding FIDO: \n\"Users can register a passkey (FIDO2) and choose it as their primary sign-in method.
