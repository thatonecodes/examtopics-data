Common examples are email, calendaring and office tools\n(such as Microsoft Office 365).\nSaaS provides a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser.
