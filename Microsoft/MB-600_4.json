Workflows cannot enforce rules as the run server-side. A possibility is to create a calculated field that displays the difference in days and one could display an error message if the number if greater than 7, however, this would not enforce anything, reason being is that the calculation only run once the record is saved and thus the error message would only display after the record is saved. In my opinion a Buisness Proces Flow and Workflows would and could not perform enforcement, however, with a few tricks you may be able to get a business rule to enforce such a rule but not on its own."}],"answers_community":[]}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":56,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"name":"MB-600","isMCOnly":false,"id":87,"provider":"Microsoft"},"currentPage":4},"__N_SSP":true}
