Used to manage member and computer access to shared resources for a group of users. For example, you can create a security group for a specific security policy. By doing it this way, you can give a set of permissions to all the members at once, instead of having to add permissions to each member individually. A security group can have users, devices, groups and service principals as its members and users and service principals as its owners. For more info about managing access to resources, see Manage access to resources with Azure Active Directory groups.\nMicrosoft 365. Provides collaboration opportunities by giving members access to a shared mailbox, calendar, files, SharePoint site, and more. This option also lets you give people outside of your organization access to the group. A Microsoft 365 group can have only users as its members.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal","comment_id":"429036","timestamp":"1645512780.0"},{"poster":"melatocaroca","timestamp":"1642105260.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"They do not tell if AD security group is global or universal, \nActive Directory Universal group can contain users, computer, global groups and other universal group, can be used to assign access permissions to resources in Active Directory and can also be used to distribute messages. \n\nMicrosoft 365 security groups if group writeback is enabled on AD connect are sync to on prem designed OU, but van not contain another M O365 group, nested groups are not supported","comment_id":"405618"},{"comment_id":"369555","timestamp":"1638204060.0","content":"Correct answer","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Goseu"},{"comment_id":"363346","poster":"zed01","timestamp":"1637552700.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"According to link, I cant find any group type which has devices assigned.
