Yes.\n\nHere's why:\n\nMicrosoft Entra ID authentication provides a secure and robust method for authenticating users. This aligns with the requirement for managers to use their corporate identity to authenticate.\nFine-grained access control can be implemented using Microsoft Entra ID groups. You can create a group for each store manager and assign them permissions to update stock information only for their specific store.
