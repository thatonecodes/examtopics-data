With this new release, the process is much easier because you can directly choose a runbook from a list during alert rule creation, and you can choose an Automation account which will run the runbook or easily create an account.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/automatically-remediate-azure-vm-alerts-with-automation-runbooks/"},{"id":"nOAeOE0MjL5iIy4fKCsi","answer_images":[],"question_id":177,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"266193","poster":"Stephan99","content":"answer is correct.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/docker-application-development-process/docker-app-development-workflow","upvote_count":"13","timestamp":"1610532240.0"},{"timestamp":"1644332640.0","comment_id":"543142","poster":"moon2351","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is correct"},{"comment_id":"529439","upvote_count":"1","content":"on Exam today 21st Jan, 2022","timestamp":"1642801440.0","poster":"nd78"},{"timestamp":"1641241560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB - 700%","comment_id":"516024","poster":"kristhiank","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"awalao","timestamp":"1638591480.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"493494","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB 100%"},{"content":"On exam today 22/11/21 Score 839","comment_id":"483996","poster":"Dpejic","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1637571360.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1630196520.0","comment_id":"434215","poster":"syu31svc","content":"This is Dockerfile file for sure; the rest are completely invalid\n\nB 101%"},{"comment_id":"406075","timestamp":"1626250620.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct","poster":"rdemontis"}],"exam_id":52,"answer":"B","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1609988460,"answer_description":"The Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions needed to create a new container image.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/manage-windows-dockerfile","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/41703-exam-az-303-topic-5-question-109-discussion/","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-01-07 04:01:00","choices":{"D":"Build.ini","B":"Dockerfile","A":"dockerconfig.json","C":"daemon.json"},"question_text":"You have a server named Server1 that runs Windows Server 2019.
