Azure SQL Database is a managed SQL Server Database in Azure. The SQL Server is managed by Microsoft; you just have access to the database.\nBox 2: Azure SQL Synapse Analytics\nAzure SQL Synapse Analytics (previously called Data Warehouse) is a cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft. It is a large-scale, distributed, MPP (massively parallel processing) relational database technology in the same class of competitors as Amazon Redshift or Snowflake. Azure SQL\nSynapse Analytics is an important component of the Modern Data Warehouse multi-platform architecture. Because Azure SQL Synapse Analytics is an MPP system with a shared-nothing architecture across distributions, it is meant for large-scale analytical workloads which can take advantage of parallelism.\nBox 3: Azure Data Lake Analytics\nYou can process big data jobs in seconds with Azure Data Lake Analytics. You can process petabytes of data for diverse workload categories such as querying,\nETL, analytics, machine learning, machine translation, image processing and sentiment analysis by leveraging existing libraries written in .NET languages, R or\nPython.\nBox 4: Azure HDInsight.\nApache Hadoop was the original open-source framework for distributed processing and analysis of big data sets on clusters. The Hadoop ecosystem includes related software and utilities, including Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Spark, Kafka, and many others.\nAzure HDInsight is a fully managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service in the cloud for enterprises. The Apache Hadoop cluster type in Azure HDInsight allows you to use HDFS, YARN resource management, and a simple MapReduce programming model to process and analyze batch data in parallel.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-latn-ba/azure/hdinsight/hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction https://www.blue-granite.com/blog/is-azure-sql-data-warehouse-a-good-fit-updated https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/data-lake-analytics/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04227/0018800001.jpg"],"isMC":false,"exam_id":62,"answer_ET":"","answer":"","question_id":78,"question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nMatch the Azure service to the correct description.\nInstructions: To answer, drag the appropriate Azure service from the column on the left to its description on the right.

It helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they depend on.\nBox 2:\nYou can browse available virtual machine images in the Azure Marketplace.\nAzure Marketplace provides access and information on solutions and services available from Microsoft and their partners. Customers can discover, try, or buy cloud software solutions built on or for Azure. The catalog of 8,000+ listings provides Azure building blocks, such as Virtual Machines (VMs), APIs, Azure apps,\nSolution Templates and managed applications, SaaS apps, containers, and consulting services.\nBox 3.\nAzure Advisor displays security recommendations.\nAzure Advisor provides you with a consistent, consolidated view of recommendations for all your Azure resources. It integrates with Azure Security Center to bring you security recommendations. You can get security recommendations from the Security tab on the Advisor dashboard.\nSecurity Center helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility into and control over the security of your Azure resources. It periodically analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations.
