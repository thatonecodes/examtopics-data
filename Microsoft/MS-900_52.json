It simply allows users to easily identify and understand the classification level of the data, but it does not restrict access to or control the retention of the data based on the classification level. While labels can be a useful tool for classifying data, they alone are not sufficient for enforcing data classification in a data governance strategy.\n\nTo enforce data classification, you need to have mechanisms in place to control access to and retention of data based on the classification level. This is where options A and E (Applying SharePoint permissions and retention policies) come in. SharePoint permissions allow you to restrict access to sensitive data to only authorized users, and retention policies allow you to ensure that data is retained for the appropriate amount of time based on its classification level and legal or regulatory requirements.
