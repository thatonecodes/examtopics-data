When you compare models, they are ranked by the metric you select for evaluation.\nMean absolute error (MAE) measures how close the predictions are to the actual outcomes; thus, a lower score is better.\nRoot mean squared error (RMSE) creates a single value that summarizes the error in the model. By squaring the difference, the metric disregards the difference between over-prediction and under-prediction.\nRelative absolute error (RAE) is the relative absolute difference between expected and actual values; relative because the mean difference is divided by the arithmetic mean.\nRelative squared error (RSE) similarly normalizes the total squared error of the predicted values by dividing by the total squared error of the actual values.\nMean Zero One Error (MZOE) indicates whether the prediction was correct or not. In other words: ZeroOneLoss(x,y) = 1 when x!=y; otherwise 0.\nCoefficient of determination, often referred to as R2, represents the predictive power of the model as a value between 0 and 1. Zero means the model is random\n(explains nothing); 1 means there is a perfect fit. However, caution should be used in interpreting R2 values, as low values can be entirely normal and high values can be suspect.\nAUC.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/evaluate-model","question_images":[],"question_text":"Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario.

A high AUC value indicates that the model has a strong ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances, which is especially important in imbalanced datasets where one class may have significantly fewer instances than the other.
