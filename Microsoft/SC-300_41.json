Delete CAPolicy1.\n\nTo enable Security defaults for contoso.com, Admin1 must be assigned at least the Security Administrator role1. However, this role is not available in the list of roles for Au1, which is the only authentication method for contoso.com. This is because Au1 has a Conditional Access policy named CAPolicy1 that blocks legacy authentication protocols2. Security defaults also block legacy authentication protocols, so they cannot be enabled if there is an existing Conditional Access policy that does the same3.\n\nTherefore, to enable Security defaults, Admin1 must first delete CAPolicy1 from Au1.
