Location-Based Routing (LBR).\n\nHere's why LBR is the appropriate solution for this scenario:\n\nDirect Control over Toll Bypass: LBR allows you to explicitly define which calls should be routed through the PSTN carrier based on the user's physical location, effectively restricting toll bypass for users in specific offices.\nGeographical Accuracy: LBR utilizes IP address mapping to determine the user's location, ensuring accurate enforcement of toll bypass restrictions.\nCompliance with Regulatory Requirements: In some regions, toll bypass restrictions are mandated by law.
