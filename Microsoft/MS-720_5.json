There was a time when TAC and SfB Legacy Portal were still both in place, where you could assign an SfB User a Phone Number which also triggered enabling EV. Right now it's only PowerShell. If you try to add a user which is not EV enabled as an Agent in a CQ, TAC will display an error message saying that this user is not EV enabled.

There are several instances in it that refer to \"Enterprise Voice\" in the exam, and it is unambiguous that it refers to voice services for Teams, not as a license granting voice capabilities for SfB (it can mean both, as I cautioned).
