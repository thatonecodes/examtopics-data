In this list, the order of the labels is important because it reflects their priority. You want your most restrictive sensitivity label, such as Highly Confidential, to appear at the bottom of the list, and your least restrictive sensitivity label, such as Public, to appear at the top.\nYou can apply just one sensitivity label to an item such as a document, email, or container. If you set an option that requires your users to provide a justification for changing a label to a lower classification, the order of this list identifies the lower classifications. However, this option does not apply to sublabels.\nThe ordering of sublabels is used with automatic labeling, though. When you configure labels to be applied automatically or as a recommendation, multiple matches can result for more than one label. To determine the label to apply or recommend, the label ordering is used: The last sensitive label is selected, and then if applicable, the last sublabel.","poster":"Cyberbug2021"},{"poster":"Cyberbug2021","content":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-file-types\n\n.txt is not supported","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"344761","timestamp":"1651163040.0"},{"poster":"macco455","comment_id":"321464","upvote_count":"1","content":"Label 2\nNo Label\nScoped policies, just like labels, are ordered in the Azure portal.
