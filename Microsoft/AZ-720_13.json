This means that flow logs on the gateway will not capture this traffic, which is why you are not seeing outbound traffic in the flow logs for the gateway.\n\nIn order to capture traffic information for VM1 (including the issues users are experiencing when connecting to VM1 from on-premises), you need to enable flow logging on the network security group (NSG) associated with VM1's network interface.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the storage account can be accessed from the virtual network associated with the NSG. To achieve this, we can enable the public endpoint for the storage account, which allows traffic to be sent to the storage account over the public internet.
