If duplication detection setting during create is turned on, users (sales person) are able to overrule the system suggestion and create the duplicate records anyways. I have done it 100's of times and you can easily try it yourself in the vanilla system.","timestamp":"1581196380.0","poster":"[Removed]"},{"comment_id":"47252","upvote_count":"2","content":"The correct answer is C&E confirmed.","timestamp":"1580982360.0","poster":"HaCha"},{"timestamp":"1579767720.0","comment_id":"41875","poster":"[Removed]","content":"I agree with the majority, C & E appears to be the correct answer","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"C & E are correct","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1579007940.0","comment_id":"38960","poster":"ned"},{"content":"The system must prevent the addition of duplicate leads from the workbooks.\nE - prevents import\nSales team members must be able to manually create a duplicate lead record.\nC - allows create/update by disabling","comment_id":"30367","poster":"MAKHUNXA","timestamp":"1576588680.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"poster":"vignesh989","content":"its C and E, go to Setting > Data Management > Duplicate Detection settings \nYou can toggle those options and check them out.","comment_id":"24111","upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1574615940.0"},{"timestamp":"1571683740.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"The correct answer should be C+E.\nThe question asked about configure Settings, not create a rule.\nAs you see the options in the following link,\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajlw_u-9iVJohwEK3-LtzEJjKNWh?e=A3Pb52\nB, C and E are options included in Duplicate Detection Settings, so that discard A and D.\nWhat B does is to warn the user that is creating a duplicate record but gives the option to ignore the warning and create the record anyway -> https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajlw_u-9iVJohwKKQGdGsylhKjAS?e=eeLm7e\nWhat I understand in this question is that the system shoudn´t even warn about the creation of a duplicate record for manual entry so B is also out.\nHope this helps.","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1583332620.0","comment_id":"58777","poster":"javier"}],"content":"Can anyone confirm what the actual answer is?
