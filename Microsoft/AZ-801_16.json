Enabling live migrations (Option B) is not related to Hyper-V Replica. The Hyper-V Replica HTTPS Listener (Option C) is used for Replica over HTTPS, not Kerberos. The Hyper-V Replica HTTP Listener (Option D) is also used for Replica over HTTP, not Kerberos. Kerberos authentication for Hyper-V Replica does not require any specific firewall rules to be enabled.
