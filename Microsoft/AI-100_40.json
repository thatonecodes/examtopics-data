Shared Key authorization provides a storage account access key, which can be used to authenticate and access the blob store.

Yes, it does.\n\nImplementing Shared Access Signatures (SAS) on the storage account can help accomplish your objective of controlling access to the blob store based on a role.\n\nBy using SAS, you can generate a token that includes specific permissions and a limited validity period. This token can be issued to users or clients with the required role. The role determines the permissions they have on the blob store. The SAS token can be attached to a request made to the storage account, granting temporary access to perform specific operations, such as read or write, on the blob store.\n\nWith SAS, you have fine-grained control over who can access the blob store and what operations they can perform.
