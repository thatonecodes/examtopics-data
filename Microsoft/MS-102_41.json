Fabrikam has 10,000 employees worldwide.\n\nFabrikam has a main office in London and branch offices in major cities in Europe, Asia, and the United States.\n\n\nExisting Environment -\n\n\nActive Directory Environment -\n\nThe network contains an Active Directory forest named fabrikam.com. The forest contains all the identities used for user and computer authentication. Each department is represented by a top-level organizational unit (OU) that contains several child OUs for user accounts and computer accounts.\n\nAll users authenticate to on-premises applications by signing in to their device by using a UPN format of username@fabrikam.com.\n\nFabrikam does NOT plan to implement identity federation.\n\n\nNetwork Infrastructure -\n\nEach office has a high-speed connection to the Internet.\n\nEach office contains two domain controllers. All domain controllers are configured as DNS servers.\n\nThe public zone for fabrikam.com is managed by an external DNS server.\n\nAll users connect to an on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 organization. The users access their email by using Outlook Anywhere, Outlook on the web, or the Microsoft Outlook app for iOS. All the Exchange servers have the latest cumulative updates installed.\n\nAll shared company documents are stored on a Microsoft SharePoint Server farm.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nPlanned Changes -\n\nFabrikam plans to implement a Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscription and move all email and shared documents to the subscription.\n\nFabrikam plans to implement two pilot projects:\n\n• Project1: During Project1, the mailboxes of 100 users in the sales department will be moved to Microsoft 365.\n• Project2: After the successful completion of Project1, Microsoft Teams will be enabled in Microsoft 365 for the sales department users.\n\nFabrikam plans to create a group named UserLicenses that will manage the allocation of all Microsoft 365 bulk licenses.\n\n\nTechnical Requirements -\n\nFabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:\n\n• All users must be able to exchange email messages successfully during Project1 by using their current email address.\n• Users must be able to authenticate to cloud services if Active Directory becomes unavailable.\n• A user named User1 must be able to view all DLP reports from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n• Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise applications must be installed from a network share only.\n• Disruptions to email access must be minimized.\n\n\nApplication Requirements -\n\nFabrikam identifies the following application requirements:\n\n• An on-premises web application named App1 must allow users to complete their expense reports online. App1 must be available to users from the My Apps portal.\n• The installation of feature updates for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise must be minimized.\n\n\nSecurity Requirements -\n\nFabrikam identifies the following security requirements:\n\n• After the planned migration to Microsoft 365, all users must continue to authenticate to their mailbox and to SharePoint sites by using their UPN.\n• The membership of the UserLicenses group must be validated monthly. Unused user accounts must be removed from the group automatically.\n• After the planned migration to Microsoft 365, all users must be signed in to on-premises and cloud-based applications automatically.\n• The principle of least privilege must be used.\n\n\nYou are evaluating the required processes for Project1.\n\nYou need to recommend which DNS record must be created while adding a domain name for the project.\n\nWhich DNS record should you recommend?","timestamp":"2024-08-16 03:06:00","unix_timestamp":1723770360,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","question_id":202,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"host information (HINFO)","D":"pointer (PTR)","A":"name server (NS)","C":"text (TXT)"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1736724240.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nJust filling up the dump with the same question.

However, in the context of filtering recommended actions in Microsoft Secure Score based on specific department names, a dynamic security group might not be the most direct solution.\n\nAdministrative units are specifically designed to segment your organization into smaller units, making it easier to manage and apply policies based on those segments. This segmentation aligns more closely with the need to filter actions by department.\n\nSo, while dynamic security groups are powerful for managing memberships dynamically, administrative units are more suitable for your specific requirement of filtering actions in Microsoft Secure Score by department."},{"timestamp":"1723790280.0","poster":"APK1","comment_id":"1266865","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect answer is \nB.

By creating tags for different departments, you can then apply these tags to users and devices. This allows you to filter and view recommendations and actions in the Microsoft Secure Score tailored to these tagged departments.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723770600.0","comment_id":"1266767"},{"comment_id":"1201632","timestamp":"1713993060.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nhttps://security.microsoft.com/securescore\nThe only option for filtering from these answers is TAG","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. an administrative unit\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is that an administrative unit in Microsoft 365 allows for the organization of users based on different departments or other criteria, such as geographical location or job function. Once these users are organized into administrative units, various settings and policies, including those related to security, can be applied specifically to these units. In the context of Microsoft Secure Score, being able to filter recommendations based on specific departments will require that these departments are first organized in a way that they can be individually addressed, which is facilitated by creating administrative units. This allows for a more targeted and efficient management of the recommendations based on the particular needs and characteristics of each department.","timestamp":"1713966960.0","comments":[],"poster":"egman18","comment_id":"1201420"}],"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"You have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription.\n\nFrom the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, you review your company’s Microsoft Secure Score.\n\nYou discover a large number of recommended actions.\n\nYou need to ensure that the actions can be filtered based on specific department names.\n\nWhat should you create first?","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1713966960,"choices":{"D":"a custom detection rule","B":"a tag","A":"a dynamic security group","C":"an administrative unit"},"answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer":"B","exam_id":100,"question_id":203,"timestamp":"2024-04-24 15:56:00","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/139509-exam-ms-102-topic-1-question-283-discussion/","answers_community":["B (91%)","9%"]},{"id":"iMZfVWs6q4YgVJ4YAT2p","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/ms-102/image438.png"],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Device1 and Device3 only","A":"Device1 only","B":"Device1 and Device2 only","D":"Device1, Device2, and Device3"},"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2024-08-15 14:28:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/145805-exam-ms-102-topic-1-question-284-discussion/","answer":"A","answer_description":"","exam_id":100,"question_text":"You have a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription that contains the devices shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nYou plan to create an Endpoint security policy by using the Defender Update controls template.\n\nTo which devices can you apply the policy?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"BJS78","timestamp":"1728385200.0","comment_id":"1294686","content":"Updates come via MS Update anyway, so...\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/manage-protection-updates-microsoft-defender-antivirus"},{"timestamp":"1723770900.0","poster":"Khattak3143","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe Defender Update controls template is designed for managing update settings specifically for Windows devices.\nTherefore A: Device 1 only","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1266768"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"1309766","poster":"Ody","content":"Had they not mentioned the Defender Update controls template, you would be correct.\n\nThat template is an admx file which only works with Windows.","timestamp":"1731288420.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"poster":"abill","content":"is it C?","comment_id":"1266438","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1723724880.0"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1723724880,"question_id":204},{"id":"sE41mDip1xSHUrcQ75mI","question_text":"You have a Microsoft 365 tenant.\n\nYou plan to manage incidents in the tenant by using the Microsoft Defender XDR.\n\nWhich Microsoft service source will appear on the Incidents page of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1731288720.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"D is the best answer.\n\nHowever, if connected, Sentinel will also.","poster":"Ody","comment_id":"1309767"},{"timestamp":"1728385380.0","poster":"BJS78","comment_id":"1294689","upvote_count":"3","content":"\"Alerts from different Microsoft security solutions like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, Defender for Identity, Defender for Cloud Apps, Defender XDR, App Governance, Microsoft Entra ID Protection, and Microsoft Data Loss Prevention appear here.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/investigate-alerts?tabs=settings"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"The correct answer is D.
