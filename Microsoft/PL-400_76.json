Answer is correct.\nStarting with Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps version 9.0, if your JavaScript web resource depends on an entity attribute value that you donâ€™t want to display in the form, you can set the attribute as a dependency for the JavaScript web resource. This means that the attribute will be available within the client API attributes collection so you can get or set the value in your code. When you add a dependency this way, the controls collection of the attribute will be empty because there will be no control on the form.\n\nBefore this feature you would need to manually add the attribute to the form and then configure the control to be hidden.
