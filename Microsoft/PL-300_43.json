Add a trend line to the scatter plot.\n\nAdding a trend line to the scatter plot in Power BI would enhance the visualization's ability to reveal patterns or trends in the data. This approach is beneficial because it doesn't impact the underlying data used in other visuals, such as the card showing the number of records or the bar chart displaying total transaction amounts by territory. Trend lines provide a visual representation of the general direction of the data, making it easier to identify relationships and patterns without altering the data itself.\n\nThis approach seems to be the most suitable and voted for, considering the requirements of maintaining the accuracy of other visuals and aiding in the identification of meaningful patterns in the scatter plot.","timestamp":"1704355920.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe keyword in the question is: \"10 million rows\" => C.

Enable high-density sampling on the scatter plot.\n\nEnabling high-density sampling on the scatter plot will reduce the number of points displayed in the visual, while still maintaining the overall patterns and trends in the data. This will make it easier for users to identify meaningful patterns without affecting the accuracy of the other visuals. Adding a count field to the size bucket of the scatter plot or applying a row filter to the Data1 query in Power Query Editor will change the way the data is displayed in the scatter plot and may affect the accuracy of the other visuals.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nEnabling high-density sampling allows you to plot a representative subset of the data in the scatter plot without losing significant information. This will help reduce the clutter in the scatter plot caused by a large amount of data and make it easier for users to identify patterns and trends.\n\nAdding a count field of the transaction amount to the size bucket of the scatter plot (option A) would make the scatter plot more informative but may also add more clutter to the plot, making it harder to identify patterns.\n\nAdding a trend line to the scatter plot (option B) would show the overall trend in the data, but it may not be useful in identifying patterns across different territories.\n\nApplying a row filter to the Data1 query in Power Query Editor (option D) would reduce the number of rows in the dataset but would also affect the accuracy of all the visuals using the Data1 table, including the card and bar chart.

For example, you might see a scatter chart with lots of circles that overlap (density) in a certain area, and imagine many data points must be clustered there; since the High Density Sampling algorithm can use one circle to represent many data points, such implied visual density (or \"clustering\") will not show up. To get more detail in a given area, you can use slicers to zoom in. Would go with C on this one, B would be to spot a trend. C would be accurate since it makes users more likely to spot patterns.","upvote_count":"6"},{"comment_id":"709844","poster":"Namenick10","timestamp":"1667397060.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nShould be B.","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1666736880.0","comment_id":"704212","poster":"Manzy2599"}],"unix_timestamp":1666267260,"question_id":215,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/86032-exam-pl-300-topic-3-question-47-discussion/","exam_id":116}],"exam":{"name":"PL-300","numberOfQuestions":334,"isMCOnly":false,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Microsoft","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":116,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":43},"__N_SSP":true}
