Configure NSG flow logs.\n\nTo configure an Azure Monitor Network Insights alert that will be triggered when suspicious network traffic is detected, you need to enable NSG flow logs for each NSG that is connected to a virtual machine. NSG flow logs capture information about inbound and outbound traffic flowing through an NSG.\n\nOnce NSG flow logs are enabled, you can use Azure Monitor to analyze the logs and create alerts for suspicious traffic patterns. Therefore, the first step is to configure NSG flow logs.\n\nOption A, B, and C are not directly related to configuring an Azure Monitor Network Insights alert for detecting suspicious network traffic.

This can be configured to automatically copy data from one storage location to another, either within the same region or across different regions. Object replication can be used to create disaster recovery solutions or to distribute data globally for better performance and availability.\nIt is similar to GRS but it is more flexible as you can choose the storage account and container to replicate the data.\nThe GRS of a North Europe region is a secondary copy of the data stored in a different region. The exact location of the secondary region will depend on the specific Azure region you have selected. For the North Europe region, the secondary copy is stored in the West Europe region. This means that if there is an outage or disaster in the North Europe region, your data will still be available in the West Europe region.

Once you enable GRS, Azure handles replication for you, without requiring you to configure or maintain additional rules.\n\nDefault Region Pairing: While GRS doesn't allow you to specify the secondary region, Azure automatically replicates data to the paired region of the primary region. For North Europe, the paired region is West Europe. Hence, if you choose GRS, your data would actually be replicated to West Europe, not East US.\n\nWhy not Object Replication?\n\nObject replication requires you to manually configure rules, specify the source and destination storage accounts, and ensure the target storage account is in the desired region (e.g., East US).\nWhile this approach offers control over the replication destination, it involves significantly more administrative effort, violating the \"minimize administrative effort\" requirement.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1733181300.0","comment_id":"1321133","poster":"samhouston"},{"content":"C: GRS\nWhile Object replication can indeed replicate blob data across different storage accounts, it requires more administrative effort compared to geo-redundant storage (GRS).

It provides redundancy by maintaining multiple copies of your data across different data centers. If a failure occurs in the primary region, the secondary region ensures data availability without manual intervention. GRS is a robust solution for disaster recovery and data durability.\nMinimized Administrative Effort: With GRS, you don’t need to manually manage the replication process or set up additional configurations. Azure handles the replication transparently, reducing administrative overhead.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. geo-redundant storage (GRS).
