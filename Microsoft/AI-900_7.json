Active learning is a technique where the system actively selects certain samples from the user interactions and prompts the user to provide feedback on the relevance or correctness of the response. This feedback is then used to update and refine the model, improving its performance over time.\n\nBy incorporating active learning into the bot's workflow, you can collect feedback from users and leverage it to continually train and fine-tune the model.
