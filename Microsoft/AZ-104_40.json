General-purpose v2 accounts deliver the lowest per-gigabyte capacity prices for Azure Storage, as well as industry-competitive transaction prices. General-purpose v2 accounts support default account access tiers of hot or cool and blob level tiering between hot, cool, or archive.\n\nUpgrading to a general-purpose v2 storage account from your general-purpose v1 or Blob storage accounts is straightforward. You can upgrade using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI. There is no downtime or risk of data loss associated with upgrading to a general-purpose v2 storage account.
