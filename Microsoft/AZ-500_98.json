However, this is not a strict requirement, as the article also states that you can use a key vault that is in a different region or tenant, but you need to grant permissions to the VMs to access the key vault. The article also mentions that the contents of your key vault are replicated within the region and to a secondary region at least 150 miles away, but within the same geography to maintain high durability of your keys and secrets2.
