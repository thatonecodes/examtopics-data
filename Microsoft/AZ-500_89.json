Assign share-level permissions for share1\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#prerequisites\nEnabling AD DS authentication for your Azure file shares allows you to authenticate to your Azure file shares with your on-premises AD DS credentials. Further, it allows you to better manage your permissions to allow granular access control. Doing this requires synching identities from on-premises AD DS to Azure AD using either the on-premises Azure AD Connect sync application or Azure AD Connect cloud sync, a lightweight agent that can be installed from the Azure Active Directory Admin Center. You assign share-level permissions to hybrid identities synced to Azure AD while managing file/directory-level access using Windows ACLs.","timestamp":"1714372020.0"},{"timestamp":"1727646120.0","poster":"ESAJRR","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1021066","content":"1.
