Activity functions are the functions and tasks that are orchestrated in the process. For example, you might create an orchestrator function to process an order. The tasks involve checking the inventory, charging the customer, and creating a shipment. Each task would be a separate activity function. These activity functions may be executed serially, in parallel, or some combination of both.\n\nEntity functions\nEntity functions define operations for reading and updating small pieces of state.

It works by increasing the amount of time that is waited between each retry attempt, using an exponential function to calculate the wait time.\n\nFor example, with a coefficient of 2.0 and an initial retry interval of 1 second, the wait times between retries might be 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, and so on.
