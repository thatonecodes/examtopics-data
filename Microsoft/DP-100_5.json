Boosted Decision Tree Regression.\n\nBoosted Decision Tree Regression is a powerful algorithm for predictive modeling that works by combining multiple decision trees to reduce the variance in the predictions. It does this by iteratively adding decision trees to the model, with each new tree adjusting the predictions made by the previous trees. This helps to reduce the error in the model and provide more accurate predictions.\n\nWhile the other algorithms listed (Fast Forest Quantile Regression, Poisson Regression, and Linear Regression) are useful in their own right, they may not necessarily be designed specifically to reduce variance. For example, Linear Regression is a simple and effective algorithm for modeling relationships between variables, but it does not have the same built-in capabilities for reducing variance as Boosted Decision Tree Regression.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1677049860.0","comment_id":"817560"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe keyword here is LINEAR Model, should be D","poster":"Yoshizn","timestamp":"1675776420.0","comment_id":"800933","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"Boosted Decision Tree Regression (C) is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of a model.

Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables and seeks to find the line of best fit that minimizes the variance between actual and predicted values.
