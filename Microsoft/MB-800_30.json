Unit of Measure code: This is the unit in which the item is sold (for example, each, box, case, etc.). It's important to have this information in the system so that the correct price can be applied based on the quantity sold.\n\nB. Item No.: This is the unique identifier for each item in the inventory. Loading this data allows the system to match the prices from the vendor's price list to the correct items in the inventory.\n\nPlease note that while Customer price group (C) and Campaign (D) are important aspects of pricing, they are not typically included in a vendor's price list. Customer price groups are usually defined internally to group customers for pricing purposes, and campaigns are typically related to sales and marketing efforts, not purchasing.","poster":"ivanrlg"},{"poster":"NA1926","content":"Selected Answer: AB\ncorrect","comment_id":"874776","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729347540.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/106748-exam-mb-800-topic-3-question-20-discussion/","answer_ET":"AB"},{"id":"eRPvN8oiZz6rWVXXPVn7","answers_community":[],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-04-19 16:21:00","answer_ET":"","question_text":"DRAG DROP\n-\n\nA company uses Dynamics 365 Business Central.\n\nThe accounting manager wants partially shipped and invoiced sales orders that will not be fulfilled to not be displayed on the active page (Open Sales Order list).

I surmise that they wanted to ask this question, provided the recurring sales lines are already in place, and we created. If so, then all that needs to be done is assignment of these recurring sales lines to the customer:\n1. Open Customer Card -> Related->Sales->Recurring Sales Lines\n2. Drop box and assign the recurring sales line/-s to the customer\n3. In the same window of recurring sales lines see last three columns on the right where you pick up the \"automatic\".\n4. Search tool= Tell me tool -> type \"Create Recurring Sales Invoices\"->batch job window is populated -> run the batch job\nIf I think this question is only about recurring sales lines assignment , and not their creation, then it will do.
