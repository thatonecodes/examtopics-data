Here are the recommended steps in sequence:\n\n1. Discover Privileged Roles: Before you can manage access with PIM, you need to discover who has privileged roles within your organization. You can use access reviews to automate the discovery and subsequent approval or removal of privileged role assignments.\n2. Sign up PIM for Azure AD Roles: After discovering which privileged roles exist, the next step is to sign up for PIM. This involves configuring PIM settings for each role to establish the policies that govern their activation and use, like requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA), setting activation durations, and determining the need for approval from designated approvers.\n3. Consent to PIM: The final step involves giving consent to PIM. This step is about acknowledging and accepting the responsibility that comes with using PIM to manage and secure privileged access within your organization.","poster":"JaridB","upvote_count":"10","timestamp":"1713555480.0","comment_id":"1198821"},{"timestamp":"1693911720.0","poster":"alfaAzure","upvote_count":"8","comment_id":"999397","content":"Sign up for Azure AD roles\nDiscover privileged roles\nConsent to PIM"},{"poster":"BMF","comment_id":"990862","content":"Admins , can you please update the answer to this question.
