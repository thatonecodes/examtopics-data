No\n\nThe solution does not meet the goal. In order to review the servicing status of a specific computer, you should navigate to the \"Updates\" page in the Intune console, rather than the \"Audit logs\" page. On the \"Updates\" page, you can view the current servicing channel for each device, as well as any pending updates and the status of those updates. This information can help you to identify any issues with servicing and take appropriate action to resolve them. The \"Audit logs\" page, on the other hand, provides a record of activity and changes made within the Intune console, but does not provide information about the servicing status of specific devices.","timestamp":"1673254260.0","poster":"kerimnl"},{"comment_id":"759057","poster":"Meebler","upvote_count":"1","content":"Yes, navigating to the Device configuration page in Microsoft Intune and reviewing the device status for a specific computer will allow you to review the necessary policy report and determine the servicing status of the computer.\n\nThe Device configuration page in Microsoft Intune allows you to view and manage the configuration policies that have been applied to devices in your organization.
