In this case, when you move to the Cloud, what you identify in this case is the OpEx or Operational model. This is because you actually don't have CapEx on the Cloud (or at least you look to minimize CapEx) as you pay for the resources you use and not for the underlying hardware, security, cooling, etc that you will pay for in an On-Prem solution.

A hybrid cloud model is a combination of a public cloud and a private cloud, where some applications and data are hosted in the public cloud while others are hosted in the private cloud.\n\nTo implement this model, a company must have an internal network to connect their private cloud resources to the public cloud resources. The internal network acts as a bridge between the two clouds, allowing data to be transferred securely and efficiently between them.\n\nIn addition to an internal network, the company must also have the necessary infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking equipment, to support the hybrid cloud model. They must also have the expertise to manage and maintain the infrastructure, as well as the ability to monitor and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.","comment_id":"817732","timestamp":"1677063180.0","poster":"vvadas"},{"timestamp":"1676930520.0","comment_id":"815929","content":"my view I that the first question is yes..you need to have an internal network of some sort, either on premise or private cloud, to have a hybrid solution. \nRemember - internal network isn't just on prem. it can also mean private cloud which is a internal network to the company.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"rodrigojds"},{"timestamp":"1676328900.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"807894","content":"does anyone has the pdf to share?","poster":"Aryanneb"},{"comment_id":"795915","poster":"tmusayev","content":"First answer should be YES , a company must have an internal network to implement a hybrid cloud model.

While changing pricing tiers may offer different levels of resources such as CPU, storage, or scalability options, it does not directly provide additional memory to individual apps. The memory allocation for an application is typically determined by the chosen pricing tier or configuration settings when deploying the app. However, it's worth noting that some PaaS services in Azure do provide options to scale resources, including memory, based on the needs of the application. For example, Azure App Service, which is a PaaS offering for hosting web applications, allows you to scale up or scale out your app instances to allocate more resources, including memory, to meet the application's requirements.
