Git Hub & Pipeline. \n You can integrate code scanning tools with GitHub Enterprise to automatically scan the code when it is uploaded to repositories. GitHub offers code scanning as a feature that analyzes the code in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. Any problems identified by the analysis are shown in GitHub, allowing developers to find, triage, and prioritize fixes for existing problems in their code. \n You can integrate code scanning tools with Azure Pipelines to automatically scan the code when building containers. Azure Pipelines is a cloud service that you can use to automatically build, test, and deploy your code. You can configure Azure Pipelines to use various code scanning tools, such as Microsoft Security Code Analysis, to automatically scan your code for vulnerabilities during the build process.","poster":"Victory007","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"973216","timestamp":"1691255280.0"},{"comment_id":"717149","timestamp":"1668325260.0","poster":"cychoia","upvote_count":"5","content":"Answer is correct"},{"comments":[{"content":"Yes but not during upload to git, which is a requirement","timestamp":"1667023560.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ariania","comment_id":"1255003","timestamp":"1721911440.0","content":"but it dosent say they use github, maybe they use azure devops? the scans then comes from defender from devops on the pipeline.
