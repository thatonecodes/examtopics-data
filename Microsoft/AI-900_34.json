In Azure Machine Learning, scaling and normalization techniques are applied to facilitate feature engineering. Collectively, these techniques and feature engineering are referred to as featurization.\nNote: Often, features are created from raw data through a process of feature engineering. For example, a time stamp in itself might not be useful for modeling until the information is transformed into units of days, months, or categories that are relevant to the problem, such as holiday versus working day.\n\nBox 3: Feature selection -\nIn machine learning and statistics, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant, useful features to use in building an analytical model. Feature selection helps narrow the field of data to the most valuable inputs. Narrowing the field of data helps reduce noise and improve training performance.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/evaluate-model-performance https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/38544-exam-ai-900-topic-1-question-26-discussion/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04234/0003200001.png"],"question_id":166,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"46","poster":"idioteque","content":"For me to remember again xD\n\nModel Evalution = values\nFeature engineering = splitting\nFeature selection = picking","comment_id":"644215","timestamp":"1659979080.0"},{"timestamp":"1606937880.0","comment_id":"233365","poster":"ipindado2020","upvote_count":"23","content":"answer is correct"},{"content":"model evaluation\nmodel training\nfeature selection","comment_id":"1341334","timestamp":"1736995800.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"saema"},{"comment_id":"1240461","timestamp":"1719878100.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"doesn't look like anyone in this thread had this question in their test?","poster":"gina_the_boss"},{"comment_id":"1167067","upvote_count":"11","content":"Examining = Evaluation\nSpliting = new Features = Feature Engineering\nPicking = Selection = Feature Selection","poster":"MNotABot","timestamp":"1709719380.0"},{"comment_id":"1160920","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"this is helpful. thanks","timestamp":"1719878040.0","comment_id":"1240460","poster":"gina_the_boss"}],"timestamp":"1709061000.0","upvote_count":"11","poster":"Bouncy","content":"Maybe these examples help understanding the different concepts:\n\n Feature Engineering Example: If you have data about a house's width and length, you could create a new feature called \"area\" by multiplying the width and length together.
