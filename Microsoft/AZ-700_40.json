However, configuring the UDRs to redirect traffic between subnets in the same VNET requires additional attention. While using the VNET address range as a target prefix for the UDR is sufficient, this also routes all traffic from one machine to another machine in the same subnet through the Azure Firewall instance. To avoid this, include a route for the subnet in the UDR with a next hop type of VNET. Managing these routes might be cumbersome and prone to error. The recommended method for internal network segmentation is to use Network Security Groups, which don't require UDRs.","poster":"_fvt","timestamp":"1696630200.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"10","comment_id":"868726","timestamp":"1697138160.0","poster":"MrBlueSky","content":"This link and answer are completely irrelevant to the question being asked.\n\nThe question asks about setting up a VM to perform this traffic inspection, not an Azure Firewall.
