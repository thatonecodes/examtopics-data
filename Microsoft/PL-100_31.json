Set the scope of the business rule to All Forms.\n\nThis is incorrect because if you choose All Forms for the scope of your business rule, the business rule will only apply to model-driven app forms and not to canvas apps.

Set the scope of the business rule to Entity.\n\nThis is correct because if you choose Entity for the scope of your business rule, the business rule affects any app or service that uses Common Data Service. If you have a canvas app that uses Common Data Service for its data, then when the canvas app creates or updates a record in Common Data Service, the business rule actions will be applied1. If you choose All Forms or Specific Form, the business rule will only apply to model-driven app forms and not to canvas apps.\n\nD. Use the following condition expression: (OrderType Does not begin with [test]) AND (Modified By Does not contain data)\n\nThis is correct because this condition expression checks if the OrderType field does not start with the prefix test and if the Modified By field is empty.
