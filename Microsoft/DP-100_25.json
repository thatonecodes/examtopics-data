With RAPIDS on Azure Machine Learning service, users can accelerate the entire machine learning pipeline, including data processing, training and inferencing, with GPUs from the NC_v3, NC_v2, ND or ND_v2 families. Users can unlock performance gains of more than 20X (with 4 GPUs), slashing training times from hours to minutes and dramatically reducing time-to-insight.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/sv-se/blog/azure-machine-learning-service-now-supports-nvidia-s-rapids/","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"32","comment_id":"312952","poster":"dev2dev","comments":[{"poster":"aoddy","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1695863760.0","content":"Thanks for your sharing","comment_id":"322279"}],"timestamp":"1694921340.0","content":"answers are correct, for submitting job we can use surface book but due to restrictions we cant install sdk/python"},{"timestamp":"1731777960.0","comment_id":"602635","poster":"ning","upvote_count":"3","content":"The answer should be correct ...\nBut the question is poorly written ...\nI believe it means, you can write python codes on the ds computer instance to submit experiment with script steps against gpu computer instance as target"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"hargur","comment_id":"464983","timestamp":"1713598920.0","content":"on 19Oct2021"},{"poster":"kisskeo","timestamp":"1712258100.0","comment_id":"457324","content":"On Exam 01 Oct 2021","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"snsnsnsn","content":"got similar question on 2/9/21","comment_id":"438290","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1709450760.0"},{"timestamp":"1707668340.0","poster":"VJPrakash","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"423360","content":"on exam in August 2021"}],"exam_id":64,"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYou are preparing to build a deep learning convolutional neural network model for image classification.

In terms of the packages, GPU drivers etc are all there in the DSVM image. Mostly it is for convenience during creation where we only allow DLVM to be created on GPU VM instances on Azure. We also have a few end to end deep learning samples in image, text, audio etc only on the DLVM. If these are not important for your case, it may be just easier to create a Ubuntu DSVM instance.\"","timestamp":"1618323180.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/34397-exam-dp-100-topic-2-question-5-discussion/"},{"id":"b29qulHM5VD1SeAY8FKu","answer":"ABC","topic":"2","isMC":true,"answer_description":"A: You can manage assets and resources in the Azure Machine Learning studio.\nB: The update(min_nodes=None, max_nodes=None, idle_seconds_before_scaledown=None) of the AmlCompute class updates the ScaleSettings for this\nAmlCompute target.\nC: To change the nodes in the cluster, use the UI for your cluster in the Azure portal.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.amlcompute(class)","question_images":[],"answers_community":["ABC (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1615959360,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"ABC","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/47462-exam-dp-100-topic-2-question-50-discussion/","question_id":125,"exam_id":64,"discussion":[{"comments":[{"poster":"chaudha4","timestamp":"1635343380.0","content":"Can you elaborate on \"C\".
