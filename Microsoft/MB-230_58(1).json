These charts also act as visual filters. The visual filters (interactive charts) are based on multiple entities and in the single-stream dashboards, the entity in the data stream defines the visual filter entity. If you click the High Priority Cases circle in the Cases by Priority chart, the dashboard will refresh, to show you only high priority cases. With charts and tiles the service reps will be able to see the changes and patterns in data, and act quickly to address the issues that interest them most.","comment_id":"923149","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Candy2002","timestamp":"1718366280.0"}],"answer":"D","question_id":286,"answer_description":"","question_text":"You are employed as an administrator for your companyâ€™s Dynamics 365 for Customer Service implementation.\n\nYou are currently creating case dashboard.
