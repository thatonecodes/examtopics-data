Subcases must inherit the following fields: customer name, contact email address and case title.\n• Main cases must not be closed until all the sub-cases are closed.\n• Separate groups must be created for each type of service and each phone type. Access to the groups must be restricted to team members that support that service or phone type.\n• When importing from the old system, old cases do not need to be routed to the correct support group.\n\n\nKnowledge base\n-\n\n• Users must be able to search the knowledge base when opening a new case form or when checking on cases.\n• Users must be able to use relevant searches and include any customer entities.\n\n\nDashboards\n-\n\n• Managers must be able to see a real-time list of open cases, open activities, and expiring entitlements all on one page.\n• Managers must also be able to see all open cases, escalated cases and cases by representatives on one screen. Managers must be able to drill down within each area.\n• Managers need a dashboard that displays weekly statistics for cases and representatives.\n• Each representative needs to see their own tickets that are opened for the day, week, and month as well as their closed tickets.\n\n\nService-level agreements\n-\n\n• Most customers must be contacted within 90 minutes of their case being opened.\n• Some customers can purchase faster service on call backs.\n• Emails must be sent to support managers when service-level agreements (SLAs) are missed.\n• Support representatives must be able to see a timer on each case form to ensure they are adhering to their SLAs.\n• SLA KPIs must be tracked in the system.\n• SLA KPIs must appear on the case form.\n• Cases must be able to be placed on hold if issues arise with related contracts.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\nUsers report they are not able to search the Knowledge Base.\n\n\nYou need to create the dashboards.\n\nWhich dashboard types should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate dashboard types to the correct scenario. Each dashboard type may be used once, more than once, or not at all.
