Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.\nAfter you answer a question in this question, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.\nYou are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce 2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data.\nYou must store the device in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future.\nYou need to implement a solution to receive the device data.\nSolution: Provision an Azure Event Hub. Configure the machine identifier as the partition key and enable capture.\nDoes the solution meet the goal?"}],"exam":{"name":"AZ-203","isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":144,"provider":"Microsoft","id":47,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":19},"__N_SSP":true}
