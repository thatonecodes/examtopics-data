One of the most important features is a trusted IPs list. This will allow you to whitelist a range of IPs for your network. This way, when users are in the office, they will not get prompted with MFA, and when they take their devices elsewhere, they will. Here's how to do it:\nLog in to your Azure Portal.\nNavigate to Azure AD > Conditional Access > Named locations.\nFrom the top toolbar select Configure MFA trusted IPs.\nReferences:\nhttps://www.kraftkennedy.com/implementing-azure-multi-factor-authentication/","unix_timestamp":1579731120,"choices":{"A":"From Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), configure organizational relationships.","B":"From the MFA service settings, create a trusted IP range.","D":"From Conditional access in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), create a named location.","C":"From Conditional access in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), create a custom control."},"topic":"16","isMC":true,"exam_id":50,"question_id":115,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[]}],"exam":{"name":"AZ-300","isBeta":false,"provider":"Microsoft","isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":50,"isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":241},"currentPage":23},"__N_SSP":true}
