DDM allows you to define masking rules on specific columns, so that the data in those columns is automatically replaced with a masked value when queried by users without the appropriate permissions.

Dynamic Data Masking. Here’s why:\n\nDynamic Data Masking (DDM)\nPurpose: DDM helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access by masking the data at the query result level. This means that non-privileged users will only see masked data (e.g., partially hidden) instead of the actual PII.\n\nImplementation: It dynamically hides the PII, which is ideal for ensuring that only authorized users can view the full, unmasked data.\n\nWhy not the others?\n\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC)\nRBAC controls who has access to the database but doesn’t directly mask or hide PII.\n\nData Discovery & Classification\nThis helps you identify and classify sensitive data, but it doesn't restrict access to PII.\n\nTransparent Data Encryption (TDE)\nTDE protects data at rest by encrypting the database files. It doesn’t prevent privileged users from viewing the data once they have access to the database.","comment_id":"1300802","poster":"MeisAdriano","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729495680.0"},{"content":"This question was in the exam, August 2024.
