It returns an MLTable object.\n\n-In Azure Machine Learning, when you have a folder containing an MLTable file along with data files (like file1.txt, file2.txt), the MLTable file serves as a configuration file that describes how to load and parse the data. You should load the directory containing the MLTable file, not the MLTable file itself.","poster":"jojashi","comment_id":"1221469","timestamp":"1732964640.0"},{"comment_id":"1218513","poster":"sl_mslconsulting","content":"Correct.

The Correct answer is: load, ./sample_data/MLTable\n\nThe Python SDK v2 code is for the purpose of materializing data into a Pandas data frame using an MLTable folder as a blueprint. \nMaterialization in this context refers to the process of loading data from various sources and formats into a Pandas data frame which can be used for data analysis and model training within Python.\n\nGiven the context and the folder structure in the default datastore of workspace1, the MLTable folder should contain the blueprint for materialization, which includes information about how to read the data and convert it into a format suitable for machine learning tasks.\n\nTherefore, to complete the Python SDK v2 code to use the MLTable folder as the materialization blueprint, you would use the load method on the mltable object, and specify the path to the MLTable folder, which is ./sample_data/MLTable. This path points to the MLTable folder in the sample_data directory, which is expected to contain the MLTable file that defines the data to be materialized into a Pandas data frame.","comment_id":"1109606","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"load and . sample data MLTable","poster":"phdykd","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1706280480.0","comment_id":"963725"},{"content":"Correct.\nimport mltable\n\n# load the previously saved MLTable file\ntbl = mltable.load(\"./titanic/\")\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-mltable?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=cli","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1705263600.0","comment_id":"951751","poster":"damaldon"}],"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nYou manage an Azure Machine Learning workspace named workspace1 by using the Python SDK v2.\n\nThe default datastore of workspace1 contains a folder named sample_data.
