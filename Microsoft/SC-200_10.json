Litware also has remote users located across the United States. To access Litware resources, including cloud resources, the remote users establish a VPN connection to either office.\n\n\nExisting Environment\n-\n\n\nIdentity Environment\n-\n\nThe network contains an Active Directory forest named litware.com that syncs to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named litware.com.\n\n\nMicrosoft 365 Environment\n-\n\nLitware has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription linked to the litware.com Azure AD tenant. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is deployed to all computers that run Windows 10. All Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps built-in anomaly detection policies are enabled.\n\n\nAzure Environment\n-\n\nLitware has an Azure subscription linked to the litware.com Azure AD tenant. The subscription contains resources in the East US Azure region as shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nNetwork Environment\n-\n\nEach Litware office connects directly to the internet and has a site-to-site VPN connection to the virtual networks in the Azure subscription.\n\n\nOn-premises Environment\n-\n\nThe on-premises network contains the computers shown in the following table.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\n\nCurrent Problems\n-\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps frequently generates false positive alerts when users connect to both offices simultaneously.\n\nPlanned Changes and Requirements\n\n\nPlanned Changes\n-\n\nLitware plans to implement the following changes:\n\n• Create and configure Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure subscription.\n• Validate Microsoft Sentinel functionality by using Azure AD test user accounts.\n\n\nBusiness Requirements\n-\n\nLitware identifies the following business requirements:\n\n• The principle of least privilege must be used whenever possible.\n• Costs must be minimized, as long as all other requirements are met.\n• Logs collected by Log Analytics must provide a full audit trail of user activities.\n• All domain controllers must be protected by using Microsoft Defender for Identity.\n\nAzure Information Protection Requirements\n\nAll files that have sensitivity labels and are stored on the Windows 10 computers must be available from the Azure Information Protection – Data discovery dashboard.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint Requirements\n\nAll Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps unsanctioned apps must be blocked on the Windows 10 computers by using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps Security Requirements\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps must identify whether a user connection is anomalous based on tenant-level data.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Requirements\n\nAll servers must send logs to the same Log Analytics workspace.\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel Requirements\n\nLitware must meet the following Microsoft Sentinel requirements:\n\n• Integrate Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.\n• Ensure that a user named admin1 can configure Microsoft Sentinel playbooks.\n• Create a Microsoft Sentinel analytics rule based on a custom query. The rule must automatically initiate the execution of a playbook.\n• Add notes to events that represent data access from a specific IP address to provide the ability to reference the IP address when navigating through an investigation graph while hunting.\n• Create a test rule that generates alerts when inbound access to Microsoft Office 365 by the Azure AD test user accounts is detected. Alerts generated by the rule must be grouped into individual incidents, with one incident per test user account.\n\n\nYou need to configure DC1 to meet the business requirements.\n\nWhich three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.\n\n//IMG//","answers_community":[]},{"id":"wiF3AjGNgmQUyIroDiGk","unix_timestamp":1696321560,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1696849440.0","poster":"SenorConsultant","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTested in content search in the purview portal. \n\nproject1(c:c)(date=2023-02-01..2023-02-10)\n\nThis is the correct syntax for KQL content search in Purview, and searches for keyword \"project1\" in selected team, and between said dates.","upvote_count":"12","comment_id":"1028778"},{"comment_id":"1169080","upvote_count":"8","timestamp":"1709928960.0","content":"KQL (Kusto Query Language) != KQL(Keyword Query Language)\nI hate MS.","poster":"ostralo"},{"timestamp":"1740574740.0","comment_id":"1361923","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer.
