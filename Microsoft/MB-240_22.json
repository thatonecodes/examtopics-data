Yes\n\nThe solution meets the goal. By creating a Requirement Resource Preference record with the Preference Type set to \"Restricted\" and linking it to the Adventure Works account, you ensure that the specified resource is prevented from being scheduled to work orders for Adventure Works. The restriction is account-specific, meaning the resource remains available for scheduling with other accounts, which aligns with the requirement. Additionally, setting an expiration date of four months from today (February 21, 2025, making it June 21, 2025) provides a time-bound restriction, after which the preference will no longer apply, though the requirement does not specify a need for permanence or temporariness.
