They operate in the cities (and surrounding metropolitan areas) of Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Houston, and Seattle.\n\nThese grooming services are offered as packages at multiple price points, such as \"basic bath\" for $50 and \"premium bath with nail trim\" for $75.\n\nContoso also sells branded merchandise (hats, shirts, etc.) and dog accessories (toys, leashes, collars, etc.) through its own eCommerce website.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Customer Service\n\nContoso maintains a single contact center from which its customer service agents book appointments and handle customer complaints for each geographic market Contoso serves.\n\nCustomer service agents use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service to document inbound customer booking inquiries and complaints that are received via phone call, text message and web chat.\n\nCustomer service agents schedule grooming appointments using a third-party, web-based scheduling application.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Marketing\n\nThe marketing team manages an informational website and is responsible for running campaigns through web advertising platforms and social media channels. The marketing team also produces a weekly email newsletter that contains educational content relevant to dog owners as well as promotions for Contoso’s services and products.\n\nContoso uses a third-party marketing automation platform to send email and SMS messages to customers. These communications currently include:\n\n1. All unique email addresses from the booking system, ecommerce system and Dynamics 365 Customer Service receive the weekly email newsletter described above. The same customer will receive multiple emails if the customer is associated with different email addresses in different systems.\n2. Customers receive SMS reminders the day before a scheduled grooming appointment.\n3. Each customer who purchases grooming services is sent an email with a link to a satisfaction survey on the first Tuesday following the grooming appointment. The survey link is the same for all customers, and the survey requires customers to enter their names, phone numbers and (optionally) email addresses as part of the submission.\n\nCustomer Service and Marketing Overview. Challenges\n\nCurrently, the customer service team does not have any way to relate survey responses back to individual customer records in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service.\n\nThe marketing team cannot access customer feedback data collected by the customer service team. Both the customer service team and marketing team cannot access any data from the ecommerce system.\n\n\nBusiness Objectives -\n\nContoso business leadership identifies three major objectives to address by the end of the current fiscal year:\n\n1. Improve customer retention - Current customer attrition rates exceed 40 percent each month.\n2. Maximize customer value for services - The leadership team believes customer service agents should be upselling more customers on premium grooming packages. The leadership team is also considering partnering with other organizations to offer related services like dog training and dog walking to its existing customers.\n3. Maximize customer value for merchandise and accessory sales - Fewer than five percent of grooming customers have ever made a purchase from the ecommerce site. The leadership team believes there are significant opportunities for new revenue by increasing ecommerce sales.\n\n\nProject Overview. Overview -\n\nThe customer service and marketing leaders believes a Microsoft Customer Data Platform will help achieve Contoso’s business objectives.\n\nThe information technology (IT) team starts a pilot implementation of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights.\n\n\nProject Overview. Pilot Project -\n\nThe pilot implementation will use the following sources of data from Contoso's operational systems:\n\n• Bookings - Customer demographic data and completed grooming appointments\n• Web purchases - Customer demographic data and ecommerce purchases totals summarized by customer, type (branded merchandise or accessories) and date\n• Survey responses - Respondent demographic data and response data\n• Customer interactions - Customer demographic data, interaction history (phone calls, emails, web chat), customer feedback, and inquiries\n\nThere is no common customer key across the different data sources, and none of the customer tables store customer keys from the other sources. Every table in a specific data source can be associated back to a customer record from the same data source using the corresponding customer's primary key.\n\nWhen managing system refreshes, Contoso requires data refreshes to begin within one hour of the scheduled arrival time for flat-file sources.\n\nNo Microsoft Azure storage services have been provisioned in support of the project, but the Customer Data Platform specialist may request the provisioning of any Azure services necessary to achieve the stated business objectives.\n\nThe goal of the pilot project is to demonstrate that Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights will provide marketing and customer service users with relevant data and insights. These data and insights will allow users to reduce churn, increase services revenue, and increase eCommerce spend.\n\n\nData Sources. Bookings -\n\nThis data source consists of two Parquet files that are uploaded to a secure file transport protocol (SFTP) site at noon (12 PM) and midnight (12 AM) every day.\n\n1. Customers.parquet - customer id (primary key), name, customer physical address, city, state, postal code, phone number, residence type (“house”, “apartment”, etc.), email address\n2. Appointments.parquet - appointment id (primary key), customer id, dog name, dog breed, appointment datetime, appointment price, grooming package name (“basic bath”, “premium bath”, etc.)\n\n\nData Sources. Web Purchases -\n\nThis data source consists of two CSV files that are programmatically uploaded to a SFTP site at midnight every day.\n\n1. WebCustomers.csv - customer id (primary key), name, customer address, city, state, postal code, phone number, email address\n2. TransactionTotals.csv - transaction id (primary key), customer id, merchandise total price, accessories total price, transaction datetime\n\n\nData Sources. Survey Responses -\n\nThis data source consists of two JSON files that are programmatically uploaded to a Microsoft SharePoint folder container at 6 PM every Friday.\n\n1. Respondents.json - customer id (primary key), name, phone number, email address\n2. Responses.json - response id (primary key), customer id, satisfaction score (1-5), comments, response date\n\nNote: The satisfaction survey asks for a single satisfaction score on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 meaning extremely dissatisfied and 5 meaning extremely satisfied. Respondents may optionally include comments.\n\nData Sources. Customer Interactions\n\nThis data source consists of a connection to data from the Contoso Dynamics 365 Customer Service application through a Microsoft Dataverse managed data lake. The relevant tables are all system tables.\n\n1. Contacts - all system attributes are available\n2. Activities - all system attributes are available\n3. Cases (Incidents) - all system attributes are available\n\nNote: Customer inquiries and feedback are stored as case (incident) records in the customer service application. Inquiries are tracked using the standard “question” case type value, and feedback are tracked using the standard “problem” case type value.\n\n\nThe IT manager at Contoso wants to extend Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights using Microsoft Power Platform.\n\nBased on the data available in the pilot implementation, you need to provide the requirement that can be satisfied using out-of-the-box Power Platform capabilities.\n\nWhat should you recommend?","unix_timestamp":1717923960,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-06-09 11:06:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733742360.0","comment_id":"1227205","content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorrect","poster":"DaniMondu"}],"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"choices":{"C":"Use Microsoft Power Automate to post a Microsoft Teams message when the number of members in a segment falls below a certain threshold.","B":"Use a canvas app to show interests from the out-of-the-box Microsoft enrichment source.","A":"Use a canvas app to show mobile groomers a list of survey score responses and dates.","D":"Use Microsoft Power Automate to post a Microsoft Teams message when average daily revenue for collar purchases exceeds $500."}},{"id":"IuukkekI9795TRINyQjN","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-04-10 08:32:00","choices":{"A":"Update a customer's predicted churn score.","C":"Define a new measure for total accessory spend.","E":"Add a new data source to be ingested.","D":"Delete an existing data source.","B":"Update a customer's residence type."},"exam_id":79,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/138290-exam-mb-260-topic-1-question-12-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1712730720,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["BCD (75%)","BCE (25%)"],"answer_ET":"BCD","topic":"1","question_id":3,"answer":"BCD","question_images":[],"question_text":"Case study -\n\nThis is a case study.

The AdventureWorks Cycles business model supports both in-store purchases, as well as online orders. In addition to offering a wide variety of bicycles, the company sells clothing, performance nutrition supplements, and bicycle parts. The company also offers bicycle fitting and repair services.\n\nThe customer base varies from professional cyclists, individual leisure riders to families. The business recently experienced unprecedented growth of over 2000 percent, bringing the total number of customers to 10,000. The company decided to invest in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights and Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app to unify customer data and improve sales.\n\nData Sources. ADVCUSTOMERS Common Data Model Folder\n\nAdventureWorks uses Microsoft Azure Data Factory pipelines to export demographic data from its customer loyalty, ecommerce and cycling club membership management systems to a Common Data Model (CDM) folder named ADVCUSTOMERS that is stored in a Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen 2 container named ADVDEMO9345 in the West USA region.\n\nThe following list describes the entities in this CDM folder:\n• LoyaltyMember - contains customer profile information associated with in-store purchases. o It includes the following attributes: srcid (primary key), firstname, lastname, fullname, addressstreet, city, postalcode, state, homephone, emailaddress, datecreated, timestamp\n• EcommerceCustomer - contains customer profile information from online purchases. o It includes the following attributes: ecid (primary key), firstname, last name, fullname, emailaddress, homephone, streetaddress, city, postalcode, state, datecreated, timestamp\n• ClubMember - contains profile information for cycling club members. o It includes the following attributes: ccic (primary key) fullname, emailaddress, streetaddress1, city, postal_code, state, datecreated, timestamp\n• SurveyResponse - contains customer satisfaction scores on a scale from 1-10 (1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied). o It includes the following attributes: svid (primary key), emailaddress, responsedate, score.\n\nData Sources. WEBSTATS Common Data Model Folder\n\nAdventureWorks’ website page views for authenticated ecommerce customers and cycling club members are stored in a CDM folder named WEBSTATS that is stored in an Azure Data Lake Gen 2 container named WEBDATA119 in the Central US region.\n\nThis folder contains an entity named PageViews that includes the following fields: emailaddress, pageurl. visitdate, productcategory.\n\nData Sources. Additional Information\n\nAdventureWorks uses Dynamics 365 Sales as its sales CRM application, and its data is stored in Microsoft Dataverse.\n\nCycling club event logistics and member attendance are managed in an Azure SQL database. Attendance is tracked in a single table named EventAttendee that includes the following fields: emailaddress, eventdate, eventaddress, eventcity, eventstate, eventpostalcode, lastupdated (timestamp).\n\nThe ClubMember entity contains records of existing customers, as well as individuals who have not made a purchase from AdventureWorks. There are approximately 500,000 records in this entity, and there are approximately 5 million records in the EventAttendee table.\n\n\nCurrent Configuration -\n\nAdventureWorks currently has a single Dynamics 365 Customer Insights environment. This environment is named ADWProd, and it is configured as a B-to-C production environment in the West USA region.\n\nThe following data sources have been configured:\n1. To ingest the LoyaltyMember, EcommerceCustomer and ClubMember entities described in the Data Sources section of this case study.\n2. For Dynamics 365 Sales contact records using a Dataverse managed data lake connector.\n3. For the EventAttendee table using a Power Query connection.\n\nProfile unification has been configured to perform map, match and merge for non-primary key attributes with identical semantic types from the LoyaltyMember, EcommerceCustomer and ClubMember entities. Creation dates and timestamps were intentionally left unmapped. Some additional attributes were accidentally excluded from the merge process. These attributes are listed in the Pain Points section of this case study.\n\nThe search and filter index has been configured to include FullName, City, State and PhoneNumber as search fields. The State field is enabled tor filtering based on frequency and will show up to 10 options.\n\nAll members of the AdventureWorks marketing team have been granted access to the ADWProd environment.\n\n\nPain Points -\n\nThe AdventureWorks leadership team has identified several issues that need to be addressed to support current growth and ensure customer satisfaction.\n\n1. Attributes for first name and postal code were included in the mapping process, but they were accidentally excluded from the merge process.\n2. Multiple copies of printed catalogs are being sent to members of the same household resulting in wasted printing and mailing costs.\n3. A segment export to Dynamics 365 Sales has been configured, but the sales team reports the associated marketing lists has zero members.\n4. Ingesting the EventAttendee table takes significantly longer than ingesting any other data source, and it causes significant delays for completion of scheduled refreshes.\n\n\nGoals and Objectives -\n\n1. The marketing team wants to start hosting invitation-only webinars to promote upcoming product launches. Invitations for these webinars should be restricted to customers who have responded favorably to a customer satisfaction survey.\n2. The marketing team wants to email coupons to customers based on the types of products they view on the AdventureWorks website.\n3. The IT operations team wants to minimize the amount of time required to complete a scheduled refresh.\n\n\nDetailed Requirements -\n\n1. Only one copy of a catalog should be sent per household. AdventureWorks defines a household as all customers who share the same last name, street address, city and state.\n2. Sales users are expected to call customers who are included in the loyalty system but do not have a populated email address in the loyalty system.\n3. All marketing emails must include the customer's first name in the subject field, if it is available in the source data.\n4. Marketing team members must be able to search for customer profiles in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights by full name, email address, phone number, city, state, and postal code.\n5. All members of the marketing team who can access a production Dynamics 365 Customer Insights environment should also have access to its corresponding testing environment.\n6.
