Agents communicate once every 50 hours.\n\nYou need to create a Microsoft Defender XDR custom detection rule that will identify compromised devices and establish a pattern of communication.

Here’s why: Once you create and run the rule for the first time, it will, by default, check for the last 30 days. This means we can already scan the past 14 days as stated in the question.\n\nNow, if we choose Option A, which is a 12-hour interval, it checks every 12 hours and scans back 48 hours. This is less than the 50 hours of the Command and Control (C&C), making it the most balanced option. Therefore, I would choose Option A.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/custom-detection-rules"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1460599","timestamp":"1743761220.0","poster":"Optimizor_IT","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSet detection frequency to “Every hour” in the custom detection rule wizard (Step 2: Rule settings > Frequency).\nLookback period = 14 days ensures all devices from the past 14 days are identified.\n1-hour frequency minimizes identification time (max delay = 1 hour vs. 50-hour C2 cycle), meeting the “minimize how long” requirement.\nWhy Not Others?\nA (12 hours): 12-hour delay—too slow for timely C2 response.\nB (24 hours): 24-hour delay—misses half a day, risking escalation.\nC (3 hours): 3-hour delay—better, but still triples the wait vs. hourly."},{"comment_id":"1354027","timestamp":"1739121540.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"comment_id":"1354028","content":"I meant to Click A sorry","timestamp":"1739121540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Edindude"}],"content":"Selected Answer: B\nUsing a 24-hour detection frequency would certainly work, but it might not be the most efficient choice for your scenario. Here’s why:\n\nCommunication Pattern: Since the agents communicate once every 50 hours, setting the detection frequency to 24 hours may result in delayed identification of the compromised devices. There's a chance you might miss an entire communication window and only catch it on the next cycle, effectively identifying devices every 72 hours.\n\nBalance Between Timeliness and Efficiency: A 12-hour frequency strikes a better balance. It ensures that you have more frequent checks without significantly increasing the load on your system. This means that even if you miss one communication window, you're likely to catch it on the next 12-hour cycle, improving your chances of timely detection.\n\nChoosing a 12-hour frequency helps ensure more timely detection and a better understanding of the communication pattern while maintaining efficiency.
