My understanding with this question is, submitting a support ticket request is different then \"open a new support request\" as asked in question, (i.e Technical support) and I think opening a support would be for Technical purpose or for who is able to open a case. As mentioned on the link, provided in the answer, the ability to submit as many support request ticket is included in Basic subscription and others too. However, in Azure portal Help+support blade -> features Technical support and Who can open cases, doesn't exist in Basic subscription.","timestamp":"1634746200.0","poster":"ccessex"},{"comment_id":"428094","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1629459960.0","content":"Correct answer should be D, you can create a new support request for all support plan, but you donot have 24/7 access to technical support by email and phone for only BASIC \nPlan, the question is for SUPPORT REQUEST, so D should be the correct answer.","poster":"Gbase"},{"timestamp":"1626267840.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"406232","content":"Answer is D => in Basic you \"Ability to submit as many support tickets as you need\" => copy/pasted from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/plans/\n\nRest of the plans deliver even more support, except for free.

You could open a 'technical request' with basic (I think) - I see the option however you wouldn't get 'support' for your 'request' without upgrade. This is a 'ticket' or 'request' - a ticket is fundamental. A tech 'support' scenario would involve a 'case' which then falls under 'technical support' and requires a paid subscription. You also don't get 24/7 email/phone support unless you pay. So the answer is that you can open a support request with ANY plan including basic.
