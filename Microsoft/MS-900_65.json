You can educate your users about DLP policies and help them remain compliant without blocking their work. For example, if a user tries to share a document containing sensitive information, a DLP policy can both send them an email notification and show them a policy tip in the context of the document library that allows them to override the policy if they have a business justification. The same policy tips also appear in Outlook on the web, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.\nIf you find that users are incorrectly marking content as false positive and bypassing the DLP policy, you can configure the policy to not allow user overrides.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/data-loss-prevention-policies","upvote_count":"5","poster":"SuperDC"}],"unix_timestamp":1683919260,"answer_ET":"","exam_id":113,"timestamp":"2023-05-12 21:21:00","isMC":false,"answer_description":"","question_id":321,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"HOTSPOT\n-\n\nInstructions: For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true.

This can include something the user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a smart card), or something the user is (such as a fingerprint). MFA provides an additional layer of security to protect against unauthorized access.\n\nJust-in-time (JIT) access: This solution provides temporary access to resources only when needed. JIT access can be used to grant access to users who require it for a specific task or time period. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and limit the exposure of sensitive data.\n\nBlock legacy authentication: This solution blocks authentication requests that use legacy protocols such as POP, IMAP, and SMTP.
