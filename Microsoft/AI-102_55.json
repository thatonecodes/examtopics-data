Here's why adding examples to the None intent is the right approach:\n\nNone Intent: The None intent is designed to capture user inputs that fall outside of the other specified intents in your model. By training the None intent with examples of irrelevant or unrelated requests, you teach the model to recognize and appropriately handle spurious queries that do not align with its capabilities.
