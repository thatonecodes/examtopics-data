Managed apps (apps that you've included on the Protected apps list in your WIP policy) are allowed to access your enterprise data and will interact differently when used with unallowed, non-enterprise aware, or personal-only apps. For example, if WIP management is set to Block, your employees can copy and paste from one protected app to another protected app, but not to personal apps. Imagine an HR person wants to copy a job description from a protected app to the internal career website, an enterprise-protected location, but makes a mistake and tries to paste into a personal app instead. The paste action fails and a notification pops up, saying that the app couldn't paste because of a policy restriction. The HR person then correctly pastes to the career website without a problem.\nBut I just could not find the option within the policy itself.
