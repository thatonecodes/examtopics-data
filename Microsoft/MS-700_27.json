The Guest access settings primarily control the overall permissions and capabilities of guest users within the Teams environment, such as their ability to create and manage teams, channels, and chat.\n\nTo achieve the goal of preventing guest users from using cameras during Teams meetings, you would need to utilize more granular settings or policies. In this case, you can achieve this goal by using Microsoft 365 or Azure Active Directory policies.\n\nOne possible solution could involve creating a Teams meeting policy that applies specifically to guest users and restricts their ability to use cameras. You can then assign this policy to guest users in Azure Active Directory.","timestamp":"1714284660.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"r2c3po","comment_id":"1203390"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorrect","comment_id":"617677","timestamp":"1655464020.0","poster":"Vic_W","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\ncorrect answer is A","comment_id":"536236","poster":"certgreed","timestamp":"1643553960.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1623250080.0","content":"Org-wide settings, guest access, turn off the IP video","comment_id":"378374","upvote_count":"3","poster":"TMW"}],"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Yes","B":"No"},"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"MAqUdpHNZDkHcOJNS4q9","answers_community":[],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04322/0008200001.png"],"discussion":[{"poster":"mac_ms","timestamp":"1691931900.0","comment_id":"546521","content":"Correct.
