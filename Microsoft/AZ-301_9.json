Answer NO\n3- This part is not too clear at first as the diagram doesn't really show boundaries so it is hard to know where the SQL database sits exactly but we know there is no service endpoint, so traffic will follow the default route. The default route is to the NVA which seems to connect to expressroute connection and not the internet - it seems like there is no internet gateway at all.
