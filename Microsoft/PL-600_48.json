However, the requirement states that inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed. This implies that there could be multiple images for different inspection steps within a single inspection order.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, creates a relationship within the Inspection Order table to the originating inspection order, which allows linking the new inspection order (created for re-inspection) to the original one. This way, the photos taken during the previously failed inspection can be accessed and viewed in the new inspection order, resolving the issue reported during testing.","timestamp":"1684265160.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"696493","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is probably correct.\nIf answer was B, the solution would be so broken that it is very unlikely that this issue would be raised ahead of more serious ones.\nIt all depends on how the photos are being stored.","poster":"petertwilliams","timestamp":"1665949980.0"},{"content":"Users should be able to upload multiple files, therefore the relationship is either not created, or testers do not have access to that table","comment_id":"610488","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1654157220.0","upvote_count":"3"}],"question_images":[],"answers_community":["B (87%)","13%"],"timestamp":"2022-06-02 10:07:00","answer_ET":"B","topic":"9","unix_timestamp":1654157220,"answer_description":""},{"id":"4XhwmMEE008GdQw0CFUV","choices":{"C":"in a separate Microsoft Dataverse environment in the same instance as the Dynamics 365 Field Service environment","D":"in a separate Dataverse environment with Dynamics 365 apps enabled","B":"within the default Dynamics 365 Field Service environment","A":"within the Dynamics 365 Field Service environment"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/80336-exam-pl-600-topic-9-question-7-discussion/","question_text":"You need to recommend an environment for the inspection solution.\nWhere should you recommend installing the solution?","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-09-05 15:10:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1662383400,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA and that's it.
