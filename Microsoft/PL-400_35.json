Examples of confidential clients are web apps, other web APIs, or service-type and daemon-type applications. Credentials allow your application to authenticate as itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime.\nYou can add both certificates and client secrets (a string) as credentials to your confidential client app registration.\nStep 3: Create the application user in Dataverse using the Application User form.\nApp registration can also be done by an application developer or individual user who is building a client application to connect to and read/write data in Dataverse.\nUse the Application ID and Redirect URI values from your registered app in your client application's authentication code to be able to connect to Dataverse environment from your client application, and perform the required operations. Note that if the app is registered in the same tenant as your Dataverse environment, you won't be presented with a consent form when connecting from your client application to your Dataverse environment.\nNote: When end users use the ISV's application for the first time to connect to their Dataverse environment by providing their Dataverse credentials, a consent form is presented to the end user. After consenting to use their Dataverse account with the ISV's application, end users can connect to Dataverse environment from external application. The consent form is not displayed again to other users after the first user who has already consented to use the ISV's app. Apps registered in Azure Active Directory are multi-tenant, which implies that other Dataverse users from other tenant can connect to their environment using the ISV's app.\nStep 4: Assign a security role to the application user in Dataverse\nGrant access to users that already have a Dynamics 365 license\nAny user who already has a license for any model-driven app in Dynamics 365 also will be able to access Dynamics 365 Marketing without requiring any additional licenses.
