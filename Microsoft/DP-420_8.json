It ensures monotonic reads, monotonic writes, and read-your-own-writes for requests within the same session.\n\nWhile Strong (A) and Bounded Staleness (B) offer higher consistency guarantees than Session, they tend to use more RUs, potentially reducing throughput. Eventual (default) and Consistent Prefix (D) have higher throughput but offer weaker consistency guarantees compared to Session."},{"poster":"szkielet","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nConsistent Prefix: Consistent prefix guarantees that all reads will see writes in the order they were made. It's the strongest consistency level that still allows for high throughput.

Session, consistent prefix and eventual do single replica reads. The result is that, for the same number of request units, read throughput for strong and bounded staleness is half of the other consistency levels.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels#consistency-levels-and-throughput","poster":"[Removed]"},{"content":"Answer is D - Consistent preffix. \nWhy ? We need to provide the highest consistency guarantees without decreasing throughput.
