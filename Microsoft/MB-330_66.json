The exporter is selected from the vendor list and associated with the voyage record (Landed cost > Voyages > Create voyage > Exporter field). This meets the requirement of capturing \"exporter details for every shipment.\" --> Compliance: Voyages store compliance-related data, such as exporter details, ports of origin, and destinations, which aligns with international trade regulations.--> Reporting: The system allows reporting on voyages, including exporter information, via Voyage status reports: Filter by exporter to see all shipments handled by each.
