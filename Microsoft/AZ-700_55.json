NSG rules applied to the subnet hosting the private endpoint are not applied to the private endpoint. They are applied only to other endpoints (For example: network interface controllers). A limited workaround for this issue is to implement your access rules for private endpoints on the source subnets, though this approach may require a higher management overhead.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1638544500.0","poster":"Pravda"},{"comment_id":"479458","poster":"walkwolf3","upvote_count":"6","content":"Yes, Yes, Yes - lab tested\n\nNSG rules applied to the subnet hosting the private endpoint are not applied to the private endpoint.So the NSG1 doesn't limit storage access from either VM1 or VM2.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-private-endpoints#network-security-group-rules-for-subnets-with-private-endpoints","timestamp":"1637076660.0","comments":[{"content":"that is correct. even clients from outside the VNET can access the resource \"This approach enables access to the storage account using the same connection string for clients on the VNet hosting the private endpoints, as well as clients outside the VNet.\"","timestamp":"1657723440.0","poster":"rac_sp","comment_id":"630946","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"content":"Answer should be 3 yes.
