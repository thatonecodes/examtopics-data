By working with these prerelease builds, insiders can share feedback with the company to help it fix bugs and smooth over the rough spots before an update hits the general public.\nIn the current model, Microsoft offers three rings: Fast, Slow, and Release Preview. The Fast ring is for Windows Insiders who want updates the fastest and are willing to put up with more bugs and glitches. The Slow ring is for those who'd rather wait for more stable updates. The Preview Release ring is the most stable of the three and is geared toward people who want to get an upcoming major Windows update before it's released to the public.\nReference:\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-microsoft-is-changing-its-windows-insider-program","isMC":true,"answer":"D","topic":"5"},{"id":"W0W1jSezqhhkvmdsauQB","isMC":false,"question_text":"HOTSPOT -\nYour network contains an Active Directory domain.
