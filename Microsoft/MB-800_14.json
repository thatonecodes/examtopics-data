The company wants to streamline the item accrual process. By enabling Expected Cost Posting, the system will automatically post expected costs to the general ledger when items are received, even if the invoice has not been received yet.\n\nThis feature helps the accounting team by simplifying the accrual process, making it more efficient and less time-consuming, and reducing the need for manual intervention.
