These updates are optional, cumulative, non-security preview releases known as C releases. These releases are only offered to the most recent, supported versions of Windows.\nIncorrect:\n* Non-security releases\n\nQuality updates -\nQuality updates are provided on a monthly schedule, as two types of releases:\n1. Non-security releases\n2. Combined security + non-security releases\nNon-security releases provide IT admins an opportunity for early validation of that content prior to the combined release. Releases can also be provided outside of the monthly schedule when there is an exceptional need.\n* OOB releases\nOut-of-band (OOB) releases might be provided to fix a recently identified issue or vulnerability. They are used in atypical cases when an issue is detected and cannot wait for the next monthly release, because devices must be updated immediately to address security vulnerabilities or to resolve a quality issue impacting many devices.\n* B releases\nMost people are familiar with what is commonly referred to as Patch Tuesday or Update Tuesday.×’â‚¬â€°These updates are released on the second Tuesday of each month, and are known as the×’â‚¬â€°B release (where ×’â‚¬B×’â‚¬×’â‚¬â€°refers to the second week in the month). B releases are typically published at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (PST/\nPDT).\nBecause they are cumulative, B releases include both new and previously released security fixes, along with non-security content introduced in the prior month's\nPreview C release (see the next section). These updates help keep Windows devices secure and compliant by deploying stability fixes and addressing security vulnerabilities. B releases are mandatory.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/quality-updates","exam_id":113,"answer_ET":"","topic":"1","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04260/0016500002.jpg"],"question_id":76,"unix_timestamp":1662042540,"answer":"","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1668824880.0","poster":"DarthWampa","comment_id":"721730","upvote_count":"20","content":"I had a very difficult time finding references for these terms.
