This simply means preventing all non Windows programs and services from starting so the system is running more cleanly and no third party software is launched on boot. Here is how to perform a clean boot of\nWindows with a few extra options for making sure normal booting is as clean as possible.\n1. Click Start and type msconfig into the search box or press Win key+R to show the Run dialog and type msconfig.\n2. With the System Configuration (msconfig) window open, go to the Services tab and put a tick in the ג€Hide all Microsoft servicesג€ box at the bottom left before hitting Disable all. As a lot of software installs system services you need to disable them too and letting Windows load all its services and only stopping those from third parties will mean the operating system itself will run normally.\n\n\nBox 2: Task Manager -\nDisabling Startup Programs in Windows 10 or 8 or 8.1\nWindows 8, 8.1, and 10 make it really simple to disable startup applications. All you have to do is open up Task Manager by right-clicking on the Taskbar, or using the CTRL + SHIFT + ESC shortcut key, clicking ג€More Details,ג€ switching to the Startup tab, and then using the Disable button.\n\nReference:\nhttps://www.raymond.cc/blog/disable-third-party-services-and-programs-for-clean-boot-in-windows/","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04292/0051200001.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04292/0051300001.png","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04292/0051400001.jpg"],"isMC":false,"unix_timestamp":1665585480,"answer":""},{"id":"udgTYaZegIx6qktgCILQ","exam_id":95,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","choices":{"B":"Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth","A":"chkdsk /c c:","D":"chkntfs /c c:","C":"Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup"},"unix_timestamp":1662510000,"question_id":385,"timestamp":"2022-09-07 02:20:00","answer_description":"","answers_community":["B (83%)","C (17%)"],"isMC":true,"question_text":"You are troubleshooting a Windows 10 device that fails to install updates from Windows Update.\nYou discover that some files in the component store are corrupt.\nYou need to resolve the issue to ensure that you can install the updates.\nWhich command should you run?","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/80770-exam-md-100-topic-5-question-93-discussion/","topic":"5","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1679055780.0","poster":"ExamTopics1_EIS","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/clean-up-the-winsxs-folder?view=windows-11","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"841965"},{"comment_id":"714123","content":"B is correct \nhttps://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-dism-command-line-utility-repair-windows-10-image","timestamp":"1667942400.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Princee450"},{"comment_id":"688910","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1665178080.0","poster":"Szaier","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1664197140.0","poster":"AUP123","comment_id":"679764","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth\nJust tested"},{"poster":"AUP123","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1663606740.0","comment_id":"673484","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct"},{"poster":"Kock","upvote_count":"4","content":"DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth\n\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/troubleshoot/windows-server/deployment/fix-windows-update-errors","timestamp":"1662510000.0","comment_id":"661779"}]}],"exam":{"name":"MD-100","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":95,"provider":"Microsoft","isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":398,"isMCOnly":false,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":77},"__N_SSP":true}
