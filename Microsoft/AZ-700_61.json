By creating a service endpoint policy, you can specify which storage accounts are allowed to be accessed from the virtual network, while blocking access to other storage accounts.\n\nIn this case, you can create a service endpoint policy that allows access to storage1 and associate it with the virtual network containing VM1 and VM2. This will ensure that VM1 and VM2 can only connect to storage1 and will be prevented from accessing any other storage accounts.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure that storage1 is accessible from the internet, you can configure the storage account's networking settings to allow public access. This can be done by enabling the appropriate settings such as allowing public access to blobs or enabling a public endpoint.\n\nUsing a network security group (NSG) would not provide the required granular control over specific storage accounts. A private link or private endpoint would enable private access to the storage account but would not allow access from the internet, which is a requirement in this scenario.
