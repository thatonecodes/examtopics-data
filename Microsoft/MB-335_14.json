None are owned by commercial customers.\n\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nEngineering -\n\n• The engineering manager plans to phase out production of the current steel frames and replace them with aluminum frames.\n• Innovation engineers observe an increase in consumer requests for lifted-style golf carts. ModelB will be used to create a prototype of a newer version.\n\n\nProduction -\n\n• Golf cart frames for all models must be configured as subassemblies.\n• The engineering team plans for the lift kit shocks and struts to be assembled for the prototype as a single production order for the lift kit finished good. The lift kit will remain at the end of the assembly line for the prototype.\n• The QA team must conduct a rigorous set of mandatory tests for the ModelB prototype.
