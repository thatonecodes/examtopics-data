This can make the dataset smaller and faster to load.\n\nHowever, if the datetime column has low granularity, such as hourly or daily, splitting it into separate columns may not reduce the number of distinct values, and may not improve compression or performance.\n\nIn summary, splitting a datetime column into separate date and time columns can potentially improve performance, but it depends on the specific data and use case. It's important to evaluate the impact of the split on data size, compression, and performance before making any changes to the dataset.","poster":"Pinha","timestamp":"1678885620.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"838418","timestamp":"1678750860.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"The correct answer is A.
