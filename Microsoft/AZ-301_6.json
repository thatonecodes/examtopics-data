The fast reads from cache lower the SQL Server query time since data pages are retrieved much faster from the cache compared to directly from the data disks.\nb. Serving reads from cache, means there is additional Throughput available from premium data disks. SQL Server can use this additional Throughput towards retrieving more data pages and other operations like backup/restore, batch loads, and index rebuilds.\nConfigure \"None\" cache on premium storage disks hosting the log files.\na.
