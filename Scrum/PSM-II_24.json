They give Paul their estimate of the effort it would take to get the previous work 'done', and suggest doing that work first before proceeding with new features. The team also re-estimates the effort to make the remaining Product Backlog items 'done', including all integration effort.

Each product is allocated a dedicated Scrum Team and a set budget. Based on the average velocity of a previous product release, Paul had estimated a new product to take 9 Sprints to complete. The average velocity of the previous product release was 50 completed units of work per Sprint. Over the first 3 Sprints, the Development Team reported an average velocity of 40 completed units per Sprint, while not fully completing the required integration tests.
