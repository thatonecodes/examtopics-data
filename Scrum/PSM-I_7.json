The Sprint Backlog is not a static, exhaustive list created solely by the Product Owner; instead, it's a dynamic plan developed by the Scrum Team during Sprint Planning.\n\nOption D, \"It is the Scrum Team's plan for the Sprint,\" better emphasizes the collaborative effort of the Scrum Team in creating and owning the Sprint Backlog. It reflects the idea that the team collectively decides on the work to be undertaken during the Sprint and how it will be accomplished.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1108728"},{"timestamp":"1719184380.0","poster":"emelba","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1104401","content":"D. \nAnswer A, \"It is a complete list of all work to be done in a Sprint,\" is not the best choice because the Sprint Backlog is not intended to be a comprehensive and exhaustive list of all the work to be done in a Sprint at the beginning.

Although I understand why most people here think it is D. Firstly, according to the scrum guide, \"The sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers\". However, option D refers to the Sprint Backlog as the Scrum Team's plan. The sprint is owned by the Developers and not the Scrum Team.
