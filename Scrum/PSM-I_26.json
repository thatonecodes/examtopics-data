The definition of done is a shared understanding within the Scrum team and isn't based on what the devs are willing to do. It should be ready to release to users, which does not mean it WILL be released, that's up to the PO. Through CI/CD pipeline, increments are continuously integrated with previous increments.","poster":"okayhey","timestamp":"1727578620.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1076091","poster":"Nolos83","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: CE\nC and E\n\nNot B = The increment must be already integrated","timestamp":"1716269400.0"},{"timestamp":"1716269340.0","comment_id":"1076090","upvote_count":"1","content":"C and E\n\nNot B = The increment must be already integrated","poster":"Nolos83"},{"poster":"Prozac400","timestamp":"1713593940.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"B and E\n\nOption A is not accurate because \"Done\" does not mean all work the Development Team is willing to do; it has specific criteria.

This means that the work completed by the Development Team should be tested and verified, and any dependencies or conflicts with other parts of the product should be resolved.\n\nOption C highlights that there should be no incomplete or unfinished work left from the Definition of Done. The DoD is an agreed-upon set of criteria that the Development Team and the Product Owner define at the beginning of the project. It outlines the quality standards that must be met for the work to be considered \"Done.\"\n\nOption E is not entirely correct because being \"Ready to be released to end-users\" is a subset of the DoD.
