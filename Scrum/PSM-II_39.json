The DoR is a checklist that the Product Owner must fulfill before a Product Backlog item can be presented at the Sprint Planning. This protects the Development Team from interruptions and disruptions during the Sprint.","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/scrum/view/46222-exam-psm-ii-topic-1-question-98-discussion/","exam_id":134,"answer_description":"Product Backlog items should be clear enough and have enough information for the Product Owner and Development to understand the work that needs to be done and to create a forecast of Product Backlog items to implement the Sprint Goal. Nothing stops the flow of Sprints, for example, we do not delay the Sprint because the items are not ready. In such cases, the ג€unreadyג€ items would be selected for the Sprint anyway and refined during the Sprint.\nIn the case that the Product Backlog items are not clear enough, the Development Team forecasts the most likely Product Backlog items to meet the goal and create a Sprint Backlog based on a likely initial design and plan. Once the time-box for the Sprint Planning meeting is over, start the Sprint and continue to analyze, decompose, and create additional functionality during the Sprint. At the end of the Sprint, the Scrum Team can discuss in the upcoming Sprint\nRetrospective why this happened and what changes will make it less likely to recur.","choices":{"A":"True","B":"False"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"306803","content":"B is correct","poster":"amog","timestamp":"1725931260.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[]},{"id":"DywbUclVgCgTQbvdAXcG","unix_timestamp":1615346460,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"content":"A is correct.","timestamp":"1729519860.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"340370","poster":"nhungnt184"},{"content":"A is correct","timestamp":"1725931260.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"306804","poster":"amog"}],"choices":{"A":"Teach them that it's their responsibility to coordinate with the other teams to integrate and create a shippable product Increment at the end of every Sprint.","B":"Identify and manage the dependencies between Scrum Teams.","D":"Merge the teams and work from a single Sprint Backlog.","C":"Have the Product Owner work with the tech leads of each team to parse the Product Backlog and minimize overlap in User Stories."},"question_id":192,"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":134,"timestamp":"2021-03-10 04:21:00","answer_description":"One of the benefits of self-organized teams is the ability to decide how best to work together to produce a shippable Increment.","question_text":"How should a Scrum Master coordinate the work when more than one Scrum Team is working on one product?","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/scrum/view/46223-exam-psm-ii-topic-1-question-99-discussion/"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"name":"PSM II","provider":"Scrum","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":134,"numberOfQuestions":192,"isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":39},"__N_SSP":true}
