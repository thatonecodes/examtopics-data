Selon les besoins, sans allocation spéciale pour les changements de productivité.\n\nEn Scrum, il n'y a pas de règle stricte concernant la fréquence à laquelle l'adhésion à l'équipe doit changer. L'équipe Scrum devrait être stable pendant la durée d'un Sprint (généralement deux à quatre semaines). Cependant, en dehors des Sprints, l'équipe peut s'adapter en fonction des besoins et des circonstances.\n\nLes options A et D ne sont pas tout à fait correctes car il ne s'agit pas de changer l'adhésion à l'équipe en fonction de la productivité à court terme ou à chaque Sprint. La cohérence et la stabilité de l'équipe sont généralement considérées comme bénéfiques pour favoriser la collaboration et la performance à long terme.","comment_id":"962896","timestamp":"1706208000.0","poster":"Albinopreto"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nhttps://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/7699/changing-membership\nThe answer to this question is:\nAs needed, while taking into account a short term reduction in productivity.\n\nThe feedback you are given for this Open Assessment Question is:\nTeams typically go through some steps before achieving a state of increased performance.

During the Sprint Retrospective.\n\nExplanation: The Sprint Retrospective is the most appropriate time for the Development Team to reflect on their practices and processes. If the Development Team identifies opportunities for improvement or finds that the current Definition of Done is inadequate, they can propose changes to it during the Sprint Retrospective. This allows the team to continuously enhance their Definition of Done, align it with their evolving understanding and requirements, and ensure it effectively reflects the expected quality and completeness of their work. It is a valuable opportunity to refine and update the Definition of Done for future Sprints."},{"poster":"maverick_walker","timestamp":"1730190360.0","comment_id":"1203878","content":"C is correct","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1017817","poster":"Jyoti1010","content":"Selected Answer: C\nDuring sprint retrospective Definition of done can be modified as we know more about the product and non functional requirements.","timestamp":"1711467900.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707540120.0","comment_id":"977186","poster":"Mi_Windsor","content":"C during the spring retrospective"}],"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"When is it most appropriate for a Development Team to change the definition of `Done`?","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1684550700,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/scrum/view/109754-exam-psm-i-topic-1-question-37-discussion/","question_id":113,"choices":{"B":"Prior to starting a new Sprint.","A":"During Spring Planning.","D":"Prior to starting a new project.","C":"During the Sprint Retrospective."}},{"id":"p7vGuiBaH3bmdLCTVg76","choices":{"E":"The Scrum Master loses the ability to update the Gantt chart properly.","A":"Opportunities to inspect and adapt the Sprint Backlog are lost.","B":"Impediments are raised and resolved more slowly.","D":"Too much work is spent updating the Scrum board before the meeting.","F":"The Sprint plan may become inaccurate.","C":"The Product Owner cannot accurately report progress to the stakeholders."},"unix_timestamp":1607368380,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-12-07 20:13:00","answers_community":["ABF (100%)"],"answer":"ABF","question_text":"The Daily Scrum is an event that happens every day.
