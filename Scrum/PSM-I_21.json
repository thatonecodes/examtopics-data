Tell the Product Owner to re-order the Product Backlog so the work involving the external component can be planned in a separate sprint.\n\nIn Scrum, the Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing the Product Backlog to maximize the value delivered in each Sprint. If the team is waiting for an external supplier to deliver a component and there won't be enough work in the next Sprint to occupy the full team without that component, it makes sense to reorder the backlog so that work not dependent on the external component can be planned for the next Sprint. This ensures that the team can remain productive and focused on delivering value even if they are temporarily waiting for an external dependency to be met.","timestamp":"1694000940.0","poster":"Godfall","comment_id":"1000557","upvote_count":"4"},{"comment_id":"992339","timestamp":"1693236480.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct because it talks about the very first point of scrum guide on how the scrum master serves the product owner.","poster":"amit_swolf","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"992119","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Tomix73","content":"The answer is A, the scrum master gives advices not orders, so he cannot \"Tell the product owner do something, he advises...\"","timestamp":"1693223460.0"},{"comment_id":"987988","poster":"Albinopreto","timestamp":"1692771720.0","content":"En tant que Scrum Master, le conseil le plus approprié serait le suivant :\n\nB.
