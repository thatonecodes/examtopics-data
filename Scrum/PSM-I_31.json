À la fin de chaque Sprint, un Incrément potentiellement livrable doit être produit.\n\nCependant, il n'est pas nécessaire de mettre l'Incrément en production à la fin de chaque Sprint. La décision de déployer l'Incrément en production est prise par le Product Owner et les parties prenantes en fonction de divers facteurs, notamment la préparation du produit, les priorités commerciales et les risques éventuels associés à la mise en production.\n\nAinsi, la déclaration correcte est : Un Incrément du produit doit être potentiellement livrable, mais pas nécessairement mis en production à la fin de chaque Sprint.\ndonc faux","comment_id":"964681"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1715352060.0","poster":"ordealba","content":"Selected Answer: A\n4.3 Value Driven Delivery.\n\nDecrease uncertainty and constantly address risks that can potentially decrease value if they materialize.

Watch out for tricky wording... Scrum guide does not explicitly state an increment must be 'released to production', but only useable (meeting the DoD).\n \n'Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value. Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.' - Scrum Guide (under increment section) https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html","timestamp":"1719542640.0","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"936021"}]}],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"exam_id":133,"question_text":"A product Increment must be released to production at the end of each Sprint.","question_id":151,"timestamp":"2023-05-10 16:41:00","choices":{"B":"False","A":"True"}},{"id":"EE7EUhlkEFX7aeXUMpYP","question_id":152,"unix_timestamp":1691638800,"discussion":[{"poster":"Jyoti1010","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1018056","timestamp":"1727373420.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.Burn-down chart shows the work remaining."},{"content":"C is the correct answer","timestamp":"1723261200.0","poster":"Mi_Windsor","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"977236"}],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04220/0004100001.png"],"timestamp":"2023-08-10 05:40:00","answer":"C","question_images":[],"question_text":"If burndown charts are used to visualize progress, what do they track?","topic":"1","answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://zepel.io/agile/reports/burndown/#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20a%20burndown%20chart%20is,through%E2%80%9D%20tasks%20in%20a%\n20sprint","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"A":"Accumulated cost.","D":"Accumulated business value delivered to the customer.","C":"Work remaining across time.","B":"Individual worker productivity."},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":133,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/scrum/view/117734-exam-psm-i-topic-1-question-73-discussion/"},{"id":"7ddfMIs2Ma3b2t75yTix","answers_community":[],"question_text":"How is management external to the Scrum Team involved in the Daily Scrum?","timestamp":"2023-08-10 05:41:00","topic":"1","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1691638860,"isMC":true,"exam_id":133,"choices":{"B":"Managers are not required at the Daily Scrum.","C":"Management gives an update at the start of each Daily Scrum.","D":"The Product Owner represents their opinions.","A":"The Scrum Master speaks on their behalf."},"answer_description":"Reference:\nhttps://chercher.tech/agile-certification/scrum-master-certification-prep-questions-set-7","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728901860.0","comment_id":"1043337","content":"Why not D?","poster":"ceausorin","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1729310220.0","content":"Product Owner is not attending Daily Scrum, only developers","poster":"ficklesena","comment_id":"1047498","upvote_count":"2"}]},{"poster":"Jyoti1010","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1018057","timestamp":"1727373480.0","content":"Daily scrum is attended by the developers only."},{"timestamp":"1723261260.0","content":"Why not D?
