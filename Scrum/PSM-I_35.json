The right mixture of senior and junior people can influence the learning curve and productivity of each team, but it may not be the first concern before understanding how teams will be formed.\n\nC. Deciding on team leads is important, but in Scrum, teams are encouraged to be self-organizing, and this question might prematurely impose a hierarchy that Scrum seeks to minimize.\n\nD.
