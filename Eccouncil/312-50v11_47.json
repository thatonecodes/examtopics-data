Often, sandboxing is useful in executing untested code or untrusted programs from unverified or untrusted third parties, suppliers, users, and websites. This enhances security by isolating the app to prevent intruders, system resources, malware such as Trojans and viruses, and other apps from interacting with it. As sandboxing isolates applications from one another, it protects them from tampering with each other; however, malicious applications may exploit vulnerabilities and bypass the sandbox.\n\nAnswer is Reverse Engineering \n\nCEHv11 Module 17 Hacking Mobile Platforms Page 2390 (Search Page 2406)","upvote_count":"2","poster":"gokhansah1n","timestamp":"1646046480.0"},{"timestamp":"1646046360.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"gokhansah1n","comment_id":"557994","content":"Selected Answer: A\nReverse engineering is the process of analyzing and extracting the source code of a software or application and, if needed, regenerating it with required modifications.
