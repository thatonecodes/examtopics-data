Vector image.\nWhen a vector image is enlarged, it does not lose its quality or become pixelated, unlike raster images. Vector images are made up of mathematical equations that draw shapes and lines, so they can be scaled up or down without any loss of detail.\nRaster images, on the other hand, are made up of pixels, and when they are enlarged, the pixels become visible, causing the image to appear blurry or pixelated.\nHere's a summary:\nRaster images (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF): Pixel-based, can become blurry or pixelated when enlarged.\nVector images (e.g., SVG, EPS, AI): Mathematically defined, can be scaled without losing quality.\nThe other options are not correct:\nC.

ADS allows files to contain hidden data streams, which can be used to conceal malicious files or data.\nWhile Windows search can find files based on their contents, it does not search ADS by default.

This can be used to hide malicious software, data or other files.\n\nEvidor is a tool used for digital forensics investigations, and it has the ability to search for files hidden within ADS, as well as to search for other types of hidden files, metadata, and other digital artifacts. In contrast, the built-in Windows search feature does not have the capability to search for files hidden within ADS, making Evidor a valuable tool in forensic investigations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because once a file is physically removed from the hard drive, it cannot be found by any search tool. Option B is incorrect because finding bad sectors on the hard drive is a function of disk repair tools and is not related to file search. Option C is also incorrect as searching slack space is a feature that is included in many file recovery tools, but not necessarily in Evidor.","poster":"Manzer"}],"exam_id":176,"timestamp":"2023-03-11 15:07:00","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_text":"What advantage does the tool Evidor have over the built-in Windows search?","answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/102312-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-237-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (60%)","D (40%)"],"unix_timestamp":1678543620}],"exam":{"provider":"Eccouncil","numberOfQuestions":609,"isMCOnly":true,"id":176,"name":"312-49v10","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":21},"__N_SSP":true}
