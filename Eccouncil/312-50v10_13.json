These scans are designed to manipulate the PSH, URG and FIN flags of the TCP header. When viewed within Wireshark, we can see that alternating bits are enabled, or “Blinking,” much like you would light up a Christmas tree. This is the humor we techies love.\nSo in other words, the Xmas scan in order to identify listening ports on a targeted system will send a specific packet.
