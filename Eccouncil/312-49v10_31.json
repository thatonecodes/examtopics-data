Increased by 1.\nWhen a router receives an update for its routing table, the metric value (also known as the cost or distance) for that path is increased by 1. This is because the update indicates that the path has become one \"hop\" longer, or that the distance to the destination network has increased by one router.\nThe metric value is used to determine the best path to a destination network, and increasing the metric value makes the path less preferred.","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_id":152,"answers_community":[],"answer":"C","timestamp":"2024-06-17 19:05:00","topic":"1","answer_description":""},{"id":"RYbxzEnBb0mWqsZAvMwk","answer":"C","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/140079-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-289-discussion/","answer_description":"","choices":{"D":"Unallocated","C":"Lost","B":"Bad","A":"Corrupt"},"unix_timestamp":1715018520,"discussion":[{"poster":"aqeel1506","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721371500.0","comment_id":"1250928","content":"The correct answer is C.
