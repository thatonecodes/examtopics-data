The regular expression in question matches a pattern of SQL queries that are commonly used in SQL injection attacks to bypass input validation.\n\nThe regular expression looks for a pattern that includes a single quote (either with URL encoding %27 or the actual character '), followed by the letter o (either with URL encoding %6F or the actual character o), followed by the letter r (either with URL encoding %72 or the actual character r), and finally, the letter O (either with URL encoding %4F or the actual character O). This pattern is used to insert malicious SQL code into a query and evade input validation, allowing the attacker to execute their malicious code.\n\nTherefore, the detection of this regular expression in web application logs is a strong indication of a possible SQL injection attack, and security analysts can use it to identify and prevent such attacks.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"893964","poster":"milo888"}],"question_text":"Sam, a security analyst with INFOSOL INC., while monitoring and analyzing IIS logs, detected an event matching regex /\\\\w*((\\%27)|(\\’))((\\%6F)|o|(\\%4F))((\\%72)|r|(\\%52))/ix.\nWhat does this event log indicate?","timestamp":"2023-05-10 15:14:00","topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_id":32,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/108868-exam-312-39-topic-1-question-37-discussion/","exam_id":174,"choices":{"A":"SQL Injection Attack","D":"Directory Traversal Attack","C":"XSS Attack","B":"Parameter Tampering Attack"},"unix_timestamp":1683724440,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"answer":"A"},{"id":"qxeLfFZyx6Dq8DNxoNxE","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"Pragdeashwar","content":"SSE-CMM Module 1 Page 38","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727684580.0","comment_id":"1186663"},{"comment_id":"810795","poster":"SchFiftySchFive","timestamp":"1692190860.0","content":"The answer is C as per the ISO website:\n\nSO/IEC 21827:2008 specifies the Systems Security Engineering - Capability Maturity Model® (SSE-CMM®), which describes the essential characteristics of an organization's security engineering process that must exist to ensure good security engineering.
