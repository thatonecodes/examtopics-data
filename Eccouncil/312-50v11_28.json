The first category consists of downgrade attacks against WPA3-capable devices, and the second category consists of weaknesses in the Dragonfly handshake of WPA3, which in the Wi-Fi standard is better known as the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) handshake. The discovered flaws can be abused to recover the password of the Wi-Fi network, launch resource consumption attacks, and force devices into using weaker security groups. All attacks are against home networks (i.e. WPA3-Personal), where one password is shared among all users.","comment_id":"442060","poster":"Scryptic","timestamp":"1694273760.0"},{"comment_id":"412205","timestamp":"1690086300.0","poster":"ANDRESCB1988","upvote_count":"2","content":"correct"}],"answer_description":"","exam_id":179,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"]}],"exam":{"name":"312-50v11","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":400,"provider":"Eccouncil","isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"id":179,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":28},"__N_SSP":true}
