The responses to the settings are analyzed and compared to a list of known request/response values to find a match. Operating systems are all built with identifying characteristics within their TCP/IP stacks and configurations. This includes settings such as the TCP window size and TCP initial sequence numbers. Passive fingerprinting also looks at deviations in TCP/IP stack implementations; however it looks for these deviations by analyzing the traffic on the network. Passive fingerprinting does not send any packets to the target; it passively monitors the target’s communications.","timestamp":"1722404820.0"}],"timestamp":"2020-07-31 07:47:00","question_id":21,"exam_id":178,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Passive","C":"Reflective","B":"Active","D":"Distributive"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"zsFVCeKWA1fCCRbJHnnc","unix_timestamp":1599248580,"timestamp":"2020-09-04 21:43:00","exam_id":178,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/30603-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-135-discussion/","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","choices":{"B":"The host is likely a printer.","D":"The host is likely a Windows machine.","A":"The host is likely a Linux machine.","C":"The host is likely a router."},"answer":"B","question_text":"A penetration tester is conducting a port scan on a specific host.

It’s sometimes possible to store the CSRF attack on the vulnerable site itself. Such vulnerabilities are called “stored CSRF flaws”. This can be accomplished by simply storing an IMG or IFRAME tag in a field that accepts HTML, or by a more complex cross-site scripting attack. If the attack can store a CSRF attack in the site, the severity of the attack is amplified. In particular, the likelihood is increased because the victim is more likely to view the page containing the attack than some random page on the Internet. The likelihood is also increased because the victim is sure to be authenticated to the site already.","comment_id":"297715"}]},{"id":"kw5g4b7G5HTd7mu59Ihw","unix_timestamp":1597119840,"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"An attacker with access to the inside network of a small company launches a successful STP manipulation attack.
