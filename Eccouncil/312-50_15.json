Network-based IDS/IPS systems analyze network traffic and compare it to known attack patterns, signatures, and behavior to identify and block suspicious activity in real-time. This allows them to protect multiple hosts simultaneously, without the need for individual installations on each host.","poster":"Novmejst","comment_id":"877394","timestamp":"1713799680.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"877391","poster":"Novmejst","timestamp":"1713799560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThey are placed at the boundary, allowing them to inspect all traffic."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nNetwork based will also cover devices that cannot have host based ids installed (like IoT).","comment_id":"835272","timestamp":"1710092100.0","poster":"Borjebour"}],"unix_timestamp":1678469700,"topic":"3","answer":"B","exam_id":177,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/102192-exam-312-50-topic-3-question-56-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"BprI66A1uCMdn5GZqTxe","answer":"C","discussion":[{"content":"Https uses TLS/SSL protocol to establish handshake and that relies on asymmetric (2 pairs of keys).
