He intends to perform a Slow HTTP POST attack, by manipulating 'a' HTTP connection. Each connection sends a byte of data every 'b' second, effectively holding up the connections for an extended period. Your server is designed to manage 'm' connections per second, but any connections exceeding this number tend to overwhelm the system. Given 'a=100' and variable 'm', along with the attacker's intention of maximizing the attack duration 'D=a*b', consider the following scenarios. Which is most likely to result in the longest duration of server unavailability?","timestamp":"2024-02-06 22:38:00","question_id":56,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1386428","content":"Selected Answer: A\nM<A and time: 100*15=1500","timestamp":"1741635420.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"agelbahri"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nB & C can be exclude right away as the value of \"m\" is greater than \"a\" so can easily manage those request. \nNow coming to option D which has m = 95 if we calculate the duration it would 100 * 10 = 1000 also logically it would hold for less time as compared to the value m=90 for this also duration would be 15 * 100 = 1500, hence Answer is A.\n\nHope it make sense.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"shubhi6","timestamp":"1733652960.0","comment_id":"1323480"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732840680.0","poster":"blehbleh","comment_id":"1319495","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis A and I am not understanding what other people are not understanding of how to solve this question. The question at the end wants to know which one will result in the most down time or something along those lines I cant view it with this discussion pulled up. Regardless option A the attacks are longer or more then what the server can manage that is easily viewable and the attacks are 15 seconds in duration, so with the server not being able to handle all the requests and the 15 seconds it makes it the longest duration attack. I think most of the other options the server can manage the requests because the requests are less of that then which the server can handle.
