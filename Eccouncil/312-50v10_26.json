EC Council CEHv11 Page 2017\n\n Illegal/Logically Incorrect Query An attacker may gain knowledge by injecting illegal/logically incorrect requests such as injectable parameters, data types, names of tables, and so on. In this SQL injection attack, an attacker intentionally sends an incorrect query to the database to generate an error message that may be useful for performing further attacks. This technique may help an attacker to extract the structure of the underlying database. For example, to find the column name, an attacker may give the following malicious input: Username: 'Bob\" The resultant query will be\nSELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Bob\"' AND password = After executing the above query, the database may return the following error message:\n\"Incorrect Syntax near 'Bob'.
