IPv6 is designed to solve many of the problems that were faced by IPv4, such as address depletion, security, auto-configuration, and extensibility. With the fast increasing number of networks and the expansion of the World Wide Web, the allotted IP addresses are depleting rapidly, and the need for more network addresses is arising. IPv6 solves this problem, as it uses a 128-bit address that can produce a lot more IP addresses. These addresses are hexadecimal numbers, made up of eight octet pairs. An example of an IPv6 address is 45CF: 6D53: 12CD: AFC7: E654:\nBB32: 543C: FACE.\nAnswer option C is incorrect.

Nmap is a free open-source utility for network exploration and security auditing. It is used to discover computers and services on a computer network, thus creating a \"map\" of the network. Just like many simple port scanners, Nmap is capable of discovering passive services. In addition, Nmap may be able to determine various details about the remote computers. These include operating system, device type, uptime, software product used to run a service, exact version number of that product, presence of some firewall techniques and, on a local area network, even vendor of the remote network card. Nmap runs on Linux, Microsoft Windows, etc."},{"id":"fLtdzRVTxI9F9eCF1cBS","answer_ET":"","answer_description":"Following are the terms with their descriptions:\n\nA Trojan horse is a malicious software program that contains hidden code and masquerades itself as a normal program. When a Trojan horse program is run, its hidden code runs to destroy or scramble data on the hard disk. An example of a Trojan horse is a program that masquerades as a computer logon to retrieve user names and password information. The developer of a Trojan horse can use this information later to gain unauthorized access to computers. Trojan horses are normally spread by e-mail attachments. Ping sweep is a technique used to determine which of a range of IP addresses map to live hosts. It consists of ICMP\nECHO requests sent to multiple hosts. If a given address is live, it will return an ICMP ECHO reply. A ping is often used to check that a network device is functioning. To disable ping sweeps on a network, administrators can block ICMP ECHO requests from outside sources. However, ICMP TIMESTAMP and ICMP\nINFO can be used in a similar manner. Spamware is software designed by or for spammers to send out automated spam e-mail. Spamware is used to search for e-mail addresses to build lists of e-mail addresses to be used either for spamming directly or to be sold to spammers. The spamware package also includes an e- mail harvesting tool. A backdoor is any program that allows a hacker to connect to a computer without going through the normal authentication process. The main advantage of this type of attack is that the network traffic moves from inside a network to the hacker's computer. The traffic moving from inside a network to the outside world is typically the least restrictive, as companies are more concerned about what comes into a network, rather than what leaves it. It, therefore, becomes hard to detect backdoors.","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03651/0000300002.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03651/0000400001.png"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1275789","timestamp":"1725159000.0","poster":"K_ENG","content":"1-Trojan horse 2- ping sweep 3- spamware 4- backdoor"},{"poster":"[Removed]","comment_id":"1272544","content":"Please provide the terms and their descriptions, so I can assist you with the matching.","timestamp":"1724660100.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":10,"unix_timestamp":1724660100,"answer":"","timestamp":"2024-08-26 10:15:00","question_text":"DRAG DROP -\nDrag and drop the terms to match with their descriptions.\nSelect and Place:\n//IMG//","isMC":false,"topic":"1","answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03651/0000300001.jpg"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/146438-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-2-discussion/","exam_id":173}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"id":173,"isImplemented":true,"name":"312-38","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Eccouncil","isMCOnly":false,"numberOfQuestions":188},"currentPage":2},"__N_SSP":true}
