Side-channel attack\nCEHv12 Book Module 18 p. 2956\n\nAttackers perform a side-channel attack by monitoring its physical implementation to obtain critical information from a target system. Attackers use two techniques, namely timing analysis and power analysis, to perform side-channel attacks on the target OT systems.\n\nPasswords are often transmitted through a serial channel. Attackers employ a loop strategy to recover these passwords. They use one character at a time to check whether the first character entered is correct; if so, the loop continues for consecutive characters. If not, the loop terminates. Attackers check how much time the device is taking to finish one complete password authentication process, through which they can determine how many characters entered are correct.","timestamp":"1724843940.0","poster":"ethacker2"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"insaniunt","timestamp":"1724608920.0","comment_id":"1159083","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
