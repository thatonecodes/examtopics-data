This is because anomaly detection systems work by identifying deviations from a baseline of normal behavior, which can be highly variable and unpredictable due to the diverse activities of users and networks.\n\nWhile both network-based IDS (NIDS) and host-based IDS (HIDS) can employ anomaly detection methods, it is the specific approach of anomaly detection itself that tends to generate a higher rate of false positives compared to signature-based detection methods, which rely on known patterns of malicious behavior."},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nout-of-the-ordinary behavior does not mean that it's 100% malicious.
