This security feature uses digital signatures based on public-key cryptography to strengthen authentication in DNS. These digital signatures are stored in the DNS name servers along with common records such as MX, A, AAAA, and CNAME.

Key escrow is a process of storing a copy of a cryptographic key with a trusted third party, such as a key recovery agent or an escrow server. This enables the key to be retrieved in case the original key is lost or inaccessible. In the context of BitLocker, Active Directory can act as a key escrow agent by storing a copy of the BitLocker recovery key for each encrypted device.
