L0phtCrack has the ability to obtain password hashes directly from other machines on the network remotely, making it easy for network administrators. Audits performed by L0phtCrack can be done manually or can be scheduled to run at predetermined times. Once L0phtcrack is in possession of groups of password hashes, it subjects them to several attacks. After checking that the password is not the same as the username, the program performs a dictionary attack, a hybrid attack, a pre-computed attack using rainbow tables, and a brute-force attack.\"","timestamp":"1730548200.0","poster":"XX20Jim20XX"}],"choices":{"B":"Netbus","C":"NTFSDOS","D":"L0phtcrack","A":"This is not possible"},"answer":"A","timestamp":"2023-11-02 12:50:00","isMC":true,"topic":"8","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/125174-exam-312-50-topic-8-question-327-discussion/","question_id":182,"exam_id":177,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1698925800,"question_images":[],"question_text":"What tool can crack Windows SMB passwords simply by listening to network traffic?"},{"id":"4ocuz0GTClT9Vi62hxFc","topic":"8","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-11-22 07:06:00","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1669097160,"isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"exam_id":177,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/88290-exam-312-50-topic-8-question-335-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","choices":{"D":"SSL","B":"DES","A":"MD4","C":"SHA"},"answer_description":"","question_id":183,"question_text":"You are attempting to crack LM Manager hashed from Windows 2000 SAM file.
