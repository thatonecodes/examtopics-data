STP is used in LAN-switched networks with the primary function of removing potential loops within the network. STP ensures that the traffic inside the network follows an optimized path to enhance network performance. In this process, a switch inside the network is appointed as the root bridge. After the selection of the root bridge, other switches in the network connect to it by selecting a root port (the closest port to the root bridge). The root bridge is selected with the help of Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). BPDUs each have an identification number known as a BID or ID. These BIDs consist of the Bridge Priority and the MAC address. By default, the value of the Bridge Priority is 32769. If an attacker has access to two switches, he/she introduces a rogue switch in the network with a priority lower than any other switch in the network. This makes the rogue switch the root bridge, thus allowing the attacker to sniff all the traffic flowing in the network.","comment_id":"461261","timestamp":"1681331520.0","upvote_count":"11","poster":"blacksheep6r","comments":[{"poster":"king777","timestamp":"1708123200.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"647818","content":"Thank you for the explanation."}]},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nAn STP manipulation attack is when an attacker, hacker, or an unauthorized user spoof the root bridge in the topology. The attacker broadcasts out an STP configuration/topology change BPDU in an attempt to force an STP recalculation. The BPDU sent out announces that the attacker’s system has a lower bridge priority.
