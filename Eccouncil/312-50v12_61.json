Out-of-band SQLi. \n\nOut-of-band SQL injection is an advanced form of SQL injection that is not reliant on the same channel as the application. In this technique, the attacker uses a different channel, such as an email, to send the data to an external server that is under their control. An example of this technique is exploiting a SQL vulnerability that allows an attacker to make DNS requests from the victim's server to an external server under the attacker's control, allowing them to pass data to the attacker.","comment_id":"861409","timestamp":"1696445160.0","poster":"eli117","upvote_count":"3"}],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/105192-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-88-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-04-04 20:46:00","unix_timestamp":1680633960,"question_text":"SQL injection (SQLi) attacks attempt to inject SQL syntax into web requests, which may bypass authentication and allow attackers to access and/or modify data attached to a web application.\nWhich of the following SQLi types leverages a database server’s ability to make DNS requests to pass data to an attacker?"},{"id":"kSLWo28Nb9baaY6eAL1X","exam_id":180,"answers_community":["A (69%)","B (23%)","8%"],"unix_timestamp":1680634080,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"861411","comments":[{"comment_id":"903140","timestamp":"1700572980.0","poster":"victorfs","content":"I think is B opción.\nApplication assesment","upvote_count":"1"}],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A.
