Slowloris attack \n312-50v11 Q187\nCEH book Module 10 P1452\n\nSlowloris is a DDoS attack tool used to perform layer-7 DDoS attacks to take down web infrastructure. It is distinctly different from other tools in that it uses perfectly legitimate HTTP traffic to take down a target server. In Slowloris attacks, the attacker sends partial HTTP requests to the target web server or application.

Slowloris attack.\n\nExplanation: In a Slowloris attack, the attacker sends partial HTTP requests to the web infrastructure or applications. Upon receiving a partial request, the target server opens multiple connections and keeps waiting for the requests to complete. The attacker then sends a slow stream of subsequent requests that are never completed, which leads to resource exhaustion on the server, eventually causing it to crash or become unavailable. This attack is performed at layer 7 to take down web infrastructure.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"eli117"}],"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1680633780,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/105187-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-83-discussion/","exam_id":180,"answer":"B"},{"id":"9dzH6a25M29VfZPIcwKT","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

ARP ping scan is an efficient and effective technique that enables a host to discover all the active hosts on the network, especially when it is difficult to identify devices using the traditional methods such as ICMP ping. ARP requests are used to check the existence of each device with a specific IP address within the network, and the devices with the corresponding MAC addresses reply with an ARP response. Therefore, by sending ARP requests to each IP address in a range, Andrew can identify all active devices within the network.","poster":"eli117","upvote_count":"4"}],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1680633780,"topic":"1","exam_id":180,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (93%)","7%"],"question_id":297,"timestamp":"2023-04-04 20:43:00","question_text":"Andrew is an Ethical Hacker who was assigned the task of discovering all the active devices hidden by a restrictive firewall in the IPv4 range in a given target network.\nWhich of the following host discovery techniques must he use to perform the given task?","choices":{"A":"UDP scan","D":"TCP Maimon scan","B":"ARP ping scan","C":"ACK flag probe scan"},"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/105188-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-84-discussion/","answer":"B"},{"id":"GyHGqrZ8m9v7Q2alVPkA","question_id":298,"question_text":"Abel, a cloud architect, uses container technology to deploy applications/software including all its dependencies, such as libraries and configuration files, binaries, and other resources that run independently from other processes in the cloud environment.
