Community\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe three main types of cloud deployment options are: private, public, and hybrid. However, there is also a fourth deployment option called community cloud.\n\nIn a community cloud, a cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations or groups that have similar computing requirements and concerns. These organizations may be from the same industry, have similar security or compliance requirements, or have other commonalities that make it beneficial for them to share a cloud environment.\n\nCommunity cloud environments can provide benefits such as lower costs, improved security, and shared expertise.

WPA3-Enterprise\n\nWPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) is the latest wireless security protocol that provides improved security and privacy over the older WPA2 protocol. WPA3-Enterprise is designed for use in enterprise environments, where security is a critical concern. WPA3-Enterprise provides strong encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect against various types of attacks, including password-based attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nWPA3-Enterprise supports the use of 192-bit minimum-strength security protocols, such as GCMP-256, to protect sensitive data. It also uses cryptographic tools like HMAC-SHA384 and ECDSA using a 384-bit elliptic curve to provide strong security.\n\nWPA3-Personal, on the other hand, is designed for use in home networks and provides improved security over the older WPA2-Personal protocol, but it does not support the same level of security protocols as WPA3-Enterprise.","comment_id":"860998"},{"comment_id":"1332276","timestamp":"1735284120.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mann098","content":"Selected Answer: B\nas its a latest serurity protocol so its more secure"},{"poster":"Kermitdfrog","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis is on the exam.","timestamp":"1724351940.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1156709"},{"timestamp":"1716678420.0","comment_id":"1080415","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
