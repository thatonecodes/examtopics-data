This evasion technique is based on splitting an attack vector between multiple instances of a parameter with the same name. Since none of the relevant HTTP RFCs define the semantics of HTTP parameter manipulation, each web application delivery platform may deal with it differently. In particular, some environments process such requests by concatenating the values taken from all instances of a parameter name within the request. This behavior is abused by the attacker in order to bypass pattern-based security mechanisms."},{"timestamp":"1723949340.0","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","content":"Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session.
