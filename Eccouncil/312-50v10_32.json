This attack is often used when the web application is configured to show generic error messages, but has not mitigated the code that is vulnerable to SQL injection."},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1721107620.0","content":"In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi)\nIn-band SQL Injection is the most common and easy-to-exploit of SQL Injection attacks. In-band SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is able to use the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.\n\nThe two most common types of in-band SQL Injection are Error-based SQLi and Union-based SQLi.\n\nError-based SQLi\nError-based SQLi is an in-band SQL Injection technique that relies on error messages thrown by the database server to obtain information about the structure of the database. In some cases, error-based SQL injection alone is enough for an attacker to enumerate an entire database. While errors are very useful during the development phase of a web application, they should be disabled on a live site, or logged to a file with restricted access instead.\n\nUnion-based SQLi\nUnion-based SQLi is an in-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result which is then returned as part of the HTTP response.","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","comment_id":"136197"},{"content":"What is a compound SQL injection attack?\nIn order to circumvent security measures, clever attackers will sometimes implement multi-vector attacks against a targeted website. While a single attack may be mitigated, it can also become the focus of attention for database administrators and information security teams. DDoS attacks, DNS hijacking and other methods of disruption are sometimes used as a distraction to implement sweeping SQL injection attacks. As a result, a comprehensive threat mitigation strategy provides the widest range of protection. Cloudflareâ€™s web application firewall, DDoS mitigation and DNS security comprise core elements of a holistic security strategy.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"136195","timestamp":"1721107320.0","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks"},{"comment_id":"136193","content":"DMSS-SQLInjectin(AKAOut-of-band SQLi )is a much less common approach to attacking an SQL server. It relies on certain features of an SQL database to be enabled; if those features aren't, the OOB attack won't succeed.\n\nOOB attacks involve submitting a DNS or HTTP query to the SQL server that contains an SQL statement. If successful, the OOB attack can escalate user privileges, transmit database contents, and generally do the same things other forms of SQLi attacks do.","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1721107200.0"}],"choices":{"B":"Compound SQLi","C":"Blind SQLi","D":"Classic SQLi","A":"DMS-specific SQLi"},"exam_id":178,"answer":"C","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"What is attempting an injection attack on a web server based on responses to True/False questions called?","topic":"1","question_images":[],"question_id":156,"unix_timestamp":1594602540,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2020-07-13 03:09:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/25537-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-46-discussion/"},{"id":"acCsFJzGJVVBWZI8sT4E","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/32365-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-48-discussion/","answers_community":[],"question_id":157,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Snort is a free open source network intrusion detection system and intrusion prevention system created in 1998 by Martin Roesch, founder and former CTO of Sourcefire.

Attackers exploit injection flaws by constructing malicious commands or queries that result in data loss or corruption, lack of accountability, or denial of access. Injection flaws are prevalent in legacy code, often found in SQL, LDAP, and XPath queries, etc. and can be easily discovered by application vulnerability scanners and fuzzers. Attackers inject malicious code, commands, or scripts in the input gates of flawed web applications in such a way that the applications interpret and run with the newly supplied malicious input, which in turn allows them to extract sensitive information. By exploiting injection flaws in web applications, attackers can easily read, write, delete, and update any data (i.e., relevant or irrelevant to that particular application).\""}],"content":"Correct answer is B.\nCode injection and RCE are the same thing.","timestamp":"1714557900.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"210414"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"jagadeesh666","content":"Code injection is the exploitation of a computer bug that is caused by processing invalid data.
