Ping sweeps are attempts to discover live hosts on a network by sending echo requests (ping) to multiple IP addresses, and they can use either TCP or UDP packets with the appropriate source and destination ports.","comment_id":"997430","upvote_count":"1","poster":"sTaTiK"}]},{"id":"gLJ4IF6R1ImHR7Fh0kaq","topic":"1","question_id":169,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-12-03 06:19:00","isMC":true,"answer":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":173,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/89824-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-558-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1733387880.0","poster":"YanaC","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCND Page 641","comment_id":"1088291","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nLAPS is the last microsoft solution","comment_id":"997427","timestamp":"1725348540.0","poster":"sTaTiK"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nWindows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS)\nLAPS creates a password or individual administrator accounts and stroes them in the AD","comment_id":"860652","poster":"castro_siya","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1712206740.0"},{"timestamp":"1701580740.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"tsungyu0923","comment_id":"734217","content":"D.
