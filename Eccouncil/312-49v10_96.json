The digital camera was not listed as one of the digital devices in the warrant\n\nWhen executing a search warrant, law enforcement officers are generally only allowed to search for and seize items that are explicitly listed in the warrant. If the digital camera was not included in the list of digital devices specified in the warrant, Debbie would not have the authority to seize it as part of the search. The execution of a search warrant must adhere to the scope and specificity outlined in the warrant itself."},{"timestamp":"1721580660.0","poster":"aqeel1506","comment_id":"1252605","upvote_count":"1","content":"A. The digital camera was not listed as one of the digital devices in the warrant.\n\nIn forensic investigations, it's crucial to adhere strictly to the search warrant's specifications. Seizing items not listed in the warrant could potentially invalidate the evidence collected. Hence, if the digital camera was not mentioned in the warrant, it should not be collected unless the warrant is amended or a new one is obtained that includes it."}]},{"id":"8du2l7j852cJAGGvHvSf","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1713871200,"question_text":"An investigator is checking a Cisco firewall log that reads as follows:\nAug 21 2019 09:16:44: %ASA-1 -106021: Deny ICMP reverse path check from 10.0.0.44 to 10.0.0.33 on interface outside\nWhat does %ASA-1-106021 denote?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/139426-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-669-discussion/","timestamp":"2024-04-23 13:20:00","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"content":"In Cisco firewall logs, the %ASA-1-106021 part of the log entry is a Mnemonic message.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n%ASA: Indicates the type of device, which in this case is a Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewall.\n1: Denotes the severity level of the message (1 is for emergencies).\n106021: This is the specific log message code that corresponds to a predefined event or action in the firewall.\nSo, %ASA-1-106021 represents a specific message type or mnemonic that details the nature of the event or action being logged.","timestamp":"1721580780.0","comment_id":"1252609","poster":"aqeel1506","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Elb","comment_id":"1200685","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713871200.0","content":"B < https://networkengineer.me/2018/05/14/what-is-syslog-on-asa/"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"B","exam_id":176,"answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","choices":{"B":"Mnemonic message","C":"Firewall action","A":"Type of request","D":"Type of traffic"},"question_id":480}],"exam":{"id":176,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Eccouncil","isImplemented":true,"name":"312-49v10","isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":609,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":96},"__N_SSP":true}
