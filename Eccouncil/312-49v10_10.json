This command is not specific to the Windows operating system; it can be run from any system where Nmap is installed, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.\n\nFreeBSD can respond to this command because Nmap is designed to work across different operating systems. When you run nmap -sW from a Windows system, it sends packets to the target (in this case, 10.10.145.65) and analyzes the responses to determine information about the target system, such as open ports and the operating system.\n\nIn this context, Nmap is the tool that is cross-platform, and it can be executed from a Windows system to scan a FreeBSD target, or vice versa. The operating system that responds to the scan is the target system, which could be running FreeBSD, Linux, Windows, or any other operating system."},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Windows XP\n\nThe command is:\nc:\\> nmap -sW 10.10.145.65\n\nThe use of c:\\> in the question (particularly the backslash) indicates that the command is being run from a Microsoft-based command line interface. This eliminates options B: and D: which are unix or unix-like operating systems.\n\nThen we know that NMAP was not ported for the Windows operating system until December of the year 2000, developed for use on the advanced networking stack of NT-based systems (Windows NT/2000). Windows 95 lacked modern networking APIs (e.g., raw sockets) required by Nmap, making it very unlikely that the command could be run from a windows 95 machine.
