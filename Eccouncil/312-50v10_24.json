CCMP provides the following security services:[2]\n\nData confidentiality; ensures only authorized parties can access the information\nAuthentication; provides proof of genuineness of the user\nAccess control in conjunction with layer management\nBecause CCMP is a block cipher mode using a 128-bit key, it is secure against attacks to the 264 steps of operation. Generic meet-in-the-middle attacks do exist and can be used to limit the theoretical strength of the key to 2n∕2 (where n is the number of bits in the key) operations needed.[3]","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"165900","timestamp":"1724581740.0"}],"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"WPA2 uses AES for wireless data encryption at which of the following encryption levels?","choices":{"C":"128 bit and CCMP","A":"64 bit and CCMP","D":"128 bi and TKIP","B":"128 bit and CRC"},"question_id":116,"unix_timestamp":1598351340,"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2020-08-25 12:29:00","exam_id":178,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/29551-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-280-discussion/"},{"id":"2BtSyIdq6iKsWxHCecaq","choices":{"B":"10.1.255.200","D":"10.1.4.156","C":"10.1.5.200","A":"10.1.4.254"},"question_id":117,"topic":"1","exam_id":178,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1705901760.0","poster":"Pb1805","comment_id":"411326","content":"Only C satisfies the condition","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"The question is asking the last 100 usable IP, so C must be the answer","timestamp":"1699891080.0","comment_id":"356451","poster":"AWS_nick","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"292471","comments":[{"timestamp":"1728177000.0","content":"Only 10.1.5.200 is in the last 100 addresses","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"581526","poster":"[Removed]"}],"timestamp":"1692264480.0","content":"A, C and D are true (i guess in exam it's check all that apply).\n\n10.1.4.0/23 = 10.1.4.0 255.255.254.0\nRange is 10.1.4.0 - 10.1.5.255\n10.1.4.0 = network address\n10.1.5.255 = broadcast address","poster":"MeganONO","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"You are tasked to configure the DHCP server to lease the last 100 usable IP addresses in subnet 10.1.4.0/23.\nWhich of the following IP addresses could be leased as a result of the new configuration?","unix_timestamp":1613561280,"timestamp":"2021-02-17 12:28:00","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/44977-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-281-discussion/"},{"id":"PAm6aOQw9PEBm3VJas8I","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"9","timestamp":"1631453340.0","content":"tshark -f \"net 192.168.8.0/24\" is working for me.
