Fire suppression systems are designed to detect and extinguish fires in their early stages, before they can spread and cause significant damage. These systems can use a variety of methods to suppress fires, including the use of water, foam, and chemicals, as well as the use of inert gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon, which can displace oxygen and prevent the fire from spreading. Fire suppression systems are commonly used in commercial and industrial settings, such as data centers, laboratories, and manufacturing facilities, where the risk of fire is high and the potential damage from a fire can be significant.","poster":"thetha","timestamp":"1727260080.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"unix_timestamp":1679747280,"choices":{"C":"Fire sprinkler","D":"Fire suppression system","B":"Fire alarm system","A":"Gaseous fire suppression"},"answer_description":"","topic":"1","exam_id":173,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/103851-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-272-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-03-25 13:28:00","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following is a term to describe the use of inert gases and chemical agents to extinguish a fire?"},{"id":"1Rq66mUecUxtj5rW2WOY","topic":"1","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which of the following tools is used to ping a given range of IP addresses and resolve the host name of the remote system?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"I_know_everything","content":"A is true for windows: but nmap uses reverse dns by default to resolve hostnames\nA 0r B are valid answers here.","comment_id":"1167022","timestamp":"1725605880.0"},{"content":"correct https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscan","poster":"alvaroestebancta","timestamp":"1647359220.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"445246"}],"question_id":32,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/62112-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-275-discussion/","choices":{"A":"SuperScan","C":"Hping","D":"Nmap","B":"Netscan"},"timestamp":"2021-09-15 15:47:00","answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","exam_id":173,"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1631713620,"question_images":[]},{"id":"2kwqpp60ht0ROwJ87QZG","exam_id":173,"discussion":[{"content":"DH in DH-CHAP means \"Difffe-Hellman\" - thus implying a key exchange.

It provides an attacker access to the real operating system without any restriction.\nA high-interaction honeypot is a powerful weapon that provides opportunities to discover new tools, to identify new vulnerabilities in the operating system, and to learn how blackhats communicate with one another.\nAnswer option D is incorrect. A low-interaction honeypot captures limited amounts of information that are mainly transactional data and some limited interactive information. Because of simple design and basic functionality, low-interaction honeypots are easy to install, deploy, maintain, and configure. A low-interaction honeypot detects unauthorized scans or unauthorized connection attempts. A low-interaction honeypot is like a one-way connection, as the honeypot provides services that are limited to listening ports. Its role is very passive and does not alter any traffic. It generates logs or alerts when incoming packets match their patterns.\nAnswer option B is incorrect. A medium-interaction honeypot offers richer interaction capabilities than a low-interaction honeypot, but does not provide any real underlying operating system target. Installing and configuring a medium-interaction honeypot takes more time than a low-interaction honeypot. It is also more complicated to deploy and maintain as compared to a low-interaction honeypot. A medium-interaction honeypot captures a greater amount of information but comes with greater risk. Answer option C is incorrect. Honeyd is an example of a low-interaction honeypot.","question_text":"Which of the following honeypots provides an attacker access to the real operating system without any restriction and collects a vast amount of information about the attacker?"}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"name":"312-38","numberOfQuestions":188,"id":173,"isBeta":false,"provider":"Eccouncil","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":7},"__N_SSP":true}
