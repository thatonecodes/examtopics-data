Attackers perform wireless sniffing by simply tuning a receiver to the target transmission frequency and identifying the target communication protocol used. Attackers analyze the captured traffic to perform further attacks on the target network. To sniff wireless traffic, an attacker needs to enable the monitor mode on their Wi-Fi card.\nAll Wi-Fi cards do not support the monitor mode in Windows. The following link can be used to check whether\na Wi-Fi card supports https://secwiki.org/w/Npcap/WiFi_adapters\nAttackers use tools such as Wireshark with Npcap, SteelCentral Packet Analyzer, OmniPeek Network Protocol Analyzer, CommView for Wi-Fi, and Kismet to sniff wireless networks.","timestamp":"1665615120.0"},{"timestamp":"1731337680.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nChatGPT answer:\nC. tshark\n Explanation: tshark is a network protocol analyzer that works on the command line. It is part of the Wireshark suite and is available for various platforms, including Linux. tshark allows users to capture and analyze network traffic, making it a passive tool for inspecting packets.\n\nWhy the answer is not Kismet?\n Explanation: Kismet is primarily focused on wireless networks. It operates almost entirely passively, collecting and sorting wireless data. While it can be used for analyzing wireless packets, it is not designed for active attacks. Kismet is often associated with Linux-based systems, although versions exist for other platforms. It is used for monitoring and analyzing wireless network activity rather than actively interacting with the network.\n\nIn this context, both tshark and Kismet can be considered passive wireless packet analyzers, but tshark is more generalized for overall network traffic analysis, while Kismet is specialized for wireless network monitoring.","comment_id":"1067911","upvote_count":"1","poster":"YourFriendlyNeighborhoodSpider"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nKismet is an 802.11 Layer-2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection\nsystem.
