Unlike HDDs (hard disk drives), SSDs do not have moving parts. HDDs use spinning disks and moving read/write heads, while SSDs use NAND flash memory for data storage, making them more robust and less prone to mechanical failures.\n\nOption B is false. SSDs do not use traditional tracks, clusters, and sectors like HDDs. Data storage in SSDs is based on NAND flash memory cells, pages, and blocks.\n\nOption D is false. SSDs are designed to store non-volatile data, which means the data remains stored even when the power is turned off. Non-volatile memory ensures that data is retained over time without the need for constant power supply, making SSDs suitable for storing and retrieving data even when the device is powered off.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"581777a"}],"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":176,"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer":"C","question_text":"Which of the following statements is true with respect to SSDs (solid-state drives)?","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"Faster data access, lower power usage, and higher reliability are some of the major advantages of SSDs over HDDs","B":"SSDs contain tracks, clusters, and sectors to store data","A":"Like HDDs, SSDs also have moving parts","D":"SSDs cannot store non-volatile data"},"timestamp":"2023-08-22 21:39:00","unix_timestamp":1692733140,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/118761-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-624-discussion/","topic":"1","question_id":439,"question_images":[]},{"id":"eJ88SlzDfXHNftUaDguq","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"9150/9151","A":"49664/49665","B":"49667/49668","D":"7680"},"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"987722","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724355660.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. 9150/9151\n\nWhen the Tor Browser is installed on a Windows machine, it uses port numbers 9150 and 9151 to establish a network connection via Tor nodes.
