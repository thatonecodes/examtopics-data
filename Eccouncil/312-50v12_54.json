DHCP starvation\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe scenario describes an attack in which Abel launched a DHCP starvation attack on the client organization's DHCP servers. A DHCP starvation attack is a type of DoS attack that involves flooding the DHCP server with forged DHCP requests in an attempt to lease all available IP addresses in the DHCP scope. This causes the server to run out of available IP addresses, and as a result, legitimate clients are unable to obtain an IP address and connect to the network.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1712246940.0","comment_id":"861275"}],"exam_id":180,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"DHCP starvation","A":"Rogue DHCP server attack","C":"STP attack","B":"VLAN hopping"},"question_id":266,"answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1680624540},{"id":"QeAaozJShaYNciHaXweQ","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Blowfish encryption algorithm","C":"IDEA","A":"HMAC encryption algorithm","B":"Twofish encryption algorithm"},"answer":"B","answer_description":"","question_id":267,"exam_id":180,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/105156-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-57-discussion/","topic":"1","question_text":"This form of encryption algorithm is a symmetric key block cipher that is characterized by a 128-bit block size, and its key size can be up to 256 bits.

Spoofed session flood attack\n\nExplanation:\n\nJude used a spoofed session flood attack to bypass the network protection tools and firewalls used in his company's network infrastructure. This attack technique involves creating forged TCP sessions by sending multiple SYN, ACK, RST, or FIN packets to the target system. By doing so, the attacker can exhaust the target system's resources and make it unresponsive to legitimate requests.\n\nIn a spoofed session flood attack, the attacker sends packets with a forged source IP address, making it difficult for the target system to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic. This makes it easier for the attacker to bypass network protection tools and firewalls, which may be configured to block traffic from known malicious IP addresses.","comment_id":"861279","timestamp":"1712247120.0","poster":"eli117"},{"poster":"insaniunt","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1092904","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Attackers employ this attack to bypass firewalls and perform DDoS attacks against target networks, exhausting their network resources. \nThe following are examples for spoofed session flood attacks: \n\n ▪ Multiple SYN-ACK Spoofed Session Flood Attack \nIn this type of flood attack, attackers create a fake session with multiple SYN and multiple ACK packets, along with one or more RST or FIN packets.\n ▪ Multiple ACK Spoofed Session Flood Attack \nIn this type of flood attack, attackers create a fake session by completely skipping SYN packets and using only multiple ACK packets along with one or more RST or FIN packets. Because SYN packets are not employed and firewalls mostly use SYN packet filters to detect abnormal traffic, the DDoS detection rate of the firewalls is very low for these types of attacks.\n\nCEH V12 Page 1449"},{"comment_id":"997409","poster":"pashte2307","timestamp":"1725347760.0","content":"A: Spoofed session flood attack","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
