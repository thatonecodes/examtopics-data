The spokes access the VPN through the hub. This topology is mainly used in banking and international organizations. The hub controls two types of communication: \n  Communication between a spoke and a hub\n  Communication between the spokes\nThis topology is used to represent an intranet VPN connecting an organization’s main office to its regional offices. The hubs facilitate the sharing of numerous amounts of data. There are separate tunnels for data transfer between the hub and the spoke. All the data transfers happen through the hub.
