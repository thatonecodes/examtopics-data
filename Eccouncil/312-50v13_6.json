The organization has adopted a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)policy, but they have recently experienced a phishing incident where an employee's device was compromised. In the investigation, you discovered that the phishing attack occurred through a third-party email app that the employee had installed. Given the need to balance security and user autonomy under the BYOD policy, how should the organization mitigate the risk of such incidents? Moreover, consider a measure that would prevent similar attacks without overly restricting the use of personal devices.","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"killwitch","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSince the phishing attack occurred via a third-party email app on an employee’s BYOD device, the best approach is to implement a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution that:\n- Restricts the installation of non-approved applications, ensuring that only secure and vetted apps are used.\n- Enforces security policies, such as requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption.\n- Monitors and manages mobile devices while respecting user privacy.\n\nThis reduces the attack surface while allowing employees to continue using their personal devices under the BYOD policy.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1399826","timestamp":"1742242020.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1399041","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn a BYOD environment, security policies must strike a balance between protecting company data and allowing user autonomy.
