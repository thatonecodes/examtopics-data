Parameter tampering.\nThe user was manually typing in different user ID numbers, which suggests that they were attempting to manipulate the user ID parameter to gain unauthorized access or perform actions as a different user. This is a classic example of parameter tampering, which is a type of web application attack where an attacker modifies input parameters to alter the behavior of the application.\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\nB. Cross-site scripting (XSS): A type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a website to steal data or take control of the user's session.\nC. SQL injection: A type of attack where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application's database to access or modify sensitive data.\nD.
