DROWN attack\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe scenario describes a vulnerability where the web server permits SSLv2 connections and the same private key certificate is used on a different server that also allows SSLv2 connections. This is a security weakness because SSLv2 is a deprecated and insecure protocol that is susceptible to attacks.\n\nOne attack that can be performed by exploiting this vulnerability is the DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption) attack. This attack allows an attacker to decrypt intercepted SSL traffic by exploiting a vulnerability in the SSLv2 protocol.\n\nIn the DROWN attack, the attacker first sends specially crafted packets to the SSLv2 server to obtain data encrypted with the server's private key. The attacker can then use this data to decrypt intercepted SSL traffic that was encrypted with the same private key.","poster":"eli117"},{"poster":"insaniunt","comment_id":"1092893","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

The -D flag\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe scenario describes a specific condition for a penetration testing scan, where the tester is required to scan every port on a server several times using a set of spoofed source IP addresses. The tester is using Nmap to perform the scan and needs to know which flag to use to satisfy this requirement.\n\nThe -D flag is used in Nmap to specify a decoy scan. A decoy scan involves sending packets with spoofed IP addresses in order to disguise the true source of the scan. This can be used to make it more difficult for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to detect the scan, as well as to confuse the target system about the true source of the traffic.\n\nTo use the -D flag, the tester specifies a list of decoy IP addresses to be used in the scan. These decoy addresses will be interspersed with the true source IP address in the scan traffic.","comment_id":"861265","timestamp":"1696435080.0"},{"timestamp":"1718502000.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
