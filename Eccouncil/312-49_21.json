If you *have* to start up a victim computer, then you would modify the BIOS to boot from USB, and remove SecureBoot, then boot up from the USB. But I wouldn't even do this.

You DO NOT REMOVE THE CMOS. the CMOS battery will 100% alter data. Changing the boot device does not mess with integrity whatsoever. \n\nImagine if the hard drive being investigated had macros enabled for if certain keystrokes were not pressed upon boot that all data on the hard drive gets erased. Since you booted to that hard drive still and did not implement the proper keystrokes, now data is erased and the investigation gets thrown out. Things can happen on boot so changing the boot order is the proper answer here.
