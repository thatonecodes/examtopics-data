Inspect the IoT HVAC system for backdoor access\n\nThe textbook emphasizes the importance of identifying potential security breaches such as backdoor access, especially when anomalous behavior (like unexpected traffic) is observed. This inspection helps ensure that there are no unauthorized entry points or malicious control over the IoT devices.\n\nWhile DDoS attacks are a concern, the initial focus should be on investigating possible direct compromises or vulnerabilities, such as backdoors, that could be exploited.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1252828","timestamp":"1721624100.0","poster":"aqeel1506"}],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1721624100,"exam_id":176},{"id":"v1B4MzORDg9HRSh1y31M","topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-07-22 07:44:00","answer_ET":"B","question_id":492,"exam_id":176,"question_text":"A digital forensics investigator performs a browser history analysis after a suspected breach.
