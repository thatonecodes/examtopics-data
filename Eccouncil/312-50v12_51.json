Change SNMP to SNMP V3.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol used for managing and monitoring network devices, such as routers, switches, and servers. SNMP uses UDP port 161 for communication. However, SNMP V1 and V2 use clear text community strings for authentication, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping and other attacks.\n\nTo secure SNMP traffic, Bill should change the SNMP version to SNMP V3, which provides enhanced security features, such as authentication, encryption, and message integrity. SNMP V3 requires a username and password for authentication, and it supports encryption of the data being transmitted.","timestamp":"1712244300.0","comment_id":"861230","poster":"eli117"},{"timestamp":"1735552080.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nChange SNMP to SNMP V3","comment_id":"1334016","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Mann098"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1092811","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
