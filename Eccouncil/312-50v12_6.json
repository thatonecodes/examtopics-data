SMB is a network protocol used for sharing files, printers, and other resources between computers on a network. It runs on TCP port 445 and is commonly used in Windows-based networks. Banner grabbing is a technique used to obtain information about a target system, including the OS details and versions of services running. By enumerating the SMB service, Lawrence may be able to obtain information about the shares, users, and other resources available on the target system.","timestamp":"1696506840.0","poster":"eli117","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"862072"}],"question_text":"During the enumeration phase, Lawrence performs banner grabbing to obtain information such as OS details and versions of services running.
