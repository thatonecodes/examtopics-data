For example, an attacker might request an authorized person to unlock a security door, saying that they have forgotten their ID badge. In the interest of common courtesy, the authorized person will allow the attacker to pass through the door.\n\nTailgating \nTailgating implies accessing a building or secured area without the consent of the authorized\nperson. It is the act of following an authorized person through a secure entrance, as a polite user would open and hold the door for those following them. An attacker, wearing a fake badge, might attempt to enter the secured area by closely following an authorized person through a door that requires key access.

(Protocol no:50)\n\nAH provides authentication, integrity and anti-replay services at Network Layer and above.\nESP provides authentication, integrity, anti-replay and confidentiality services at Transport Layer and above.\nHence, we can say, IPSec(AH+ESP) operates at Network Layer and provide security services at Network and above layers.\n\nA note on IKE protocol\nIts imperative that, if two entities want to communicate securely, they should share secret keys to set up a secure connection, encrypt and decrypt messages etc. Hence, Apart from AH and ESP , most of the IPSec implementations also use a Key exchange and management protocol that generates, negotiates and manages secret keys for establishing a secure channel between communicating entities.
