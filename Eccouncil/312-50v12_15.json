This adversary meticulously crafts 'q' malicious SQL queries, each inducing a delay of 'd' seconds in the server response. This delay in response is an indicator of a potential attack. If the total delay, represented by the product 'q*d', crosses a defined threshold 'T', an alert is activated in your security system. Furthermore, it is observed that the attacker prefers prime numbers for 'q', and 'd' follows a pattern in the Fibonacci sequence. Now, consider 'd=13' seconds (a Fibonacci number) and various values of 'q' (a prime number) and 'T'. Which among the following scenarios will most likely trigger an alert?","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1723334760.0","poster":"insaniunt","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA -> \nq=17 \nd=13\n17*13 = 221 seconds ( greater than T = 220)","comment_id":"1146936"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nif q*d > T == alert\n\n A) 221 > 220 = alert\n B) 169 < 180\n C) 143 <150\n D) 247 <260","comment_id":"1143547","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1723042800.0","poster":"qwerty100"}],"exam_id":180,"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"L2eLqMdhnmVicCYmSVt8","timestamp":"2024-02-06 22:38:00","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"B.
