The hidden message and the corresponding stego-image are known.\nIn Steganalysis, a Known-stego attack is a scenario where the analyst has access to both the hidden message (the secret information) and the corresponding stego-image (the image with the hidden message). This allows the analyst to compare the two and potentially identify the steganography method used.\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\nB. This describes an Active attack, where the attacker can modify the cover object (e.g., image) during communication.\nC. This describes a Known-cover attack, where the original cover object and the stego-object are available, and the steganography algorithm is known.\nD. This describes a Blind attack, where only the steganography medium (e.g., image) is available for analysis, without any knowledge of the hidden message or cover object.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"aqeel1506","timestamp":"1721498220.0","comment_id":"1251890"},{"timestamp":"1718231100.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe attacker knows the steganography algorithm as well as original and stego-object.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Elb","comment_id":"1229523"},{"poster":"Elb","timestamp":"1718230980.0","content":"Known-stego Attack In this attack, the attacker knows the steganography algorithm as well as original and stego-object.
