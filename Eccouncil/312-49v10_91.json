Among the types of blobs available in Azure Blob Storage, Page blob is the most suitable for storing OS disks, as they support random read/write operations and can handle large data files efficiently.

Medium blob is an outdated term and not a valid blob type in Azure Blob Storage. Block blob is designed for storing text and binary data as blocks and is commonly used for storing files and data objects.
