Zombie\n\nhttps://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html\n\n\"The first step in executing an IP ID idle scan is to find an appropriate zombie. It needs to assign IP ID packets incrementally on a global (rather than per-host it communicates with) basis. It should be idle (hence the scan name), as extraneous traffic will bump up its IP ID sequence, confusing the scan logic. The lower the latency between the attacker and the zombie, and between the zombie and the target, the faster the scan will proceed.\"\n\nto paraphrase: zombie should be idle\n\n-----\nIf you agree, please UPVOTE.\nEach time you upvote someone with contributor access (like me) your vote is added to the Community Vote Distribution, which helps the entire community.","comment_id":"1387675","poster":"044f354","timestamp":"1741734900.0"},{"poster":"Toni222","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1721110920.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAn 'idle' system is commonly referred to a PC that is turned on but not currently running any applications or tasks.
