Packet fragmentation scanning is a technique used to evade firewalls by fragmenting packets to bypass firewall rules. In this technique, the attacker sends a large packet that is broken down into smaller fragments. The fragments are sent to the target system and are reassembled by the system's TCP/IP stack. The firewall may only inspect the first fragment, allowing the subsequent fragments to bypass the firewall rules. The attacker may use a zombie system with low network activity to generate fragmented packets with random fragment identification numbers to evade detection.\nIn contrast, the technique mentioned in the question uses the fragmentation identification numbers of a zombie system to evade firewall scanning. Therefore, the correct answer is A, packet fragmentation scanning."},{"poster":"sausageman","comment_id":"872882","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Packet fragmentation scanning\n\nPacket fragmentation scanning involves breaking up packets into smaller fragments to evade firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS) rules that are configured to block or detect packets of a certain size or pattern. By using a zombie system with low network activity, the attacker can minimize the chances of detection and increase the chances of successful evasion.
