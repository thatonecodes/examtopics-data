ACK flag probe scan\n\nIn an ACK flag probe scan, the scanner sends TCP ACK packets to various ports on the target host. If the target host responds with an RST packet, it indicates that the port is closed. However, if there is no response or a different response is received, it suggests that the port is open or filtered.\n\nThe other scanning techniques mentioned are as follows:\n\nA. Xmas scan: This scan involves sending packets with the FIN, URG, and PUSH flags set, probing the target host for open ports.\n\nB. IDLE/IPID header scan: This scan examines the IP ID field in the packet header to determine if it increments predictably, indicating the presence of an open port.\n\nC.
