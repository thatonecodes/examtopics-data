Network: Correct – Routers operate at the Network layer (Layer 3).\nB. Transport: Incorrect – Deals with end-to-end communication protocols like TCP/UDP, not routers.\nC.

This layer is responsible for framing, error control, and flow control of data transmitted over a network.\nAt the Data Link layer, you can see packet headers, MAC addresses, and other information related to the local network segment. This allows you to monitor and analyze traffic to and from the router, including potential attacker activity.\nA. Network (Layer 3): This layer is responsible for routing and addressing, but you're not monitoring at this layer with Ethereal.\nB. Transport (Layer 4): This layer is responsible for reliable data transfer, but you're not monitoring at this layer with Ethereal.\nD. Session (Layer 5): This layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating connections, but you're not monitoring at this layer with Ethereal.","poster":"aqeel1506","timestamp":"1721304540.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1719458760.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCapturing you do at datalink layer","comment_id":"1237854","poster":"ala76nl","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"You have been called in to help with an investigation of an alleged network intrusion. After questioning the members of the company IT department, you search through the server log files to find any trace of the intrusion. After that you decide to telnet into one of the company routers to see if there is any evidence to be found. While connected to the router, you see some unusual activity and believe that the attackers are currently connected to that router. You start up an ethereal session to begin capturing traffic on the router that could be used in the investigation.

The data link layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of data frames within a local network.\n\nWhen a NIC is in promiscuous mode, it captures and processes all data frames on the network segment to which it is connected, regardless of whether the frames are intended for that specific NIC or not. This mode allows the sniffer to intercept and analyze network traffic, including Ethernet frames, without being restricted to only capturing the frames specifically addressed to its own MAC (Media Access Control) address.\n\nPromiscuous mode is often used in network monitoring and packet analysis tools, such as network analyzers and protocol analyzers, to capture and inspect network traffic for troubleshooting, security, and analysis purposes. It enables the collection of data at a lower network layer, which can be useful for diagnosing network issues, monitoring security, and examining network behavior.\n\n--> Data link","comment_id":"1063122","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1699203240.0"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"Elb","comment_id":"962029","timestamp":"1690231020.0","content":"D:\nA NIC covers layers 1 and 2. \nPromiscuous mode is when the NIC ignores the destination MAC address which is part of layer 2."},{"timestamp":"1646909400.0","content":"D. data link layer","comment_id":"564740","upvote_count":"3","poster":"K3nz0420"},{"comment_id":"558959","poster":"AspiringScriptKiddie","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1646160840.0","content":"Only the physical NIC card can be considered layer 1.
