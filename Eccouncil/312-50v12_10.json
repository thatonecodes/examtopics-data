Here’s how:\n\n Exploiting Debugging Functions: Debugging tools often have elevated privileges and direct access to the system memory and processes. If an attacker gains access to these debugging functions, they can manipulate the system in various ways, including injecting malicious code.\n\n\nDLL injection is a technique used to run malicious code within the address space of another process by loading a dynamic link library (DLL).
