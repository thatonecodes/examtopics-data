It uses a two-part key. The private key is kept by the owner; the public key is published.\nData are encrypted by using the recipient's public key, which can only be decrypted by the recipient's private key. RSA is very computation intensive, thus it is often used to create a digital envelope, which holds an RSA-encrypted DES key and DES-encrypted data. This method encrypts the secret DES key so that it can be transmitted over the network, but encrypts and decrypts the actual message using the much faster DES algorithm.","comment_id":"159614","timestamp":"1723867920.0"},{"content":"ES is a symmetric algorithm which uses the same 128, 192, or 256 bit key for both encryption and decryption (the security of an AES system increases exponentially with key length).

Scanning every port of every single IP address is slow and usually unnecessary. Of course what makes a host interesting depends greatly on the scan purposes. Network administrators may only be interested in hosts running a certain service, while security auditors may care about every single device with an IP address. An administrator may be comfortable using just an ICMP ping to locate hosts on his internal network, while an external penetration tester may use a diverse set of dozens of probes in an attempt to evade firewall restrictions.","comment_id":"159887","timestamp":"1723890900.0"}],"answer":"C","answer_images":[]},{"id":"gSk5aMTsHM6om5ambJgm","exam_id":178,"isMC":true,"question_id":40,"timestamp":"2020-08-17 12:51:00","choices":{"D":"The hacker successfully transferred the zone and enumerated the hosts.","B":"The hacker used the \"fierce\" tool to brute force the list of available domains.","A":"The hacker used who is to gather publicly available records for the domain.","C":"The hacker listed DNS records on his own domain."},"answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/28831-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-157-discussion/","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03167/0006900001.png"],"answer":"D","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"question_text":"Look at the following output.
