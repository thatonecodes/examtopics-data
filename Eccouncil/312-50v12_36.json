She was tasked with ensuring the authentication and integrity of messages being transmitted in the corporate network. To encrypt the messages, she implemented a security model in which every user in the network maintains a ring of public keys. In this model, a user needs to encrypt a message using the receiver’s public key, and only the receiver can decrypt the message using their private key.\n\nWhat is the security model implemented by Jane to secure corporate messages?","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1708775940,"answer":"D","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_id":177,"exam_id":180,"timestamp":"2024-02-24 12:59:00","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Secure Socket Layer (SSL)","D":"Web of trust (WOT)","C":"Transport Layer Security (TLS)","A":"Zero trust network"},"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/134513-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-258-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nCEHv12 3405 - D","timestamp":"1727979720.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"LordXander","comment_id":"1188822"},{"poster":"insaniunt","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724609580.0","comment_id":"1159136","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

This means inserting the attacker’s device into the communication flow in a way that allows them to intercept, modify, or block the data being exchanged without the original devices noticing. This is more aggressive and direct in terms of interaction compared to merely tracking.\n\nThus, while option A is very relevant for understanding the dynamics of the communication and could be a precursor to an effective hijacking (by knowing where and how to hijack), it does not by itself perform the action of hijacking. Therefore, it's correct to say that option A could be part of the process leading up to a hijack, but it isn't the command that would be used to execute the hijacking. The specific action of hijacking in Btlejack is indicated by the -j flag, as shown in option D.","comment_id":"1204070"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nCEHv12 2538","comment_id":"1188824","poster":"LordXander","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727979780.0"},{"poster":"insaniunt","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1724609820.0","comment_id":"1159138","content":"Selected Answer: A\nModule 16 Page 2538"},{"timestamp":"1724431680.0","poster":"Lunko","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nHijacking a BLE connection\nBtlejack is also able to hijack an existing connection, use the -t option to do so.
