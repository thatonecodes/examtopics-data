Sparse or Logical Acquisition.\nWhen acquiring data from RAID storage, a sparse or logical acquisition is recommended to retrieve only the data relevant to the investigation. This method captures only the logical files and folders, without duplicating redundant data or acquiring unused space on the RAID array. This approach helps to reduce the amount of data to be analyzed and minimizes the risk of data overload.\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\nA. Static Acquisition: This method involves creating a bit-for-bit copy of the entire RAID array, including unused space and redundant data.\nC. Bit-stream disk-to-disk Acquisition: Similar to static acquisition, this method creates an exact replica of the entire RAID array, including unused space and redundant data.\nD. Bit-by-bit Acquisition: This method is similar to static acquisition, but is typically used for single disks, not RAID arrays."},{"content":"B: A logical acquisition captures only specific files of interest to the case or specific types of files. A sparse acquisition is similar but also collects fragments of unallocated (deleted) data; use this method only when you don't need to examine the entire drive.","comment_id":"962596","poster":"Elb","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1690281660.0"}],"exam_id":176,"question_images":[]},{"id":"AIgUzyVkLUBuUb3WJ4Os","timestamp":"2024-05-17 15:38:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/140795-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-312-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1715953080,"exam_id":176,"answer_ET":"A","answer":"A","answers_community":[],"question_text":"Which of the following stages in a Linux boot process involve initialization of the system's hardware?","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"aqeel1506","content":"Here's a brief overview of the other options:\nB.

Client Misassociation\n\n▪ Client Misassociation\nA client misassociation attack begins when a client attaches to an access point that is not in their own network. Due to the manner in which wireless signals propagate through walls and other structures, a client system may detect an access point belonging to another network and attach to it, either accidently or intentionally. In either case, the client may attach to a network that is unsafe, perhaps while still being connected to a secure network. This last scenario can result in a malicious party gaining access into a protected network\n\nOfficial EC Council Curriculum \nComputer Hacking Forensic Investigator \nExam 312-49\n\nNetwork Forensics\nModule 08 Page 786","comment_id":"1325989","upvote_count":"1","poster":"044f354","timestamp":"1734059220.0"},{"content":"B:\nThe AP allows connectivity to the Internet but is not actually on your corporate wired network.
