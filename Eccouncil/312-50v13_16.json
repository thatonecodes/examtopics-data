Unlike ICMP-based scans, which are often blocked by firewalls, SYN scans can work even if ICMP traffic is restricted. Firewalls may allow SYN packets through to specific services, making this technique useful in restricted environments.","poster":"KiranYS"},{"timestamp":"1739643300.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1356977","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIn a firewalled and heavily filtered network, a TCP SYN Ping Scan is the best host discovery method.
