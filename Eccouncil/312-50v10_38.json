Think about this at the personal level. You can't leave your house without taking the risk of being hurt - by a falling meteor, a texting driver, or a rabid raccoon.

Once you treat the risks, you won’t completely eliminate all the risks because it is simply not possible – therefore, some risks will remain at a certain level, and this is what residual risks are.

The gateway is not routing to a public IP address.\n\nExplanation:\nThe role of the gateway in a local network is to serve as an access point to another network, typically the Internet. If a device can communicate with others on the local network but not with the Internet, it's possible that the gateway isn't properly routing traffic to the Internet. The fact that the computer and gateway are on the same subnet (192.168.1.0/24) confirms that they can communicate with each other, so the issue is likely with the gateway's connection or routing to the public network.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Aalkinani"},{"timestamp":"1705588380.0","poster":"BlackAdam","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. The gateway and the computer are not on the same network.\n\nIn this scenario, the computer's IP address and default gateway are both on the 192.168.1.0/24 network. However, the computer is unable to reach the Internet while still being able to transfer files locally. This suggests that the issue lies in the network configuration.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that the gateway configured on the computer is not the correct one for accessing the Internet. The gateway should be the IP address of the device that provides access to networks outside of the local network (in this case, the Internet). Since the computer can communicate with other machines on the local network, it indicates that the local network is functioning properly.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the technician should verify the correct IP address of the gateway device that provides Internet connectivity and update the computer's network configuration accordingly.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"955401"}],"question_id":188,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1689683580,"exam_id":178,"question_text":"A technician is resolving an issue where a computer is unable to connect to the Internet using a wireless access point.
