Performing content enumeration using a wordlist\nUsing a wordlist allows you to provide a list of potential directory and file names for Gobuster to check on the web server. This method is efficient and targeted, as it focuses on known paths rather than attempting to bruteforce or randomly guess filenames. It's generally faster and more effective than bruteforcing or using random file extensions.","poster":"insaniunt","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1107162"},{"comment_id":"899372","poster":"victorfs","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Performing content enumeration using a wordlist is the fastest way to perform content enumeration on a given web server using the Gobuster tool. This is because a wordlist includes common paths, directories, and files that are likely to exist on the web server, and it is a pre-built list, so there is no need to generate a list on the fly. This approach avoids the overhead of trying to brute force filenames or extensions and reduces the time it takes to discover content.","comment_id":"861424","poster":"eli117"}],"answer_description":"","question_id":311,"unix_timestamp":1680634680,"exam_id":180},{"id":"xyJlsdbDcoyyFLGX4Fka","answers_community":["D (88%)","12%"],"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2023-04-04 21:00:00","question_text":"When analyzing the IDS logs, the system administrator noticed an alert was logged when the external router was accessed from the administrator’s Computer to update the router configuration.\nWhat type of an alert is this?","unix_timestamp":1680634800,"question_id":312,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"909542","content":"Selected Answer: D\nfrom the reponse of hasib125 - V10 Q213 - \nD.

The best answer is a Benign Positive, since the alert is doing a true detection, but the activity isn't malicious. Unfortunately EC-Council does not list \"Benign Positive\" as one of the answers on the pick list. According to NIST SP 800-86 pages 6-13 and C-1, a benign positive is a type of false positive. See also https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/false_positive. So the best answer of the ones listed is D.
