Accepting the risk means acknowledging and monitoring the residual risk while carrying on with the project. The other options would involve additional cost, effort, or project changes that may not be necessary, given that the current risk level is below the established threshold.","poster":"qovert","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727555100.0","comment_id":"853679"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1726952220.0","content":"C.

Specifically, \"-F\" option tells nmap to scan only the most commonly used 100 ports, rather than scanning all 65535 ports.\n\nThis can be useful when time is a critical factor and a quick overview of the open ports on a target system is needed. By scanning fewer ports, the scan can be completed more quickly and with less network traffic, which can be useful in situations where a more comprehensive scan is not necessary or not practical due to time constraints.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that scanning fewer ports may also lead to missing some important information, especially if the target system is using non-standard ports or services.
