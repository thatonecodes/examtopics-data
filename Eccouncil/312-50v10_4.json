Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will see no response.\n\nTo get the correct IP TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the gateway we need to ramp up hop-counts. We do this in the same manner that traceroute works. Once we have the gateway hopcount (at that point the scan is said to be `bound`) we can begin our scan.\n\nIt is significant to note the fact that the ultimate destination host does not have to be reached. It just needs to be somewhere downstream, on the other side of the gateway, from the scanning host.","timestamp":"1722333900.0","comment_id":"147272","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks"}],"unix_timestamp":1596103500,"answer_description":"","answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2020-07-30 12:05:00","choices":{"D":"Network sniffing","C":"Man-in-the middle attack","B":"Firewalking","A":"Session hijacking"},"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/26984-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-131-discussion/"}],"exam":{"provider":"Eccouncil","name":"312-50v10","numberOfQuestions":203,"isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true,"id":178,"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":4},"__N_SSP":true}
