A kernel-level rootkit runs in Ring-0 with the highest OS privileges. These cover backdoors on the computer and are created by writing additional code, or by substituting portions of kernel code with modified code via device drivers in Windows or loadable kernel modules in Linux.

It can be URLs, file names and hashes, domain names, IP addresses, etc. Its use ranges from blocking attacks to triaging and validating alerts and searching and eliminating specific threats within a network.\n\nIOCs usually become outdated in a matter of hours. Still, it is important to note that aging indicators aren’t good practice as threats may remain active for months or even years, continuing to pose danger to enterprises. As the most volatile of the three types of intelligence, Operational indicators should be closely vetted and monitored to assure their dependability. They are better consumed by tools like SPAM filters, firewalls, IDS/IPS, SIEM, SOAR, etc, helping security teams quickly respond to malicious campaigns.\n\nOperational threat intelligence indicators are collected from active campaigns, attacks performed against honeypots and data shared by third parties.\n\nhttps://www.malwarepatrol.net/three-types-of-cyber-threat-intelligence/","timestamp":"1694073840.0","poster":"gokhansah1n"},{"comment_id":"478950","content":"Technical Intelligence is Correct.\n\nIt also helps Incident Response teams identify malicious traffic and suspected IP addresses used to spread malware and spam mails.
