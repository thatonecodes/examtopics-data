The classification is based on heuristics or rules, rather than patterns or signatures, and attempts to detect any type of misuse that falls out of normal system operation. This is as opposed to signature-based systems, which can only detect attacks for which a signature has previously been created."},{"timestamp":"1704931020.0","content":"thats correct!!!","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"521196","poster":"egz21"},{"poster":"ANDRESCB1988","content":"correct","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1690086600.0","comment_id":"412236"}],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2021-07-23 06:30:00","question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","question_id":173,"unix_timestamp":1627014600},{"id":"P2dtETo03uW5UNRiEj1Q","question_images":[],"question_id":174,"choices":{"C":"Modification of a request by a proxy between client and server.","B":"A server making a request to another server without the user's knowledge","D":"A browser making a request to a server without the user's knowledge","A":"A request sent by a malicious user from a browser to a server"},"unix_timestamp":1627014600,"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"891185","content":"So, A is correct!? \nA request sent by a malicious user from a browser to a server.","timestamp":"1730966820.0","poster":"Muli_70","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"696871","timestamp":"1713329160.0","poster":"Daniel8660","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCross-site Request Forgery Attack (CSRF)\nCross-site request forgery (CSRF), also known as a one-click attack or session riding.The Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack exploits the victim’s active session with a trusted site to perform malicious activities.
