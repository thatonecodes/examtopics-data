Hybrid attack\n\nA hybrid attack combines dictionary and brute force attacks. It starts with a dictionary of common words or known information (like a year of birth) and then adds variations (e.g., adding numbers, symbols, or different letter cases) to crack passwords that are based on predictable patterns or known personal information. This method would be efficient for cracking a password that includes a known element like a year of birth.","poster":"aqeel1506"},{"comment_id":"1206070","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1714735200.0","poster":"Elb","content":"A.

In computer security, NOP sleds or NOP slides are used in buffer overflow attacks to achieve code execution by overwriting a program's instruction pointer to point to the beginning of the NOP sled, causing the program to execute the attacker's code.
