The psexec module is often used by penetration testers to obtain access to a given system that you already know the credentials for. It was written by sysinternals and has been integrated within the framework. Often as penetration testers, successfully gain access to a system through some exploit, use meterpreter to grab the passwords or other methods like fgdump, pwdump, or cachedump and then utilize rainbowtables to crack those hash values.\nWhich of the following is true hash type and sort order that is using in the psexec module's 'smbpass'?","unix_timestamp":1732432200,"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","isMC":true,"answers_community":[],"exam_id":177,"choices":{"C":"LM:NTLM","D":"NTLM:LM","A":"NT:LM","B":"LM:NT"},"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/151899-exam-312-50-topic-8-question-166-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732432200.0","comment_id":"1316952","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Chogi_","content":"Why not letter A.
