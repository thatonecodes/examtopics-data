In such cases, it may be necessary to initiate a process of transformation to replace the old system with a new one that is better suited to meet the current needs and requirements. This process of transformation may involve a complete overhaul of the existing system, including hardware, software, and processes, and can be complex and time-consuming.","comment_id":"850843","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1695718200.0","poster":"thetha"}],"choices":{"A":"Disaster","D":"Crisis","B":"Risk","C":"Threat"},"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"YeLbI4nblAzAUSGU5yT7","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-09-15 14:56:00","question_id":48,"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following types of RAID offers no protection for the parity disk?","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1631710560,"answers_community":["D (50%)","B (25%)","C (25%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/62106-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-318-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer":"D","exam_id":173,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1025490","poster":"remanche","timestamp":"1728118800.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAmong the options provided, RAID 5 (option C) offers no protection for the parity disk.
