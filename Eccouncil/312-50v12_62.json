Implement cognitive radios in the physical layer.\n\nCognitive radios can sense the environment, sense other RF devices' signals, and use different frequencies in response to the sensing results. This makes the device very flexible in terms of being able to adjust to different environments and also to be able to detect and evade jamming or scrambling attacks. By deploying cognitive radios, Mike can mitigate the effects of DoS/DDoS attacks that use jamming or scrambling techniques."}],"exam_id":180,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/105196-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-92-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1680634200,"topic":"1","question_id":306,"answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2023-04-04 20:50:00","choices":{"B":"Disable TCP SYN cookie protection","D":"Implement cognitive radios in the physical layer","C":"Allow the usage of functions such as gets and strcpy","A":"Allow the transmission of all types of addressed packets at the ISP level"}},{"id":"ikG3mFLsDUrSrqbwSAuL","question_text":"You are using a public Wi-Fi network inside a coffee shop.

You should check your ARP table and see if there is one IP address with two different MAC addresses.\n\nARP spoofing is a type of attack where an attacker sends fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of another host on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept and modify traffic intended for the victim. By checking the ARP table on your laptop, you can see if there is any IP address with two different MAC addresses, which would indicate an ARP spoofing attack is in progress.","upvote_count":"8","poster":"eli117"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1192353","content":"A: I saw this question somewhere else and the answer was \"check ARP table\".","timestamp":"1728486000.0","poster":"0ea2cf3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. You should check your ARP table and see if there is one IP address with two different MAC addresses\n\nARP spoofing is a method of attacking an Ethernet LAN. It succeeds by changing the IP address of the attacker’s computer to that of the target computer. A forged ARP request and reply packet can find a place in the target ARP cache in this process. As the ARP reply has been forged, the destination computer (target) sends frames to the attacker’s computer, where the attacker can modify the frames before sending them to the source machine (User A) in an MITM attack. -- Module 08, page 1258","comment_id":"1107139","poster":"insaniunt","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1719510780.0"},{"poster":"YourFriendlyNeighborhoodSpider","content":"Selected Answer: A\nChatGPT:\nAnswer: A. You should check your ARP table and see if there is one IP address with two different MAC addresses.\n\n Explanation:\n\n ARP spoofing (or ARP poisoning) involves manipulating the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache of a target device to associate its IP address with a different MAC address. This can be used for various malicious purposes, including intercepting network traffic.\n\n Checking the ARP table on your device is a common method to detect ARP spoofing. If there is an entry in the ARP table with the same IP address but different MAC addresses, it could indicate an ARP spoofing attack.\n\n The other options (B, C, D) do not specifically address ARP spoofing detection:\n Option B: Nmap can identify hosts on a network but may not directly detect ARP spoofing.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1068684","timestamp":"1715526300.0"},{"timestamp":"1715453100.0","poster":"VidiMidi","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1068107","content":"Selected Answer: A\narp -a\nThis will give you the ARP table\nThe table shows the IP addresses in the left column, and MAC addresses in the middle. If the table contains two different IP addresses that share the same MAC address, then you are probably undergoing an ARP poisoning attack.\n\nAs an example, let’s say that your ARP table contains a number of different addresses. When you scan through it, you may notice that two of the IP addresses have the same physical address. You might see something like this in your ARP table if you are actually being poisoned:\n\nInternet Address Physical Address\n192.168.0.1 00-17-31-dc-39-ab\n192.168.0.105 40-d4-48-cr-29-b2\n192.168.0.106 00-17-31-dc-39-ab\n\nAs you can see, both the first and the third MAC addresses match.
