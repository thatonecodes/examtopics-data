During forensic analysis, it was discovered that the malware was utilizing a blend of two highly sophisticated techniques to stay undetected and continue its operations.\nFirstly, the malware was embedding its harmful code into the actual binary or executable part of genuine system files rather than appending or prepending itself to the files. This made it exceptionally difficult to detect and eradicate, as doing so risked damaging the system files themselves.\nSecondly, the malware exhibited characteristics of a type of malware that changes its code as it propagates, making signature-based detection approaches nearly impossible.\nOn top of these, the malware maintained a persistent presence by installing itself in the registry, making it able to survive system reboots.\nGiven these distinctive characteristics, which two types of malware techniques does this malware most closely embody?","topic":"1","choices":{"C":"Macro and Rootkit malware","B":"Polymorphic and Macro malware","D":"Metamorphic and Rootkit malware","A":"Polymorphic and Metamorphic malware"},"exam_id":181,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/156615-exam-312-50v13-topic-1-question-207-discussion/"},{"id":"mpfoBJvGYydYNKCyASDP","exam_id":181,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nRule based attack is sophisticated by the use of patterns to guess the password.\nHybrid works by combining dictionary attack and some pattern.
