Is, obviously. And as application, that fw works at OSI layer 7.\n\nPoint is, what OSI layer that fw is inspecting. If you filter based on IP address (for example), you can say that your firewall is filtering at layer 3. If you filter specific ports, you can say you're filtering at layer 4. If your firewall inspects specific protocol states or data, you can say it operates at layer 7.\n\nSoftware fw usually inspects OSI layer 2 pdus.

The longer the malware stays in a system, the more iteration it produces and the more sophisticated the iterations are, making it increasingly hard for antivirus applications to detect or diffuse it. Polymorphic malware works by encrypting itself with a variable encryption key since the keys used for encryption are different so each copy looks different. But the virus decryption routine would remain constant and because of this static part of code, it gets easy for an antivirus program to identify the malware.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"https://pediaa.com/difference-between-polymorphic-and-metamorphic-virus/ \n\nJust a bad question again.
