Traffic is Blocked on TCP Port 80\n\nThe problem is likely that traffic is blocked on TCP port 80. TCP port 80 is the default port used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is the protocol used for web browsing. When you try to access websites using the URL (e.g., \"http://www.example.com\"), your browser communicates with the web server over TCP port 80 to retrieve the web pages.\n\nGiven that you can ping the servers and access them using their IP addresses, it indicates that the servers are reachable and responsive. However, the fact that you cannot access the websites using their URLs suggests that there may be an issue with the traffic on TCP port 80, which is used for regular web browsing.","timestamp":"1721480460.0"},{"content":"choice of B and D is same","comment_id":"35309","poster":"Jeremy95","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1609773300.0","comments":[{"content":"How is it the same?
