Jacob has implemented Encapsulating\nSecurity Payload (ESP) to encrypt IP traffic. Jacob wants to encrypt the IP traffic by inserting the ESP header in the IP datagram before the transport layer protocol header. What mode of ESP does Jacob need to use to encrypt the IP traffic?","answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728729780.0","comment_id":"333865","content":"In tunnel mode, IPsec encrypts both the IP payload and the header to protect an entire IP packet by encapsulating it with an AH or ESP header and an additional IP header. This mode is useful for protecting traffic between different networks and is primarily used for interoperability with gateways. The tunnel mode of IPsec is generally implemented in configurations such as gateway-to-gateway, server-to-gateway and server-to-server. The IPsec tunnel mode is useful in protecting traffic while it is passing through untrusted networks.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"ui"}],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","timestamp":"2021-04-12 12:43:00","unix_timestamp":1618224180,"answer_ET":"B","question_id":133,"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Jacob should utilize ESP in tunnel mode.","D":"He should use ESP in transport mode.","A":"Jacob should use ESP in pass-through mode.","C":"He should use ESP in gateway mode."},"question_images":[],"answer":"B","exam_id":173,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/49954-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-483-discussion/"},{"id":"AoYuUFY5mXWqqejIRhSy","question_images":[],"answer_description":"","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"A":"Network Logon Service (Netlogon)","C":"Security Reference Monitor (SRM)","B":"Security Accounts Manager (SAM)","D":"Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS)"},"unix_timestamp":1670049780,"topic":"1","answer":"C","answer_ET":"C","exam_id":173,"question_id":134,"timestamp":"2022-12-03 07:43:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/89829-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-488-discussion/","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Security Reference Monitor (SRM)\nSRM is responsible for controlling access of user(subject) to a resource(object)","poster":"tsungyu0923","upvote_count":"5","timestamp":"1701585780.0","comment_id":"734246"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nSRM is responsible for controlling access of user (subject) to a resource (object)","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1733408160.0","comment_id":"1088557","poster":"YanaC"},{"poster":"rich84","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720307580.0","comment_id":"945062","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"SRM is responsible for controlling access of user (object) to a resource (object)\", CND eBook page 540."},{"comment_id":"861213","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
