The organization has implemented a signature-based IDS, intrusion detection system, to detect known attack payloads and network flow analysis to monitor data entering and leaving the network. The organization is deliberating on the next step. Considering the information provided about various social engineering techniques, what should be the organization's next course of action?","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","answer":"D","answer_images":[],"question_id":36,"unix_timestamp":1742086560,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"choices":{"D":"Organize regular employee awareness training regarding social engineering techniques and preventive measures","A":"Implement endpoint detection and response solution to oversee endpoint activities","B":"Set up a honeypot to attract potential attackers into a controlled environment for analysis","C":"Deploy more security personnel to physically monitor key points of access"},"timestamp":"2025-03-16 01:56:00","exam_id":181,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"Gibsomd","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSocial engineering attacks primarily target human vulnerabilities rather than technical weaknesses.
