Enable encryption on the wireless network.\n\nEnabling encryption, specifically WPA3 or at least WPA2, on the wireless network is a crucial step in securing the communications between devices and the router. This encrypts the data transmitted over the Wi-Fi network, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to eavesdrop on and intercept the wireless communications.

The attacker should leverage a botnet to launch a Pulse Wave attack, sending high-volume traffic pulses at regular intervals\n\nA Pulse Wave DDoS attack is a sophisticated variation that involves alternating periods of attack intensity and brief pauses, making it more challenging for traditional mitigation techniques to detect and respond effectively. This approach can help the attacker achieve their objective of exhausting network resources while concealing their identity. Additionally, leveraging a botnet enhances the attacker's ability to generate a massive volume of traffic, making it even more challenging for the targeted online retailer to mitigate the attack.","poster":"insaniunt","timestamp":"1723338420.0","comment_id":"1146960","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"ldixon84304","timestamp":"1723201140.0","content":"I was thinking it was \"D\" due to anonymity being a requirement.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1145473"}],"exam_id":180,"timestamp":"2024-02-06 22:38:00","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1707255480,"answer":"B","topic":"1","choices":{"D":"The attacker should execute a simple ICMP flood attack from a single IP, exploiting the retailer's ICMP processing","C":"The attacker should initiate a volumetric flood attack using a single compromised machine to overwhelm the retailer's network bandwidth","B":"The attacker should leverage a botnet to launch a Pulse Wave attack, sending high-volume traffic pulses at regular intervals","A":"The attacker should instigate a protocol-based SYN flood attack, consuming connection state tables on the retailer's servers"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/133136-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-169-discussion/","question_id":78},{"id":"FMT95cGccs1eRZZCEreK","choices":{"B":"Persistence","D":"Preparation","A":"Initial intrusion","C":"Cleanup"},"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nPreparation\nInitial Intrusion\nExpansion\nPersistence\nSearch and Exfiltration\nClean up","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"946905","poster":"Vincent_Lu","timestamp":"1688883180.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nInitial Intrusion","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735450620.0","comment_id":"1333348","poster":"Mann098"},{"comment_id":"861063","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Common techniques used for an initial intrusion are sending spear-phishing emails and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly available servers. Spear-phishing emails usually appear legitimate but they contain malicious links or attachments containing executable malware. These malicious links can redirect the target to the website where the targetâ€™s web browser and software are compromised by the attacker using various exploit techniques. Sometimes, an attacker may also use social engineering techniques to gather information from the target. After obtaining information from the target, attackers use such information to launch further attacks on the target network.
