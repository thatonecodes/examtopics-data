The virus code replaces the requests to perform operations with respect to these service call interrupts. These viruses state false information to hide their presence from antivirus programs. For example, a stealth virus hides the operations that it modified and gives false representations. Thus, it takes over portions of the target system and hides its virus code."},{"poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","content":"Stealth Virus : It is a very tricky virus as it changes the code that can be used to detect it.
