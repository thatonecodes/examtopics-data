Evaluating the network for inherent technology weaknesses prone to specific types of attacks.\n\nWhile all the options are important aspects of a comprehensive vulnerability assessment, evaluating the network for inherent technology weaknesses helps identify potential vulnerabilities that may exist due to the configuration, design, or technology choices. This involves assessing the network for weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, such as insecure protocols, open ports, or default configurations that may pose security risks. This step complements the information about the latest updates and cybersecurity awareness training by focusing on the technical aspects of the network's security posture.","comment_id":"1155553"},{"poster":"insaniunt","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
