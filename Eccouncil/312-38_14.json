She just got back from a security conference in Las Vegas where they talked about all kinds of old and new security threats; many of which she did not know of. She is worried about the current security state of her company's network so she decides to start scanning the network from an external IP address. To see how some of the hosts on her network react, she sends out SYN packets to an IP range. A number of\nIPs respond with a SYN/ACK response. Before the connection is established, she sends RST packets to those hosts to stop the session. She has done this to see how her intrusion detection system will log the traffic. What type of scan is Cindy attempting here?","topic":"1","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1652440020,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2022-05-13 13:07:00","question_id":66,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/75570-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-385-discussion/","discussion":[{"comment_id":"601092","timestamp":"1731503220.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"SYN then RST is not a half-open scan.\n\nSYN Scan– Also referred to as a half-open scan, it only sends a SYN, and waits for a SYN-ACK response from the target.
