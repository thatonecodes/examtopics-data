In this case, more than three interfaces are present, allowing for further subdivision of the systems based on the specific security objectives of the organization. Each interface connects with separate network segments logically and physically. A multi-homed firewall allows different security policy to be assigned to each interface\n\nChoose the screened subnet topology if the organization offers public services. This type of topology is ideal for an organization hosting a website or an email server. A screened subnet topology provides secure services to Internet users. In this type of topology, the servers that provide public services are setup in a separate zone called a demilitarized zone (DMZ), keeping the trusted network secure from the Internet","timestamp":"1731691080.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"950269","timestamp":"1720835700.0","content":"P.383 is says D","poster":"leefreedom"},{"poster":"ethacker","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A, EC-Council CND Book, P.383","timestamp":"1713968940.0","comment_id":"879437","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1703372880.0","poster":"sadsad","content":"screend subnet","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"754593"}],"answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"QtwCZ9ogyvb8mThAHH36","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/146443-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-5-discussion/","answers_community":["AC (100%)"],"answer_ET":"AC","unix_timestamp":1724660400,"question_id":137,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following analyzes network traffic to trace specific transactions and can intercept and log traffic passing over a digital network?

As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.\nAnswer option D is incorrect. Performance Monitor is used to get statistical information about the hardware and software components of a server.\nAnswer option B is incorrect. A spectrum analyzer, or spectral analyzer, is a device that is used to examine the spectral composition of an electrical, acoustic, or optical waveform. It may also measure the power spectrum.","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1724660400.0","poster":"[Removed]","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nCorrect answers: A. Wireless sniffer and C.
