It employs electromagnetic induction to enable communication between devices connected within a range of 10 cm. The NFC chip embedded within a mobile device can read RFID tags and also be used to establish Bluetooth connections with nearby devices to exchange information such as images and contact lists. Although it allows a very narrow communication range, an attacker with a specialized antenna can intercept and capture the data by jamming the traffic. This security issue may result from the improper configuration of NFC and non-encrypted data transmission. An attacker may craft and send malicious RFID tags, forcing the mobile user to visit a fake website in the browser. Furthermore, an attacker may perform a DoS attack by creating enormous RF signals to corrupt the NFC data being transmitted in that area.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"RSMCT2011"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_id":16,"question_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1699600140,"timestamp":"2023-11-10 08:09:00","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"ANT","C":"Cellular communication","A":"NFC","B":"Satcom"},"answer_ET":"A","exam_id":171,"question_text":"Rickson, a security professional at an organization, was instructed to establish short-range communication between devices within a range of 10 cm.
