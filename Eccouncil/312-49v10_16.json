One of the first things you change is to switch the RestrictAnonymous setting from 0 to 1 on your servers. This, as you were told, would prevent anonymous users from establishing a null session on the server. Using Userinfo tool mentioned at the seminar, you succeed in establishing a null session with one of the servers. Why is that?","question_id":76},{"id":"bTfo0HO4y3FdsYv6Jsd8","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1721196060,"timestamp":"2024-07-17 08:01:00","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721196060.0","poster":"aqeel1506","comment_id":"1249412","content":"The correct answer is A. The change in the routing fabric to bypass the affected router.\nWhen a BGP router shuts down, the other routers in the network will detect the loss of connectivity and adapt the routing fabric to bypass the affected router. This is done by recalculating the best paths for reaching destinations and updating the routing tables. The routers will communicate with each other using BGP update messages to exchange information about the changed routing topology."}],"question_id":77,"answers_community":[],"exam_id":176,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/143989-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-203-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","choices":{"C":"RESTART packets to the affected router to get it to power back up","B":"More RESET packets to the affected router to get it to power back up","D":"STOP packets to all other routers warning of where the attack originated","A":"The change in the routing fabric to bypass the affected router"},"question_text":"In a virtual test environment, Michael is testing the strength and security of BGP using multiple routers to mimic the backbone of the Internet.
