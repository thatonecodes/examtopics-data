Scenario testing\n\nScenario testing works by creating a simulated disaster scenario, such as a fire, to test how well the procedures for handling such incidents work in practice. By simulating these scenarios, organizations can assess the effectiveness of their incident response plans and identify any weaknesses or areas that need improvement. This type of testing helps ensure that the organization is prepared to deal with real-life emergencies and can minimize the impact of any potential disasters.","poster":"drc56"},{"content":"Module 1: Best Practice (OWASP). Practice:\nOrganizations should not wait for incidents to occur; rather, incident handling teams should always be prepared. It is important that the incident response team understands how important mock drills and practice are to the firm. Sometimes the team can practice the organization’s plan by simulating a live scenario. This test can be as simple as dropping a thumb drive on the floor of the office and seeing what happens or as sophisticated as simulating a data breach or phishing attack.","poster":"_Aneeb","timestamp":"1688297760.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"940818"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1662486360.0","content":"I more inclined for Scenario to.","poster":"Cubano","comment_id":"661532"},{"content":"This should be Scenario Testing.
