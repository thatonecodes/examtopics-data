A group of servers with a unique role best describes a server type under an N-tier architecture. In an N-tier architecture, multiple servers can be used to perform a specific set of tasks or roles, and these servers are typically grouped together based on their function or responsibility in the application. Each server in the group may be responsible for a specific subset of tasks, but they work together to provide the necessary functionality to the layer or tier they belong to."}],"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1682194980,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"A group of servers with a unique role","D":"A single server at a specific layer","A":"A group of servers at a specific layer","B":"A single server with a specific role"},"answer_description":"","answer":"C","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-04-22 22:23:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/107046-exam-312-50-topic-5-question-35-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which statement best describes a server type under an N-tier architecture?","topic":"5","exam_id":177},{"id":"tgeMsTZ4iUC7OXDtZfcO","question_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":128,"timestamp":"2022-11-28 14:29:00","answer_ET":"D","exam_id":177,"topic":"5","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nWhat is the difference between chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attack? In both of cases, adversary has access to paintext-ciphertext pairs.
