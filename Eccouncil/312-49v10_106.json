Bridge nodes are nodes that are not published or listed in the public directory of Tor nodes.\n\nSeveral entry and exit nodes of the Tor network are publicly listed and accessible on the Internet; consequently, they can be blocked by organizations/governments, if they wish to prohibit the usage of Tor. In many authoritarian countries, governments, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and corporate organizations ban the use of the Tor network. In such scenarios, where the usage of the Tor network is restricted, bridge nodes help circumvent the restrictions and allow users to access the Tor network.\n\nThe usage of bridge nodes makes it difficult for governments, organizations, and ISPs to censor the usage of the Tor network. \n\n-\nIf you agree: UPVOTE","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1411298","poster":"044f354","timestamp":"1743166800.0"},{"timestamp":"1733476920.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nTOR relays are public; bridges are not.","comment_id":"1225226","poster":"jingu_bingo","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Elb","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe Tor relay nodes are publicly available in the directory list, but the bridge node is different from relay nodes.
