Attackers use two techniques, namely timing analysis and power analysis, to perform side-channel attacks on the target OT systems. The timing-analysis attack is based on the amount of time taken by the device to execute different computations. The power analysis attack is based on the change in power consumption during a cryptographic operation. ICS systems are often vulnerable to these two side-channel attacks.  Timing Analysis Passwords are often transmitted through a serial channel. Attackers employ a loop strategy to recover these passwords. They use one character at a time to check whether the first character entered is correct; if so, the loop continues for consecutive characters. If not, the loop terminates. Attackers check how much time the device is taking to finish one complete password authentication process, through which they can determine how many characters entered are correct.
