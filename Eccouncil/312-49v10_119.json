The timestamps for some files have been manipulated, possibly as an anti-forensic measure\n\nExplanation:\n\n$STANDARD_INFORMATION and $FILE_NAME attributes in the NTFS file system store timestamps related to file creation, modification, and access. Discrepancies between these timestamps can indicate that the file's metadata has been altered.\nBCWipe is a utility designed to securely delete files and wipe data, which includes features that can manipulate file timestamps as an anti-forensic measure to obscure the true timeline of file activity.\nBased on the presence of BCWipe and the observed timestamp discrepancies, it is most plausible that the file timestamps have been deliberately manipulated, potentially as part of an effort to cover tracks and hinder forensic analysis.","comment_id":"1253897","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"KsPSMvMehVGJKDfWbXP1","isMC":true,"question_id":593,"question_text":"When a file is deleted by Windows Explorer or through the MS-DOS delete command, the operating system inserts _______________ in the first letter position of the filename in the FAT database.","exam_id":176,"choices":{"A":"A Capital X","B":"A Blank Space","C":"The Underscore Symbol","D":"The lowercase Greek Letter Sigma (s)"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"topic":"1","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1366489","timestamp":"1741408200.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nhttps://www.sans.org/blog/fat-and-fat-directory-entries/\n\n\"...on FAT file systems a deleted file has the first character in its name replaced with hexadecimal value 0xE5 which corresponds to the ASCII underscore.\"","poster":"044f354"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/157745-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-82-discussion/","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1741408200,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"answer":"C","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2025-03-08 05:30:00"},{"id":"SXtoAC1xloDwHAOGTltL","answer":"D","question_id":594,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1718215680,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-06-12 20:08:00","question_images":[],"exam_id":176,"question_text":"In the middle of a high-pressure cybercrime investigation, you stumble upon a cryptic message.
