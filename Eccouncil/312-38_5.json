Transport layer.\n\nThe Transport layer provides communication session management between host computers. It is responsible for establishing a reliable end-to-end connection between applications running on different hosts and for ensuring that data is delivered error-free, in order, and without loss or duplication. It also handles flow control and congestion control to prevent network congestion and ensure efficient use of network resources. Examples of protocols at the transport layer include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n\nThe Application layer (A) provides services to user applications, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing. The Internet layer (B) is responsible for routing packets across multiple networks and provides addressing and fragmentation services. The Link layer (D) provides data link communication services between nodes on the same network segment.","comments":[{"poster":"leefreedom","content":"session layer is right.

It is made of glass or plastic and transmits signals in the form of light. It is of cylindrical shape and consists of three concentric sections: the core, the cladding, and the jacket. Optical fiber carries much more information than conventional copper wire and is in general not subject to electromagnetic interference and the need to retransmit signals. Most telephone company's long-distance lines are now made of optical fiber. Transmission over an optical fiber cable requires repeaters at distance intervals. The glass fiber requires more protection within an outer cable than copper.\nAnswer option B is incorrect. Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors (the forward and return conductors of a single circuit) are twisted together for the purposes of canceling out electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources. It consists of the following twisted pair cables:\nShielded Twisted Pair: Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) is a special kind of copper telephone wiring used in some business installations. An outer covering or shield is added to the ordinary twisted pair telephone wires; the shield functions as a ground. Twisted pair is the ordinary copper wire that connects home and many business computers to the telephone company. Shielded twisted pair is often used in business installations. Unshielded Twisted Pair: Unshielded Twisted Pair\n(UTP) is the ordinary wire used in home. UTP cable is also the most common cable used in computer networking. Ethernet, the most common data networking standard, utilizes UTP cables. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to optical fiber and coaxial cable.UTP is also finding increasing use in video applications, primarily in security cameras. Many middle to high-end cameras include a UTP output with setscrew terminals. This is made possible by the fact that UTP cable bandwidth has improved to match the baseband of television signals.\nAnswer option A is incorrect. Coaxial cable is the kind of copper cable used by cable TV companies between the community antenna and user homes and businesses. Coaxial cable is sometimes used by telephone companies from their central office to the telephone poles near users. It is also widely installed for use in business and corporation Ethernet and other types of local area network. Coaxial cable is called \"coaxial\" because it includes one physical channel that carries the signal surrounded (after a layer of insulation) by another concentric physical channel, both running along the same axis. The outer channel serves as a ground. Many of these cables or pairs of coaxial tubes can be placed in a single outer sheathing and, with repeaters, can carry information for a great distance. It is shown in the figure below:\n\nAnswer option C is incorrect. Plenum cable is cable that is laid in the plenum spaces of buildings. The plenum is the space that can facilitate air circulation for heating and air conditioning systems, by providing pathways for either heated/conditioned or return airflows. Space between the structural ceiling and the dropped ceiling or under a raised floor is typically considered plenum. However, some drop ceiling designs create a tight seal that does not allow for airflow and therefore may not be considered a plenum air-handling space. The plenum space is typically used to house the communication cables for the building's computer and telephone network.","unix_timestamp":1637422080,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03651/0001900001.png"],"question_text":"Which of the following cables is made of glass or plastic and transmits signals in the form of light?","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Coaxial cable","B":"Twisted pair cable","C":"Plenum cable","D":"Fiber optic cable"},"question_id":24,"answer":"D","timestamp":"2021-11-20 16:28:00","exam_id":173,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732116480.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Nikanor","comment_id":"482660","content":"Selected Answer: D\niS CORRECT"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/66399-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-24-discussion/"},{"id":"T0Cbl7O4a2QCinpHGYKh","answer_description":"","answer":"B","unix_timestamp":1652104380,"question_text":"Which of the following is a presentation layer protocol?","question_id":25,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1711362300.0","upvote_count":"5","poster":"thetha","comment_id":"850018","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe presentation layer is the layer 6 of the OSI model, which is responsible for data representation, encryption, and compression.
