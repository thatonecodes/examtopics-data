The memory buffer, also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), is where a computer temporarily stores data and programs that are currently running. If the computer is shut down improperly, or if the power is cut off, the data in the memory buffer may be lost or corrupted. This is why it is important to avoid powering on a computer that you need to acquire digital evidence from. Instead, you should use specialized software and hardware tools to extract the data from the computer's hard drive in a forensically sound manner, without altering or destroying any of the data.","comments":[{"poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1728737340.0","content":"Umm, this is wrong?
