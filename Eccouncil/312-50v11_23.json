DNS cache poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is a technique used by hackers to manipulate the DNS (Domain Name System) cache data on a DNS resolver. The objective is to deceive the resolver into associating a domain name with an incorrect IP address, thereby redirecting traffic to a malicious website or server.\n\nThe first step in a DNS cache poisoning attack is for the attacker to forge a reply from the DNS resolver. The attacker crafts a DNS response packet that appears to come from a legitimate DNS resolver, containing a fake mapping between a domain name and an IP address. The forged reply is designed to convince the target's DNS resolver to store the incorrect mapping in its cache.\n\nOnce the DNS resolver receives the forged reply, it may cache the incorrect information, associating the domain name with the attacker's desired IP address. Subsequent requests for that domain name from users within the organization will then be directed to the attacker's malicious server instead of the legitimate server.\n- ChatGPT3.5","timestamp":"1702520400.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"922627"},{"timestamp":"1699471200.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correcto option is A.\n\nThe other options may be involved in a DNS cache poisoning attack, but the first step would always be the same: the attacker must send queries to the DNS server to learn about the name resolution process and cache records.

In this type of attack, the attacker sends a false DNS response to the user's computer or intermediate DNS server, causing it to cache the malicious data instead of the correct data. When the user later attempts to access the legitimate website, they are directed to the attacker's website instead.\n\nIf an attacker queries a nameserver using a DNS resolver, this could be part of a reconnaissance or information gathering phase of a larger attack. By querying a nameserver, the attacker can obtain information about the DNS infrastructure for a particular domain, such as the IP addresses of servers hosting the domain's website or email services. This information can be used to plan and carry out further attacks, such as DNS cache poisoning or DDoS attacks.","timestamp":"1694860740.0","comment_id":"840953","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nMake a request then send fake reply to posion cache","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Shin_Frankie","timestamp":"1692514140.0","comment_id":"815019"},{"timestamp":"1686369660.0","comment_id":"740711","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think A is right .","poster":"topbarry","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"736142","content":"Since it is asking for the FIRST step, 8 would think the answer is C.\nMake a request to the DNS resolver, if the resolver does not have that answer in it's cache, it then in turn (ie next step) the resolver queries the nameserver.\nOr do I have the DNS process in wrong order?","timestamp":"1685978220.0","poster":"Praezin"},{"timestamp":"1685904720.0","comment_id":"735446","content":"Selected Answer: A\nDNS CACHE Poisoning refers to altering or adding forged DNS records in the DNS resolver cache so that a DNS query is redirected to a malicious site.\nHowever, the question is asking the FIRST STEP for a hacker.

Explanation below:\n\nDifferent Stages of Attack of DNS Cache Poisoning:\n- The attacker proceeds to send DNS queries to the DNS resolver, which forwards the Root/TLD authoritative DNS server request and awaits an answer.\n\n- The attacker overloads the DNS with poisoned responses that contain several IP addresses of the malicious website. To be accepted by the DNS resolver, the attacker's response should match a port number and the query ID field before the DNS response. Also, the attackers can force its response to increasing their chance of success.\n\n- If you are a legitimate user who queries this DNS resolver, you will get a poisoned response from the cache, and you will be automatically redirected to the malicious website.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"587037","timestamp":"1665975720.0","poster":"Average_Joe"},{"comment_id":"583572","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"615171","timestamp":"1670832120.0","content":"actually, you seem to be right. querying the nameserver is the first step of the user, not the ATTACKER!","poster":"pyw"},{"poster":"pinguin666","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1673021160.0","content":"Agree question is NOT what is the steps, but what is the ATTACKERS first step.","comment_id":"627929"}],"poster":"Bodescu","content":"Selected Answer: D\nKey here is \" the first step for a hacker conducting a DNS cache poisoning\".\n\nFor sure, first step to start the process is a query to the nameserver, but that query is not the first step for the attacker, but the user.
