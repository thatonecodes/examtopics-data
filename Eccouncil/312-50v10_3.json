The psexec module is often used by penetration testers to obtain access to a given system whose credentials are known. It was written by sysinternals and has been integrated within the framework. The penetration testers successfully gain access to a system through some exploit, use meterpreter to grab the passwords or other methods like fgdump, pwdump, or cachedump and then utilize rainbowtables to crack those hash values.\nWhich of the following is true hash type and sort order that is used in the psexec module's 'smbpass' option?","isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"LM:NT","B":"NTLM:LM","C":"NT:LM","D":"LM:NTLM"},"question_id":11,"answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1728399600.0","comment_id":"1028087","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
