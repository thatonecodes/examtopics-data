You do not care if the hard disk has one partition or more, NTFS or BTRFS or anything else. You are using the device driver, which can be IDE or SCSI or SATA or others, and you're writing data to physical sectors. More importantly, low level formatting will write to each and every bit on the storage device, making sure the old states are destroyed forever, and with them, any trace of former data previously stored.\n\nPerforming one low-level formatting operation is known as one-pass format. Some security consultants and experts and paranoids might recommend you perform three or more passes, to make absolutely sure no trace of old data can ever be retrieved.
