Also, they can employ malware in techniques that aren't stored to disk, only run in memory, like a remote execution of Powershell scripts like invoke-mimikatz to harvest credentials.

Instead of installing executable files, file-less malware typically exploits system vulnerabilities or runs in-memory, often through scripting languages or legitimate system tools. Because it doesn't rely on files, it can bypass traditional antivirus (AV) tools and application whitelisting mechanisms that focus on detecting file-based threats.\n\nIn this case, the fact that AV tools couldn't detect any malicious software and the IDS/IPS didn't flag any non-whitelisted programs suggests that the malware did not rely on traditional files but instead operated directly in memory, making it difficult to detect and block."},{"poster":"marcel9999","comment_id":"1364748","content":"Selected Answer: B\nZero day because not recognized bypass all detections","timestamp":"1741067700.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"SukhoiF35","content":"Selected Answer: B\nMalware wasn't recognised by any AV or IPS/IDS.
