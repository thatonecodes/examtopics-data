If the string isn’t validated and malicious text or characters are not escaped, an attacker can potentially access sensitive data or other resources on the server. For example, an attacker could mount an attack by supplying a ***semicolon*** and appending another value. The connection string is parsed by using a “last one wins” algorithm, and the hostile input is replaced with a legitimate value.\n\nsource from :https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-connection-string-parameter-pollution/","comments":[{"poster":"NikoTomas","comment_id":"1170603","content":"I agree, A) is correct - injecting parameters with semicolons, which separate commands.\n\nD) is incorrect - multiple parameters with the SAME NAME in HTTP request - it usually does nothing, because another occurence of the same parameter (or HTTP header like \"host:\", \"origin:\" etc..) just REWRITES the value of the previous occurence.
