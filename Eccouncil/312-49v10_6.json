It operates at the session layer of the OSI model and creates a virtual circuit between the internal and external networks. This type of firewall does not examine the contents of the packets, but only checks the state of the connection to ensure that it is valid. Therefore, it is an ideal choice for enforcing the DoD's policy of only allowing incoming connections that were first initiated by internal computers.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"you're wrong, Correct Answer is D","timestamp":"1717222800.0","comment_id":"911792","poster":"hisham"}],"comment_id":"835572"}],"question_id":29,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/102237-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-142-discussion/","answer_description":""},{"id":"2wBDKurcJWeJyzWGX5Dw","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Tracert","D":"ICMP ping sweep","C":"Ping trace","B":"Smurf scan"},"unix_timestamp":1713097080,"isMC":true,"answer":"D","exam_id":176,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Elb","content":"D.
