Credential enumerator\nhttps://cybersecurity.wa.gov/news/emotet-growing-threat\n\nCredential enumerator: a self-extracting RAR file containing two components, a bypass and a service component. The bypass component is used for enumeration of network resources and either finds writable share drives using Server Message Block (SMB) or tries to brute force user accounts, including the administrator account. Once an available system is found, Emotet then writes the service component on the system, which writes Emotet onto the disk.
