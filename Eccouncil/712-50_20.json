Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize and focus security efforts on protecting high-value assets, as these are the most critical and potentially damaging if compromised. This approach helps in allocating resources efficiently to areas that matter the most, ensuring that the organization's most valuable and sensitive information is adequately protected."},{"timestamp":"1711375680.0","poster":"Emporeo","content":"i honestly would pick none of the answers. Focus on most critical assets can't be the right answer, that would leave other assets vulnerable. Transferring risk to an insurance company? that might compensate some costs, but will NOT protect your company getting hit by a severe attack...and fines in case of regulations. My thoughts here are to harden the incident response process, implement a stronger process and tech, implement network segreration and strong IAM to limit the damage and potential lateral movement.

Considering the CISO's challenges in advancing the IT security agenda, the major concern likely revolves around the broader organizational and leadership context.\n\nThe Major Concern:\nD. Lack of sponsorship from executive management\n\nExplanation:\nLack of Sponsorship from Executive Management: Effective information security leadership requires strong support and sponsorship from the executive management team. Without this backing, the CISO will struggle to advance the security agenda, gain necessary resources, and ensure organization-wide adherence to security policies and initiatives.
