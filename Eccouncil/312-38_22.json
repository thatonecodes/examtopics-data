This company processes over 20,000 student loans a year from colleges all over the state. Most communication between the company, schools, and lenders is carried out through emails. Much of the email communication used at his company contains sensitive information such as social security numbers. For this reason, James wants to utilize email encryption. Since a server-based PKI is not an option for him, he is looking for a low/no cost solution to encrypt emails. What should James use?","answer_ET":"C","question_id":106,"answers_community":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"James can use MD5 algorithm to encrypt all the emails.","B":"James can enforce mandatory HTTPS in the email clients to encrypt emails.","A":"James should utilize the free OTP software package.","C":"James could use PGP as a free option for encrypting the company's emails."},"unix_timestamp":1619417820},{"id":"JRwaNCyxTuU9skoP6NwM","question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"choices":{"B":"ITIL","A":"COBIT","D":"RMIS","C":"ISO 27007"},"topic":"1","question_id":107,"unix_timestamp":1619417580,"exam_id":173,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/50975-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-438-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_text":"David is working in a mid-sized IT company.

This is the lowest component layer of the\nInternet protocols, as TCP/IP is designed to be hardware independent. As a result, TCP/IP has been implemented on top of virtually any hardware networking technology in existence. The Link Layer is used to move packets between the Internet Layer interfaces of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the software device driver for the network card, as well as on firmware or specialized chipsets.\nAnswer option B is incorrect. The Internet Layer of the TCP/IP model solves the problem of sending packets across one or more networks. Internetworking requires sending data from the source network to the destination network. This process is called routing. IP can carry data for a number of different upper layer protocols.\nAnswer option D is incorrect. The Transport Layer of TCP/IP model is responsible for end-to-end message transfer capabilities independent of the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers). End to end message transmission or connecting applications at the transport layer can be categorized as either connection-oriented, implemented in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), or connectionless, implemented in User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\nAnswer option is incorrect. The Application Layer of TCP/IP model refers to the higher-level protocols used by most applications for network communication.\nExamples of application layer protocols include the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Data coded according to application layer protocols are then encapsulated into one or more transport layer protocols, which in turn use lower layer protocols to affect actual data transfer.","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/59500-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-44-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following layers of TCP/IP model is used to move packets between the Internet Layer interfaces of two different hosts on the same link?","unix_timestamp":1628473500,"timestamp":"2021-08-09 03:45:00","answers_community":[],"exam_id":173,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"880143","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729845660.0","content":"Should be Network Layer, as said on CND Book P.2503.
