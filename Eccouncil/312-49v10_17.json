Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen IIS logging is enabled, the web server writes log files that contain information about the requests processed by the server. These log files are typically used for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and security auditing.\n\nIn a default IIS installation, the web server generates a new log file each day, with the file name format of \"u_exYYMMDD.log\", where YYMMDD represents the year, month, and day of the log file. For example, the log file for March 25, 2023, would be named \"u_ex230325.log\".\n\nThe log files are stored in the W3SVC folder under the Windows system root directory (e.g., C:\\Windows\\System32\\LogFiles\\W3SVC).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, a new log file is created every day.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"850649"},{"timestamp":"1701664920.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Port_Stack","comment_id":"734849","content":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.applicationhost/sites/sitedefaults/logfile/"},{"timestamp":"1678139220.0","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"timestamp":"1678139280.0","content":"Correction B is the answer","poster":"K3nz0420","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"562289"}],"comment_id":"562287","content":"C - By default, each IIS Site hosted will begin recording web logs into %SystemDrive%\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles and it will create a new file every day","poster":"K3nz0420"},{"content":"B. a new log file is created everyday","poster":"ctaregistro","comment_id":"495010","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1670319420.0"}],"choices":{"D":"a new log is created each time the Web Server is started","C":"a new log file is created each week","B":"a new log file is created everyday","A":"the same log is used at all times"},"unix_timestamp":1638783420,"timestamp":"2021-12-06 10:37:00","answer_description":"","question_id":81,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_text":"When examining the log files from a Windows IIS Web Server, how often is a new log file created?","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B"},{"id":"iW8tHkcqJqPWoCeV7tl0","exam_id":176,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/68076-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-210-discussion/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"502472","poster":"ctaregistro","content":"A.

Ping of death.\nICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets larger than 65,536 bytes are indicative of a \"Ping of Death\" attack. This type of attack involves sending malformed or malicious ICMP packets, specifically echo request (ping) packets, that exceed the maximum allowed size (65,536 bytes). This can cause the target system to crash, freeze, or become unstable.\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\nA. Smurf attack: a type of DDoS attack that uses ICMP echo requests (pings) to flood a network, but the packets are typically not larger than 65,536 bytes.\nC. Fraggle attack: a type of DDoS attack that uses UDP packets, not ICMP packets, to flood a network.\nD.
