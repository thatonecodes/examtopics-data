It operates on 64-bit data blocks, using the classic DES algorithm three times for enhanced security. 3DES employs three 56-bit keys, which provides an effective key length of 168 bits, though it processes data in 64-bit chunks. This approach was developed to address the vulnerabilities of the original DES algorithm by repeating the encryption process multiple times. While 3DES offers stronger security than DES, it is slower compared to modern encryption algorithms like AES, which are now more commonly used.

DES uses a block cipher to encrypt data in 64-bit blocks, and it uses three keys in a process called Triple DES (3DES) encryption. Each key is 56 bits long, but only 48 of those bits are used in each round of the encryption process.
