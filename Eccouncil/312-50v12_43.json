An employee who manages the sales software of the operational plant opened the fraudulent email and clicked on the malicious attachment.

These emails often contain malware or links to malicious websites and are designed to appear legitimate to trick the recipient into performing actions that trigger malware installation or reveal confidential information.

Spear-phishing attack.\n\nHere's why:\n\nSpear-phishing attack: This is a targeted attack where the attacker sends fraudulent emails to specific individuals or organizations to deceive them into clicking on malicious links or attachments. The goal is to gain unauthorized access to systems or to inject malware, as seen in the scenario described. The fact that Stephen generated a fraudulent email with a malicious attachment and targeted employees of the organization, leading to the compromise of their systems, fits the definition of a spear-phishing attack.\n\nHMI-based attack: This involves targeting the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) systems that are used to monitor and control industrial processes. While the malware did affect industrial automation components, the initial attack vector was through a phishing email, not a direct attack on HMI systems.","timestamp":"1710961260.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1178623","poster":"anarchyeagle"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1175042","content":"spear-pishing attack D\n Spear Phishing Attackers send fake emails containing malicious links or attachments, seemingly originated from legitimate or well-known sources, to the victim.

For example, an attacker sends a fraudulent email with a malicious attachment to a victim system that maintains the sales software of the operational plant.
