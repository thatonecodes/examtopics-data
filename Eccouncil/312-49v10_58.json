A logical block is a fixed-size unit of data that is accessed by the operating system and represents a segment of a file or a portion of free space on the hard disk.\n\nThe physical organization of a hard disk is typically divided into sectors, tracks, and cylinders, which are used to locate data on the disk. However, logical block addressing is used by the operating system to manage and access data on the disk, rather than using physical addresses.\n\nOption A, physical block, refers to a physical unit of data storage on the hard disk.\n\nOption B, operating system block, is not a commonly used term in the context of hard disk data addressing.\n\nOption C, hard disk block, is also not a commonly used term in the context of hard disk data addressing."}],"answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (60%)","A (40%)"]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Eccouncil","name":"312-49v10","numberOfQuestions":609,"isMCOnly":true,"id":176},"currentPage":58},"__N_SSP":true}
