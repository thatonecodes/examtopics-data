Subsequently, the attacker scans the list to find a vulnerable machine. On finding one, the attacker installs malicious code on it and divides the list in half. The attacker continues to scan one half, whereas the other half is scanned by the newly compromised machine. This process keeps repeating, causing the number of compromised machines to increase exponentially. This technique ensures the installation of malicious code on all the potentially vulnerable machines in the hit list within a short time.\n\n*Topological Scanning\nThis technique uses the information obtained from an infected machine to find new vulnerable machines. An infected host checks for URLs in the hard drive of a machine that it wants to infect. Subsequently, it shortlists URLs and targets, and it checks their vulnerability. This technique yields accurate results, and its performance is similar to that of the hit-list scanning technique.","poster":"jeremy13","upvote_count":"16"},{"timestamp":"1735459320.0","poster":"Mann098","comment_id":"1333392","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHit-List scanning technique"},{"poster":"Nicknp","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731528900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption C hitlist scanning technique","comment_id":"1211017"},{"comment_id":"1105490","content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption C.

Hit-list scanning technique.","timestamp":"1699038720.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnser is Hitlist:\nThe technique discussed here is the Hit-list scanning technique.\n\nIn the Hit-list scanning technique, the attacker creates a list of potential targets that are vulnerable to a specific exploit or attack. The attacker then uses this list to scan and infect the vulnerable machines. Once a machine is compromised, it can be used to scan for and infect other vulnerable machines on the list. The list is then divided among the compromised machines, and the scanning process continues until all the machines on the list are infected.\n\nThis technique is often used to create botnets, which are networks of infected machines that can be controlled by the attacker. Botnets can be used for various purposes, such as launching DDoS attacks, stealing sensitive information, or distributing spam or malware. The Hit-list scanning technique allows the attacker to quickly infect a large number of machines and create a powerful botnet.","comment_id":"886097","timestamp":"1698842040.0","upvote_count":"4","poster":"sTaTiK"},{"poster":"Chipless","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"870330","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHit-list Scanning\nSOURCE: CEH v12 eBook Module 10 pg 954","timestamp":"1697300640.0"},{"timestamp":"1696426320.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
