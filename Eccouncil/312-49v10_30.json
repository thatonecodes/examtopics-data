If copyright and intellectual property theft/misuse has occurred.\nComputer forensics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence to investigate cybercrimes, digital frauds, and other digital offenses. It's appropriate to use computer forensics in situations like:\nIntellectual property theft or misuse (e.g., software piracy, copyright infringement)\nHacking or unauthorized access to computer systems or networks\nDigital fraud (e.g., identity theft, online scams)\nCyberstalking or harassment\nData breaches or leaks\nElectronic evidence collection and analysis for legal proceedings","timestamp":"1721369100.0","poster":"aqeel1506"}],"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"If employees do not care for their boss management techniques","A":"If copyright and intellectual property theft/misuse has occurred","C":"If sales drop off for no apparent reason for an extended period of time","D":"If a financial institution is burglarized by robbers"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/144162-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-282-discussion/","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"exam_id":176,"unix_timestamp":1721369100,"timestamp":"2024-07-19 08:05:00"},{"id":"5jUDOYlidrO6qqNllo6g","timestamp":"2024-07-19 08:06:00","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/144163-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-283-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1721369160,"answers_community":[],"question_text":"Which of the following is a precomputed table containing word lists like dictionary files and brute force lists and their hash values?","choices":{"A":"Directory Table","D":"Partition Table","C":"Master file Table (MFT)","B":"Rainbow Table"},"discussion":[{"content":"The correct answer is B. Rainbow Table.\nA Rainbow Table is a precomputed table containing word lists (like dictionary files and brute-force lists) and their corresponding hash values. This allows for rapid lookup and matching of hash values to crack passwords or authentication credentials. Rainbow Tables are commonly used in password cracking and password strength testing.\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\nA. Directory Table is not a standard term in computer security or cryptography.\nC. Master File Table (MFT) is a data structure used by the NTFS file system to store metadata about files and directories.\nD. Partition Table is a data structure that describes the partitioning scheme of a hard drive or storage device.\nRainbow Tables are a powerful tool for password cracking, but they can also be used for password strength testing and security auditing.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1250892","timestamp":"1721369160.0","poster":"aqeel1506"}],"exam_id":176,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","question_id":147,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"iIBD7Vv0btQtTjlYXsoR","isMC":true,"question_text":"Using Linux to carry out a forensics investigation, what would the following command accomplish? dd if=/usr/home/partition.image of=/dev/sdb2 bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror","answer":"D","discussion":[{"content":"The command dd if=/usr/home/partition.image of=/dev/sdb2 bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror would:\n\nD.
