Encrypt data client-side before uploading to the cloud and retain control of the encryption keys.\n\nThis approach ensures that the client encrypts the data on their premises before uploading it to the cloud, and they retain control of the encryption keys. This way, even if the data is stored in the cloud, only the client holds the keys necessary for decryption, providing them with full control over their sensitive information","timestamp":"1723232760.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
