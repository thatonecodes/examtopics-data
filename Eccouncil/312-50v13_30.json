T3 is Nmap's default behavior, which includes parallelization.\n\nD is NOT correct:\n--host-timeout <time> (Give up on slow target hosts after the timeout) \n= amount of time you are willing to wait. For example, specify 30m to ensure that Nmap doesn't waste more than half an hour on a single host. \nNote that Nmap may be scanning other hosts at the same time during that half an hour, so it isn't a complete loss. A host that times out is skipped. No port table, OS detection, or version detection results are printed for that host.\n\nSource: https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html","poster":"NikoTomas","comment_id":"1373365"},{"comment_id":"1365215","timestamp":"1741139100.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nselete D","poster":"AY_Tseng","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"You are attempting to run an Nmap port scan on a web server.
