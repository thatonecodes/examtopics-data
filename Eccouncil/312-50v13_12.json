The time recipient spent reading the email\n\nExplanation:\neMailTrackerPro is a tool used to track emails and obtain information such as the sender's location, IP address, and other metadata. However, it cannot determine how much time the recipient spends reading an email, as this would require access to the user's email client or screen behavior, which is not part of the standard email tracking functionality.","comment_id":"1353047","poster":"pindinga1"}],"question_text":"A certified ethical hacker is carrying out an email footprinting exercise on a targeted organization using eMailTrackerPro.

Enable encryption on the wireless network.\n\nEncryption (WPA2 or WPA3) ensures that the data transmitted over the network is encrypted, making it much more difficult for unauthorized individuals to intercept and read the communication.

The botnet consists of multiple compromised devices, making the attack more difficult to mitigate using IP-based blocking, as the attacker’s identity is hidden behind many different IP addresses. The traffic generated is distributed and highly resilient against traditional defenses, making this a very effective strategy for the attacker’s objectives.","poster":"killwitch"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1399325","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA Pulse Wave attack is a sophisticated form of DDoS attack that, uses a botnet to distribute the attack traffic across thousands (or millions) of devices, making it resistant to simple IP-based blocking.","timestamp":"1742146020.0","poster":"Gibsomd"}],"question_id":58,"answer":"B","question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/169165-exam-312-50v13-topic-1-question-169-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1742146020,"question_text":"A well-resourced attacker intends to launch a highly disruptive DDoS attack against a major online retailer.
