If the port is open, the target responds with an SYN/ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet. Instead of completing the handshake with an ACK packet, the hacker sends an RST (reset) packet to terminate the connection immediately. \n\nGoal of the SYN Scan: \nThe attacker can identify open ports on the target system. Since the connection is never fully established, this scan is less likely to be logged compared to a full TCP connect scan. It’s a commonly used method in network reconnaissance before launching further attacks or penetration testing activities. \n\nThus, the hacker is performing an SYN scan (Option A) to detect open ports while remaining stealthy.","comment_id":"1400175","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1742307780.0"}],"question_images":[]},{"id":"o7E5jwRPOaJuVasmQkRk","choices":{"B":"Buffer overflow","D":"XSS","C":"CSRF","A":"SQL injection"},"answer":"B","question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/312-50v13/image1.png"],"answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2025-01-16 14:46:00","question_id":82,"answers_community":["B (80%)","A (20%)"],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"question_text":"John is investigating web-application firewall logs and observers that someone is attempting to inject the following:\n//IMG//\n\nWhat type of attack is this?","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"poster":"nicejob","comment_id":"1351205","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nbuffer overflow, it not possible is sqli","timestamp":"1738646220.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is B (buffer overflow)\n\nReasons:\nThe buffer buff is defined to hold 10 elements (indices 0 through 9).\nWriting to buff[10] attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer size.\nThis can lead to overwriting adjacent memory, potentially corrupting data, crashing the application, or enabling the execution of malicious code.","poster":"Osanyindoro","comment_id":"1342458","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1737191700.0"},{"timestamp":"1737035280.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nthe answer is B and not A.
