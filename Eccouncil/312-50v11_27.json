They filter packets at the network layer of the OSI model (or the internet layer of the TCP/IP model) to determine whether session packets are legitimate, and they evaluate the contents of the packets at the application layer. Using stateful packet filtering, you can overcome the limitation of packet firewalls, which can only filter the IP address, port, protocol, and so on. This multilayer firewall can perform deep packet inspection. \n\nApplication-based proxy firewalls focus on the application layer rather than just the packets. Application-level gateways (proxies) can filter packets at the application layer of the OSI model (or the application layer of TCP/IP). Incoming and outgoing traffic is restricted to services supported by the proxy; all other service requests are denied.
