Real-time off-site replication\nReal-time off-site replication involves continuously replicating critical data to an off-site location, ensuring that an up-to-date copy of the data is available in case of an attack. This approach minimizes the potential data loss and reduces the downtime caused by a ransomware incident. It allows for quick restoration of systems and data from the replicated copies, enabling the organization to resume normal operations as soon as possible.","poster":"arifbhatkar","timestamp":"1688648220.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"846503","poster":"Pika26","timestamp":"1679444640.0","content":"Answer is A. Real-time off-site replication\nReal-time off-site replication provides the best response to a ransomware attack because it constantly updates a copy of your data in a separate, secure location. This allows for faster recovery in the event of a ransomware attack, as you can quickly restore your systems and data from the replicated copy without having to rely on potentially outdated or compromised backups. Additionally, having off-site replication adds another layer of protection against data loss due to physical damage or other site-specific issues."},{"timestamp":"1675323180.0","content":"D is the the best answer","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"795850","poster":"ironman_86"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/97634-exam-712-50-topic-1-question-423-discussion/","topic":"1"}],"exam":{"name":"712-50","isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true,"id":183,"provider":"Eccouncil","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":182,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":28},"__N_SSP":true}
