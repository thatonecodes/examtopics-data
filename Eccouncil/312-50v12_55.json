He records the frequency required to share information between connected devices and captures the original data when commands are initiated by the connected devices. Once the original data are collected, he uses free tools such as URH to segregate the command sequence. Subsequently, he starts injecting the segregated command sequence on the same frequency into the IoT network, which repeats the captured signals of the devices.\n\nIn a replay attack, an attacker records legitimate data transmissions and later retransmits them, hoping to impersonate the original sender or gain unauthorized access. The attacker captures the data packets or messages transmitted between two entities and replays them back to the same or another entity, leading to unauthorized access, impersonation, or denial of service.","timestamp":"1712253540.0"},{"comment_id":"1354800","upvote_count":"1","poster":"kenjeshry","timestamp":"1739240280.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nReplay Attack\n Once the original data is collected, the attacker uses free tools such as URH (Universal Radio Hacker) to segregate the command sequence..Page 2814"},{"timestamp":"1733868720.0","comment_id":"1092912","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
