Continuously.\nIn order for log files to be admissible in a court of law, they must be:\nAuthentic: The logs must be genuine and unaltered.\nReliable: The logs must be generated and stored in a trustworthy manner.\nComplete: The logs must be comprehensive and include all relevant information.\nContinuous: The logs must be kept continuously, without gaps or omissions.\nThere is no specific time frame (like weekly, monthly, etc.) required for log files to be admissible in court. However, it's essential to maintain a continuous and unbroken chain of log files to demonstrate their integrity and reliability.\nKeeping log files continuously means:\nLogging must be enabled and configured correctly.\nLogs must be regularly collected, stored, and preserved.\nLogs must be protected from alteration, deletion, or tampering.","poster":"aqeel1506","timestamp":"1721302500.0","comment_id":"1250344","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"E8QUOR9CETe1f8AonBsV","question_text":"What file is processed at the end of a Windows XP boot to initialize the logon dialog box?","unix_timestamp":1636909080,"answers_community":["C (50%)","A (50%)"],"exam_id":176,"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/66029-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-253-discussion/","choices":{"D":"NTDETECT.COM","C":"LSASS.EXE","A":"NTOSKRNL.EXE","B":"NTLDR"},"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2021-11-14 17:58:00","isMC":true,"answer":"C","question_id":122,"discussion":[{"poster":"044f354","comment_id":"1324867","timestamp":"1733894340.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nSASS.EXE (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service):\nLSASS.EXE is a critical Windows system process responsible for enforcing security policies on the system.
