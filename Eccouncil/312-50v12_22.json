When Nmap sends probes to closed ports, the firewall generates ICMP error messages in response to those probes.

Assuming that the port on the target was open and that the zombie has already sent an RST packet to the target, the IPID number is increased by 1. Now, the zombie responds with an RST packet to the attacker using its next IPID, i.e., 31339 (X + 2). Consequently, the IPID is increased by 2, which implies that the port on the target machine was open.

The target network has a stateful firewall present\n\nIn an IDLE/IPID header scan using Nmap, the scanning technique relies on the behavior of the IPID (IP Identification) field in IP headers. In a normal scan, the IPID field typically increments by 1 for each packet sent. However, in the presence of a stateful firewall that performs packet normalization, the IPID might increase by a different value.\n\nIf the IPID number increases by 2 after performing the IDLE/IPID header scan, it suggests that the target network has a stateful firewall present. This behavior occurs because the firewall is manipulating the IPID field in a way that deviates from the normal incrementation observed in the absence of such a firewall.","comment_id":"1147696","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1707689580.0","poster":"insaniunt"},{"timestamp":"1707426660.0","poster":"qwerty100","upvote_count":"1","content":"A.

Unnecessary services could contain vulnerabilities that might be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause disruption.\n\nThus, the primary response to the question at hand is that by limiting these services, we effectively reduce the server's attack surface. This enhances the overall performance and stability of the server environment in addition to helping to block possible entry points for bad actors.\n\nConsidering the continuous evolution of cyber threats, up-to-date security infrastructure is mandatory, further stressing the necessity to reduce unnecessary services.","comment_id":"1244471","poster":"prasoonmk"},{"timestamp":"1712082540.0","comment_id":"1188231","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nIs B, the answer is literally in your face :))","poster":"LordXander"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

In this case, the most effective method would probably be to use the CHAR encoding function to convert hexadecimal and decimal values into characters that pass the SQL engine's analysis.\n\nThe main reason is that signature-based IDS systems tend to look for specific known patterns associated with known attacks. If the IDS is not configured to recognize CHAR encoding as an indicator of possible SQL injection, the attack is more likely to go undetected.\n\nAdditionally, whitespace manipulation in SQL queries might be more easily detected by the IDS if it is configured to look for unusual whitespace patterns in SQL queries.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, using the CHAR encoding feature would be the best option to evade IDS detection and succeed in the attack.","poster":"Lalo","timestamp":"1727057280.0","comment_id":"1180533"}],"comment_id":"1150339","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Nopez","timestamp":"1723645680.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
