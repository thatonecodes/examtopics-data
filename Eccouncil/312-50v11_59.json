It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access.\n\nIn some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks[https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe]"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1697532240.0","comment_id":"697151","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks _ A4 - XML External Entity (XXE)\nXML External Entity attack is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack that can occur when a misconfigured XML parser allows applications to parse XML input from an unreliable source.When this malicious input is processed by the weakly configured XML parser of a target web application, it enables the attacker to access protected files and services from servers or connected networks.

External entities can disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal SMB file shares on unpatched Windows servers, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and DoS service attacks such as the billion laughs attack.\n\nA7 – Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or whenever it updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser, which can hijack user sessions, deface websites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.","poster":"dinonino","upvote_count":"1"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/82587-exam-312-50v11-topic-1-question-360-discussion/","answer":"B"},{"id":"sUivtgRHBJ7oGX899DYz","question_text":"Elante company has recently hired James as a penetration tester.
