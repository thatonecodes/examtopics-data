Password salting.\n\nSalting involves adding random data (the \"salt\") to a password before it is hashed. This makes each password hash unique, even if two users have the same password. By adding extra characters or salt to the password before it is hashed, it becomes much more difficult for attackers to use rainbow tables, which rely on precomputed hash values.\n\nA. Password key hashing refers to hashing passwords, but it doesn’t provide protection against rainbow tables unless combined with salting.\nC. Account lockout is a security measure to block access after a number of failed login attempts, not specifically related to rainbow tables.\nD. Password hashing alone, without salting, can still be vulnerable to rainbow tables.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740125220.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1740125220,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":180,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/156920-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-312-discussion/","question_text":"Ethical hacker Jane Doe is attempting to crack the password of the head of the IT department of ABC company.

Watering hole attack\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given scenario, Joel is using a technique called the watering hole attack. This technique involves the attacker targeting a specific group of individuals or organization by infecting a website that the targeted group regularly visits, also known as the \"watering hole\". The attacker then injects a malicious code into the website, which can be used to download malware onto the victim's machine. When the victim visits the infected website, the malware is automatically downloaded onto their system. This attack is often used when traditional phishing techniques fail to work or are too risky to execute.","comment_id":"861105","timestamp":"1696427220.0","poster":"eli117","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/105123-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-32-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-04-04 15:47:00","unix_timestamp":1680616020,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","question_id":240,"question_text":"Joel, a professional hacker, targeted a company and identified the types of websites frequently visited by its employees.
