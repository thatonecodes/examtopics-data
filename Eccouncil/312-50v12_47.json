Network-based scanner\n\nAgent-based scanners can reside on a single machine and scan several machines on the same network. Agent-based scanners typically involve installing a scanning agent or software component on each target machine that you want to scan. These agents communicate with a central management system or console, which controls and coordinates the scanning process. The central console can initiate scans on multiple machines across the network, making it possible to scan multiple systems from a single machine where the console is installed.\n\nThis approach provides more control and flexibility, as you can customize scanning options for each target machine and collect detailed information. However, it requires installing agents on each target system, which can be resource-intensive and may not be suitable for all scenarios.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1056046","poster":"davitm","timestamp":"1698479700.0"},{"timestamp":"1696943700.0","comment_id":"1039535","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe main difference between agent-based scanners and network-based scanners is that agent-based scanners require a software agent to be installed on each machine that is being scanned, while network-based scanners do not.
