To calculate the number of sectors used by a 123 KB file, you can divide the file size by the sector size:\n123 KB (file size) รท 0.5 KB (sector size) = 246 sectors\nHowever, since FAT32 uses cluster allocation, which groups sectors into clusters, the actual number of sectors used will be rounded up to the nearest cluster boundary. The default cluster size for FAT32 is 8 sectors (4 KB).\nSo, the 246 sectors will be rounded up to:\n246 sectors รท 8 sectors/cluster = 25 clusters\nTherefore, a 123 KB file will use 25 clusters, which is equivalent to 25 ร 8 = 200 sectors. so the answer is B","poster":"aqeel1506","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1720878360.0"},{"poster":"Jashan_lefty","comment_id":"1225787","timestamp":"1717709640.0","content":"Wrong question","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"634049","timestamp":"1658322000.0","content":"There is an error in this question.
