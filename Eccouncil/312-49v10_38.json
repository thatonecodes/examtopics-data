Here’s why:\n\nImmediate Issue: The domain controller is the system that has gone down, so investigating it first helps address the immediate problem.\nCentral Role: The domain controller manages user authentication and access, so its failure could have widespread impacts on the network.\nRoot Cause Analysis: By starting with the domain controller, you can identify whether the issue is isolated to that system or if it’s part of a larger problem.\nAfter addressing the domain controller, you can then use the SIEM to analyze logs and events for additional context and to understand any broader security implications.","timestamp":"1721416080.0"},{"poster":"ericccong","timestamp":"1643635920.0","comment_id":"537053","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFrom the security point of view, SIEM should be the best choice."},{"poster":"Chaoticda","comment_id":"501035","content":"Answer is Domain Controller","comments":[{"comment_id":"1041802","upvote_count":"1","content":"no, if you have SIEM, your DC log should be available in SIEM as well","poster":"[Removed]","timestamp":"1697120880.0"}],"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1639452240.0"}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Company ABC has employed a firewall, IDS, Antivirus, Domain Controller, and SIEM.
