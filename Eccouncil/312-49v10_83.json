Next, all cables near there terminal end should be labeled and an identical label should be placed next to its corresponding port. Once all the cables and ports have been properly labeled, the forensic examiner should again photograph the back of the computer at several different angels. Taking these photographs will serve as proof for how the computer was configured at the scene. This documentation will be useful if the forensic examiner must later reconstruct the system. Once documented, all the cables connected to the computer should be removed.","poster":"Elb","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1231408"}],"timestamp":"2024-06-16 17:13:00","answer":"A","answer_description":"","question_id":414,"unix_timestamp":1718550780,"choices":{"B":"in case other devices were connected","C":"to know what peripheral devices exist","D":"to know what hardware existed","A":"to know what outside connections existed"},"question_text":"Why should you note all cable connections for a computer you want to seize as evidence?","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[]},{"id":"b8DGD2qbWa3XSCD09nFY","question_id":415,"question_text":"Donald made an OS disk snapshot of a compromised Azure VM under a resource group being used by the affected company as a part of forensic analysis process.

This allows investigators to perform a detailed analysis without altering the original state of the compromised system.\n\nHowever, once the snapshots are securely backed up and stored in another region or resource group, deleting them from the source resource group becomes crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access or tampering.","timestamp":"1721785620.0"}],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B"}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Eccouncil","name":"312-49v10","id":176,"numberOfQuestions":609,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false},"currentPage":83},"__N_SSP":true}
