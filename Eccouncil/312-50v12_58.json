Remediation\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe vulnerability-management life cycle consists of several phases, including risk assessment, vulnerability scan, reporting, prioritization, remediation, and verification. The remediation phase is the process of applying fixes on vulnerable systems to reduce the impact and severity of vulnerabilities.\n\nIn this phase, the organization takes actions to fix the identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact on the business. The remediation process includes the application of patches, the installation of updates, the configuration of settings, and the implementation of security controls to reduce the risk of exploitation.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"861377"}]},{"id":"zR5IoXxf80uvSH0UqPIO","answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","exam_id":180,"choices":{"B":"Man-in-the-cloud (MITC) attack","A":"Cloud cryptojacking","C":"Cloud hopper attack","D":"Cloudborne attack"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"868465","timestamp":"1681311240.0","poster":"jeremy13","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
