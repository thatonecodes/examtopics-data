When an attacker creates a complete profile of the site's external links and file structures\n\nExplanation:\nWeb server footprinting refers to the process of gathering information about a target web server in order to map out its structure and identify potential attack vectors. This includes discovering publicly available data about the server's external links, file structures, and other resources.\n\nAttackers use footprinting techniques to learn about the target's architecture and potentially vulnerable entry points. This may include identifying exposed directories, files, technologies in use, and links that could be exploited for a security breach.","comment_id":"1395579","poster":"killwitch"}]},{"id":"axVMT8TFdhWqwlu2MkwU","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/169979-exam-312-50v13-topic-1-question-285-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","choices":{"C":"Flooding the web server with requests to perform a DoS attack","A":"Performing content enumeration on the web server to discover hidden folders","D":"Downloading all the contents of the web page locally for further examination","B":"Using wget to perform banner grabbing on the webserver"},"discussion":[{"poster":"NikoTomas","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer: B\n\nWget:\n-S --server-response \nPrint the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP servers. \n\n-q --quiet \nTurn off Wget's output.","comment_id":"1411018","timestamp":"1743106620.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"B","question_text":"What would be the purpose of running \"wget 192.168.0.15 -q -S\" against a web server?","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-03-27 21:17:00","unix_timestamp":1743106620,"answer_images":[],"question_id":129,"exam_id":181,"topic":"1","answer_description":""},{"id":"zco7su6uO1u3KV6xVBVT","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC) - Linux\n\nThe common default TTL values are:\n• 64 – Linux/MAC OSX systems\n• 128 – Windows systems\n• 255 – Network devices like routers\n\nhttps://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/time-to-live-ttl/\n\nA default TCP window size of 5840 bytes is historically associated with Linux-based operating systems (older kernels), specifically:\n• Linux 2.4.x and some early Linux 2.6.x kernels\n• Also seen in embedded Linux devices, such as routers or IoT gear based on older kernels\n\nWhy 5840 Bytes?\n• The value 5840 bytes is intentionally chosen to fit within a 1460-byte MSS (Maximum Segment Size) without IP or TCP options.\n• This was a default TCP receive window that Linux used before dynamic window scaling became more common.\n• Modern Linux kernels typically negotiate higher window sizes using TCP window scaling (RFC 1323).","poster":"NikoTomas","comment_id":"1411022","timestamp":"1743107040.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1741951920.0","comments":[],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe TTL (Time to Live) and the TCP window size can be used to help identify the operating system of a target machine, as different OSes tend to set these values in specific ways.\n\n - TTL: 64: The TTL value of 64 is commonly associated with Linux or Mac OS.
