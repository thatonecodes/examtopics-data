ACK flag scan will be blocked by FW (no session exists on FW).\n\nTCP Maimon scan will be blocked by FW as well - like ACK scan, Maimon is also based on incomplete TCP session with FIN/ACK flags set (no session exists on FW).\n\nUDP scan:\n• Many FWs struggle to track UDP sessions (UDP is stateless, no handshake like TCP). \n• Some FWs mistakenly assume that UDP is harmless and allow it without strict filtering. \n• UDP scanning can identify misconfigured firewall rules, revealing hidden services.\n• Many FWs focus on filtering TCP traffic because most applications use TCP. \n• UDP is often less restricted as it is required for essential services like DNS (53), SNMP (161) and DHCP (67/68). \n• UDP scanning can identify open services that a FW does not properly restrict."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"killwitch","timestamp":"1741338840.0","comment_id":"1366193","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. ARP ping scan.\n\nARP (Address Resolution Protocol) ping scan works at the link layer (Layer 2) and does not rely on IP-based scanning techniques like TCP or UDP.\nSince firewalls typically block ICMP pings and other IP-based scans, an ARP scan bypasses these restrictions by directly querying MAC addresses in the local network.\nThis method is highly effective in discovering all active hosts on a LAN because all devices must respond to ARP requests."},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740501840.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nACK scan","comment_id":"1361498","poster":"getaseadsss"},{"comment_id":"1350397","timestamp":"1738497900.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAn ACK flag probe scan is used to discover active hosts behind a restrictive firewall by sending TCP packets with the ACK flag set.","poster":"Dogeo","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1348806","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThis correct answer is ARP ping scan","timestamp":"1738190700.0","poster":"pindinga1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nHow it works: Sends ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests to discover devices on the same local network segment.\n\nUse case: Highly effective for host discovery within the same subnet because ARP is a layer 2 protocol and is rarely blocked by firewalls.\n\nSuitability: This is the best choice for discovering active devices hidden by a restrictive firewall, especially if the target network is within the same subnet.","poster":"rmycyc","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1348678","timestamp":"1738171920.0"}],"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1"},{"id":"cymwMTqP3mKMehedM81J","answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/154562-exam-312-50v13-topic-1-question-85-discussion/","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1736944320,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Tier-3: Registries","D":"Tier-4: Orchestrators","B":"Tier-2: Testing and accreditation systems","A":"Tier-1: Developer machines"},"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Abel, a cloud architect, uses container technology to deploy applications/software including all its dependencies, such as libraries and configuration files, binaries, and other resources that run independently from other processes in the cloud environment.
