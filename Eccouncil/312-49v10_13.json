While applications create sessions via cookies over HTTP, the protocol itself lacks native session management, requiring tools like Ettercap to target application-layer vulnerabilities rather than protocol weaknesses\n-----\nIf you agree, please UPVOTE.\nEach time you upvote someone with a YELLOW VOTE BANNER (like me) your vote is added to the Community Vote Distribution, which helps by crowdsourcing correct answers.","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Elb","timestamp":"1718416140.0","comment_id":"1230743","upvote_count":"1","content":"HTTP is a stateless protocol and, consequently, every HTTP request a website receives is viewed independently."}]},{"id":"oAheQ4CiRTZfhssaNVaN","question_id":62,"timestamp":"2024-12-07 06:07:00","answer_description":"","answer":"C","exam_id":176,"question_text":"A packet is sent to a router that does not have the packet destination address in its route table.\nHow will the packet get to its proper destination?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741834620.0","poster":"044f354","comment_id":"1388156","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The gateway of last resort routes packets with unknown destinations.\n\n(A) ❌ Root Internet servers handle DNS, not packet routing.\n(B) ❌ BGP manages routing between autonomous systems, not individual packets.\n(C) ✅ Gateway of last resort forwards packets when no specific route exists.\n(D) ❌ Reverse DNS resolves IP addresses to domain names, unrelated to routing.\n\n-----\nIf you agree, please UPVOTE.\nEach time you upvote someone with a YELLOW VOTE BANNER (like me) your vote is added to the Community Vote Distribution, which helps by crowdsourcing correct answers."},{"poster":"Cisco103","comment_id":"1323018","timestamp":"1733548020.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\ndifferent way to mean: Default gateway"}],"answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1733548020,"choices":{"D":"Reverse DNS","C":"Gateway of last resort","B":"Border Gateway Protocol","A":"Root Internet servers"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/152652-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-188-discussion/","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"KzabCWMmvfJrZgm1Oi0p","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"question_id":63,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_text":"James is testing the ability of his routers to withstand DoS attacks.
