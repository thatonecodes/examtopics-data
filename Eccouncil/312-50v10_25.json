It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls. It is also relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never completes TCP connections. SYN scan works against any compliant TCP stack rather than depending on idiosyncrasies of specific platforms as Nmap's FIN/NULL/Xmas, Maimon and idle scans do. It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between the open, closed, and filtered states.","comment_id":"133291","upvote_count":"3","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","timestamp":"1720823400.0"}],"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2020-07-13 00:30:00","choices":{"A":"nmap -sU","B":"nmap -sS","D":"nmap -sT","C":"nmap -sM"},"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","question_text":"What would you enter, if you wanted to perform a stealth scan using Nmap?","answer":"B","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1594593000,"answers_community":[],"question_id":121,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/25531-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-29-discussion/"},{"id":"Os5Cew8gzNHZbAlzIeKc","topic":"1","answers_community":[],"question_images":[],"question_text":"A common cryptographical tool is the use of XOR.

Host OS on containers has a larger surface attack.\nThey share host OS, allowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in one container to attack others or the host system. Virtual machines provide more isolation, making it harder for attackers to directly target the host.
