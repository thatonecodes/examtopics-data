In this scenario, when the user clicked on the link in the email that seemed to lead to an interesting website with a cat video, the attacker exploited clickjacking to overlay that link with an invisible frame or layer that directed the user to a different action, such as initiating a fund transfer from the user's bank account.\nIn this case, the attacker used the user's own browser to perform actions without the user's knowledge, making it appear as though the user initiated the actions, which include unauthorized fund transfers from the bank account. This technique allows the attacker to perform actions on a different site in the context of the user's active session.","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"989351","poster":"ostorgaf"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"The answer is C","timestamp":"1686140160.0","comment_id":"917204","poster":"vitusisya"},{"timestamp":"1667661000.0","comment_id":"711843","content":"Answer is C","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Chucho_es_gay"},{"comment_id":"693461","poster":"studyin","timestamp":"1665620100.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is C"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"C is the right for this one!","timestamp":"1665254460.0","comment_id":"689613","poster":"leandrosoares"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"677691","poster":"antoclk","timestamp":"1664008740.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\n**CSRF** - tricks a web browser into executing an unwanted action in an application to which a user is already logged in. the attacker will typically use social engineering, such as an email or link that will trick a victim into sending a forger request to a server. **require a user to do something**. works only one way – it can only send HTTP requests, but **cannot view the response**."},{"comment_id":"676414","timestamp":"1663866420.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"tosmap","content":"Answer is C"},{"comment_id":"652916","upvote_count":"1","poster":"basel07019","content":"Answer is C","timestamp":"1661684460.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"CSRF CSRF CSRF CSRF","comment_id":"585639","poster":"GowherMalik","timestamp":"1649928240.0"},{"poster":"bolshoibooze","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1647384900.0","content":"The bank saying it came from a foreign country means the request did not originate from the users machine...
