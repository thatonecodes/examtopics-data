The most widely used cache poisoning prevention tool is DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extension). It was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force and provides secure DNS data authentication.\n\nWhen deployed, computers will be able to confirm if DNS responses are legitimate, whereas it currently has no way of determining real or fake ones. It also has the ability to verify that a domain name does not exist at all, which can help prevent man in the middle attacks.\n\nDNSSEC will verify the root domain or sometimes called “signing the root.” When an end user attempts to access a site, a stub resolver on their computer requests the site's IP address from a recursive name server. After the record is requested by the server, it will also request the zones DNSEC key. The key will then be used to verify that the IP address record is the same as the record on the authoritative server.","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","timestamp":"1721130780.0"}],"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1594900380,"exam_id":178,"answer":"B","topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","timestamp":"2020-07-16 13:53:00","isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_id":181,"question_text":"Some clients of TPNQM SA were redirected to a malicious site when they tried to access the TPNQM main site.

Passwords or passphrases created by humans are often short or predictable enough to allow password cracking, and key stretching is intended to make such attacks more difficult by complicating a basic step of trying a single password candidate. Key stretching also improves security in some real-world applications where the key length has been constrained, by mimicking a longer key length from the perspective of a brute-force attacker.[1]","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721130840.0","comment_id":"136434"}],"timestamp":"2020-07-16 13:54:00","choices":{"B":"Key Stretching","D":"Double Hashing","A":"Keyed Hashing","C":"Salting"},"question_images":[],"question_id":182},{"id":"7MAyZdd0JOWu7fPEUu4N","unix_timestamp":1594900560,"answers_community":[],"answer":"B","choices":{"D":"-A","B":"-T5","C":"-O","A":"-T0"},"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"t0 t1 slow avoid ids t2 t3 normal t4 t5 is fast","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","comment_id":"136437","timestamp":"1721130960.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"timestamp":"2020-07-16 13:56:00","isMC":true,"exam_id":178,"question_id":183,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/25895-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-78-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_text":"Which Nmap option would you use if you were not concerned about being detected and wanted to perform a very fast scan?"},{"id":"GHMcPWo7g3HHippwU8LD","answer":"D","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2020-06-12 06:31:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/22928-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-8-discussion/","isMC":true,"exam_id":178,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"question_id":184,"unix_timestamp":1591936260,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"achugh053","timestamp":"1729444560.0","content":"answer is B.
