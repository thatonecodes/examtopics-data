Separate students in a different VLAN\n\nTo avoid unauthorized students from connecting their notebooks to the wired network, Bob should separate them into a different Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN). VLANs are logical networks created within a physical network, and they allow the network administrator to segment the network traffic and control access based on the VLAN membership.\n\nBy placing students in a separate VLAN, Bob can restrict their access to only specific resources and services, preventing them from connecting to the same network as professors and authorized visitors. This segmentation will help improve network security and reduce the risk of malware activities and unauthorized access.","comment_id":"955037","poster":"BlackAdam","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721283960.0"}],"exam_id":178,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":169,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/23645-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-63-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Use the 802.1x protocol","B":"Separate students in a different VLAN","A":"Disable unused ports in the switches","D":"Ask students to use the wireless network"},"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"C","answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2020-06-21 18:37:00","unix_timestamp":1592757420},{"id":"Bkpnli6loubKp3BAVm7y","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/26326-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-64-discussion/","exam_id":178,"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1724349240.0","poster":"tinex","upvote_count":"7","content":"Bluetooth Attacks\nBluesmacking - denial of service against device\nBluejacking - sending unsolicited messages\nBluesniffing - attempt to discover Bluetooth devices\nBluebugging - remotely using a device's features\nBluesnarfing - theft of data from a device\nBlueprinting - collecting device information over Bluetooth","comment_id":"296931"},{"timestamp":"1723956480.0","poster":"JKCY","content":"bluesmacking =form of DDOS.
