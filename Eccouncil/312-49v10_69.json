The most likely anomaly is a web bug, which was commonly used in early web tracking but is now often replaced by more sophisticated tracking methods.\n\nWeb Bugs Were Common in Early Internet Tracking. A web bug (or tracking pixel) is a 1x1 transparent image embedded in a webpage or email. It loads from an external server, secretly tracking user behavior (e.g., IP address, browser type, and page interactions).\n\nThese were heavily used in the early 2000s for advertising, email tracking, and analytics before modern tracking scripts (e.g., Google Analytics)."},{"comment_id":"588937","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1729455720.0","poster":"jjweust","content":"The word bug only occurs 4 times in CHFI v10 manual, never in this context and this is impossible to answer without more information.

This computer, according to the police, was used by a hacker who gained access to numerous banking institutions to steal customer information. After preliminary investigations, Gill finds in the computer's log files that the hacker was able to gain access to these banks through the use of Trojan horses. The hacker then used these Trojan horses to obtain remote access to the companies' domain controllers. From this point, Gill found that the hacker pulled off the SAM files from the domain controllers to then attempt and crack network passwords.

While effective, it's more complex than a simple dictionary attack.\nBrute Force Attack: This method tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct one is found.
