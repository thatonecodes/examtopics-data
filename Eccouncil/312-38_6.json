SLP.\n\nSLP (Service Location Protocol) is a session layer protocol used to allow network services to advertise their existence to other network devices. It is used to locate network services such as printers, file servers, and directory services in a network. SLP allows clients to dynamically discover services and servers in a network and is used in conjunction with other protocols such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System).\n\nRPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a presentation layer protocol used for communication between applications running on different computers. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a presentation layer protocol used for remote desktop connections.

ATM uses a fixed-length packet called a cell, which is 53 bytes in size, to transmit data.\n\nHowever, there are no IEEE standards for wireless ATM. There are other wireless networking technologies that have been developed to provide high-speed data transfer, such as WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) and LTE (Long-Term Evolution), which are designed to provide wireless broadband access.","timestamp":"1727253420.0","comment_id":"850028","upvote_count":"2"}],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/103840-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-255-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following IEEE standards provides specifications for wireless ATM systems?"},{"id":"Yz6qCa1SjxiEu3xerQZD","question_text":"Which of the following UTP cables supports transmission up to 20MHz?","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-03-25 11:48:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/103843-exam-312-38-topic-1-question-263-discussion/","question_id":28,"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":173,"choices":{"B":"Category 5e","A":"Category 2","D":"Category 1","C":"Category 4"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nCategory 4 UTP cable is capable of supporting data transfer rates up to 16 Mbps, which was faster than Category 3 cable, but slower than Category 5 cable and later categories.
