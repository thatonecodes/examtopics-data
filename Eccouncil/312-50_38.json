This can be achieved by implementing SMTP authentication mechanisms such as SMTP-AUTH or STARTTLS, which require clients to provide valid credentials before establishing a connection to the server.\n\nBlocking port 25 at the firewall (option A) would indeed prevent telnet access to the SMTP server, but it would also affect legitimate email communication as port 25 is the standard SMTP port used for email delivery. Shutting off the SMTP service on the server (option B) would completely disable email functionality. Switching from Windows Exchange to UNIX Sendmail (option D) is not necessary to address the issue at hand and would involve a significant infrastructure change. ---ChatGPT","comment_id":"902148","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"gauravtewari","comment_id":"488866","content":"Blocking port 25 in the firewall or forcing all connections to use username and password would have the consequences that the server is unable to communicate with other SMTP servers.
