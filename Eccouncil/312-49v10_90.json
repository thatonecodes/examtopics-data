To enforce the security of all devices and software in the scene\n\nWhile it's essential for the forensic analyst to maintain the security of evidence and maintain the chain of custody, their primary role is to gather, analyze, and document digital evidence. Enforcing the security of devices and software at the scene might fall more within the responsibilities of law enforcement or security personnel rather than the forensic analyst, who is more focused on data retrieval, analysis, and documentation.","upvote_count":"1"}],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/118767-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-632-discussion/","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":176,"isMC":true},{"id":"JP35rblrJQ71QXCnp0eC","answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/115030-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-633-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"isMC":true,"question_id":447,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1689232140,"timestamp":"2023-07-13 09:09:00","answer_description":"","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743027060.0","poster":"044f354","comment_id":"1410607","content":"Selected Answer: D\nNone of the dedicated memory acquisition tools are listed.\nVolatility is the best AVAILABLE option.\n\nECCouncil Official CHFI\nhttps://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/reader/books/9781635676969/\nModule 06 Page 587\n\n\"Volatility\nSource: https://www.volatilityfoundation.org\nThe Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools, implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
