If the audit findings impact regulatory compliance, the organization must address them to avoid legal, financial, and reputational consequences.\n\nA risk-based approach means:\n\n- Prioritizing remediation to meet compliance requirements.\n- Optimizing resources by implementing solutions that address multiple findings at once.\n- Ensuring cost-effective security improvements that align with business objectives.\n\nBy applying remediation strategies that cover multiple findings efficiently, the CISO ensures regulatory compliance, risk reduction, and resource optimization.\n\nThis aligns with NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and ISO 27001 Annex A.12 (Security Operations), which emphasize cost-effective risk mitigation while ensuring compliance.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ME79"}]},{"id":"BNCDK5Lwhhor5cxcBAS1","choices":{"B":"Install software patch, operate system, maintain system","C":"Discover software, remove affected software, apply software patch","A":"Install software patch, configuration adjustment, software removal","D":"Software removal, install software patch, maintain system"},"exam_id":183,"question_text":"An information security department is required to remediate system vulnerabilities when they are discovered.

Information Security and Identity Access Management teams perform two distinct functions.\n\nProper separation of duties is an important principle in the corporate environment to ensure accountability, prevent conflicts of interest, and reduce the risk of fraud or unauthorized activities. The separation of duties involves dividing responsibilities among different individuals or teams to create checks and balances.
