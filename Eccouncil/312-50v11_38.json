The page with the vulnerability may not be one that displays data but will display differently depending on the results of a logical statement injected into the legitimate SQL statement called for that page. This type of attack has traditionally been considered time-intensive because a new statement needed to be crafted for each bit recovered, and depending on its structure, the attack may consist of many unsuccessful requests. Recent advancements have allowed each request to recover multiple bits, with no unsuccessful requests, allowing for more consistent and efficient extraction. There are several tools that can automate these attacks once the location of the vulnerability and the target information has been established.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Blind_SQL_injection","poster":"Gerasz87","timestamp":"1713333840.0"},{"timestamp":"1694624160.0","comment_id":"444105","upvote_count":"3","content":"Blind SQL injection is nearly identical to normal SQL Injection, the only difference being the way the data is retrieved from the database.
