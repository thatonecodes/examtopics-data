Normally, Nmap uses this stage to determine active machines for heavier scanning. By default, Nmap only performs heavy probing such as port scans, version detection, or OS detection against hosts that are found to be up. Disabling host discovery with -Pn causes Nmap to attempt the requested scanning functions against every target IP address specified. So if a class B target address space (/16) is specified on the command line, all 65,536 IP addresses are scanned. Proper host discovery is skipped as with the list scan, but instead of stopping and printing the target list, Nmap continues to perform requested functions as if each target IP is active. To skip ping scan and port scan, while still allowing NSE to run, use the two options -Pn -sn together."},{"content":"UDP Scan (-sU)\nWhile most popular services on the Internet run over the TCP protocol, UDP services are widely deployed. DNS, SNMP, and DHCP (registered ports 53, 161/162, and 67/68) are three of the most common. Because UDP scanning is generally slower and more difficult than TCP, some security auditors ignore these ports. This is a mistake, as exploitable UDP services are quite common and attackers certainly don't ignore the whole protocol. Fortunately, Nmap can help inventory UDP ports.","timestamp":"1708221000.0","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","comment_id":"160405","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"160404","upvote_count":"3","content":"CP SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS)\nSYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reason. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls. SYN scan is relatively unobtrusive and stealthy, since it never completes TCP connections. It also works against any compliant TCP stack rather than depending on idiosyncrasies of specific platforms as Nmap's FIN/NULL/Xmas, Maimon and idle scans do. It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between open, closed, and filtered states.","timestamp":"1708220940.0","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks"}],"answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following Nmap commands will produce the following output?\n//IMG//","answers_community":[],"question_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03167/0007200001.png"],"exam_id":178,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/28899-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-162-discussion/","question_id":42,"unix_timestamp":1597708140,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2020-08-18 01:49:00","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"VUVsJlykPg0V1EjWFgGQ","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1723939080.0","comment_id":"160408","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","upvote_count":"1","content":"In computing terminology, a macro virus is a virus that is written in a macro language: a programming language which is embedded inside a software application (e.g., word processors and spreadsheet applications). Some applications, such as Microsoft Office, Excel, PowerPoint allow macro programs to be embedded in documents such that the macros are run automatically when the document is opened, and this provides a distinct mechanism by which malicious computer instructions can spread. This is one reason it can be dangerous to open unexpected attachments in e-mails. Many antivirus programs can detect macro viruses; however, the macro virus' behavior can still be difficult to detect."}],"answer":"C","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2020-08-18 01:58:00","unix_timestamp":1597708680,"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"choices":{"C":"Macro virus","D":"Stealth virus","B":"Multipart virus","A":"Polymorphic virus"},"answer_ET":"C","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/28900-exam-312-50v10-topic-1-question-164-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following programs is usually targeted at Microsoft Office products?","question_id":43,"exam_id":178,"topic":"1"},{"id":"HiIzsp7f7KjYioFPx8mj","exam_id":178,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"A","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","comment_id":"160420","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1723940160.0","content":"Though a WAP device supports up to 20 clients at a time, a user might decide to specify a particular number of devices to be allowed either by a MAC address or IP address."},{"upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"bleble00001","content":"\"is not responding to the association requests being sent\" is the key.
