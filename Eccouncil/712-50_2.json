Defense in depth cost enumerated costs\n\nDefense in depth is a cybersecurity strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls (defenses) to protect information and resources. Implementing a secondary authentication process is a classic example of adding an additional layer of security, enhancing the overall security posture by requiring multiple factors to authenticate users. This approach ensures that even if one layer of defense (e.g., primary authentication) is compromised, other layers (e.g., secondary authentication) provide additional protection.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1707729960.0","comment_id":"1147921","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect answer is A","poster":"musagul"},{"content":"A.
