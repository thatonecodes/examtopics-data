By manipulating session data to look like valid communication, the attacker floods the system with these fake requests, consuming resources and potentially causing the application to become unresponsive or leading to unauthorized access. \nThis type of attack exploits weaknesses in session management and network traffic monitoring, making it difficult to detect and mitigate. \n\nAttackers can submit a fake SYN packet (used to initiate a TCP connection), followed by multiple ACK packets (which acknowledge the receipt of data), and at least one RST (reset) or FIN (connection termination) packet. By crafting these packets, they mimic a genuine TCP session, tricking security systems into believing the communication is legitimate. \n\nhttps://www.indusface.com/learning/spoofed-session-flood-attack/","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"Jude, a pen tester working in Keiltech Ltd., performs sophisticated security testing on his company's network infrastructure to identify security loopholes. In this process, he started to circumvent the network protection tools and firewalls used in the company. He employed a technique that can create forged TCP sessions by carrying out multiple SYN, ACK, and RST or FIN packets. Further, this process allowed Jude to execute DDoS attacks that can exhaust the network resources.\nWhat is the attack technique used by Jude for finding loopholes in the above scenario?","exam_id":181,"question_images":[],"answer":"A","timestamp":"2025-03-10 23:24:00","choices":{"D":"Ping-of-death attack","A":"Spoofed session flood attack","B":"UDP flood attack","C":"Peer-to-peer attack"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/168834-exam-312-50v13-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","question_id":161,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1741645440},{"id":"JnuyGWHcXDmMYpAyaoOO","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/168835-exam-312-50v13-topic-1-question-59-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Jim, a professional hacker, targeted an organization that is operating critical industrial infrastructure.
