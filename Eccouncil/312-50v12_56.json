The jailbreak exploit needs to be applied again using special software or tools to gain access to the device’s filesystem and allow the installation of unauthorized apps and modifications. Without this reapplication, the device will boot into a non-jailbroken state.\n\nOn the other hand, an untethered jailbreak is more convenient as it does not require a computer connection every time the device restarts. Once the untethered jailbreak is successfully performed, the modifications made to the device remain persistent even after a reboot. The device can be turned on and off without losing the jailbreak status, allowing the use of unauthorized apps and tweaks without any additional steps.","comment_id":"919193","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Rocko1","timestamp":"1702125600.0"},{"timestamp":"1728907320.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1195483","poster":"RITYdff545454545f","content":"B IS CORRECT"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Untethered jailbreaking\n\nExplanation:\n\nUntethered jailbreaking is a type of jailbreaking technique that allows an iOS device to maintain the jailbreak state even after rebooting. This is achieved by patching the kernel during the device boot process so that it always loads a jailbroken version of the operating system. Unlike tethered or semi-tethered jailbreaking, the user does not need to connect the device to a computer each time it is rebooted to maintain the jailbreak state.","comment_id":"861356","poster":"eli117"}],"unix_timestamp":1680631320,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-04-04 20:02:00","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/105166-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-65-discussion/","choices":{"D":"Untethered jailbreaking","C":"Semi-tethered jailbreaking","B":"Semi-untethered jailbreaking","A":"Tethered jailbreaking"},"answer_images":[],"answer":"D","question_text":"Which IOS jailbreaking technique patches the kernel during the device boot so that it becomes jailbroken after each successive reboot?","exam_id":180,"isMC":true,"question_id":276},{"id":"vBKjt12DrVi5qMjpITp8","exam_id":180,"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1680631380,"answer_ET":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/105167-exam-312-50v12-topic-1-question-66-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB. WS-Address spoofing\n\nExplanation:\n\nWS-Address spoofing is an attack technique used to exploit a vulnerability that provides additional routing information in the SOAP header to support asynchronous communication. This vulnerability allows the transmission of web-service requests and response messages using different TCP connections. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by modifying the WS-Addressing header to redirect the web-service request to a different endpoint or server.\n\nIn a WS-Address spoofing attack, the attacker crafts a malicious SOAP message that includes a modified WS-Addressing header. This header contains a spoofed address that points to a malicious endpoint or server controlled by the attacker. When the SOAP message is processed by the web service, it sends the response to the spoofed address specified in the header, allowing the attacker to intercept and modify the response.","upvote_count":"7","timestamp":"1696442580.0","poster":"eli117","comment_id":"861357"},{"poster":"jeremy13","upvote_count":"6","comment_id":"896412","timestamp":"1699860180.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
