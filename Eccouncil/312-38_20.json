This method can identify new forms of attacks that are not in the IDS signature database and issue a warning. The disadvantage of this method is issuing false positive messages, which will complicate the functioning of an administrator. In the anomaly detection step, if the attack signature matches, the connections will be disconnected from the source IP, the packet will be dropped, the activity will be logged, and an alarm will be initiated. Alternatively, the packet will be sent to stateful protocol analysis.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1666770720.0"}]}],"exam":{"name":"312-38","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":188,"id":173,"isImplemented":true,"provider":"Eccouncil","isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":false},"currentPage":20},"__N_SSP":true}
