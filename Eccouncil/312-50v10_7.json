There's several ways of accomplishing it. Email-based exploited PDFs are probably most common, as they can affect the BES server directly or turn the endpoint into a proxy for attacks. What most people don't realize is that a BES server will proxy ALL traffic for any device registered to it. If the BES server is not properly kept in a secure DMZ, you can use the server to attack your network from the inside.\n\nIf a handset is exploited (using any means), anything your BES server is attached to can be attacked. Any mail or other communications processed by the BES server could also potentially also exploit the BES server and use it as a proxy.","poster":"Neela","comment_id":"182184","timestamp":"1726738860.0"},{"timestamp":"1723548420.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"157248","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","content":"bbcrack uses a new algorithm based on patterns of interest to bruteforce typical malware obfuscation such as XOR, ROL, ADD and various combinations, in order to guess which algorithms/keys have been used."},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","timestamp":"1723548300.0","comment_id":"157244","content":"Paros Overview\nParos runs as a GUI JAVA application and supports spidering, HTTP message editing, proxy-chaining, and intelligent scanning for SQL and XSS vulnerabilities.

An individual finds the public key of the person he or she wants to contact in a directory. 2. This public key is used to encrypt a message that is then sent to the intended recipient. 3. The receiver uses the private key to decrypt the message and reads it. No one but the holder of the private key can decrypt a message composed with the corresponding public key. This increases the security of the information because all communications involve only public keys; the message sender never transmits or shares the private keys. The sender must link the public keys with the usernames in a secured method to ensure that individuals claiming to be the intended recipient do not intercept information.
