It accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending a partial request. Periodically, it will send subsequent HTTP headers, adding to, but never completing, the request. Affected servers will keep these connections open, filling their maximum concurrent connection pool.\n\nIncorrect:\n\nPhlashing = attack when an attacker bricks a device or destroys firmware, rendering the device or an entire system useless.
