This policy sets an expiration date for passwords, after which users must update their passwords to continue accessing their accounts. The purpose of password aging is to reduce the risk of compromised passwords by ensuring they are changed regularly.\n\nHere's why the other options are less appropriate:\n\nB. A Single Sign-On requirement: Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems without re-entering credentials. This is unrelated to password aging.\n\nC. Time in seconds a user is allocated to change a password: This describes a timeout for a password change session rather than the concept of password aging.\n\nD. The amount of time it takes for a password to activate: This is not related to password aging. Activation time refers to how long it takes for a new password to become effective after being set.","poster":"johndoe69","comment_id":"1226385","timestamp":"1733610000.0"},{"timestamp":"1695340860.0","comment_id":"846576","poster":"Pika26","upvote_count":"1","content":"Answer is A."},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct answer","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1673933160.0","comment_id":"632444","poster":"arifbhatkar"},{"poster":"ahmad_Hammad","content":"A is correct","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1633848240.0","comment_id":"332360"},{"comment_id":"293502","poster":"e_karma","timestamp":"1629292440.0","comments":[{"poster":"SujeewaUP","comment_id":"319872","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1632547260.0","content":"A is the correct answer"}],"upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer is A.
