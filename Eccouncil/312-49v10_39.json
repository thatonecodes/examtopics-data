Bit Stream Imaging.\nBit Stream Imaging, also known as bit-for-bit imaging or sector-by-sector imaging, is a technique used to create an exact replica of a digital evidence media, such as a hard drive or USB drive. This process creates a identical copy of the original media, including all data, metadata, and even blank spaces.\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\nA. Data Extraction: This technique extracts specific data from a digital evidence media, but does not create a complete replica.\nB. Backup: A backup is a copy of important data, but it's not a bit-for-bit copy of the entire media.\nD. Data Deduplication: This technique removes duplicate data to reduce storage size, but does not create a replica of the media.","poster":"aqeel1506","comment_id":"1251414","timestamp":"1721417700.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"question_id":195,"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1721417700,"choices":{"C":"Bit Stream Imaging","A":"Data Extraction","D":"Data Deduplication","B":"Backup"}}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":176,"isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":609,"name":"312-49v10","provider":"Eccouncil","isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":39},"__N_SSP":true}
