The protocol uses DNS tables that contain the domain name and its equivalent IP address stored in a distributed large database. In DNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, the attacker tricks a DNS server into believing that it has received authentic information when, in reality, it has not received any. The attacker tries to redirect the victim to a malicious server instead of the legitimate server. The attacker does this by manipulating the DNS table entries in the DNS. This results in substitution of a false IP address at the DNS level, where web addresses are converted into numeric IP addresses."},{"timestamp":"1659503460.0","poster":"AbdullahK1997","upvote_count":"6","content":"DNS spoofing is correct","comment_id":"419057"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nOption C.
