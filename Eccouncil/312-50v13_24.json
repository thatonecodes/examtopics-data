Why RC5 is the correct choice:\n\n- 128-bit symmetric block cipher: RC5 is a block cipher, and it can operate on 128-bit blocks.\n- Key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits: RC5 supports variable key sizes, including 128, 192, and 256 bits, making it adaptable to different security requirements.\n- 32 rounds: RC5 uses a variable number of rounds, and it can be configured to perform 32 rounds in its computations.\n- Substitution and permutation operations: RC5 uses a combination of substitution and permutation (SP) operations during each round, which is in line with the question's description.\n- S-boxes with 4-bit entry and 4-bit exit: RC5 uses S-boxes in its round function. The S-boxes in RC5, which operate on 4 bits, fit the specified entry and exit size.\n- 32-bit word blocks: RC5 operates on 32-bit words, which aligns with the requirement of using 4 32-bit word blocks.","poster":"killwitch","timestamp":"1741949580.0"}]},{"id":"JknVU0RsjEeWTwz3d3JK","answer_ET":"D","question_id":118,"choices":{"C":"Kube-controller-manager","A":"Kube-apiserver","D":"Kube-scheduler","B":"Etcd cluster"},"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1410986","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1743101520.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer: D\n\nIn a Kubernetes cluster, the kube-scheduler is the master component responsible for:\n\n - Pod scheduling --> Watches for newly created Pods that have no node assigned\n - Node selection --> Assigns pods to appropriate nodes based on multiple factors\n - Decision criteria:\n • CPU & memory requirements\n • Data locality\n • Taints and tolerations\n • Node affinity/anti-affinity\n • Custom policies\n • Internal workload balancing","poster":"NikoTomas"}],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Geena, a cloud architect, uses a master component in the Kubernetes cluster architecture that scans newly generated pods and allocates a node to them.
