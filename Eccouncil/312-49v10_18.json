This action can corrupt the disk.\nWhen carrying out a forensic investigation, it's essential to preserve the integrity of the evidence, which includes the disk and its partitions. Deleting a partition on a dynamic disk can lead to corruption of the entire disk, causing data loss and potentially compromising the investigation.\nDynamic disks use a database to manage disk configuration and partition information, and deleting a partition can update this database, potentially overwriting important evidence. Additionally, dynamic disks often have complex relationships between partitions, and deleting one partition can affect others, leading to unintended consequences.","poster":"aqeel1506","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721197380.0","comment_id":"1249429"}]},{"id":"VudPOqwl4jmaRjmTB2tS","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-06-13 01:14:00","question_id":87,"choices":{"C":"Remove all the system memory","B":"Removing the CMOS battery","D":"Login to Windows and disable the BIOS password","A":"Removing the processor"},"exam_id":176,"answer_description":"","answer":"B","isMC":true,"question_text":"What is one method of bypassing a system BIOS password?","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1718234040,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/142434-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-216-discussion/","discussion":[{"poster":"Elb","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1718234040.0","comment_id":"1229548","content":"Selected Answer: B\nMethods to Bypass/Reset BIOS password\nUsing a manufacturerâ€™s backdoor password to access the BIOS\nUsing password cracking software \nResetting the CMOS using jumpers or solder beads \nRemoving the CMOS battery for at least 10 minutes"}]},{"id":"nxUTwQheyxZ6d2BuzCl4","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/140128-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-217-discussion/","answer_ET":"B","unix_timestamp":1715076060,"answer_images":[],"exam_id":176,"isMC":true,"choices":{"A":"Every byte of the file(s) is given an MD5 hash to match against a master file","C":"Every byte of the file(s) is copied to three different hard drives","D":"Every byte of the file(s) is encrypted using three different methods","B":"Every byte of the file(s) is verified using 32-bit CRC"},"question_text":"What technique used by Encase makes it virtually impossible to tamper with evidence once it has been acquired?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1251639","timestamp":"1721465940.0","poster":"4bd3116","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe use of MD5 hashes ensures that any modification or tampering with the evidence would change the hash value, thus making tampering detectable."},{"poster":"aqeel1506","comment_id":"1249440","content":"The correct answer is A. Every byte of the file(s) is given an MD5 hash to match against a master file.\nEncase, a digital forensics tool, uses MD5 hashing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of evidence. When evidence is acquired, Encase calculates an MD5 hash value for every byte of the file(s), creating a unique digital fingerprint. This hash value is then compared to a master file to verify that the evidence has not been altered or tampered with.\nMD5 hashing is a one-way encryption method that produces a fixed-length string of characters, making it virtually impossible to modify the evidence without changing the hash value. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the evidence, making it admissible in court.","timestamp":"1721198100.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"aqeel1506","content":"The technique used by EnCase to make it virtually impossible to tamper with evidence once it has been acquired is A.
