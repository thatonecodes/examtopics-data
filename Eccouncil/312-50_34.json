Database hardening (option B) is about securing the database from attacks, but the issue here is with the management of credentials, not the database structure or protection mechanisms. In this scenario, we have to assume the credentials were easy to guess, which shows weak security practices and policies to protect against unauthorized access.\nThere could be confusion between the specific use of security tokens and other security practices. For instance, if B mentioned a practice that's commonly misunderstood or conflated with the use of tokens, like encryption or specific types of authentication methods, it might seem like a good choice without understanding the distinct role and definition of security tokens.","comment_id":"1156736","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724353680.0","poster":"Script_Kitty"},{"timestamp":"1700243160.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"900318","content":"ok, here is my theory after reading the question so many times.
