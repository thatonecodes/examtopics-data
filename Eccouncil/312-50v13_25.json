Subsequently, the attacker scans the list to find a vulnerable machine. On finding one, the attacker installs malicious code on it and divides the list in half. The attacker continues to scan one half, whereas the other half is scanned by the newly compromised machine. This process keeps repeating, causing the number of compromised machines to increase exponentially. This technique ensures the installation of malicious code on all the potentially vulnerable machines in the hit list within a short time.","poster":"SNimlaka","comment_id":"1346362"},{"comment_id":"1344783","content":"Selected Answer: C\nHIT LIST SCANNING","poster":"shabnaluttu","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1737553980.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"JOHNBOO","timestamp":"1736110500.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC.
