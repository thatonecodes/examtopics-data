This could potentially fool the application into treating \"Ned\" as an access control parameter, allowing Rob to access Ned's account without proper authorization. This technique is also known as a null byte injection attack.\n\nOption A is an example of SQL injection, where an attacker tries to modify the query to retrieve unauthorized data. Option C is an example of parameter tampering, where an attacker tries to modify a parameter value to gain access to unauthorized data.
