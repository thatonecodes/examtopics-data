That's the DNS relative problem."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIf websites are accessible by IP address but not by URL, it suggests that traffic on TCP port 80 is blocked. TCP port 80 is used for standard HTTP traffic, which is used to access websites through their URLs. When TCP port 80 is blocked, web browsers are unable to establish the necessary HTTP connections to load web pages using URLs.\nIf the issue were a blocked DNS UDP port 53 issue, you would likely encounter problems when initially trying to resolve domain names to IP addresses using DNS. This would prevent you from even reaching the stage where you could attempt to access websites by either IP address or URL. In that case, you would experience issues with the DNS resolution process itself, before even trying to establish an HTTP connection on port 80.\nIn contrast, when you can access websites by IP address but not by URL, it's more likely that the issue lies with establishing the HTTP connection on port 80, which is used to load web pages. This points to a potential issue with blocked traffic on TCP port 80.","poster":"ostorgaf","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1708830540.0","comment_id":"989601"},{"comments":[{"timestamp":"1694875140.0","poster":"Z360","comment_id":"841188","upvote_count":"2","content":"Its TCP but here we are trying some queries.
