Deception technology.\n\nDeception technology is used to lure attackers into false environments or decoy systems. These decoy systems are designed to mimic the appearance and behavior of real systems, applications, or data, with the purpose of attracting attackers and diverting their attention away from actual critical systems. Deception technology can include decoy servers, fake network segments, or deceptive data files.","poster":"arifbhatkar","comment_id":"943856","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nHONEY POT: DECEPTION APP","comment_id":"910897","poster":"VOAKDO_cciso","timestamp":"1701331860.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Answer is C.","comment_id":"846590","poster":"Pika26","timestamp":"1695341340.0"},{"timestamp":"1674732060.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"vernfwx","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC instead","comment_id":"637299"},{"timestamp":"1673931900.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Correct answer is C","poster":"arifbhatkar","comment_id":"632439"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"503007","content":"C is the answer.

Each node set to local time.\n\nSetting each node to local time would negatively impact a log analysis of a multinational organization. In order to perform effective log analysis, it is important to have consistent and standardized timestamps across all log entries. If each node within the organization is set to local time, it would introduce inconsistencies in the timestamps recorded in the log files, making it difficult to correlate events accurately and perform accurate analysis across different systems and regions.","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Pika26","timestamp":"1679404920.0","content":"Answer is C.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"845993"},{"upvote_count":"3","content":"A.
