Each file in the file system is represented by an inode.\n\nThe inode internal link count is a field within the inode that counts the number of hard links pointing to the inode. When a new hard link is created to a file, the inode internal link count is incremented by 1. When a hard link is deleted, the inode internal link count is decremented by 1.\n\nWhen the inode internal link count reaches 0, it means that there are no more hard links pointing to the file. This indicates that the file is no longer in use and can be deleted. At this point, the file system marks the inode and the blocks containing the file's data as available for reuse.\n\nTherefore, with the standard Linux second extended file system (Ext2fs), a file is deleted when the inode internal link count reaches 0.","timestamp":"1727314680.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"user009","comment_id":"850648"}],"unix_timestamp":1679794680,"answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"0","D":"1","B":"10","C":"100"},"answer_description":"","question_id":73,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/103923-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-20-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"VGuVBgbPXxaOvcUcJE5z","question_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Only Windows systems will reply to this scan","C":"A switched network will not respond to packets sent to the broadcast address","A":"Only IBM AS/400 will reply to this scan","D":"Only Unix and Unix-like systems will reply to this scan"},"answer_description":"","exam_id":176,"question_id":74,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nAnswer: C.

When a packet is sent to the broadcast address on a switched network, the switch will only forward the packet out to the ports that are connected to devices that have requested the broadcast packet, instead of flooding it to all ports like on a hub network.

Change the default community string names.\nSNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) uses community strings as passwords to authenticate access to network devices. The default community strings are well-known (\"public\" for read-only access and \"private\" for read-write access), making them easily guessable by attackers. Changing the default community string names to strong, unique passwords will significantly improve SNMP security.","timestamp":"1721194680.0","poster":"aqeel1506"}],"exam_id":176,"question_text":"Your company's network just finished going through a SAS 70 audit.
