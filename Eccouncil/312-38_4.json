It is commonly known as Token Ring and uses a physical ring topology in which devices are connected in a closed-loop configuration. Each device on the network is connected to its adjacent neighbors, forming a physical ring. This standard specifies how data is transmitted around the ring and how devices access the network.","timestamp":"1712156880.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which of the following IEEE standards defines a physical bus topology?","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2023-10-03 17:08:00","question_images":[]},{"id":"V6WmhwdP5AnBKohxz8xJ","topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following protocols is used for inter-domain multicast routing?","timestamp":"2021-10-04 15:59:00","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1633355940,"question_id":17,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"RIDA_007","content":"One common protocol for interdomain multicast routing is called Multicast Border Gateway Protocol (MBGP), which is the extension of BGP.
