Swap files\n\nSwap files (or page files) can contain remnants of data from applications that were recently used, including Tor browser. Even if the Tor browser has been uninstalled, its artifacts might still be present in the swap files, which can provide evidence of its previous usage.\n\nOther options, such as security logs, files in the Recycle Bin, or prefetch files, might not provide as direct evidence of Tor browser activity as the swap files can.","poster":"aqeel1506","timestamp":"1721575560.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1252525"}],"answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"sK1OcVOdABZP9qTbpRP6","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1716548220,"question_text":"Harry has collected a suspicious executable file from an infected system and seeks to reverse its machine code to instructions written in assembly language.\nWhich tool should he use for this purpose?","choices":{"B":"Ollydbg","A":"HashCalc","C":"BinText","D":"oledump"},"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721575680.0","content":"The correct answer is B.

Emphasis on binary code analysis makes it particularly useful in cases where source is unavailable. Once the suspected malware sample is loaded on OllyDbg, it will show assembler mnemonics, opcodes, and virtual addresses.

Static analysis\n\nExplanation:\nStatic Analysis: This involves examining the file without executing it. The investigator analyzes the file’s code, structure, and metadata to uncover indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as suspicious code patterns, embedded malicious payloads, and other characteristics that might indicate malicious intent.\n\nDynamic Analysis: This involves executing the file in a controlled environment to observe its behavior. This approach can potentially execute malicious code, so it's not suitable if the goal is to avoid code execution.\n\nThreat Hunting: This is a proactive approach to searching for signs of malicious activities within the network or systems. It's broader and may involve dynamic analysis among other techniques.\n\nThreat Analysis: This generally refers to assessing the threat landscape, understanding threats, and their potential impacts, which is not specific to examining a file for malicious content.","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"S7qqnQxxpLgAjIUEdWMR","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-02-26 06:38:00","question_id":430,"exam_id":176,"unix_timestamp":1708925880,"answer_description":"","answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1410567","content":"Selected Answer: D\nECCouncil Official CHFI\nhttps://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/reader/books/9781635676969/\nModule 01 Page 42\n\nAND\n\nhttps://www.rulesofevidence.org/fre/\n\nRule 1002: Requirement of the Original\n“An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.”\n\n-----\nIf you agree: UPVOTE this post to add your vote to the community tally.\nIf you disagree: discuss with citations\nBoth actions crowdsource best answers.","poster":"044f354","timestamp":"1743022920.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Rule 1002: This rule states that to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original is required, except as otherwise provided in the rules.
