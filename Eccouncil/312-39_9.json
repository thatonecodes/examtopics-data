Bad Bot User-Agents are typically used by malicious bots to mimic legitimate user agents and evade detection by web application firewalls and other security measures.\n\nBy analyzing web server logs, security analysts can identify patterns of traffic associated with known Bad Bot User-Agents and take steps to block or mitigate this traffic, such as implementing rate limiting or IP blocking. Some web application firewalls (WAFs) also use machine learning algorithms to analyze web server logs and detect suspicious traffic patterns associated with Bad Bot User-Agents."}],"question_id":41,"topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1683725460},{"id":"nQ2uqSWm3ZNTZRJLanlH","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-12-05 04:18:00","topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":174,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"B","answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/90031-exam-312-39-topic-1-question-46-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":42,"choices":{"B":"Incident Response Mission","A":"Incident Response Intelligence","C":"Incident Response Vision","D":"Incident Response Resources"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"968354","timestamp":"1722445800.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCSA Courseware page 674\nB is correc","poster":"bivixa2510"},{"timestamp":"1718970120.0","comment_id":"929428","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","poster":"ayisuska","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nIncident Response Mission","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Muslihmdzin","timestamp":"1713336180.0","comment_id":"872413"},{"content":"Correct answer is B - Incident Response Mission.\n\nCSA Courseware Volume 2 - Glossary - page 891","timestamp":"1708539120.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"SchFiftySchFive","comment_id":"816974"},{"comment_id":"773120","poster":"vjvirus","timestamp":"1705033020.0","content":"Incident Response Mission","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Bocktw","comment_id":"753811","timestamp":"1703300100.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnsswer is B.","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"Thiha","content":"Ansswer is B.\nIR mission statements define the purpose and scope of the planned incident response capabilities.","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"735630","timestamp":"1701746280.0"}],"question_text":"Daniel is a member of an IRT, which was started recently in a company named Mesh Tech.
