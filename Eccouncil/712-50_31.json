In Information Security, the definition of Risk is: Risk = Threat x Probability.\nRisk refers to the potential for harm or loss resulting from a threat exploiting a vulnerability. A threat is any potential danger that could harm or compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organization's information assets. Probability refers to the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, while vulnerability is a weakness or gap in an organization's security defenses that could be exploited by a threat.\n\nBy multiplying the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability (i.e., probability) by the potential impact of a successful attack (i.e., threat), organizations can determine the level of risk associated with a particular information asset or system. This formula allows organizations to quantify and prioritize risks and determine appropriate risk treatment strategies.","timestamp":"1679185260.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"843296"},{"content":"A is correct","poster":"boyladdudeman","timestamp":"1616865900.0","comment_id":"321998","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1616865900,"question_id":154,"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/48310-exam-712-50-topic-1-question-53-discussion/","topic":"1","exam_id":183},{"id":"HbXmQzs6dUNMEGf4tOCS","exam_id":183,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer":"B","timestamp":"2023-06-29 05:22:00","choices":{"D":"Permit a 90-day window to see if an issue occurs and then amend the standard if there are no issues.","C":"Amend the standard to permit the deployment.","A":"Enforce the existing security standards and do not allow the deployment of the new technology.","B":"If the risks associated with that technology are not already identified, perform a risk analysis to quantify the risk, and allow the business unit to proceed based on the identified risk level."},"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1688008920,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/113606-exam-712-50-topic-1-question-54-discussion/","question_id":155,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","discussion":[{"content":"As written A is the best answer.
