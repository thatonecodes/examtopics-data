A compliance test of program library controls.\n\nThis type of test is conducted by an IS auditor to verify that the controls over the program library are effective. Specifically, by comparing the source and object versions of a sample of programs, the auditor can determine if the programs have been properly maintained and updated in the library. This helps ensure that the programs in use are the authorized and most current versions, which is a crucial aspect of maintaining the integrity and reliability of information systems. Compliance tests are focused on the effectiveness of the controls in place, rather than on the accuracy of the data, which is the focus of substantive tests."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"935508","poster":"arifbhatkar","content":"Correct answer A. A substantive test of program library controls\nwhen an IS auditor selects a sample of programs to determine if the source and object versions are the same, they would perform a substantive test of program library controls. This involves examining the controls and processes related to the program library, such as version control, change management, and documentation practices. The purpose of this test is to verify that the programs stored in the library are the correct and authorized versions, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the software used within the organization.","timestamp":"1703696340.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1687877940,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-06-27 16:59:00","answer":"C","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/113419-exam-712-50-topic-1-question-94-discussion/"},{"id":"p8wtmHcYJ2Mh2aMX2REg","question_id":182,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-06-27 17:01:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (67%)","A (33%)"],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1723395660.0","poster":"adv87","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\n\"Best practice\" is not a requirement, it's a guideline.
