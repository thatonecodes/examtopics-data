By signing the email with the sender's private key, it ensures that the sender cannot later deny sending the message, providing a form of non-repudiation.

Both of these methods can effectively circumvent input validation that merely blocks known patterns or direct data leakage.\n\nOption A is subtle and can be very slow, but it's quite effective in environments where the application gives any sort of feedback based on the query's success or failure. Option D is sophisticated and can bypass more stringent controls by causing the database server to send data to an attacker-controlled location, potentially without triggering alerts that are based on typical input patterns. Both options should be actively guarded against by implementing advanced SQL injection prevention techniques, such as using parameterized queries, employing least privilege on database permissions, and comprehensive monitoring and logging of database queries.","comment_id":"1204000"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nIn the given scenario, the hacker specializes in SQL Injection attacks and is known for using advanced techniques.
