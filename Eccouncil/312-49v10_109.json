Chi-square attack, where the analyst performs probability analysis to test whether the stego object and original data are identical**\n\nThe Chi-square attack is a statistical method that does not rely on prior knowledge of the specific steganography algorithm used. Instead, it analyzes the distribution of pixel values or other properties in the image to detect anomalies that may indicate the presence of hidden data. This approach is effective because it can be applied to a wide range of steganographic techniques without needing specific knowledge about the algorithm the attacker used.","timestamp":"1720260360.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1720260300.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAn organization is concerned about potential attacks using steganography to hide malicious data within image files.
