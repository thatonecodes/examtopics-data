This is one of them. I am assuming they want you to select C because WPA3 it talked about helping prevent evil twins. But in reality it can't protect against an evil twin, it can make your connection more secure if you are connected to a WPA3 connection but it can't negate or stop you from connecting to an evil twin which is why the real answer here should be D, but on the test I would probably answer C because if you do any research about WPA3 and its benefits compared to previous versions preventing evil twins in mentioned but it really doesn't do anything against an evil twin.
