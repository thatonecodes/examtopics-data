Overwrite the contents of the hard disk with junk data.\n\nTo permanently erase data on a hard disk, it is crucial to overwrite the existing data with junk data (random or meaningless information) multiple times. This ensures that the original data cannot be recovered, even with advanced forensic tools. This process is often referred to as data wiping or secure erasure.\n\nWhile methods like using magnets or destroying the disk physically (e.g., throwing it into a fire) may render the disk unusable, they don't guarantee that data is completely irretrievable, especially by sophisticated recovery techniques.
