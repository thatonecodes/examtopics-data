This approach enables rapid response to new malware threats and reduces the computational overhead on local machines. By leveraging the power of cloud infrastructure, antivirus providers can analyze large volumes of data and deploy updates to their users more efficiently.","comment_id":"854727","poster":"qovert"},{"comment_id":"821843","content":"Selected Answer: D\nit's D","timestamp":"1708896420.0","poster":"Flav_man","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1699981680.0","poster":"josevirtual","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCloud-based, it is done in cloud, not on-premise","comment_id":"718121"},{"timestamp":"1691334780.0","content":"D.

Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to determine what layer 4 protocols a given IP forwarding device will pass. Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will see no response.","poster":"czarul79"},{"timestamp":"1716898200.0","upvote_count":"7","comment_id":"608383","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCEH V11 Module 12 Page 1551 \" Firewalking is a method of collecting information about remote networks behind firewalls. It is a technique that uses TTL values to determine gateway ACL filters and map networks by analyzing the IP packet response. It probes ACLs on packet filtering routers/firewalls using the same method as tracerouting. Firewalking involves sending TCP or UDP packets into the firewall where the TTL value is one hop greater than the targeted firewall. If the packet makes it through the gateway, the system forwards it to the next hop, where the TTL equals one, and prompts an ICMP error message at the point of rejection with a \"TTL exceeded in transi\" message.
