The Wi-Fi password is too complex and long.\n\nHere's why this option is the most plausible:\n\nWPA2 Personal with AES encryption is currently considered secure for home and personal use, provided a strong, complex, and long password is used. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely regarded as unbreakable with current computing technology when implemented correctly. The security of a WPA2 network largely depends on the password's strength. A complex and long password (typically 12 characters or more, including numbers, symbols, and upper and lower case letters) significantly increases the time and computational power required to crack it through brute-force attacks.","comment_id":"1162770","timestamp":"1709221500.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1148687","content":"Selected Answer: B\nC.

The hacking tool is outdated\nThe question suggests that you're using a well known hack which involves capturing network traffic to get into the wifi network, this is how the IV attack worked on WEP, by picking up enough packets from the air to be able to figure out which key is in use. That doesn't work with WPA2 though, WPA2 is vulnerable to KRACK which attacks the network by abusing the 3 way handshake authentication method.\n\nBesides look at the suggested answer, nothing is uncrackable, especially not WiFi, even something like AES256 bit is breakable... it would just take a billion years to do it.

DLL Hijacking\nCEHv12 Book Module 6 p.711\n\nMost Windows applications do not use the fully qualified path when loading an external DLL library; instead, they first search the directory from which they have been loaded. Taking this as an advantage, if attackers can place a malicious DLL in the application directory, the application will execute the malicious DLL in place of the real DLL. For example, if an application program “.exe” needs library.dll (usually in the Windows system directory) to install the application, and fails to specify the library.dll path, Windows will search for the DLL in the directory from which the application was launched. If an attacker has already placed the DLL in the same directory as program.exe, then that malicious DLL will load instead of the real DLL, which allows the attacker to gain remote access to the target system.","comment_id":"1161422","poster":"ethacker2","timestamp":"1724828040.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
