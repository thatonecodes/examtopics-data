If multiple access points are set up on the same channel, they will compete for the same bandwidth, which can result in slower network performance. Additionally, having multiple access points on the same channel can cause interference and reduce the overall coverage area of the wireless network. By setting each access point on a different channel, it is possible to maximize network performance and ensure reliable wireless coverage.","timestamp":"1694429160.0"},{"timestamp":"1731715200.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD < https://inet.omnetpp.org/docs/showcases/wireless/crosstalk/doc/index.html","poster":"Elb","comment_id":"1212142","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"Elb","comment_id":"1208804","upvote_count":"2","content":"D < A phenomenon by which a signal transmitted on one circuit or channel creates an undesired effect on another circuit.\nThe goal of using different non-overlapping channels is to avoid the affects caused by channel utilization and interference.","timestamp":"1731155160.0"},{"comments":[{"content":"Dude. Your unresearched confidence is astonishing.\n\nYour answer actually correctly states \"radiate\" to describe what crosstalk is.\nWhen physical networking cables (copper based) experience crosstalk, it's because the physical wires are acting like an antenna, RADIATING the signal being carried, which allows other nearby wires to pick up that signal. Hence the definition of crosstalk.\nShielding and twisting wires is how crosstalk is managed in physical networks.\n\nYou know what else radiates? WIFI antennae. On purpose. By design.\nSeparate channels is how crosstalk is managed in WIFI.","comment_id":"1387725","upvote_count":"1","poster":"044f354","timestamp":"1741752360.0"}],"upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is the correct answer.\n\nCross-talk is a term used in physical networking, it occurs when a signal transmitted on one copper pair radiates and interferes with transmission on another pair.\n\nIn general it is best-practice to put multiple WAPs on different channels to avoid congestion/over-saturation.","timestamp":"1683723600.0","poster":"BarryMacockener","comment_id":"715324"}],"timestamp":"2022-11-10 16:00:00","answers_community":["D (70%)","B (30%)"],"question_text":"When setting up a wireless network with multiple access points, why is it important to set each access point on a different channel?","answer_ET":"D","answer":"D","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Multiple access points can be set up on the same channel without any issues","D":"Avoid cross talk","C":"So that the access points will work on different frequencies","B":"Avoid over-saturation of wireless signals"},"answer_description":"","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/87254-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-174-discussion/","question_id":51},{"id":"Ru9YjVGanuADG5fb8yhH","answer":"D","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1208810","content":"D > https://www.keysight.com/blogs/en/tech/nwvs/2020/05/20/fail-closed-fail-open-fail-safe-and-failover-abcs-of-network-visibility","timestamp":"1731157320.0","poster":"Elb","upvote_count":"1"}],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1715252520,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/140216-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-175-discussion/","choices":{"D":"The firewall failed-open","A":"The firewall failed-bypass","B":"The firewall failed-closed","C":"The firewall ACL has been purged"},"answer_ET":"D","question_text":"You are running through a series of tests on your network to check for any security vulnerabilities.\nAfter normal working hours, you initiate a DoS attack against your external firewall.
