If you want to see attacks coming from the internet into your DMZ, then put it there, but that will miss attackers coming in through a client inside the network (think BEC). In all practicality, they should be placed EVERYWHERE on your network. However, I completely disagree that \"it doesn't matter.\" It certainly DOES MATTER where you place it.","comment_id":"1347578","timestamp":"1738012500.0"},{"timestamp":"1725306300.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIf the honeypot is in front of firewall then logical thinking it's safe but too obvious.

If it says its a DC or something and inside were files like \"important\" or \"top-secret\" its pretty easy to deduce that this isnt worth my time infiltrating most likely and any interaction I have on pulling files would be flagged and I would immediately be identified. My best bet would be to continue enumerating and seeking out POCs for lateral movement.
