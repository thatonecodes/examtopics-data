TPM\n\nA Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware component that provides a secure environment for cryptographic operations, including:\n\n- Generating encryption keys\n- Storing sensitive data, such as encryption keys and certificates\n- Performing cryptographic operations, such as encryption and decryption\n\nOne of the key features of a TPM is its ability to generate and store encryption keys in a secure manner. The TPM generates a unique key, known as the Storage Root Key (SRK), which is used to encrypt and decrypt data.\n\nThe TPM only releases a portion of the encryption key, known as the \"wrapped\" key, which is encrypted with the SRK. This ensures that even if an attacker gains physical access to the computer, they will not be able to access the encrypted data without the SRK.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1740806460,"timestamp":"2025-03-01 06:21:00","question_id":115,"choices":{"A":"CPU","B":"UEFI","D":"TPM","C":"GPU"},"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/157299-exam-312-50v13-topic-1-question-26-discussion/","question_text":"What piece of hardware on a computer’s motherboard generates encryption keys and only releases a part of the key so that decrypting a disk on a new piece of hardware is not possible?","isMC":true,"answer":"D","exam_id":181}],"exam":{"id":181,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"312-50v13","provider":"Eccouncil","isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":192,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":23},"__N_SSP":true}
