Daryl takes pictures and tags all computer and peripheral equipment found in the house. Daryl packs all the items found in his van and takes them back to his lab for further examination. At his lab, Michael his assistant helps him with the investigation. Since Michael is still in training, Daryl supervises all of his work very carefully.

Incorrect: MD5 hash verification checks data integrity, not password cracking speed.","timestamp":"1733886000.0"},{"content":"The correct answer is B. Distribute processing over 16 or fewer computers.\nDecryption Collection is a tool used for password cracking and decryption. One of its features allows investigators to distribute the processing workload across multiple computers (up to 16) to speed up the password cracking process. This is known as distributed processing or parallel processing.\nBy distributing the workload across multiple machines, the tool can take advantage of the combined processing power to crack passwords more quickly and efficiently. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex passwords or large datasets.","comment_id":"1249446","poster":"aqeel1506","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721198880.0"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"exam_id":176,"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Support for MD5 hash verification","B":"Distribute processing over 16 or fewer computers","C":"Support for Encrypted File System","A":"Cracks every password in 10 minutes"},"topic":"1","question_text":"What feature of Decryption Collection allows an investigator to crack a password as quickly as possible?","answer_images":[]},{"id":"BHHeLwajPy7wSAXCGbEh","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/140736-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-224-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1715814780,"timestamp":"2024-05-16 01:13:00","topic":"1","question_id":94,"answer":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
