It forwards data between networks without verification and blocks incoming packets from the host but allows the traffic to pass through itself. Information passed to remote computers through a circuit-level gateway will appear to have originated from the gateway, as the incoming traffic carries the IP address of the proxy (circuit-level gateway).
