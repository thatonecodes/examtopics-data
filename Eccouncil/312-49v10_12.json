In this honeypot, he has placed a server running Windows Active Directory. He has also placed a Web server in the DMZ that services a number of web pages that offer visitors a chance to download sensitive information by clicking on a button. A week later, Jason finds in his network logs how an intruder accessed the honeypot and downloaded sensitive information. Jason uses the logs to try and prosecute the intruder for stealing sensitive corporate information.

The offset in a hexadecimal code is the first byte after the colon.\n\nExplanation:\nIn computer science, hexadecimal code is commonly used to represent binary data in a more readable format. Hexadecimal code uses a base-16 numbering system to represent values, where each digit can represent a value from 0 to 15.\n\nIn the context of analyzing computer memory or network packets, the hexadecimal code is often displayed in a format that includes an offset and a series of bytes. The offset is the starting memory address where the bytes are located, and it is typically displayed at the beginning of each line of code.\n\nFor example, in the following hexadecimal code snippet:\n\n00000000: 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 4A 4B 4C 4D 4E 4F 50 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP\n\nThe offset is \"00000000\", and the first byte after the colon is \"41\". Therefore, the correct answer is D.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1695692220.0"},{"timestamp":"1659848280.0","content":"0x is just a common prefix convention for base 16 representation of numbers","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"542188","poster":"vcloudpmp"}],"topic":"1","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (57%)","B (43%)"],"timestamp":"2022-02-07 07:58:00","answer":"D","question_id":57,"exam_id":176,"answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/71120-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-18-discussion/","isMC":true},{"id":"PKIfQry6bEXTQGigIixQ","question_id":58,"answer":"D","timestamp":"2023-07-24 13:29:00","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/eccouncil/view/116298-exam-312-49v10-topic-1-question-180-discussion/","choices":{"B":"Enumerate MX and A records from DNS","D":"Enumerate domain user accounts and built-in groups","C":"Establish a remote connection to the Domain Controller","A":"Poison the DNS records with false records"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"961530","timestamp":"1721820540.0","content":"D: What is LDP EXE used for?\nPerforms operations such as connect, bind, search, modify, add, delete against any Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)-compatible directory, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)","poster":"Elb","upvote_count":"1"}],"answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1690198140,"question_images":[],"topic":"1","question_text":"You have compromised a lower-level administrator account on an Active Directory network of a small company in Dallas, Texas.
