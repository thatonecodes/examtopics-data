Script-based injection\n Explanation: The technique used by Jack to launch the fileless malware on the target systems is known as script-based injection. Here's why:\n Script-based injection (option C): In this scenario, Jack used fraudulent emails containing malicious links. When a victim employee clicks on the link, they are directed to a fraudulent website that automatically loads Flash and triggers the exploit. The term \"script-based\" refers to the use of scripts or code embedded in a web page or email to initiate an attack. In this case, the script is used to exploit vulnerabilities in Flash and deliver the fileless malware.\n Phishing (option D): Phishing is a broader term that encompasses various deceptive techniques to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information. In this scenario, while there is an element of deception (fraudulent emails), the specific technique used for the malware injection is script-based.","comment_id":"1068624","poster":"YourFriendlyNeighborhoodSpider","timestamp":"1731462600.0"},{"comment_id":"1003309","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPhishing","poster":"Vincent_Lu","timestamp":"1725892260.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1716211440.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPhishing","comment_id":"902594","poster":"ujjwal247"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1715602620.0","comment_id":"896657","poster":"victorfs","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct option is D.\nPhishing"},{"comment_id":"751240","content":"Selected Answer: D\n\"What is the technique?\" In memory exploits is not a technique, I go with \"phishing\"","poster":"josevirtual","timestamp":"1703091180.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1697532540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Daniel8660","comment_id":"697170","content":"Selected Answer: D\nLaunching Fileless Malware through Phishing\nAttackers commonly use social engineering techniques such as phishing to spread fileless malware to the target systems.
