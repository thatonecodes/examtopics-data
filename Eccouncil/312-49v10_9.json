Each hop decreases the TTL by 1.\n\nWhat Firewalk Does:\nFirewalk sets the TTL to 1 (or another small value), so the packet expires at the first gateway (e.g., the Cisco PIX firewall in this case).\n\nWhy Traffic Doesn't Appear in the Sniffer Logs:\nThe sniffer is placed on a deeper subnet within the network.\nFirewalk's packets with TTL set to 1 expire at the first firewall (gateway) and never make it past this point.\nSince the packets don't reach the deeper subnet where the sniffer is located, they aren't logged or detected by the sniffer.","timestamp":"1733718120.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD < ...

By monitoring the responses to these packets, Firewalk can infer the behavior of the target firewall. If a packet with a specific TTL value is allowed to pass through the firewall and reach its intended destination, Firewalk deduces that the corresponding port is open. If the packet is blocked or dropped by the firewall, Firewalk determines that the port is closed.\n\n--> Firewalk sets all packets with a TTL of one","poster":"torabi123"},{"timestamp":"1691252220.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nI think the best answer is A.\nFirewalk is used to test the security of the firewall. If tested ports are closed or ICMP is droped by the firewall (which is a good security option) nothing will go trough the FW whatever the TTL. \nAnother possibility is that the sniffer is placed too far from the target and the TTL is too low. So nothing reach the sniffer. \nBut I prefere the A response.\nAny other suggestion is welcomed","poster":"Malko59","comment_id":"973157"},{"poster":"BarryMacockener","timestamp":"1668004500.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"714660","content":"This is not correct.

So, what is the difference between these two answers?
