Normally Nmap scans the most common 1,000 ports for each scanned protocol. With -F, this is reduced to 100.\n\n-r (Don't randomize ports)\nBy default, Nmap randomizes the scanned port order (except that certain commonly accessible ports are moved near the beginning for efficiency reasons). This randomization is normally desirable, but you can specify -r for sequential (sorted from lowest to highest) port scanning instead.","poster":"TrendMicroDLPSSucks","upvote_count":"6"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"946315","poster":"BlackAdam","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe best Nmap command to quickly enumerate all machines in the same network, given that the compromised server has an IP address of 10.10.0.5, is option A: nmap -T4 -q 10.10.0.0/24.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe \"-T4\" option sets the timing template to aggressive, which speeds up the scanning process.\nThe \"-q\" option makes the scan quiet and reduces the amount of output, making the enumeration faster.\n\"10.10.0.0/24\" specifies the target network range to scan.
