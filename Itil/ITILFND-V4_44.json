An event\n\nIn the context of IT service management, an event is any detectable occurrence that has significance for the management of the IT infrastructure or the delivery of IT service.

The modification can be an addition, subtraction, or a switch in the strategy to improve the results. \n\nService Level Management defines, agrees, and monitors service levels with customers and provides a framework for measuring and reporting on service performance. Service-level management examples include defining services and expected delivery times, monitoring service promises and measuring customer satisfaction.\n\n\nService level management is responsible for ensuring that the level of service delivered by the supplier meets the organization's needs and requirements as set out in the contract.
