Using bundled metrics to relate performance to outcomes.\n\nExplanation: A successful service level agreement (SLA) should include bundled metrics that provide a holistic view of service performance and relate to the desired outcomes of the service. Bundled metrics consider multiple aspects of service delivery and measure performance in terms of the value and results achieved, rather than focusing solely on individual metrics or single-system-based metrics. By using bundled metrics, the SLA can capture the overall performance and effectiveness of the service in meeting the agreed-upon objectives and outcomes. This approach ensures that the SLA reflects the true value and impact of the service from the perspective of the customer or service consumer."},{"poster":"Frameff","content":"Selected Answer: B\nSLA should relate to defined outcomes and not simply operational metrics.","timestamp":"1676813280.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"550930"},{"poster":"bigpete975","upvote_count":"2","content":"B is correct.","timestamp":"1671904620.0","comment_id":"508698"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1659883740.0","content":"SLA should be bundled with operational metrics and outcome (eg CX or BOI)","poster":"aldacumaph","comment_id":"421252"}],"exam_id":280,"answer_description":"","choices":{"B":"Using bundled metrics to relate performance to outcomes","D":"Using an agreement between the service provider and service supplier","A":"Using individual metrics that relate to the service catalogue","C":"Using single-system-based metrics that relate to outputs"}},{"id":"UNdBC9mX6PLytXbF7MZj","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1620893160,"question_text":"Which is considered by the 'partners and suppliers' dimension?","answer_ET":"D","timestamp":"2021-05-13 10:06:00","question_id":354,"answer_description":"","topic":"1","exam_id":280,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1659005760.0","content":"A.

Working with an integrator to manage relationships.\n\nExplanation: The 'partners and suppliers' dimension of service management focuses on establishing and managing relationships with external entities, such as partners and suppliers, to support the delivery of services. This dimension involves collaborating with external organizations to ensure effective integration, coordination, and cooperation in delivering value to customers. Working with an integrator to manage relationships is a key aspect of this dimension, as it involves establishing a strategic partnership or engaging with a third-party entity that can help manage the relationships with various partners and suppliers.
