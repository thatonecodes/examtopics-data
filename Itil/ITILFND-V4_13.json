Service request management.\n\nExplanation: The purpose of the 'service request management' practice is to handle pre-defined, user-initiated demands for services. It provides a standardized and efficient process for users to request access to services, information, or specific actions. The practice ensures that these requests are properly recorded, assessed, authorized, and fulfilled according to established procedures and controls.\n\nIn other words, service request management focuses on managing and fulfilling specific user requests for services, often in a structured and repeatable manner. It allows users to initiate and request various types of services without going through the formal change process, making it easier and quicker to access the services they need.","poster":"Traktark","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"956349"},{"upvote_count":"3","poster":"El_Capitan","timestamp":"1675928760.0","content":"service request management practice\nThe practice of supporting the agreed quality of a service by handling all predefined, user-initiated service requests in an effective and user-friendly manner.","comment_id":"543596"},{"poster":"bigpete975","upvote_count":"3","content":"A is correct.","comment_id":"508766","timestamp":"1671909540.0"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/itil/view/68537-exam-itilfnd-v4-topic-1-question-153-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":280,"unix_timestamp":1640373540,"question_text":"Which practice has a purpose that includes the handling of pre-defined, user-initiated demands for service?","question_id":61,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Deployment management","B":"Service configuration management","A":"Service request management","D":"Change enablement"},"timestamp":"2021-12-24 20:19:00","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"answer":"A"},{"id":"CwjMzXgTBWEcB88NN7Me","isMC":true,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1627099260,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/itil/view/58557-exam-itilfnd-v4-topic-1-question-154-discussion/","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"Progress iteratively with feedback","C":"Think and work holistically","D":"Keep it simple and practical","B":"Collaborate and promote visibility"},"exam_id":280,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D","timestamp":"2021-07-24 06:01:00","answer_images":[],"question_id":62,"question_text":"Which guiding principle considers which parts of an existing process should be kept by identifying how they contribute to value creation?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"412943","content":"D.

Keep it simple and practical.\n\nExplanation: The guiding principle \"Keep it simple and practical\" emphasizes that improvements should be straightforward, effective, and aligned with the value they provide. When applying this principle to an existing process, it involves evaluating which parts of the process contribute to value creation and should be retained, while also identifying areas where simplification or streamlining can be achieved. The goal is to avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on practical solutions that bring the most significant benefits to the organization and its customers.
