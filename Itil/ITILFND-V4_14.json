The flow of the model helps organizations to link improvements to its goals. The continual improvement model in ITIL provides a framework for organizations to systematically identify and implement improvements to their IT services. The flow of the model helps organizations to link improvements to its goals and ensure that they are aligned with the overall vision and objectives of the organization. Organizations are not required to work through the steps of the model in a specific sequence, nor is the model limited to certain parts of the service value system. The model can be used to identify and implement improvements across the entire service value system, and organizations should use the model itself, rather than an additional model or method, to link improvements to customer value.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1707314160.0","poster":"Traktark"},{"comment_id":"790667","poster":"OBANSON","upvote_count":"1","content":"B IS THE CORRECT ANSWER","timestamp":"1706452740.0"},{"content":"B IS CORRECT “ 4.6: The flow seeks to ensure that improvements are linked to the organization’s goals and are properly prioritized, and that improvement actions produce sustainable results”\nA is wrong “ 4.6: The steps of this model do not need to be carried out in a linear fashion, and it may be necessary to re-evaluate and return to a previous step at some point.”","poster":"MD2022abcd","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"785806","timestamp":"1706042040.0"},{"comment_id":"781443","content":"Selected Answer: B\nPage 66: Use of the model ... ensures that improvement efforts can be lionked bac to the organization's vision. -> it's B\nPage 67: An organization can adjust these steps to it's culture and goals. -> not A","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1705687440.0","poster":"Manix"},{"timestamp":"1698259740.0","comment_id":"704107","content":"A is correct","poster":"rulezztim","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"kimochi31","comment_id":"681329","timestamp":"1695863880.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nShould be A.
