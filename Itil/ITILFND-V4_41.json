Customers are an important stakeholder group and their needs and feedback should be considered throughout the planning and implementation process. By involving customers early on, their input can help shape the improvement and increase their buy-in and support. Waiting until after planning has been completed may result in changes that are not aligned with their needs, and may lead to resistance and pushback.
