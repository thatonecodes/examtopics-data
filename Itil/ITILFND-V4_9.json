Use an agreed classification which is based on the business impact of the incident.\n\nThe priority of an incident should be based on the impact it has on the business. This means considering factors such as the number of users affected, the severity of the disruption, and the financial impact.\n\nAn agreed classification system will help to ensure that incidents are prioritized consistently and fairly. This will help to ensure that the most important incidents are resolved first, and that the business is not adversely affected.\n\nThe other options are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because the user's preferred resolution timeframe may not be the most important factor in determining the priority of the incident. Option B is incorrect because the availability of the appropriate support team may not be the most important factor in determining the priority of the incident. Option D is incorrect because the dates and times when incidents were logged are not the most important factor in determining the priority of the incident.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Traktark","comment_id":"956345","timestamp":"1721371860.0"},{"comment_id":"840914","poster":"MarcusWG86","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1710590160.0","content":"5.2.5 Incident management\nIncidents are prioritized based on an agreed classification to ensure that incidents with the highest business impact are resolved first."},{"comment_id":"788486","content":"C is correct","timestamp":"1706254560.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MD2022abcd"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Stanzi","comment_id":"642355","content":"It is C","timestamp":"1691148420.0"},{"poster":"bigpete975","content":"C is correct.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"508741","timestamp":"1671908340.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/itil/view/68529-exam-itilfnd-v4-topic-1-question-139-discussion/","question_id":45,"question_text":"How should an organization prioritize incidents?","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"timestamp":"2021-12-24 19:59:00","answer_description":"","exam_id":280,"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1640372340,"question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Ask the user for their preferred resolution timeframe","B":"Assess the availability of the appropriate support team","D":"Create an order of incidents based on the dates and times when they were logged","C":"Use an agreed classification which is based on the business impact of the incident"}}],"exam":{"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","provider":"Itil","id":280,"isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":356,"name":"ITILFND V4","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true},"currentPage":9},"__N_SSP":true}
