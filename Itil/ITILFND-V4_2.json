In the context of IT service management, an incident refers to any unplanned event or interruption that causes or may cause a disruption to a service. It could be an unexpected system failure, software error, network outage, or any other event that impacts the normal functioning of a service. Incidents are typically reported by users or detected through monitoring systems. The primary objective of incident management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible, minimizing the impact on users and the business. Self-help tools, such as knowledge bases or automated troubleshooting guides, are often utilized to assist users in resolving incidents without the need for direct intervention from support staff."},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"Fund81","timestamp":"1705921800.0","comment_id":"784211","content":"D\nUnder 5.2.5, Some incidents will be resolved by the users themselves, using self-help."},{"timestamp":"1704719160.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nSome incidents will be resolved by the users themselves, using self-help >> https://www.bmc.com/blogs/itil-incident-management/","upvote_count":"1","poster":"_Juliemol13","comment_id":"769428"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"fabulous_success","content":"Option C sounds more of a Problem, while D is the correct answer","comment_id":"654428","timestamp":"1693430460.0"},{"poster":"Crazy_mig","comment_id":"651722","upvote_count":"1","content":"D for sure","timestamp":"1692956040.0"},{"poster":"PHD_CHENG","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD looks correct","comment_id":"645248","timestamp":"1691726520.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1680727800.0","comment_id":"581458","poster":"cellophanedreams","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nRisk = \"A possible event that could cause harm or loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives.\"\nC = \" A possible future event that could cause harm\"\nSo C can't be answer, therefore D is."},{"comment_id":"569740","poster":"smiley2021","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt should be D","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1679059020.0"},{"timestamp":"1678019640.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"NiravPatel","content":"Selected Answer: D\nThis is correct because an interruption or a resolving future interruption must be considered as incident.","comment_id":"561420"},{"timestamp":"1674521580.0","comment_id":"530944","poster":"marjieanne","upvote_count":"1","content":"should be d"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD sound more correct than C.
