Authorization of emergency changes may be deferred until after implementation.\n\nEmergency changes are typically unplanned and implemented to restore service as quickly as possible. In emergency situations, it may not be possible or practical to follow the full change management process. Therefore, the authorization of emergency changes may be deferred until after implementation to minimize the time it takes to restore service. However, it is still important to document emergency changes and complete any necessary documentation as soon as possible after the change has been implemented.
