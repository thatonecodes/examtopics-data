Service request management.\n\nExplanation: Service request management is the practice that focuses on handling user requests for access to services, information, or specific actions. It provides a standardized and efficient process for users to submit their requests and ensures that the appropriate actions are taken to fulfill those requests. In the given scenario, if a user needs access to an application, they can submit a service request through the service request management process. The request will then be evaluated, authorized, and fulfilled according to the established procedures and controls.","timestamp":"1719663180.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"C is the right answer","poster":"dufad","timestamp":"1695740520.0","comment_id":"679875"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct C.","poster":"Mario00000","timestamp":"1694475300.0","comment_id":"666508"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"fabulous_success","content":"The answer is C","comment_id":"653730","timestamp":"1693359000.0"},{"timestamp":"1692956280.0","comment_id":"651726","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Crazy_mig","content":"Gaining access will need service request"},{"poster":"jsingh26","content":"Selected Answer: C\nGaining access to an application, a user submits a ticket first, therefore, the answer should be C","timestamp":"1687616880.0","comment_id":"621713","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"611082","upvote_count":"3","poster":"jj0097","content":"Selected Answer: C\nObviously it's C","timestamp":"1685795940.0"},{"timestamp":"1684677960.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAfter the request is submitted, service request management will eventually submit a standard change request to change enablement (CCB). So providing the access is really up to change enablement. If the CCB evaluates and finally approves, the access is provided to the requester. If the CCB think it's too risky they can disapprove and no access is provided. So, it's really up to the Change enablement practice, not Service request management","comment_id":"604921","upvote_count":"2","comments":[{"content":"I think the question is incorrect, because the question is which service would \"help\" a user get access, and then it is C- Service Request Mgmt.
