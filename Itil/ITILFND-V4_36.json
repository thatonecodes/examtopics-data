If a practice is easier to follow it is more likely to be adopted\n\nThe guiding principle \"keep it simple and practical\" recommends that organizations should strive to make their practices as easy to follow and understand as possible. One of the main recommendations of this principle is that if a practice is easier to follow, it is more likely to be adopted and used effectively. This means that organizations should aim to make their practices clear, straightforward, and easy to understand, rather than complex and difficult to follow. By doing so, they can increase the chances that their practices will be adopted and used effectively by those who need to use them.","poster":"KingSouth","comment_id":"777377"},{"comment_id":"722957","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nCorrect answer is C\n\nChapter 4.3.6.3\nEasier to understand, more likely to adopt: To embed a practice, make sure it is easy to follow.","timestamp":"1716227760.0","poster":"gpfs"},{"poster":"_Juliemol13","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC for me","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"722123","timestamp":"1716130860.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1668877260,"exam_id":280,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"topic":"1"},{"id":"iBRtPMWpF05wAl0zGjrd","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"Service request management","D":"Change enablement","C":"Monitoring and event management","A":"Incident management"},"answer_description":"","question_id":178,"isMC":true,"answer":"C","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1725308820.0","poster":"heerowiind","content":"Selected Answer: C\n5.2.7 monitoring and event management \n\nThe purpose of the monitoring and event management practice is to systematically observe services and service components, and record and report selected changes of state identified as events.
