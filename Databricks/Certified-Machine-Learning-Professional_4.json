All of these statements.\n\nIn a streaming deployment, the system is always on and continuously processing data. Therefore, it’s crucial to handle all types of data without producing an error. Rigorous data tests and checks can help ensure that the system can handle changes in data formats and continue to operate smoothly.\n\nAdditionally, because the system is always on, there may not be a practitioner available to debug poor model performance in real-time. Data tests and checks can help catch potential issues before they impact model performance.\n\nFinally, because the system is always on, it’s important to confirm that the deployment can autoscale to handle varying data volumes. Data tests and checks can help validate the system’s ability to scale.","comment_id":"1100188","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"makes more sense to me","timestamp":"1715153520.0","comment_id":"1208244","poster":"ThoBustos"}],"timestamp":"1702949880.0","poster":"BokNinja","upvote_count":"4"}],"unix_timestamp":1702949880,"exam_id":164},{"id":"tSiWy4dILYrflIt527We","choices":{"E":"Real-time","A":"Streaming","C":"Edge/on-device","B":"Batch","D":"None of these strategies will accomplish the task."},"exam_id":164,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/databricks/view/128958-exam-certified-machine-learning-professional-topic-1/","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1702949700,"timestamp":"2023-12-19 02:35:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1722095220.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: E\nReal-time deployment is designed for low-latency, high-throughput inference, making it suitable for scenarios where predictions need to be computed quickly for individual records.
