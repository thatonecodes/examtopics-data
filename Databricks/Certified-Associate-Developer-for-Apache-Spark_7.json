Stage\n\nIn Spark, a stage represents a sequence of narrow transformations that can be executed without shuffling the entire data across partitions. Narrow transformations are those where each partition of the parent RDD contributes to only one partition of the child RDD. Spark groups as many narrow transformations as possible into a single stage, and these operations are pipelined together to optimize performance. A stage is completed before the next stage begins, and usually, a shuffle operation would define the boundary between stages.","poster":"Sowwy1","timestamp":"1728478080.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/databricks/view/138252-exam-certified-associate-developer-for-apache-spark-topic-1/","answers_community":[],"exam_id":161,"isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Job","D":"Task","E":"Executor","A":"Slot","C":"Stage"},"answer":"C","answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1712666880,"question_text":"Which of the following identifies multiple narrow operations that are executed in sequence?","topic":"1","timestamp":"2024-04-09 14:48:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"Z8vyN88rLmVgZaboplw7","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1702832400.0","upvote_count":"11","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe most likely scenario to experience an out-of-memory error in response to data skew in a single partition is:\n\nC. Scenario #6: 12.5 GB Worker Node, 12.5 GB Executor. 1 Driver & 8 Executors.\n\nExplanation:\n\nData skew refers to an uneven distribution of data across partitions. When there is significant skew in a single partition, it can lead to increased memory usage for that specific partition, potentially causing out-of-memory errors. The smaller the available memory per executor, the higher the likelihood of encountering such issues.\n\nIn this case, Scenario #6 has the smallest worker node and executor configuration, with only 12.5 GB of RAM available for each executor. With 8 executors, the total available memory is still 100 GB (similar to other scenarios), but the reduced memory per executor increases the risk of encountering out-of-memory errors when handling skewed data in a single partition.","poster":"TmData","comment_id":"926066"},{"timestamp":"1725737880.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"azurearch","content":"D is correct. even though you have less executor memory in scenario 6, spark will still complete the process , it might take more time to do the shuffle neverthless.","comment_id":"1168376"},{"poster":"Mohitsain","timestamp":"1703249100.0","comment_id":"930399","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis is the right answer.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"880656","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1698252960.0","content":"Data skew is when you have a few partitions oversized.
