The customers table is implemented as a Type 2 table; old values are maintained but marked as no longer current and new values are inserted.\n\nA Type 1 table does not track changes in dimensional attributes - the new value overwrites the existing value. Here, we do not preserve historical changes in data.\n\nA Type 2 Table tracks change over time by creating new rows for each change. A new dimension record is inserted with a high-end date or one with NULL. The previous record is \"closed\" with an end date. This approach maintains a complete history of changes and allows for as-was reporting use cases.\n\nA data warehousing method called Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 3 is used to track both the old and new values while managing historical changes in data over time. To reflect the historical and present values of an attribute, SCD Type 3 keeps two extra columns in the dimension table."},{"comment_id":"1131071","poster":"spaceexplorer","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1706125380.0"},{"comment_id":"1118794","poster":"kz_data","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","timestamp":"1704902580.0"},{"comment_id":"1051456","upvote_count":"2","poster":"chokthewa","timestamp":"1698037740.0","content":"B is correct."}],"answer_ET":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/certified-data-engineer-professional/image20.png"]},{"id":"HJkfUgXEbtfYL5uSAtCS","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/databricks/view/124922-exam-certified-data-engineer-professional-topic-1-question/","choices":{"D":"Can Read","E":"Can Run","A":"Can Manage","B":"Can Edit","C":"No permissions"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"AlHerd","timestamp":"1743089700.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWe don't want to person to run the code in the notebooks as this might change the data, so \"can read\" is best.","comment_id":"1410951"},{"comment_id":"1342287","content":"Selected Answer: E\nMaximum permission Can Run .https://docs.databricks.com/en/notebooks/notebooks-collaborate.html","timestamp":"1737138240.0","poster":"RasipalayamRDK","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"arekm","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI change my mind - answer D.
