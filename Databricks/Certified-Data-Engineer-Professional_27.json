Single Comparison Filter (e.g., latitude > 66.3): File skipping is highly efficient because Delta can use min/max statistics to directly eliminate files that don't meet the condition.\nRange Filters (e.g., longitude < 20 AND longitude > -20): File skipping is still possible but less efficient, because Delta has to evaluate whether any records in the file might meet the condition, even if the min and max values of the column in the file overlap with the filter range.\nSo in summary, file skipping works best with single comparisons like latitude > 66.3 but is less effective with range filters like longitude < 20 AND longitude > -20."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1325633","content":"Selected Answer: D\nDo not get confused between option c and d.
