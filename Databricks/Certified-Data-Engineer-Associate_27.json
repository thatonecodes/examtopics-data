It is particularly useful for maintaining up-to-date data and ensuring there are no duplicate records in the target table. This is often referred to as an \"upsert\" operation (update + insert). When the target table needs to be kept free of duplicate records, and there's a need to update existing records or insert new ones based on some matching condition, MERGE INTO is the appropriate command. The INSERT INTO command, on the other hand, is used to add new records to a table without regard for whether they duplicate existing records. Options A, B, C, and E do not specifically require the use of MERGE INTO.
