Increase the cluster size of the SQL endpoint: While increasing the cluster size might help if the current cluster size is insufficient, it does not necessarily address the scaling needs dynamically. The SQL endpoint might still be limited by its scaling configuration.\n\nC. Turn on the Auto Stop feature: Auto Stop helps manage costs by automatically stopping the SQL endpoint when it is idle. However, it doesn't address performance issues related to simultaneous query execution and would not improve query latency directly.\n\nD. Turn on the Serverless feature: The Serverless SQL endpoint is designed for ad-hoc querying without requiring dedicated clusters. While it could help in certain scenarios, it may not be directly applicable if the issue is specifically related to high concurrency and resource contention in an always-on environment.\n\nBy increasing the scaling range, the SQL endpoint can handle more concurrent queries and improve overall performance.","comment_id":"1272963","poster":"9d4d68a","timestamp":"1724695740.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"80370eb","timestamp":"1723608660.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nTurning on the Serverless feature allows the SQL endpoint to scale automatically and efficiently handle a large number of small queries, improving performance and reducing latency.","comment_id":"1265495","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_id":36,"choices":{"D":"They can turn on the Serverless feature for the SQL endpoint.","B":"They can increase the maximum bound of the SQL endpoint’s scaling range.","A":"They can increase the cluster size of the SQL endpoint.","C":"They can turn on the Auto Stop feature for the SQL endpoint."},"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (83%)","D (17%)"],"answer_description":"","question_text":"A data analysis team has noticed that their Databricks SQL queries are running too slowly when connected to their always-on SQL endpoint.

They can set the query’s refresh schedule to end on a certain date in the query scheduler.\nThis is the best solution. By setting the refresh schedule to automatically stop on a specific date (e.g., one week after the project release), the engineering team ensures that the query will only refresh during the desired period, preventing unnecessary costs after that date.
