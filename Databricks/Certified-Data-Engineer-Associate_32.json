A data lakehouse supports ACID-compliant transactions.\n\nOne of the key features of a data lakehouse that results in improved data quality over a traditional data lake is its support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. ACID transactions provide data integrity and consistency guarantees, ensuring that operations on the data are reliable and that data is not left in an inconsistent state due to failures or concurrent access.\n\nIn a traditional data lake, such transactional guarantees are often lacking, making it challenging to maintain data quality, especially in scenarios involving multiple data writes, updates, or complex transformations. A data lakehouse, by offering ACID compliance, helps maintain data quality by providing strong consistency and reliability, which is crucial for data pipelines and analytics.","poster":"vctrhugo"},{"comment_id":"1307209","timestamp":"1730784420.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
