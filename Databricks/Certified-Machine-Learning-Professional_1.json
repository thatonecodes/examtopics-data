It says something about sensitivity, but sensitivity wouldn't be an issue if ks test is applied correctly. This question is tricky, how can we argue js is more robust than ks test, surely this is subjective. An answer below says js produces a score below 0 and 1, but ks test can also do so.

It produces a value between 0 and 1, which represents the divergence between two distributions. This value can be interpreted without needing to set arbitrary thresholds or cutoffs.
