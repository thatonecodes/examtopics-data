Silver tables contain less data than Bronze tables.\n\nThis is because Silver tables are typically more refined and processed versions of the raw data found in Bronze tables. Bronze tables often contain raw, unprocessed data, while Silver tables contain cleaned, filtered, or aggregated data. Therefore, Silver tables usually contain a subset or a refined version of the data in the Bronze tables, leading to less overall data in the Silver tables.","poster":"80370eb"},{"timestamp":"1719256620.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nsilver have some data filters","poster":"vigaro","comment_id":"1236565"},{"comment_id":"1226140","timestamp":"1717765800.0","poster":"mgari","content":"in my opinion it is D Silver has only the data with no error","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"I think there is no correct answer","comment_id":"1216000","timestamp":"1716408780.0","poster":"b79962e"},{"timestamp":"1716407940.0","content":"Silver tables contain a more refined and cleaner view of data than Bronze tables.","comment_id":"1215990","poster":"PreranaC","upvote_count":"2"},{"comment_id":"1209100","upvote_count":"1","content":"Correct is A","poster":"helmerpaiva","timestamp":"1715297460.0"}],"timestamp":"2024-05-10 01:31:00","question_id":29,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/databricks/view/140248-exam-certified-data-engineer-associate-topic-1-question-124/","question_text":"Which statement regarding the relationship between Silver tables and Bronze tables is always true?"},{"id":"3reS8fKvK3eG1CD4KqGk","answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","question_id":30,"topic":"1","question_text":"Which query is performing a streaming hop from raw data to a Bronze table?","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1306475","poster":"Pankaj_Shet","timestamp":"1730627880.0","content":"Correct Answer is C. \nA and B are the aggregations \nThere is no transformation in D.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1729243380.0","poster":"RandomForest","comment_id":"1299607","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect answer is D.","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"CommanderBigMac","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nQuestion specified streaming hop.
