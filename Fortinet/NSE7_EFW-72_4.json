It detects only two-way failures.\n\n False. BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) is capable of detecting failures in both directions, not limited to two-way failures.\n\nB. The two routers must be connected to the same subnet.\n\n False. BFD can operate over multi-hop configurations, so the routers do not need to be on the same subnet.\n\nC. It allows failure detection in less than one second.\n\n True. BFD is designed for rapid failure detection, often detecting failures within milliseconds, making sub-second failure detection possible.\n\nD. It is supported for neighbors over multiple hops.\n\n True. BFD supports multi-hop configurations, making it suitable for BGP neighbors that are not directly connected.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1341043","timestamp":"1736949420.0"},{"comment_id":"1201288","timestamp":"1729768680.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC and D are correct","poster":"charruco","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1726069200.0","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nCorrect answers are C & D. BFD tuning for BGP is described on page 204 in the Study Guide. \n - Enable BFD for faste failure detection (in less than 1 second) \n - For BFD multihop path, configure neighbor with; set ebgp-enforce-multihop enable, this is optional and needed IF you need support for multiple hops to reach your peer. \nAs Artbrut mentions further down, it is stated pretty clearly in the link they have provided that peers must be on the same network for BFD to properly function, HOWEVER, this is for the OSPF configuration. The source in the link they provide is this; https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.2.0/new-features/729892/bfd-for-multihop-path-for-bgp\n\nHere it is stated that BFD only supported directly connected neighbors previously, but come 7.2.x it now supports multihop.
