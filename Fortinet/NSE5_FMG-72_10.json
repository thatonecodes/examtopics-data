During discovery, FortiManager sets the FortiManager NATed IP address on FortiGate.\n\nWhen adding a FortiGate device to FortiManager using the discovery process, and FortiManager is operating behind a NAT device, configuring the FortiManager's NATed IP address in the system administration settings of FortiManager is crucial. This setup ensures that the FortiGate device can communicate with the FortiManager through the NAT device. By providing the NATed IP address of FortiManager, you're essentially telling the FortiGate where to send its management traffic so that it can be properly routed through the NAT device to reach the FortiManager.\n\nThe process does not involve setting the NAT device's IP address on the FortiGate; instead, it utilizes the configured NATed IP address of the FortiManager to establish the management connection. This makes option B the expected result of this configuration scenario.","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\n7.4 Study Guide, page 240\nNoe: Same graphic on the slide\n\nYou can configure the FortiManger NATed IP address on FortiGate under the central management configuration. This allows FortiGate to announce itself to FortiManager and try to re-establish the FGFM tunnel, if it is torn down. Configuring the FortiManager NATed IP address on FortiGate allows both FortiManager and FortiGate to re-establish the FGFM tunnel. Also, if you configure the FortiManager NATed IP address under the FortiManager system administrator settings, FortiManager sets this address on FortiGate during the discovery process.","comment_id":"1166143","poster":"DaBadge79","timestamp":"1725493680.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nduring discovery the FMG will deploy the NATed IP on the managed FGT.\nSo, it should be C","poster":"red_sparrow_Gr","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"content":"I am wrong.
