Without route reflectors, every BGP router in the network would need to establish a session with every other BGP router (full mesh), which becomes inefficient in large networks.\n\n The route reflector itself is set up on the BGP router that will act as the central point for routing updates.\n On the client routers, you configure route-reflector-client enable to designate them as clients of the route reflector.\n\nSummary:\nTo reduce the number of IBGP sessions, configure a router as a route reflector, and set route-reflector-client enable on its clients. Let me know if you need further clarification!"},{"poster":"gondohwe","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1275036","content":"why is C correct???","timestamp":"1725016500.0"},{"timestamp":"1718442060.0","comment_id":"1230863","poster":"charruco","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct\nStudy Guide 7.2 Page 203"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1716978360.0","poster":"dsticht","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

It can be configured as an update server, a rating server, or both\n\n True. When FortiManager is deployed as a local FortiGuard Distribution Server (FDS), it can act as:\n An update server for distributing antivirus signatures, IPS definitions, and other updates.\n A rating server for handling web filtering rating requests.\n Both roles can be configured depending on requirements.\n\nB. It provides VM license validation services\n\n True. FortiManager can validate Fortinet VM licenses when acting as a local FDS, ensuring proper functioning of licensed Fortinet devices.\n\nC. It supports rating requests from non-FortiGate devices\n\n False. FortiManager as a local FDS only supports rating requests from managed Fortinet devices (e.g., FortiGate, FortiClient, etc.).\n\nD. It caches available firmware updates for unmanaged devices\n\n False. Firmware updates are cached only for devices that are managed by the FortiManager. Unmanaged devices cannot retrieve updates from it."},{"comment_id":"1327804","upvote_count":"1","poster":"tuky88","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA and D are correct.
