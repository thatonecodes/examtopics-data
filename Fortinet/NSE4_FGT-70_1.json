The event viewer logs contain information about user logins, logouts, and other authentication events.\n\nThe FSSO collector agent is not required in agentless polling mode, as FortiGate directly reads the event viewer logs from the DCs. This reduces the configuration complexity and overhead associated with deploying a collector agent on the network.\n\nFortiGate uses the collected authentication information to apply security policies and provide user-based reporting.
