Is correct because an administrator can also lock the \"local-fortigate\" policy package because you have enabled the \"per policy option\".\nB.

The only way to push configurations to devices is through scripts. This includes, among other things, creating or modifying firewall rules (policies) directly in the CLI of the managed FortiGate.\nHow is this actually done with a script?\nA script in FortiManager can contain CLI commands that will execute on the FortiGate, for example:\nconfig firewall policy\n edit 100\n set name \"Mi-Policy-desde-Script\"\n set srcintf \"port1\"\n set dstintf \"port2\"\n set srcaddr \"all\"\n set dstaddr \"all\"\n set action accept\n set schedule \"always\"\n set service \"ALL\"\n next\nend\nWhen running this script from FortiManager (even with the ADOM in backup mode) against the FortiGate, the policy is effectively created on the device. It is not the usual \"graphical\" procedure (you won't see it in the ADOM's \"offline\" policy database), but in practice you are installing (or modifying) a policy on the FortiGate."},{"timestamp":"1738144200.0","poster":"pfeast420","content":"Selected Answer: B\n\"To make configuration changes from FortiManager to managed devices while in backup mode, you must use the script feature.\" - page 43 of FMG study guide","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1348457"},{"upvote_count":"4","poster":"LAFNELL","content":"Selected Answer: B\nA is false, as no conf changes possible using policy package panel when in backup mode\nC is false, as there is no relationship between offline mode and this case\nD is false as no relationship here too","timestamp":"1731202320.0","comment_id":"1309264"},{"comment_id":"1308696","timestamp":"1731059700.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer B is correct","poster":"Nightwolf33"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1307144","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCorrect answer is B","timestamp":"1730762460.0","poster":"eamstar"},{"comment_id":"1306162","timestamp":"1730549760.0","poster":"Ygrec","comments":[{"timestamp":"1730549760.0","poster":"Ygrec","upvote_count":"1","content":"It's not possible to make change I mean","comment_id":"1306163"}],"content":"In my opinion.
