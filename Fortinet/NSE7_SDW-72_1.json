The only mention of it was in the context of soft clear. Soft reconfiguration is a method in which fortigate stores BGP routing information using hardware resources.\nB: Is correct because by default IBGP does not pass on learned routes between spokes, it can however when you enable the route reflector command. When this is enabled on the neighbor group it will forward routes of its peers to other spokes from the hub. \nC: is correct, this is because this setting enables the ability to identify 2 additional paths and select them.\nD: is correct, this is because the neighbor groups need to be assigned how many paths they can send on that neighbor.\nE: is incorrect, this is because the advertisement interval is used in regards to route failover.
