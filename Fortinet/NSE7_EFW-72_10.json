F-SBID ( --name “eicar”; --protocol tcp; --service HTTP; --flow from_client; --pattern “www.eicar.org”; --no_case; --context host;)\nProtocol: TCP\n\n Since the website (www.eicar.org) uses the HTTP protocol, the custom IPS signature should specify --protocol tcp.\n\nService: HTTP\n\n The --service HTTP setting ensures that the signature applies to HTTP traffic.\n\nFlow: from_client\n\n The traffic flow should be from_client because the client (user device) initiates the request to the website.\n\nPattern: “www.eicar.org”\n\n The pattern must match the website name, which is \"www.eicar.org\". The --no_case parameter ensures that the match is case-insensitive.\n\nContext: host\n\n The --context host setting specifies that the signature should inspect the Host field in the HTTP request header, which contains the domain name.","poster":"myrmidon3","comment_id":"1341081","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1230950","poster":"charruco","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct","timestamp":"1718456220.0"},{"poster":"Disposable_Me_2018","comment_id":"1221805","timestamp":"1717099440.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's not UDP (A or B).\nIt's not DNS over TCP (C).\nMust be \"D\".","upvote_count":"2"},{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1716992100.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIt's not UDP and it's not \"from_server\", so D.","comment_id":"1221023","poster":"dsticht"}],"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-05-29 16:15:00","unix_timestamp":1716992100,"answer_ET":"D","exam_id":425,"question_images":[],"answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/141533-exam-nse7_efw-72-topic-1-question-50-discussion/","question_id":46,"answer_description":""},{"id":"KCVeI0PnvlayJrOTL1qO","exam_id":425,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1341126","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nroute-overlap settings and their behavior:\n\n use-new (default): Disconnects the existing VPN and accepts the new one.\n use-old: Keeps the existing VPN and rejects the new connection.\n allow: Keeps both VPNs and allows traffic balancing between them using ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path).\n\nAnswer in context: If the goal is to ensure that only one remote site is connected at a time, the most appropriate configuration would be to use use-new or use-old.","poster":"myrmidon3","timestamp":"1736959140.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct\nStudy Guide 7.2 Page 315","timestamp":"1718456340.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1230952","poster":"charruco"},{"timestamp":"1717158360.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nagree study guide 315","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1222143","poster":"GCISystemIntegrator"},{"timestamp":"1716992280.0","comment_id":"1221027","poster":"dsticht","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: D\np315 of Study Guide"}],"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit, which shows a network diagram.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich IPSec phase 2 configuration should you implement so that only one remote site is connected at any time?","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-05-29 16:18:00","topic":"1","answer_ET":"D","unix_timestamp":1716992280,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/141535-exam-nse7_efw-72-topic-1-question-51-discussion/","answer_description":"","question_id":47,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/nse7-efw-7-2/image32.png"],"answer":"D","choices":{"B":"Set route-overlap to allow.","D":"Set route-overlap to either use-new or use-old.","A":"Set net-device to enable.","C":"Set single-source to enable."}},{"id":"dZQztx2uhUARl3otNXM4","question_id":48,"answer_ET":"A","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","question_text":"Which ADVPN configuration must be configured using a script on FortiManager, when using VPN Manager to manage FortiGate VPN tunnels?","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1736807400.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nEnabling ADVPN in the IPsec phase 1 settings is a mandatory step when configuring ADVPN, but it must be done using a script when using FortiManager's VPN Manager.

It typically requires only four messages to establish a secure tunnel in its main exchange:\nIKE_SA_INIT: The first exchange initializes the IKE Security Association (SA) and performs a Diffie-Hellman exchange to generate shared secret keys.\nIKE_AUTH: The second exchange authenticates the parties and establishes the IPsec SA.\n\nIKEv2 supports EAP, which provides a flexible framework for various authentication methods. EAP can be used for user authentication, allowing integration with systems such as RADIUS or other authentication servers, providing a high degree of flexibility in choosing authentication mechanisms.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"K4KarOt0","comment_id":"1220545","timestamp":"1716931980.0"}],"question_text":"Which two statements about IKE version 2 are true?
