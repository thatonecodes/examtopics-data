FortiManager will not allow the administrator to delete a referenced address object until they lock the ADOM.\n\nIn workspace mode, you must first lock the ADOM before making any configuration changes (including deleting objects). If the ADOM is not locked, FortiManager will prevent you from modifying or deleting anything.\nD. FortiManager will replace the deleted address object with the “none” address object in the referenced firewall policy.\n\nIf you force the deletion of an address object that is still referenced, FortiManager replaces it with the “none” address object in any policies that used it. This can cause the policy to behave unexpectedly (effectively matching nothing for that field), but it is how FortiManager handles forced deletions of in-use objects.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"darco","timestamp":"1741857960.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1731252360.0","comment_id":"1309517","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC & D is correct","poster":"e7f2ce0"},{"poster":"LAFNELL","timestamp":"1731180780.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1309185","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nA & B are false cause there is no disable status on FMG during configuration"},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nAnswer is C & D","poster":"eamstar","comment_id":"1307131","timestamp":"1730760900.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_id":12,"unix_timestamp":1730760900},{"id":"4JffDtNjWuMc0XVSLG8B","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":415,"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-11-06 17:47:00","question_id":13,"answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1730911620,"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe fgdlinkd process on FortiManager downloads email-filter and web-filter databases from FortiGuard servers.
