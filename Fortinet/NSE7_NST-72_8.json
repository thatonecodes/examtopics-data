The \"Status\" for \"License\" is \"Contract\" and it is \"Enable\". This indicates that FortiGate has successfully validated its contract with a FortiGuard server. \n- Option C suggests that FortiGate used 64.26.151.37 as the initial server to validate its contract. While the output doesn't explicitly state this, the server 64.26.151.37 has a very low weight (10), which typically indicates a highly preferred server. It is logical to conclude that FortiGate would attempt to contact the most preferred servers first for critical operations like contract validation. Although we cannot be absolutely certain it was the initial server, it is a reasonable conclusion based on the information provided. \n- Option A cannot be concluded as the output doesn't show the order of servers from a DNS query. \n- Option B is incorrect as there appears to be an inverse correlation. \n- Option D is incorrect as servers with negative TZ values have varying weights."}],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","unix_timestamp":1742295960,"choices":{"C":"FortiGate used 64.26.151.37 as the initial server to validate its contract.","D":"Servers with a negative TZ value are less preferred for rating requests.","B":"There is a natural correlation between the value in the FortiGuard-requests field and the value in the Weight field.","A":"The first server provided to FortiGate when it performed a DNS query looking for a list of rating servers, was 121.111.236.179."},"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit, which shows the output of a diagnose command.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhat can you conclude about the debug output in this scenario?","topic":"1","question_id":36,"exam_id":427},{"id":"VmmrK8xL4Z7xx9Z7KmgC","answer":"A","timestamp":"2025-03-18 12:01:00","question_id":37,"unix_timestamp":1742295660,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nFrom the reference to the “internet service(1): Fortinet-FortiGuard(…)” object in the output, it is clear that this policy route entry is using an Internet Service Database (ISDB) object rather than a conventional address object.\n\nCorrect answer is A.","poster":"Ic3Box","timestamp":"1742295660.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1400088"}],"choices":{"B":"A regular policy route","A":"An ISDB route","C":"A regular policy route, which is associated with an active static route in the FIB","D":"An SD-WAN rule"},"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/nse7-nst-7-2/image35.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/169317-exam-nse7_nst-72-topic-1-question-43-discussion/","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit, which shows the output of a policy route table entry.\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nWhich type of policy route does the output show?","topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","isMC":true,"exam_id":427,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"bP8Lq81whkuyahNOoEuM","answer":"A","exam_id":427,"question_id":38,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/169316-exam-nse7_nst-72-topic-1-question-44-discussion/","answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2025-03-18 11:57:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1742295420.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1400085","content":"Selected Answer: A\nCorrect answer is A.\n\nThe configuration shows that webfilter-force-off is enabled.
