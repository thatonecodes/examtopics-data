The HA connections for the cluster are terminated on the local switches in the data centers. Once the FortiGate devices have booted, they do not form a cluster.

For example, Cisco N5K/Nexus switches use Ethertype 0x8890 for some functions. When one of these switches receives Ethertype 0x8890 heartbeat packets from an attached cluster unit, the switch generates CRC errors and the packets are not forwarded. As a result, FortiGates connected with these switches cannot form a cluster.\n\nIn some cases, if the heartbeat interfaces are connected and configured so regular traffic flows but heartbeat traffic is not forwarded, you can change the configuration of the switch that connects the HA heartbeat interfaces to allow level2 frames with Ethertypes 0x8890, 0x8891, and 0x8893 to pass.\n\nYou can also use the following CLI commands to change the Ethertypes of the HA heartbeat packets:\n\nconfig system ha\n\nset ha-eth-type <ha_ethertype_4-digit_hex>\n\nset hc-eth-type <hc_ethertype_4-digit_hex>\n\nset l2ep-eth-type <l2ep_ethertype_4-digit_hex>\n\nend"}],"question_id":41,"answer":"D","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1630489260,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/61262-exam-nse8_811-topic-1-question-5-discussion/"},{"id":"xKVdF8uzQh6a3gDj9JOS","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1686731880.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"yadavarya97","comment_id":"922894","content":"attempted the exam today .. and this is not valid anymore , not even a single question from this."},{"comment_id":"700347","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1666304340.0","poster":"aioross","content":"Correct: B"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nA is wrong because ELB need to be applied to FortiWeb not to internal servers only.
