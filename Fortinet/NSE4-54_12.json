This means the traffic enters the FortiGate through the correct interface.\nThe source address (192.168.32.15) is irrelevant for RPF checks in this case. Since the destination is directly connected, the FortiGate doesn't need to perform any routing lookup to determine the outgoing interface.\nTherefore, both strict and loose RPF checks will allow the traffic to pass through the FortiGate.\n\nKey Points:\nRPF checks are primarily designed to prevent spoofed traffic.\nWhen the destination is directly connected, RPF checks are less stringent.\nUnderstanding the network topology and traffic flow is crucial for proper RPF configuration.","timestamp":"1736077260.0","comment_id":"1336736","poster":"herlock_sholmes_2810"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"hiberus","content":"correct answer is B & C\nReference: Fortinet Training Institute.
