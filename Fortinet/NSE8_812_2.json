This relates to answers A and C - so if FTKs were configured on the FGT itself, then A and C would have to be fixed, and then question would ask for 2 answers, not one. \n\nBut here FTKs are created/registered on the FORTIAUTHENTICATOR and such set up works everywhere, even when the perimeter firewall before FAC is NOT Fortigate, but Checkpoint/Juniper/Cisco ASA. So A & C are excluded as not impacting tokens located on the FAC. \n\nSo the D is correct, because this configure IP should always be PUBLIC one that clients on the Internet can reach from their homes/hotels/etc. This is the IP FAC sends to the Forticlient telling him \"Connect to this IP and port\".
