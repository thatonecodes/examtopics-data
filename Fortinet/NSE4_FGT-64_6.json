Port 4 has the lowest cost 1 but don´t meet the SLA requirement. The next by lowest cost are Port 2 and 3 cost 5 and the last is Port 1 with the highest cost 15. So if port 4 don´t meet the SLA requirements, Port 2 and 3 both have cost 5, but in interface preference the next in order below Port 4 is Port3.
