While configuring the devices, the administrator issues the following commands on both HA cluster members:\n\nconfig system ha\nset link-failed-signal enable\n\nIn which two ways do these commands impact the HA cluster? (Choose two.)","discussion":[{"poster":"modaba","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nAD is correct\nIn most networks, thatâ€™s enough for the switches to update their MAC forwarding tables with the new information.\nHowever, some high-end switches might not clear their MAC tables correctly after a failover. So, they keep\nsending packets to the former primary even after receiving the gratuitous ARPs. In these cases, you should use\nthe command shown on this slide to force the former primary to shut down all its interfaces for one second when\nthe failover happens, excluding heartbeat and reserved management interfaces. This simulates a link failure that\nclears the related entries from the MAC table of the switches.","comment_id":"1361723","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1740543960.0"},{"timestamp":"1740470040.0","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nBD\nPg 98 study guide","poster":"thiagof","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1361375"},{"timestamp":"1740426120.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Alexander101","comment_id":"1361165","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nThis command forces the former primary to shut its interfaces for 1 second following an HA failover resulting in the switches updating their MAC address tables."},{"poster":"JonnathanTarrero","content":"Selected Answer: AD\ncorrect","comment_id":"1359039","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1740014400.0"}],"unix_timestamp":1740014400,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["AD (86%)","14%"],"question_id":61,"answer":"AD","timestamp":"2025-02-20 02:20:00","isMC":true,"choices":{"D":"They force the former primary to shut down all its interfaces for one second when failover happens, excluding the heartbeat and reserved management interfaces.","C":"They force both HA devices for remote link monitoring to detect an issue in the forwarding path.","A":"They force the switches to update their MAC forwarding tables, when failover happens.","B":"They force the former primary to send gratuitous ARP packets when the failover happens to indicate that the virtual MAC address is now using a different device."},"answer_ET":"AD","answer_images":[]},{"id":"ZcOihR7i9P9LS7odr8Bt","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2025-02-27 23:57:00","question_id":62,"choices":{"D":"The administrator must reconfigure the heartbeat interface.","A":"The administrator must reconfigure the monitor interface.","B":"The administrator must reconfigure the cluster in active-active mode.","C":"The administrator must reconfigure the cluster in FGSP mode."},"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/nse7-efw-7-2/image38.png","https://img.examtopics.com/nse7-efw-7-2/image39.png"],"answer_ET":"D","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nAnswer is D","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1400703","timestamp":"1742413860.0","poster":"JLHACKER"}],"answer_description":"","answer":"D","question_text":"Refer to the exhibits.\n\n\nNetwork topology -\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nOutput from the command config system ha\n\n//IMG//\n\n\nA network diagram and the output from the command config system ha are shown.\n\nThe administrator has configured the cluster with the commands shown in the exhibit.\n\nWhy is the HA cluster not forming?","topic":"1","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1740697020,"exam_id":425,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/157253-exam-nse7_efw-72-topic-1-question-65-discussion/"},{"id":"mP2anfT48N7YqBudED8M","unix_timestamp":1740425460,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"topic":"1","exam_id":425,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\n7.2 Study Guide page 317\nAnswer is D","comment_id":"1400128","poster":"JLHACKER","timestamp":"1742300100.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1361159","timestamp":"1740425460.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nFEC adds additional redundant packets to the IPSEC tunnel for reassembly of data in the event of packet loss.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Alexander101"}],"answer":"D","choices":{"D":"FortiGate will add additional redundant information to reconstruct any lost or erratically received packets.","A":"FortiGate will consider all IKEv2 packets as fragmentable.","C":"If fragmentation occurs, FortiGate will allow the packets at the IKE layer.","B":"When an FGSP member in FortiGate fails, FortiGate flushes the corresponding tunnels and sends out dead peer detection probes to find unavailable remote peers."},"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"D","question_id":63,"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/157088-exam-nse7_efw-72-topic-1-question-66-discussion/","timestamp":"2025-02-24 20:31:00","question_text":"How would fec-ingress and fec-egress IPsec configuration affect an IPsec tunnel?","answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"jyEOB88rd43Q5as4pruT","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1740362640.0","comment_id":"1360821","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer is A, Get Hardware Status command shows ASIC Version with CP model.","poster":"Alexander101"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nStudy Guide EFW7.2 pg 57: to determine the cp model available on Fortigate #
