So, C is incorrect (DPD is enabled, not disabled) and D is correct (anti‐replay is enabled).\n\nFor the quick‐mode selectors, FortiGate labels the local subnet as src and the remote subnet as dst from its own perspective. Here, src=0:10.1.2.0/255.255.255.0 and dst=0:10.1.1.0/255.255.255.0 indicates the other side (the remote FortiGate) sees its “destination” as `10.1.2.0/24.” That makes B correct. Conversely, the tunnel ID and arrow notation show that 10.200.4.1 is the remote gateway IP, so A is not correct.","timestamp":"1742299980.0","poster":"Ic3Box"},{"timestamp":"1736417460.0","poster":"TrX","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nThe correct statements are:\nA.
