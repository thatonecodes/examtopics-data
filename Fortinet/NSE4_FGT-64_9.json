If you enable asymmetric routing, it will disable RPF checking system wide. However this reduces the security of you network greatly. Features such us ANTIVIRUS, and IPS become non-effective. So, if you need to disable RPF checking, you can do so at the interface level using the command:\nconfig system interface\n edit <interface>\n set src-check [enable | disable]\n end\n\nSo the correct answer is B.
