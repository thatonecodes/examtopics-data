To solve the issue that MAC-tables on switches are not updated after a failover, you should configure the following on a HA-cluster:\nconfig system ha\nset link-failed-signal enable\nend\n\nThis will force the primary device to shut down all devices except mgmt and HA for one second, forcing the connected l2 devices to update their MAC-tables, as this simulates a link failure.","poster":"truserud"},{"comment_id":"1290597","timestamp":"1727517420.0","poster":"ray_NSE8","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe english study guide 7.2 , page 98 explains this.","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1724719860.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe only correct answer is A","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1273084","poster":"CHUA123"},{"comment_id":"1246286","content":"A its correct","poster":"jddc10006","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1720725300.0"},{"timestamp":"1720249260.0","poster":"khalmrj","comment_id":"1243237","upvote_count":"2","content":"A for sure"},{"comment_id":"1238648","upvote_count":"2","poster":"rac_sp","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA for sure","timestamp":"1719566760.0"},{"comment_id":"1219087","timestamp":"1716745740.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"havokdu","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A, Study_Guide 7.2, page 98"},{"timestamp":"1714023960.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA is correct","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1201766","poster":"Tommy_S"},{"timestamp":"1713948360.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1201210","poster":"charruco","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A, Study_Guide 7.2, page 98"},{"comment_id":"1165823","content":"Selected Answer: A\nAnswer A : p98","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Kop01","timestamp":"1709571540.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","poster":"5deee77","comment_id":"1163157","timestamp":"1709256960.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A, Enterprise_Firewall_7.2_Study_Guide, page 98"},{"poster":"Artbrut","comment_id":"1161640","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nShould be A as per https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Troubleshooting-Tip-FortiGate-HA-link-failed-signal-and/ta-p/198050","timestamp":"1709125440.0"},{"poster":"rananaj","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe answer is A","comment_id":"1156492","timestamp":"1708616520.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"A","question_id":76,"timestamp":"2024-02-22 16:42:00","answer_ET":"A","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_images":[]}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"numberOfQuestions":76,"provider":"Fortinet","name":"NSE7_EFW-7.2","id":425,"isImplemented":true,"isMCOnly":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":16},"__N_SSP":true}
