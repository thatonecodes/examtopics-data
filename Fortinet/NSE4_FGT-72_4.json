ZTNA provides a security posture check.\nD. ZTNA provides role-based access.\n\nZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access) is a security architecture that is designed to provide secure access to network resources for users, devices, and applications. It is based on the principle of \"never trust, always verify,\" which means that all access to network resources is subject to strict verification and authentication.\n\nTwo functions of ZTNA are:\n\nZTNA provides a security posture check: ZTNA checks the security posture of devices and users that are attempting to access network resources. This can include checks on the device's software and hardware configurations, security settings, and the presence of malware.\n\nZTNA provides role-based access: ZTNA controls access to network resources based on the role of the user or device. Users and devices are granted access to only those resources that are necessary for their role, and all other access is denied. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and minimize the risk of data breaches."},{"poster":"GeniusA","timestamp":"1703007060.0","comment_id":"1100859","upvote_count":"2","content":"CD are the correct answers"},{"poster":"raydel92","timestamp":"1694285640.0","comment_id":"1003433","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nCorrect:\nA.
