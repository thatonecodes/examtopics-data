So:\n- FSSO is using agentless polling mode to detect logon events (Choice A).\n- In agentless mode, FortiGate will periodically poll the same IP (the DC) on port 445 to see if the user is still logged on (Choice B).\n\nChoices C and D imply that a collector/DC agent is installed on the domain controller (which is not the case in agentless polling), so they do not apply.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1742301120.0"},{"timestamp":"1734781320.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"PabloSL","comment_id":"1329977","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nAB are correct this output corresponds with agentless polling mode, in which FortiGate polls all workstations on port 445 to verify if the user is still logged in."}],"choices":{"D":"FSSO is using DC agent mode to detect logon events.","B":"The workstation with IP 10.124.2.90 will be polled frequently using TCP port 445 to see if the user is still logged on.","A":"FSSO is using agentless polling mode to detect logon events.","C":"The logon event can be seen on the collector agent installed on Windows."},"answer_ET":"AB"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":69,"id":427,"provider":"Fortinet","name":"NSE7_NST-7.2","isBeta":false,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","isMCOnly":true},"currentPage":6},"__N_SSP":true}
