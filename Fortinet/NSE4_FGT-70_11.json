NetAPI polling can increase bandwidth usage in large networks: YES is correct, because more concurrent users, is more bandwidth, but not extremely high. But it will increase.\nB. The NetSessionEnum function is used to track user logouts: YES its tracks user login AND logouts.\nSo, I’m still not sure how to answer this. A is strictly correct, but the infrastructure guide does not mention anything about bandwidth, only something about poll interval times. B is also correct because NetAPI uses NetSessionEnum end can track user logouts. But “function is used to track user logouts” suggests it’s only used for this.
