If SD-WAN is enabled, you can configure routes with unequal distance and priority values to be part of ECMP is incorrect because ECMP requires routes to have equal cost, which means that the routes must have the same distance and priority values to be considered for load balancing.\n\nIn contrast, ECMP specifically balances traffic across multiple paths that have equal cost, hence the term \"equal-cost\" in ECMP.
