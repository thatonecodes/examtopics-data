The sensor will gather a packet log for all matched traffic.\nCorrect. The \"Microsoft.Windows.iSCSI.Target.DoS\" signature has packet logging enabled, so matched traffic will be logged.\n\nB. The sensor will reset all connections that match these signatures.\nIncorrect. The configuration does not indicate resetting connections, as the action for the \"iSCSI\" signature is set to \"Monitor.\"\n\nC. The sensor will allow attackers matching the Microsoft.Windows.iSCSI.Target.DoS signature.\nCorrect. The action for this signature is set to \"Monitor,\" meaning traffic matching this signature is allowed but logged.\n\nD. The sensor will block all attacks aimed at Windows servers.\nIncorrect.
