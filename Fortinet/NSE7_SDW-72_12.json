There is no indication of any spoke-spoke tunnel. This is a hub (indicated by the auto-discovery-sender command), and tunnel T_INET_1_0 is a hub-spoke tunnel, not a spoke-spoke tunnel, and therefore cannot be a shortcut.\nC is wrong. IPSec ESP uses UDP 500 unless traversing NAT on either or both ends--only then is UDP 4500 used. However, from Exh B: \"natt: mode=none\" Thus no NAT-T, therefore no UDP 4500.\nThat leaves A - which is not in the configuration but should be, unless they just mean the config supports it even though it is not configured - which is definitely the case and part of the reference design in the recommended template, most of which is configured on this hub.\nAnd B: i think this is actually false -- it looks like we are doing ADVPN with Phase2 Selector (SG p291), in which case the phase 2 selector (i.e., IPsec static routes) *would* be installed in the routing table. \nThis is a bad question, since definitionally, C and D *cannot* be correct based on the diag output, and it appears B is conceptually incorrect."},{"comment_id":"1295639","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nI think A is wrong since set network overlay enable command isn't configured in Phase1 (and default value is disabled).
