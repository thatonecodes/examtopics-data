This is also known as PAT. FortiGate assigns to each connection sharing the egress interface address a port number from a pool of available ports. The assignment of a port enables FortiGate to identify packets associated with the connection and then perform the corresponding translation. This is the same behavior as the overload IP pool type, which you will also learn about. \n\nOptionally, you may select a fixed port, in which case the source port translation is disabled. With a fixed port, if two or more connections require the same source port for a single IP address, only one connection is established.\"\n\nReference: FortiGate 7.4 Administrator Study Guide, page 56","poster":"herlock_sholmes_2810"},{"timestamp":"1680257640.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nAnswer is B&D","comment_id":"856906","poster":"einstein85"},{"timestamp":"1603753440.0","content":"It is A&b","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ramzie","comment_id":"206674"},{"timestamp":"1600396080.0","content":"A y B son correctas, pag. 152 Fortigate_Security_6.2","comment_id":"181324","upvote_count":"2","poster":"romartinedg"},{"poster":"Fr4nx","comment_id":"102353","upvote_count":"2","content":"A & B, Fixed port disable means that source port translation can be used,","timestamp":"1591272600.0"},{"comment_id":"63857","upvote_count":"3","content":"also for me A & B","timestamp":"1584190560.0","poster":"montonearm"},{"content":"i think its \nB&D","comment_id":"13584","poster":"topicx","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1570021560.0","comments":[{"upvote_count":"12","poster":"Samanosuke","content":"A&B are correct because the fixed port is disabled (default).
