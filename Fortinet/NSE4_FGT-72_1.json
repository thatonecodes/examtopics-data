It limits the scanning of application traffic to the application category only.\n\nWhen using a URL list and application control in the same firewall policy in NGFW policy-based mode, the firewall may be limited in its ability to fully inspect and control application traffic. This is because the URL list only controls access to specific websites or domains, while the application control inspects and controls the specific applications or services being used.\n\nBy combining both features, the firewall may only be able to inspect and control traffic based on the application category, rather than the specific application being used. This could potentially allow certain applications or services to bypass security measures if they are not categorized correctly, or if they are categorized under a broader category that is not being blocked.\n\nTherefore, it is important to carefully consider the limitations and potential gaps in security when using both URL lists and application control in the same firewall policy.","timestamp":"1679571000.0","poster":"Rodri96"},{"poster":"santi1509","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"815465","content":"Al tener un filtrado web y un control de aplicaciones en las mismas políticas, agotamos los recursos, lo cual hace que no haya un buen análisis en la categorías basada en navegador","timestamp":"1676907480.0"},{"poster":"Reyne","content":"Taken from the slides NSE 4 7.2:\n\n\"You can configure the URL Category within the same security policy; however, adding a URL filter causes application control to scan applications in only the browser based technology category, for example, Facebook Messenger on the Facebook website\"\n\nSo correct answer should be A.","comment_id":"778640","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1673939220.0"},{"poster":"tattybizzy","timestamp":"1673601540.0","content":"D. is correct","comment_id":"774282","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"768904","upvote_count":"4","poster":"Spago","timestamp":"1673123940.0","content":"D.

However, the URL list is limited to inspecting traffic at the URL level, while the application control can inspect traffic at a deeper level, such as at the application layer.
