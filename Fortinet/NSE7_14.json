It says \"connected to the port4 network\", not \"connected to port4\". Port4 network is something like 172.20.0.0/16. Local FortiGate is 1 OSPF router and has 4 neighbors. There is a total of 5 OSPF routers in 172.20.0.0/16.\n-Cannot be D because OSPF neighbors are simply routers that sit on the same segment and hear each other, but they do not engage in any closer cooperation. OSPF adjacent routers exchange routing information. That means that having 2 adjacent routers out of 4 neighbors doesn't mean that 2 routers are down.","poster":"kappa915"},{"content":"Only A","timestamp":"1662762120.0","comment_id":"664962","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ElDTO91"},{"content":"A&D are correct","comment_id":"603494","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ni","timestamp":"1652902980.0"},{"content":"A & C - just because the neighbor count is 4 and adjacency is 2 does not mean 2 routers are down.
