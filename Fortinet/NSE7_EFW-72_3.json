The metadata format is $<metadata_variable_name>.\n\n True. Metadata variables in Fortinet systems follow the format $<metadata_variable_name>, where the variable name is enclosed in angle brackets. This is the standard format for referencing metadata variables.\n\nB. You create them on FortiGate.\n\n False. Metadata variables are typically defined and managed on FortiManager or in FortiCloud, not directly on FortiGate. FortiGate uses these variables in policies or configurations pushed from FortiManager.\n\nC. They can be used as variables in scripts.\n\n True. Metadata variables can be utilized in scripts to dynamically reference objects or configurations, making them versatile for automation and templating.\n\nD. They apply only to non-firewall objects.\n\n False. Metadata variables can apply to various objects, including firewall policies and other security-related configurations, not just non-firewall objects.","timestamp":"1736958840.0","comment_id":"1341122","upvote_count":"1","poster":"myrmidon3"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1177769","content":"Selected Answer: AC\nhttps://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortimanager/7.2.0/new-features/218740/metadata-variables-are-supported-in-firewall-objects-configuration","timestamp":"1726775580.0","poster":"Totoahren"},{"content":"Selected Answer: AC\nAs it is a \"choose two\" solution, the most correct second answer is A, even though the format isn't entirely correct.
