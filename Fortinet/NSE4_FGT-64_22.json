The default is 10 MB. That is \nlarge enough for most files, except video files. If your FortiGate model has more RAM, you may be able to \nincrease this threshold.\nWithout a limit, very large files could exhaust the scan memory. So, this threshold balances risk and \nperformance. Is this tradeoff unique to FortiGate, or to a specific model? No. Regardless of vendor or model, \nyou must make a choice. This is because of the difference between scans in theory, that have no limits, and \nscans on real-world devices, that have finite RAM. In order to detect 100% of malware regardless of file size, \na firewall would need infinitely large RAM—something that no device has in the real world.\nMost viruses are very small. This table shows a typical tradeoff. You can see that with the default 10 MB \nthreshold, only 0.01% of viruses pass through.","comment_id":"443365","upvote_count":"3","poster":"vagedis","timestamp":"1631435580.0"},{"comment_id":"438400","timestamp":"1630656540.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Akoladet","content":"Answer is A and D"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"A & B is correct","timestamp":"1629629940.0","poster":"yadavarya97","comment_id":"429210"},{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1625106660.0","content":"A & B is correct answer","comment_id":"395405","poster":"Jancy_111"},{"comment_id":"395009","timestamp":"1625074260.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"A & B is correct","poster":"phototrait"}],"exam_id":419,"question_text":"Which two statements about antivirus scanning mode are true?
