Got this from the instructor ppt slide.\n\nWhen IPsec SAs expire, FortiGate needs to negotiate new SAs to continue sending and receiving traffic over the IPsec tunnel. Technically, FortiGate deletes the expired SAs from the respective phase 2 selectors, and install new ones. If IPsec SA renegotiation takes too much time, then FortiGate may drop interesting traffic because of the absence of active SAs. To prevent this, you can enable Auto-negotiate. When you do this, FortiGate not only negotiates new SAs before the current SAs expire, but it also starts using the new SAs right away. The latter prevents traffic disruption by IPsec SA renegotiation.\n\nAnother benefit of enabling Auto-negotiate is that the tunnel comes up and stays up automatically, even when there is no interesting traffic. When you enable Autokey Keep Alive and keep Auto-negotiate disabled, tunnel will not come up automatically unless there is interesting traffic.
