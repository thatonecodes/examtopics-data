When changes are made to a policy package on FortiManager and the managed device independently of each other, this can lead to conflicts. The system recognizes discrepancies between the configurations stored on FortiManager and those active on the device, marking the status as Conflict because it cannot reconcile these differences without manual intervention."},{"poster":"sugar12","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC manual page 222\nConflict: If you make policy configuration changes locally on FortiGate and don’t import the changes into\nthe policy package, and you also made the changes on FortiManager, the status enters conflict state.\nDepending on the configuration changes, you can either import a policy package or install the changes from FortiManager.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1178265","timestamp":"1726828680.0"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA policy package status of \"Conflict\" indicates that:\n\nC. The policy package configuration has been changed on both FortiManager and the managed device independently.\n\nThis status arises when there are discrepancies between the policy configurations on FortiManager and the FortiGate device, due to changes being made locally on the FortiGate and also on the FortiManager, without synchronizing these changes. As a result, FortiManager cannot reconcile the differences automatically, leading to a conflict status. This requires manual intervention to resolve the differences and ensure the policy configurations are consistent across both platforms.","timestamp":"1726073100.0","poster":"erzestxgyhlji","comment_id":"1171241"},{"comment_id":"1165016","poster":"red_sparrow_Gr","timestamp":"1725382680.0","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\ncorrect"}],"unix_timestamp":1709492280},{"id":"d7P02AzTeiHwjNvtp9rV","answer":"D","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1162293","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCorrect Answer is D.\nI just tested it and when i created the new polciy package the global header&footer policies were added automatically.","timestamp":"1724908680.0","poster":"Tommy_S","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1726830000.0","poster":"sugar12","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD is correct.

It automatically assigns the global policies.\n\nWhen a new policy package is created in a custom ADOM (Administrative Domain) that already has a global policy package assigned to it, FortiManager automatically applies the global policies to the newly created policy package. This means that the global header and footer policies, which are part of the global policy package assigned to the ADOM, will be automatically included in the new policy package. This helps ensure consistency in policy enforcement across all policy packages within the ADOM and simplifies the management of common policies across different devices or sites managed within the same ADOM.","comment_id":"1171243","poster":"erzestxgyhlji","upvote_count":"3"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD, tested in a LAB","upvote_count":"4","comment_id":"1164942","timestamp":"1725375000.0","poster":"AgentSmith"}],"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/134874-exam-nse5_fmg-72-topic-1-question-56-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1709191080,"question_text":"An administrator has assigned a global policy package to custom ADOM1.
