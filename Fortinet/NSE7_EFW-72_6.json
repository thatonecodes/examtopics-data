Look at 'BGP state = Idle' in the config. Idle means that the router hasn't established a connection to any other router yet. However, if you look at the number of Sent and Received messages, anything greater than 0 means that it is trying to establish a connection. If 'BGP state = Established' it would mean that the connection is complete and solid. Without that, it is just TRYING to connect, hence B.","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1729770420.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"charruco","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct","comment_id":"1201312"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1165791","content":"Selected Answer: B\ncorrect is B","timestamp":"1725459960.0","poster":"5deee77"},{"timestamp":"1724906100.0","comment_id":"1162269","poster":"Artbrut","upvote_count":"1","content":"https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-BGP-Neighbor-Adjacency-States/ta-p/208989"},{"timestamp":"1724866320.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB, everything else is nonsense","comment_id":"1161946","upvote_count":"3","poster":"Artbrut"}],"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"question_id":26,"answer_ET":"B","choices":{"A":"You must change the AS number to match the remote peer.","B":"BGP is attempting to establish a TCP connection with the BGP peer.","C":"The bfd configuration is set to enable.","D":"The routers are in the same area ID of 0.0.0.0."},"exam_id":425,"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit, which provides information on BGP neighbors.\n//IMG//\n\nWhat can you conclude from this command output?","unix_timestamp":1709148720},{"id":"7x5aD4jiqPKVNjQ4pgy9","unix_timestamp":1708959600,"choices":{"C":"All FortiGate devices must be in the same autonomous system (AS).","B":"You must configure phase 2 quick mode selectors to 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0.","D":"You must disable add-route in the hub.","A":"The hub adds routes based on IKE negotiations."},"answer_images":[],"answers_community":["BD (92%)","8%"],"timestamp":"2024-02-26 16:00:00","topic":"1","answer_ET":"BD","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which two statements about ADVPN are true? (Choose two.)","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1736952780.0","poster":"myrmidon3","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nA. You must disable add-route in the hub.\n\n True. For ADVPN (Auto-Discovery VPN) to work, the hub should not add routes automatically. Disabling add-route ensures that route discovery is dynamic and based on the ADVPN mechanism rather than static route additions.\n\nB. All FortiGate devices must be in the same autonomous system (AS).\n\n False. ADVPN can operate across different AS numbers as long as the routing and VPN configurations are correct. It does not require all FortiGates to be in the same AS.\n\nC. The hub adds routes based on IKE negotiations.\n\n False. ADVPN uses dynamic routing protocols (e.g., BGP or OSPF) to exchange routes, not IKE negotiations. IKE is responsible for establishing the VPN tunnels, but routing is handled separately.\n\nD. You must configure phase 2 quick mode selectors to 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0.\n\n True. To enable ADVPN's dynamic capabilities, phase 2 quick mode selectors are typically set to 0.0.0.0/0 for both source and destination. This ensures that the VPN tunnel can dynamically accommodate various subnets.","comment_id":"1341083"},{"comment_id":"1262861","timestamp":"1723199220.0","content":"Selected Answer: BD\nA. wrong - not relevant\nB. Correct because C is wrong and D is correct\nC. wrong devices can be in the same or not the same AS depending your topology. Also you can use EBGP rather than IBGP. it is recommended to use IBGP but that doesnt mean you cant use only EBGP. So it is not mandatory to be in the same AS. \nD.

The hub must also be configured with set add-route disable, so D is definitely correct. The Study Guide merely states that you have to check and confirm that phase2 selectors are set to 0.0.0.0/0, which is the default setting as stated here https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.2.4/cli-reference/373620/config-vpn-ipsec-phase2-interface (dst-subnet row in table). I belive if you HAD to set 0.0.0.0/0 the documentation would actually show that in every configuration example of ADVPN. Thus I am going to say that C and D are the correct answers, just to confuse everyone, because I am a bit confused my self.","comments":[{"comment_id":"1219146","poster":"havokdu","upvote_count":"1","content":"AD-VPN supports EBGP for inter-region routing (dual regions - Dual HUB).
