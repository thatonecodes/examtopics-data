SD-WAN rules use SLA targets to check if the preferred members meet the SLA requirements.\nSD-WAN rules are designed to ensure that the traffic is routed through the best possible link based on the defined SLA targets. These targets define the acceptable levels of performance, such as latency, jitter, and packet loss. If the preferred member does not meet the SLA requirements, the SD-WAN rule can select an alternative member that meets the criteria.\nC. When configuring an SD-WAN rule, you can select multiple SLA targets of the same performance SLA.\nIn FortiGate, you can configure multiple SLA targets within an SD-WAN rule. This allows the rule to evaluate multiple performance criteria to determine the best link for traffic routing. For example, you can set multiple targets for latency, jitter, and packet loss, and the rule will use these targets to select the optimal path.","poster":"d567468","comment_id":"1223880","upvote_count":"3"},{"comment_id":"1200349","upvote_count":"3","poster":"truserud","timestamp":"1713812100.0","content":"Selected Answer: AD\nA & D are correct.
