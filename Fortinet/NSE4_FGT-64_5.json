Shutting down/rebooting a downstream FortiGate device can only be performed from the root FortiGate in a Security Fabric. The root FortiGate has control over all the devices in the Security Fabric, and can perform actions on them as needed.\n\nD. Banning or unbanning compromised hosts can also only be performed from the root FortiGate in a Security Fabric. The root FortiGate is responsible for monitoring the Security Fabric and detecting compromised hosts. When a host is detected as compromised, the root FortiGate can ban it from the network to prevent further damage. Similarly, the root FortiGate can unban a previously banned host once it has been cleaned and is no longer a threat.","poster":"princelionelnzi","timestamp":"1678980180.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"841101"}]},{"timestamp":"1640082300.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"MrSaintz","comment_id":"506026","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC - Logical Topology, vs Phisical Topology shows interface connected to devices;\nD - 19 indicates security rating recommendations\nDevice detection is on at least in root FG.","comments":[{"timestamp":"1644097620.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Exactly, logical topology show network interfaces.","comment_id":"541287","poster":"Eduardo2022"}]},{"content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC&D are correct","comment_id":"505311","upvote_count":"1","poster":"acaselli","timestamp":"1639993500.0"},{"comment_id":"500538","content":"Selected Answer: CD\nC & D are correct.\nA is incorrect, connected devices are not part of the fabric.\nB is incorrect, we have not expanded the device to see whether or not the devices are identified.\nC is correct, logical view shows the interfaces\nD is correct, there are 19 recommendations","upvote_count":"3","poster":"mrtim5700","timestamp":"1639392480.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"A C ...
