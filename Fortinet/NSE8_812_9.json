If you want different trunk name, you need to delete the trunk. The new trunk is created automatically with an updated name. At the end of this section is a detailed procedure for renaming the MCLAG-ICL trunk.\nOn the FortiGate device, if the failed switch did not have “set lldp-profile default-auto-mclag-icl” configured in the ICL ports of the switch, the replacement switch will not have the setting as well. SSH to the replacement switch, manually configure “set mclag-icl enable” in the ISL trunk with the peer switch’s name. Then SSH to the peer switch to delete the ICL trunk (with the failed switch’s name) and configure “set mclag-icl enable” after a new ISL trunk with the replacement switch’s name forms automatically.","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1278612","poster":"kinge2","timestamp":"1725508440.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"ama6","comment_id":"1017075","timestamp":"1695663480.0","content":"i agree with Viewable8041"},{"poster":"Viewable8041","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: AB\nAs of the documentation B and D are correct, depending of the lldp profile.\nhttps://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiswitch/7.0.8/devices-managed-by-fortios/173284/replacing-a-managed-fortiswitch-unit","timestamp":"1694071080.0","comments":[{"comment_id":"1131998","content":"You mean AB","timestamp":"1706211240.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ac89l"}],"comment_id":"1001274"}],"unix_timestamp":1694071080,"timestamp":"2023-09-07 09:18:00","isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"After replacing the FortiSwitch unit, the automatically created trunk name changes.","D":"MCLAG-ICL will be automatically reconfigured once the new switch is connected to the FortiGate.","A":"After replacing the FortiSwitch unit, the automatically created trunk name does not change.","B":"MCLAG-ICL needs to be manually reconfigured once the new switch is connected to the FortiGate."},"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nYou have been tasked with replacing the managed switch FortiSwitch 2 shown in the topology.\nWhich two actions are correct regarding the replacement process?
