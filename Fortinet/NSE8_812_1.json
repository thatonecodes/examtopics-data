The download bandwidth of 500 Mbps is not\ngreater than 950 Mbps, so the FEC mapping is not overridden by the bandwidth setting. Therefore, the\nFEC behavior will be 2 redundant packets for every 8 base packets.\nHere is the explanation of the FEC mappings in the exhibit:\nPacket loss greater than 10%:8 base packets and 2 redundant packets.\nUpload bandwidth greater than 950 Mbps:9 base packets and 3 redundant packets.\nThe mappings are matched from top to bottom, so the first mapping that matches the conditions will be\nused. In this case, the first mapping matches because the packet loss is greater than 10%. Therefore, the\nFEC behavior will be 2 redundant packets for every 8 base packets.\nReference: https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.0.0/new-features/169010/adaptive-\nforward-error-correction-7-0-2","poster":"ama6","timestamp":"1695582420.0"},{"poster":"Davidrichard","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct \n\nhttps://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.0.0/new-features/169010/adaptive-forward-error-correction-7-0-2","timestamp":"1693748220.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"997657"}],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1690164480,"timestamp":"2023-07-24 04:08:00","choices":{"D":"3 redundant packet for every 9 base packets","B":"3 redundant packet for every 5 base packets","A":"1 redundant packet for every 10 base packets","C":"2 redundant packet for every 8 base packets"},"answer_ET":"A","question_id":1,"exam_id":432,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (63%)","B (38%)"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/nse8-812/image1.png"]},{"id":"mRkp1OLKMgdFGNf5SaIK","choices":{"C":"Objects from the root FortiGate will not be synchronized to any downstream FortiGate","B":"Objects from the root FortiGate will only be synchronized to FGT_2","D":"Objects from the root FortiGate will only be synchronized to FGT_3","A":"Objects from the FortiGate FGT_2 will be synchronized to the upstream FortiGate"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"967865","timestamp":"1706694240.0","content":"Local means objects will not be synchronized to and from this device (CLI Reference Guide).\nSo they will not by synced on FGT_2.
