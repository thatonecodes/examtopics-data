A session for denied traffic is created. \n\nFortiGate Security 7.2 Study Guide (p.69):\n\"During the session, if a security profile detects a violation, FortiGate records the attack log immediately. To reduce the number of log messages generated and improve performance, you can enable a session table entry of dropped traffic. This creates the denied session in the session table and, if the session is denied, all packets of that session are also denied. This ensures that FortiGate does not have to do a policy lookup for each new packet matching the denied session, which reduces CPU usage and log generation.\nThis option is in the CLI, and is called ses-denied-traffic. You can also set the duration for block sessions. This determines how long a session will be kept in the session table by setting block-sessiontimer in the CLI.
