Why? Lets see\n\"D. It is combined with the neighbor-range parameter\"\n\nIt CAN be combined with neighbor-range, but is not required. It can work fine with the “remote-as” parameter alone (which IS required).

The neighbor-group command can indeed be configured using the GUI. This allows users to set up neighbor groups easily in environments where graphical interface configuration is preferred.\n\n Option B: False. The neighbor-group command is not specific to OSPF; it is primarily a BGP construct for grouping peers. Common settings in an OSPF area would typically involve different commands or methodologies.\n\n Option C: False. While the neighbor-group command can be used with the neighbor-range parameter, it is not a requirement. This option's wording (\"It is combined\") implies necessity, which is inaccurate. The neighbor-group works independently, particularly when the remote-as parameter is defined.\n\n Option D: True. The neighbor-group command can be utilized for both IBGP and EBGP sessions, enabling the application of shared settings across both types of neighbors.\n\nThe correct options are B and C, considering the nuanced interpretations of the provided statements.","timestamp":"1736788020.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1339981"},{"poster":"raydel92","comment_id":"1259294","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB and C","timestamp":"1722505440.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BC\nCan be configured from gui","comment_id":"1255200","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1721935140.0","poster":"Benr06"},{"content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB and C\n_ neighbor-group can be configured from the GUI since FortiOS 7.2.0\n_ You can use EBGP in neighbor-group\n_ neighbor-range is not mandatory","timestamp":"1716744120.0","poster":"havokdu","comment_id":"1219074","upvote_count":"2"},{"content":"I'm thinking it is B and C.
