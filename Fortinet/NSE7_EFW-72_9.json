The downstream FortiGate has fabric-object-unification set to local.\n True. If the downstream FortiGate has fabric-object-unification set to local, it will not synchronize global objects from the root FortiGate. This setting allows the downstream FortiGate to maintain its own local objects independently of the root.\n B. The root FortiGate has configuration-sync set to enable.\n False. The configuration-sync on the root FortiGate is typically enabled to push objects downstream. This setting would not prevent synchronization but rather facilitate it.\n C. The address object on the root FortiGate has fabric-object set to disable.\n False. If the fabric-object is disabled for an address object, it won't be marked for synchronization within the Security Fabric. However, this option is not specified in the scenario, so it is unlikely to be the cause.\n D. The downstream FortiGate has configuration-sync set to local.\n True. If the downstream FortiGate has configuration-sync set to local, it will not import global CMDB objects from the root FortiGate.
