It matters in which direction the connection is established. In this case from LAN(port2) to WAN(port1).\n\nSo the Firewall Policy ID 1 matches and has NAT Enabled. in this view we are unable to look at the adress configured for NAT. It could be the interface adress shown above in the network topology, 10.200.1.1 or it could be the IP from the virtual IP Setup. \n\nIn this virtual IP Setup the IP 10.200.1.10 is assigned for being used for Destination NAT from WAN (port1) to LAN (port2). 10.200.1.10 is in the same subnet like the interface adress 10.200.1.1.\n\nSo the source could be 10.200.1.1, which will be the first adress allocated. it could also be any other allocated IP adress in that subnet.
