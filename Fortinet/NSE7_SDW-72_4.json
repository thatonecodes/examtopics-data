Existing sessions are not affected.\nIf the firewall handles a huge number of sessions, flagging all sessions as dirty, and performing a firewall\npolicy lookup for the sessions may result in high CPU utilization. To prevent this, you can configure FortiGate\nto flag only new sessions as dirty by setting firewall-session-dirty to check-new. The result is that\nFortiGate evaluates only new sessions against the new firewall policy configuration.","poster":"sugar12","timestamp":"1732962720.0","comment_id":"1222026","upvote_count":"2"},{"timestamp":"1725955560.0","upvote_count":"4","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nB & C are correct.","poster":"KavinT","comment_id":"1170220"}],"isMC":true,"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/nse7-sdw-7-2/image12.png"],"answer_ET":"BC","answers_community":["BC (100%)"],"timestamp":"2024-03-10 11:06:00","question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nBased on the exhibit, which two actions does FortiGate perform on sessions after a firewall policy change?
