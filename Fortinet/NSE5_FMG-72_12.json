Depending on the Server Override Mode configuration, you can restrict FortiManager to receiving updates from the configured override servers list, or allowing fallback to other public FDS servers, if FortiManager is not able to communicate and receive updates from the configured server list.\n\nIn the example shown on this slide, two override server addresses are configured. When Server Override Mode is set to Strict, FortiManager gets updates only from these two servers. There is no fallback to other public servers, if these two configured servers are not available.\n\nIf you set Server Override Mode to Loose, FortiManager first tries to get updates from the configured server list; if they are unavailable, FortiManager falls back to other public FDS servers to get updates.\n\nReference [Page 357] - https://ebin.pub/fortinet-fortimanager-study-guide-for-fortimanager-72.html"},{"poster":"RiderZ","timestamp":"1724958660.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is correct","comment_id":"1274692","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nServer Overide is strict mode and there is only one server configure using CLI.","poster":"ec24811","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1253656","timestamp":"1721738400.0"},{"timestamp":"1709201700.0","poster":"Tommy_S","upvote_count":"3","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC is Correct","comment_id":"1162420"},{"timestamp":"1705587180.0","content":"The answer is C","comment_id":"1125944","poster":"GeniusA","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"DatBroNZ","comment_id":"1122986","content":"Correct answer is C.\n\nFortiManager 7.2 Study Guide page 357:\n\n- When Server Override Mode is set to Strict, FortiManager gets updates only from override server address (source type CLI)\n\nWhen source type is CLI means manual override configured, when is FDNI means public FDS.","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1705280940.0"},{"timestamp":"1705131960.0","upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1121391","content":"Answer - C","poster":"erosramos322"}],"answer_ET":"C","answer":"C","topic":"1","isMC":true,"exam_id":422,"question_text":"Refer to the exhibit.\n//IMG//\n\nHow will FortiManager try to get updates for antivirus and IPS?","answer_description":"","timestamp":"2024-01-13 08:46:00","answer_images":[],"question_id":56,"choices":{"D":"From public FDNI server IP address with the fourth highest octet only","B":"From the default server fds1.fortinet.com","A":"From the list of configured override servers or public FDN servers","C":"From the configured override server IP address 10.0.1.50 only"},"unix_timestamp":1705131960,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":["https://img.examtopics.com/nse5-fmg-7-2/image1.png"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/fortinet/view/131061-exam-nse5_fmg-72-topic-1-question-6-discussion/"},{"id":"XEtfRrNncwVCMBHisDk4","topic":"1","isMC":true,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"1194495","poster":"erzestxgyhlji","timestamp":"1712949060.0","content":"Selected Answer: BC\nThese options highlight the role of FortiManager in managing device-specific settings within the Security Fabric and its capability to visualize the overall health and security ratings of the network."},{"comment_id":"1186872","timestamp":"1711900620.0","comments":[{"poster":"flamengo","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1735337880.0","content":"I think A is correct","comment_id":"1332653"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727211240.0","poster":"myrmidon3","comment_id":"1288766","content":"The option \"The Security Fabric license, group name, and password are required for the FortiManager Security Fabric integration\" is incorrect because no specific Security Fabric license, group name, or password is required for FortiManager to integrate with the Security Fabric.\n\nThe Security Fabric integration relies on the configuration of the Security Fabric across FortiGate devices, which are centrally managed through FortiManager. The integration does not involve additional licensing or the need for a separate group name and password to establish this relationship. Instead, FortiManager uses existing Security Fabric configurations on the managed FortiGate devices to display and manage them within the Fabric View.\n\nThus, FortiManager does not require separate credentials like a license, group name, or password specifically for Security Fabric integration."},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Sorry.
