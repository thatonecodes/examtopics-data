The advertised prefix of 10.20.30.0/24 was configured using the network command.\nThe origin code for 10.20.30.0/24 indicates an IGP source (usually shown as “i”), meaning it was originated locally via a network statement rather than via redistribution.\n\nD. The output shows all prefixes advertised by all neighbors as well as the local router.\nWhen you run 'get router info bgp network' without specifying a prefix, it displays the complete local BGP table.
