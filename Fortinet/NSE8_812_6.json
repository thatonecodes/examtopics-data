A multicast packet received on an interface is flooded unconditionally to all interfaces (except the incoming interface) belonging to the same forwarding domain. Multicast packets are forwarded even when there is no multicast policy or the multicast policy is set to deny. To forward multicast traffic based on multicast policy, multicast-skip-policy must be disabled.\n\nIn transparent mode, there is a per-VDOM configuration to skip policy check and forward all multicast traffic. This command is only available in transparent mode, and is disabled by default.","comment_id":"1020701","poster":"ama6","timestamp":"1727608620.0"},{"content":"C is correct question says to control multicast traffic (so disabling the rule is wrong)\n\nTo control multicast traffic passing through a FortiGate configured in transparent mode, you can use multicast policies. Multicast policies allow you to filter multicast traffic based on source and destination addresses, protocols, and interfaces. You can also apply security profiles to scan multicast traffic for threats and violations.
