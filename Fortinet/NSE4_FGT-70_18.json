A change in the virtual IP address happens when a FortiGate device joins or leaves the cluster.\nC. Virtual IP addresses are used to distinguish between cluster members.\n\nExplanation:\n\nB. When a FortiGate device joins or leaves the cluster, the virtual IP address associated with the cluster may change. The virtual IP address is assigned to the primary device in the cluster, and if that device fails, the virtual IP address will failover to the secondary device.\n\nC. Virtual IP addresses are used to distinguish between cluster members. Each device in the cluster has a unique physical IP address, but they share a virtual IP address that is used by clients to communicate with the cluster as a whole. The virtual IP address is used to identify the cluster, and clients use it to connect to the cluster rather than connecting to a specific device.","comments":[{"content":"a lot of bs.
