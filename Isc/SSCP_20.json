User ID and passwords of the employee have been deleted** tends to take precedence.\n\nRevoking access to systems, accounts, and company resources by deleting or deactivating user IDs and passwords is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems after an employee leaves. This action helps safeguard against potential security breaches and unauthorized use of company resources, which can have significant implications for data security and integrity."}],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"isMC":true,"topic":"2","exam_id":189},{"id":"RYW1lbGapSpzogpgr8m3","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/127285-exam-sscp-topic-2-question-65-discussion/","question_id":97,"question_text":"Which of the following is a CHARACTERISTIC of a decision support system (DSS) in regards to Threats and Risks Analysis?","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn the context of Threats and Risks Analysis, a characteristic of a Decision Support System (DSS) is best represented by:\n\nD.

It is aimed at solving less structured problems, combines the use of models and analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions and supports semi-structured decision-making tasks.\nDSS is sometimes referred to as the Delphi Method or Delphi Technique:\nThe Delphi technique is a group decision method used to ensure that each member gives an honest opinion of what he or she thinks the result of a particular threat will be. This avoids a group of individuals feeling pressured to go along with others thought processes and enables them to participate in an independent and anonymous way. Each member of the group provides his or her opinion of a certain threat and turns it in to the team that is performing the analysis. The results are compiled and distributed to the group members, who then write down their comments anonymously and return them to the analysis group. The comments are compiled and redistributed for more comments until a consensus is formed. This method is used to obtain an agreement on cost, loss values, and probabilities of occurrence without individuals having to agree verbally.\nHere is the ISC2 book coverage of the subject:\nOne of the methods that uses consensus relative to valuation of information is the consensus/modified Delphi method. Participants in the valuation exercise are asked to comment anonymously on the task being discussed. This information is collected and disseminated to a participant other than the original author. This participant comments upon the observations of the original author. The information gathered is discussed in a public forum and the best course is agreed upon by the group (consensus).\nEXAM TIP:\nThe DSS is what some of the books are referring to as the Delphi Method or Delphi Technique. Be familiar with both terms for the purpose of the exam.\nThe other answers are incorrect:\n'DSS is aimed at solving highly structured problems' is incorrect because it is aimed at solving less structured problems.\n'DSS supports only structured decision-making tasks' is also incorrect as it supports semi-structured decision-making tasks.\n'DSS combines the use of models with non-traditional data access and retrieval functions' is also incorrect as it combines the use of models and analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nHarris, Shon (2012-10-25).
