Patents protect new, useful, and non-obvious inventions, including manufacturing processes, machines, and industrial innovations.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Trademark → Protects logos, brand names, and symbols, not innovations or inventions.\nB. Copyright → Protects artistic, literary, and creative works (e.g., books, music, software code), not functional innovations.\nD. Trade Secret → Can protect confidential manufacturing processes, but does not provide exclusive legal rights like a patent does.","comment_id":"1361354","timestamp":"1740466500.0"},{"poster":"akg001","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732285800.0","comment_id":"605475","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. patent"}],"isMC":true,"answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/76096-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-424-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1653222600,"answer_ET":"C","topic":"1","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"choices":{"B":"Copyright","D":"Trade secret","C":"patent","A":"Trademark"},"answer":"C","timestamp":"2022-05-22 14:30:00"},{"id":"97hOgZ36WEEWrayxdciY","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Overwriting","D":"Melting","A":"Cryptoshredding","C":"Cold fusion"},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"akg001","timestamp":"1732285800.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
