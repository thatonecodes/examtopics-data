Over the years, the use of shared libraries has resulted in many security issues... \nTo protect against similar vulnerabilities, developers should be aware of the origins of their shared code and keep abreast of any security vulnerabilities that might be discovered in libraries that they use. This doesn't mean that shared libraries are inherently bad. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a world where shared libraries aren't widely used. It simply calls for vigilance and attention from software developers and cybersecurity professionals.\"","comments":[{"content":"A is correct","timestamp":"1683942540.0","comment_id":"896358","poster":"jackdryan","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"timestamp":"1673203800.0","comment_id":"769727","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Open source libraries contain known vulnerabilities, and adversaries regularly exploit those vulnerabilities in the wild.\nWhile it is true that open source libraries can be updated regularly, this does not guarantee that vulnerabilities will not exist or that they will not be exploited. In fact, the use of open source libraries can potentially increase the risk of vulnerabilities because they are widely used and known to many people, including adversaries. This means that if a vulnerability is discovered in an open source library, it may be more likely to be exploited compared to a proprietary library that is not widely known. Additionally, it is not uncommon for open source libraries to contain known vulnerabilities, as these libraries are often developed by a community of volunteers who may not have the resources or time to thoroughly test and secure the code. Therefore, it is important for software developers to consider the potential risks of using open source libraries, including the possibility of known vulnerabilities, when making decisions about which libraries to use.","poster":"DJOEK","upvote_count":"3"},{"timestamp":"1672135020.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA, developer known the vulnerabilities before use the open source library","comment_id":"758343","poster":"Ivanchun"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\n?!?

Having unknown vulnerabilities doesn’t really make the vulnerabilities go away; it simply means that the vulnerabilities are a time bomb, with no way to know when they’ll be exploited. Fundamentally, the problem of someone exploiting a vulnerability they discover is a problem for both open and closed source systems.\"\nhttps://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/open-source-security.html\nhttps://www.darkreading.com/application-security/flaws-found-in-some-open-source-projects-exploited-more-often","upvote_count":"1","poster":"JAckThePip","timestamp":"1664897640.0"}],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (79%)","D (21%)"],"answer_ET":"A","question_text":"A software development company has a short timeline in which to deliver a software product.
