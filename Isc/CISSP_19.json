Strongly typed languages require explicit declarations of variables and enforce strict rules for how variables can be used, making it more difficult for developers to make errors that could compromise the security of the code. In contrast, weakly typed languages have more flexible rules for variable declarations and use, making it easier for developers to make mistakes that could compromise the security of the code. Dynamically typed languages are similar to weakly typed languages in that they do not require explicit declarations of variables, but they also allow variables to change type during execution, which can increase the risk of security vulnerabilities. Statically typed languages are similar to strongly typed languages in that they require explicit declarations of variables and enforce strict rules for how variables can be used, but they also perform type checking at compile time rather than runtime, which can help to identify and fix potential security issues before the code is deployed.","poster":"DJOEK"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Duncan314","timestamp":"1737337380.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nStatically typed languages help catch type errors at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and enhancing the overall safety of the code.","comment_id":"1343285"},{"timestamp":"1718129700.0","comment_id":"1093821","poster":"Soleandheel","content":"C.
