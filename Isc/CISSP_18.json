This means that in the event of a firewall failure, the firewall will deny all network traffic by default, ensuring that no unauthorized traffic is allowed through. This ensures that even if the firewall fails, the network is protected from potentially harmful traffic. Method A, Failover, is a process of automatically switching to a backup system in the event of a failure. While failover can be an effective way to ensure business continuity and minimize downtime, it may not necessarily prioritize security in the event of a firewall failure. Failover can be useful to ensure that network traffic continues to flow, but it does not necessarily guarantee that the traffic is secure. In some cases, the failover system may not be as secure as the primary system, which could result in unauthorized traffic being allowed through the firewall. Therefore, Fail-Closed is considered the best method to prioritize security in the event of a firewall failure as it ensures that no unauthorized traffic is allowed through, even if the firewall fails.","comment_id":"1015245","timestamp":"1711227600.0"},{"content":"Fail-safe means that a device will not endanger lives or property when it fails.
