A chosen- ciphertext attack is defined as a cryptanalysis technique in which the analyst tries to determine the key from knowledge of plaintext that corresponds to ciphertext selected (i.e., dictated) by the analyst. A chosen-plaintext attack is a cryptanalysis technique in which the analyst tries to determine the key from knowledge of ciphertext that corresponds to plaintext selected (i.e., dictated) by the analyst. The other choice is a distracter.\nThe following are incorrect answers:\n\nA chosen-plaintext attacks -\nThe attacker has the plaintext and ciphertext, but can choose the plaintext that gets encrypted to see the corresponding ciphertext. This gives her more power and possibly a deeper understanding of the way the encryption process works so she can gather more information about the key being used. Once the key is discovered, other messages encrypted with that key can be decrypted.\n\nA chosen-ciphertext attack -\nIn chosen-ciphertext attacks, the attacker can choose the ciphertext to be decrypted and has access to the resulting decrypted plaintext. Again, the goal is to figure out the key. This is a harder attack to carry out compared to the previously mentioned attacks, and the attacker may need to have control of the system that contains the cryptosystem.\n\nA known-algorithm attack -\nKnowing the algorithm does not give you much advantage without knowing the key. This is a bogus detractor. The algorithm should be public, which is the\nKerckhoffs's Principle . The only secret should be the key.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nSource: SHIREY, Robert W., RFC2828: Internet Security Glossary, may 2000. and\nHarris, Shon (2012-10-25).

If you use a session key for each message you encrypt, then the brute force attack provides the attacker with only the key for that one message. So, if you are encrypting 10 messages a day, each with a different session key, but it takes me a month to break each session key then I am fighting a loosing battle.\nThe other answers are not correct because:\n\"The use of good key generators\" is not correct because a brute force key attack will eventually run through all possible combinations of key. Therefore, any key will eventually be broken in this manner given enough time.\n\"Nothing can defend you against a brute force crypto key attack\" is incorrect, and not the best answer listed. While it is technically true that any key will eventually be broken by a brute force attack, the question remains \"how long will it take?\". In other words, if you encrypt something today but I can't read it for 10,000 years, will you still care? If the key is changed every session does it matter if it can be broken after the session has ended? Of the answers listed here, session keys are\n\"often considered a good protection against the brute force cryptography attack\" as the question asks.\n\"Algorithms that are immune to brute force key attacks\" is incorrect because there currently are no such algorithms.\nReferences:\n\nOfficial ISC2 Guide page: 259 -\nAll in One Third Edition page: 623","answer":"B","question_text":"Brute force attacks against encryption keys have increased in potency because of increased computing power.

In the Kerberos authentication protocol, time stamps are included in the tickets to ensure that a ticket is only valid for a specific period of time.
