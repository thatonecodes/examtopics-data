This makes it difficult to perform repeat audits over time because:\nConstant Changes → Cloud resources are provisioned, modified, and decommissioned dynamically, making it hard to track what has changed between audits.\nEphemeral Workloads → Instances and containers may exist only for a short time, meaning traditional audit logs might miss key events.\nCompliance Challenges → Regulatory frameworks often require evidence of consistent security configurations, but dynamic optimization can introduce unexpected changes.\nWhy the other options are incorrect:"},{"timestamp":"1734625260.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nGuys, it's D. Dynamic optimization refers to the cloud's ability to automatically adjust and reallocate resources as needed, often without human intervention.

Virtualization: While virtualization is a fundamental technology in cloud computing, it does not inherently complicate repeat audits. It provides a consistent platform for tracking resources.\nB. Multitenancy: Multitenancy involves sharing resources among multiple customers, which poses security and isolation challenges, but it does not specifically hinder repeat audits.\nC.

While multitenancy can lead to cost efficiencies and resource optimization, it can also make it more challenging to perform repeat audits over time to track changes and compliance. This is because multiple tenants may be making changes and utilizing the same shared resources, making it difficult to isolate and track specific changes and ensure compliance for each individual tenant.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Kneebee","comment_id":"1051011","timestamp":"1698003420.0"},{"timestamp":"1686845160.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nWhen multiple tenants share the same underlying infrastructure, it becomes complex to maintain a granular level of visibility and control over the data and activities of each tenant.","poster":"escaprix","comment_id":"924350","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"Pika26","timestamp":"1682224920.0","comment_id":"877869","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nAnswer is B.

This can make it challenging to maintain continuity and consistency between audits, as the environment may look different each time.\n\nHowever, this is primarily a result of the virtualization and dynamic resource allocation that are common in cloud environments, rather than the multitenancy aspect specifically.

If data is destroyed or compromised, having regular backup systems in place as well as being able to perform disaster recovery in the event of a major or widespread problem allows operations to continue with an acceptable loss of time and data to management.
