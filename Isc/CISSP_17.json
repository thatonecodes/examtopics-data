As the number of entities (such as users or systems) increases, the number of key pairs grows exponentially.\n\nOption B, \"Exponential growth when using asymmetric keys,\" addresses this challenge accurately. The growth is exponential because, for every new entity, a new key pair must be generated, resulting in a quadratic increase in the number of keys to manage.\n\nWhile managing symmetric keys (Option A) also poses challenges, the growth is typically linear, not exponential, as each entity requires only one key.
