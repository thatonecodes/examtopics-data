With the nature of a cloud environment and how it writes data across diverse systems that are shared by others, the process of eDiscovery becomes much more complicated. Administrators cannot pull physical drives or easily isolate which data to capture. They not only have to focus on which data they need to collect, while ensuring they find all of it, but they also have to make sure that other data is not accidently collected and exposed along with it. Measured service is the aspect of a cloud where customers only pay for the services they are actually using, and for the duration of their use. Portability refers to the ease with which an application or service can be moved among different cloud providers.\nBroad network access refers to the nature of cloud services being accessed via the public Internet, either with or without secure tunneling technologies. None of these concepts would pertain to eDiscovery.","topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/75927-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-261-discussion/","question_id":181,"answer":"C","timestamp":"2022-05-19 19:55:00","answers_community":["C (100%)"]},{"id":"smomrKkShRmW2HLPHpwP","question_text":"A crucial decision any company must make is in regard to where it hosts the data systems it depends on.

BUILDING A DATACENTER GIVES YOU CONTROL ADVANTAGE.\n\nBUILDING/PROCURING DATACENTER:\nWhen companies build their own data centers, they have complete control over nearly every aspect â€“ from the overall facility designs down to the granular operational details like temperature and asset access. Firms that develop and operate their own data center space can also build out their resources in a phased and/or modular approach to manage capital deployment. In addition, since the space belongs to the service provider, they can utilize their assets however they please, whether this means leveraging resources for their own IT equipment or leasing space to other companies for a profit.\nLEASING A DATACENTER:\nOn the other hand, leasing from a top-tier provider has its advantages as well. This approach offers a more consistent and predictable cost model and can help providers reduce capital expenditures when compared with building and operating their own facility.\nhttps://wiredre.com/data-center-decisions-building-vs-leasing-data-center-space/","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1627789620.0","comment_id":"45499","comments":[{"content":"You are wrong, read it again! leas vs cloud NOT lease vs build","timestamp":"1655303100.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"eliotn183","comment_id":"244738"}],"poster":"ArizonaClassics"}],"answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"RZUC5sNOuKHtDLBiUF6n","answer":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"DaddyPan","content":"Stupid question","timestamp":"1722064140.0","comment_id":"637887"},{"timestamp":"1716141480.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is similar to an IDS but actually takes action against suspect traffic, whereas an IDS just alerts when it finds anything suspect. A firewall works at the network level and only takes into account IP addresses, ports, and protocols; it does not inspect the traffic for patterns or content. A web application firewall (WAF) works at the application layer and provides additional security via proxying, filtering service requests, or blocking based on additional factors such as the client and requests.","topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","question_text":"Which of the following systems is used to employ a variety of different techniques to discover and alert on threats and potential threats to systems and networks?","isMC":true},{"id":"qgEbWLGQ1RRggk727Jbc","unix_timestamp":1652983140,"topic":"1","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-05-19 19:59:00","question_text":"Which of the following is not a risk management framework?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732046340.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"akg001","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

Destroy\nThe Destroy phase is critical because it involves the secure deletion of data that is no longer needed or beyond the retention period. Regulatory compliance often includes specific requirements for data destruction to ensure that sensitive information is not recoverable and is handled in a way that prevents unauthorized access or breaches. Regularly testing and auditing the Destroy phase ensures that data is being securely and effectively removed in accordance with legal and regulatory standards, thus reducing the risk of non-compliance.","comment_id":"1317436","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Sivath","timestamp":"1732533360.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"You\nIn order to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, which phase of the cloud data lifecycle must be tested regularly?\n\nA.
