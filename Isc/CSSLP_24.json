Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control model. In this model, a user can access resources according to his role in the organization.

This helps limit the potential damage caused by unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information by controlling who has access to it. The principle applies in both physical and digital security contexts, and is often used in conjunction with other access control models such as mandatory or discretionary access control.","poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","comments":[{"poster":"74gjd_37","timestamp":"1727722200.0","content":"The term \"need-to-know\" has been used in various contexts and organizations over the years, but its origins can be traced back to military and intelligence agencies. In these settings, access to sensitive information is restricted based on a person's security clearance level (which relates to their level of authorization) as well as their demonstrated need-to-know that information for their job duties.\n\nSo the idea behind it comes from a historical context related to national security where only individuals with specialized knowledge, experience or authority were given access to certain types of classified information. The use of the term \"need-to-know\" likely arose naturally out of this principle-based practice -- a person should only have access when necessary in order for them carry out specific tasks successfully without endangering national interests. Today, the concept has become more widely applied in various industries beyond just government agencies and defense entities.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1021821","comments":[{"comment_id":"1021824","content":"The terms \"need to know\" and the principle of the \"least privilege\" the are related and often discussed together in access control discussions, but they have distinct origins and applications.\n\nThe principle of least privilege involves granting a user or process only those permissions necessary to perform its intended function, while minimizing additional privileges or access beyond what is required. Conversely, the need-to-know principle refers to controlling who has access to confidential information based on their role and necessity for it in order to protect sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure.\n\nBoth principles aim at reducing risk exposure by limiting unnecessary permissions/accesses within a specific system (such as an operating system) or with respect to information between multiple parties respectively. While they share some similarities in practice, their application has developed independently over time indicating a clear distinction between them when discussing cybersecurity best practices and techniques aimed at enhancing confidentiality/privacy/security.","poster":"74gjd_37","timestamp":"1727722380.0","upvote_count":"1"}]}]}]}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/121962-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-35-discussion/","answer_ET":"permission.

It is a process of repeating Unit testing and Integration testing whenever existing tests need to be performed again along with the new tests. Regression testing is performed to its implementation into the production environment. It is done either by a client or an application specialist to ensure that the software meets the requirement for more units are combined into a component. During integration testing, a developer combines two units that have already been tested into a component, and tests the interface between the two units. Although integration testing can be performed in various ways, the following three approaches are generally used: The top- application is tested separately. During unit testing, a developer takes the smallest unit of an application, isolates it from the rest of the application code, and tests it to determine whether it works as expected. Unit testing is performed before integrating these independent units into modules. The most common approach to unit testing requires drivers and stubs to be written. Drivers and stubs are programs. A driver simulates a calling unit, and a stub simulates a called unit.","topic":"2","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/121963-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-36-discussion/","answer_ET":"ensure that no existing errors reappear, and no new errors are introduced.
