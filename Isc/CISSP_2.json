Fewer incidents of phishing attempts are being reported. For those selecting B, you are mistaken. I understand your logic, you're thinking that employees will report more phishing attemps when they are more away but your approach of looking at it is flawed. When an awareness program is effective, employees will have fewer security incidents. There is a difference between a security event and a security incident. An incident usually means that the phishing event was successful and as such an incident that needs to be contained or mitigated. C. is the correct answer because fewer incidents will be reported because the phishing attempt events will not be successful to become incidents. I hope this makes sense to you. You have to be able to distinguish between a phishing event and a phishing incident. There is a difference between an event and an incident.
