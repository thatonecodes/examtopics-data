Therefore, the correct answer is option A. Remove all active production instances.\n\nDuring maintenance mode, one of the goals is to minimize disruption to the system while necessary updates, patches, or repairs are carried out. The actions listed in the question are typical steps for maintaining system integrity and limiting use during this time. However, the action that is not required as part of entering maintenance mode is to remove all active production instances. This is not typically done because it would mean taking the entire system offline, which is contrary to the intent of keeping the system operational albeit with limited functionality during maintenance. Instead, active production instances usually continue to run, possibly with limited capacity or functionality.","poster":"dbrowndiver","timestamp":"1743438720.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1740488280.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nWhen a system enters maintenance mode, the goal is to ensure that security and monitoring remain active while preventing normal operations.
