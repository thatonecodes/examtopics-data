Cloud providers invest heavily in security infrastructure, compliance, encryption, monitoring, and threat detection, offering cost-effective solutions on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Regulatory: Cloud providers help with compliance frameworks, but regulatory compliance still requires organization-specific policies and legal oversight.\nC. Testing: Cloud environments are great for testing, but security benefits (e.g., DDoS protection, IAM, threat detection) provide greater cost savings compared to running security on-premises.\nD. Development: Cloud platforms enhance development with scalable resources, but security is the area where small companies gain the most significant cost-effectiveness compared to building security in-house.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1300640","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1729447260.0","content":"D.

A small company can leverage the extensive security controls and monitoring provided by a cloud provider, which they would unlikely ever be able to afford on their own. Moving to a cloud would not result in any gains for development and testing because these areas require the same rigor regardless of where deployment and hosting occur. Regulatory compliance in a cloud would not be a gain for an organization because it would likely result in additional oversight and auditing as well as require the organization to adapt to a new environment.","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/69082-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-333-discussion/","topic":"1","question_id":261},{"id":"jnMP7J7Z1JrZ7fjDuXIf","exam_id":184,"question_text":"BCDR strategies typically do not involve the entire operations of an organization, but only those deemed critical to their business.\nWhich concept pertains to the amount of data and services needed to reach the predetermined level of operations?","answer":"C","question_id":262,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (75%)","B (25%)"],"choices":{"A":"SRE","B":"RPO","D":"RTO","C":"RSL"},"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","discussion":[{"content":"RPO for data and RSL percent of services.","timestamp":"1611851280.0","poster":"Sa007788","comment_id":"278690","upvote_count":"7"},{"content":"The answer should be RSL, not RPO","comment_id":"160374","poster":"bark101","timestamp":"1597700580.0","upvote_count":"5"},{"timestamp":"1740330120.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nRecovery Service Level (RSL) refers to the amount of data and services needed to reach a predetermined level of operations after a disaster or disruption.
