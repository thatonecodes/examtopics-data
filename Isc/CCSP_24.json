Elasticity is the characteristic that allows resources to scale up or down quickly based on demand. This dynamic provisioning and deprovisioning of resources means that the environment is continuously shifting, which makes it harder to track changes over time and ensure ongoing compliance.\n\nVirtualization abstracts hardware, but the virtual instances often remain relatively stable once provisioned.\nResource pooling means sharing resources among multiple customers, but it doesn’t necessarily lead to rapid changes in individual system configurations.\nThus, it’s the elastic nature of cloud resources that poses the biggest challenge for auditing over time.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1359667","timestamp":"1740124980.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nVirtualization as it is difficult for the audit trail","comment_id":"1161633","timestamp":"1724842680.0","poster":"cloudenthusiast","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"gayan237","comment_id":"946076","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1704685740.0","content":"so, if its virtualization only on cloud-computing, is that mean you don't have virtualization in on-prem ? resource pooling makes it tough in cloud because it leads to other clients also using the same resource (hardware CPU, RAM, space) as you which makes it tough to audit."},{"timestamp":"1700496900.0","poster":"Pika26","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB: Virtualization","comment_id":"902621","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1653059460.0","poster":"Zeezee2","comment_id":"482730","upvote_count":"4","content":"Virtualization as the creation and destruction of virtualized resources happens all the time so meaningful compliance reporting becomes very difficult, even if you use a baseline for all resources."},{"timestamp":"1632815880.0","poster":"pooppants","comment_id":"322455","upvote_count":"3","content":"wow that is a tough question.

It is extremely unlikely that the exact same virtual machines and images used in a previous audit would still be in use or even available for a later audit, making the tracking of changes over time extremely difficult, or even impossible. Elasticity refers to the ability to add and remove resources from a system or service to meet current demand, and although it plays a factor in making the tracking of virtual machines very difficult over time, it is not the best answer in this case. Resource pooling pertains to a cloud environment sharing a large amount of resources between different customers and services. Portability refers to the ability to move systems or services easily between different cloud providers.","answer":"B","answers_community":["B (67%)","C (33%)"],"timestamp":"2020-07-23 09:09:00","exam_id":184,"choices":{"B":"Virtualization","A":"Portability","C":"Elasticity","D":"Resource pooling"},"isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1595488140},{"id":"dAFjAFS18ecV6AmGj10t","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was enacted in response to major corporate scandals, such as Enron and WorldCom, to ensure greater transparency and accountability in corporate financial reporting and disclosures.

Although this type of attack cannot be used to steal data directly because the attacker has no way of seeing the results of the commands, it does open other ways to compromise an application. Missing function-level access control exists where an application only checks for authorization during the initial login process and does not further validate with each function call. Cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker is able to send untrusted data to a user's browser without going through validation processes. An injection attack is where a malicious actor sends commands or other arbitrary data through input and data fields with the intent of having the application or system execute the code as part of its normal processing and queries.","unix_timestamp":1595488200,"answer":"D","question_text":"Which one of the following threat types to applications and services involves the sending of requests that are invalid and manipulated through a user's client to execute commands on the application under the user's own credentials?","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"timestamp":"2020-07-23 09:10:00","exam_id":184,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/26459-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-204-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"D":"Cross-site request forgery","A":"Injection","B":"Missing function-level access control","C":"Cross-site scripting"},"question_images":[],"answer_images":[]},{"id":"rifSXNkR8JjilufCJQPF","question_id":119,"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"Platform as a Service would allow software developers to quickly and easily deploy their applications among different hosting providers for testing and validation in order to determine the best option.
