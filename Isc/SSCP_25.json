Any synchronization mechanism would update the mirror copy and the data could not be recovered.\nWith backups there could be a large gap where your latest data may not be available. You would have to look at your Recovery Point Objective and see if this is acceptable for your company recovery objectives.\nThe following are incorrect answers:\nMirroring will preserve integrity and restore points in all cases of drive failure. However, if you have corrupted data on the primary set of drives you may get corrupted data on the secondary set as well.\nRemote Journaling provides Continuous or periodic synchronized recording of transaction data at a remote location as a backup strategy. (http:// www.businessdictionary.com/definition/remote-journaling.html) With journaling there might be a gap of time between the data updates being send in batch at regular interval. So some of the data could be lost.\nDatabase shadowing is synonymous with Mirroring but it only applies to databases, but not to information and data as a whole.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nKRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Page 68.","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"Turbowet","comment_id":"1287924","content":"Selected Answer: B\nconcur with B","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727044440.0"},{"comment_id":"1096514","poster":"gabbinu","timestamp":"1702561800.0","content":"Correct answer is C","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1697452560.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDatabase shadowing.\n\nThe purpose of database shadowing is to protect and/or restore lost, corrupted, or deleted information, thereby preserving data integrity and availability.
