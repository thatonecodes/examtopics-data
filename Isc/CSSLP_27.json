C&A consists of four phases in a DITSCAP assessment. These phases are the same as NIACAP phases. The order of these phases is as follows: 1.Definition: The definition phase is focused on understanding the IS business case, the mission, environment, and architecture. This phase determines the security requirements and level of effort necessary to achieve Certification & Accreditation (C&A). 2.Verification: The second phase confirms the evolving or modified system's compliance with the information. The verification phase ensures that the fully integrated system will be ready for certification testing. 3.Validation: The third phase confirms abidance of the fully integrated system with the security policy. This phase follows the requirements slated in the SSAA. The objective of the validation phase is to show the required evidence to support the DAA in accreditation process. 4.Post Accreditation: The Post Accreditation is the final phase of DITSCAP assessment and it starts after the system has been certified and accredited for operations. This phase ensures secure system management, operation, and maintenance to save an acceptable level of residual risk.","answer":"B","timestamp":"2023-10-01 17:45:00"},{"id":"9WFV12lW3Xb1zsgZDjvq","exam_id":188,"answer_images":[],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1696175160,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/122074-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-48-discussion/","answer_ET":"user requirements.

Secure parameter passing methods to protect against buffer overflow or format string vulnerabilities.\n3. Improving code quality by reducing complexity, increasing modularity, and promoting more straightforward design.\n4. The use of security-specific controls like access control lists (ACLs), digital signatures for sensitive data types/critical functions, encryption/decryption algorithms\n5.

They decrease the exploitable flaws and weaknesses.\nC. They decrease the attack surface.\nD. They employ software security constraints, protections, and services.\n\nSecure coding tools help to reduce exploitable flaws and vulnerabilities in code, as well as decreasing the overall attack surface of an application or system by implementing secure software development practices and employing security-specific controls such as input validation mechanisms or access control measures. These tools also commonly include security constraints, protections, and services to prevent attacks or limit their impact on a system's functionality or data integrity.\n\nThey do not decrease the level of type checking and program analysis; rather they typically include more rigorous checks for these elements in order to improve overall code quality and enhance security posture.","poster":"74gjd_37","comment_id":"1022426","timestamp":"1727797680.0","upvote_count":"1"}]},{"id":"l71lyPkxdKlW14QbgBsd","choices":{"D":"Functional test","B":"Performance test","A":"Reliability test","C":"Regression test"},"topic":"2","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer":"B","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/121922-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-5-discussion/","question_id":135,"exam_id":188,"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-30 18:39:00","question_text":"Stella works as a system engineer for BlueWell Inc.

The goal of performance testing is to identify the maximum number of users or transactions that can be supported by the system without compromising its functionality, security, and reliability. It involves simulating real-world scenarios and measuring various system parameters such as response time, throughput rate, CPU usage, memory consumption, network latency/throughput.\n\nThe purpose of performance testing is not only to test whether the application responds correctly but also whether it does so quickly enough under varying loads to meet user expectations and business requirements. This type of testing enables developers and testers to detect any bottlenecks in the system's architecture or code early in development or before deployment into production environments which may cause poor performance on customer end-users thereby causing dissatisfaction with product/services which affects revenue negatively over time."}]}],"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"The various types of internal tests performed on builds are as follows: Regression tests: It is also known as the verification testing.
