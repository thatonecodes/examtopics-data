An XML firewall is a network security device, not something that sits between internal software layers of an application. The CCSP guidance explicitly notes that placing an XML firewall at other points (such as between the presentation and application layers, or between an IPS and the firewall, etc.) “would not serve the intended purpose” of intercepting XML attacks. The proper location is in front of the application server (behind the external firewall), so that all XML traffic can be filtered before it hits the application.
