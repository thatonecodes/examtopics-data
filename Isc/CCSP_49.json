It is configured to perform only essential functions, reducing its attack surface. Bastion hosts are commonly used for secure remote access (e.g., SSH jump servers) or as intermediary systems for accessing internal networks securely.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Firewall → Firewalls control traffic flow and enforce security policies but do not function as publicly exposed operational systems.\nB. Proxy → Proxies act as intermediaries for network requests but are not standalone hardened systems for direct exposure.\nC. Honeypot → A honeypot is a decoy system used to attract and analyze attacks, not a secure public-facing system for legitimate operations."},{"poster":"Sivath","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1732694820.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
