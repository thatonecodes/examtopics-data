One such capability is the ability to restrict printing of documents, which is not possible with traditional security controls alone.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Copy → Traditional file system permissions can restrict copying by setting read-only permissions, but IRM allows more advanced controls like preventing clipboard copying.\nB. Read → Traditional access control mechanisms (e.g., ACLs, file permissions) already manage read access.\nC.
