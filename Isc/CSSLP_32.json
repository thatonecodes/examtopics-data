Incident tracking and reporting\n\nSIEM systems provide centralized logging capabilities where logs from various sources like servers, network devices, applications, endpoints, etc., can be collected and correlated to identify security events or incidents. These incidents are then tracked through their entire lifecycle - from detection to resolution - using incident tracking and reporting features built into the SIEM system.\n\nThis allows organizations to quickly respond to security threats by providing real-time alerts that highlight suspicious activity or anomalies within their IT environment. The information gathered during this process can also be useful for forensic investigations or compliance reporting purposes.\n\nWhile a security knowledge base may contain predefined rulesets or signatures used by SIEM systems to detect known attacks, graphical user interface (GUI) provides ease-of-use display facility whereas asset information storage and correlation includes information about assets such as IP addresses assigned to them along with info about software installed on them.","comment_id":"1022542","upvote_count":"1"}],"question_text":"Which of the following features of SIEM products is used in analysis for identifying potential problems and reviewing all available data that are associated with the problems?","answer_description":"SIEM product has a graphical user interface (GUI) which is used in analysis for identifying potential problems and reviewing all available data that are associated with the problems. A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows people to interact with programs in more ways than typing commands on computers. The term came into existence because the first interactive user interfaces to computers were not graphical; they were text- and- keyboard oriented and usually consisted of commands a user had to remember and computer responses that were infamously brief. A GUI offers graphical icons, and visual indicators, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation to fully represent the information and actions available to a user. The actions are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.","topic":"2","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/122104-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-70-discussion/","timestamp":"2023-10-01 19:27:00","answer_images":[]},{"id":"yjPEVTzDTUWHtsOj8IWH","topic":"2","timestamp":"2023-10-01 19:27:00","choices":{"B":"Cryptography","A":"Cryptographer","C":"Kerberos","D":"Cryptanalysis"},"exam_id":188,"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following is the process of finding weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms and obtaining the plaintext or key from the ciphertext?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/122105-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-71-discussion/","question_id":157,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1022543","timestamp":"1727803620.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

It was a pioneering computer networking program that allowed multiple users to simultaneously access, edit, and share documents in real-time over the ARPANET network.\n\nDARPA NLS consisted of three main components: a text editor, command shell, and document browser. The text editor provided WYSIWYG editing capabilities for creating and formatting documents with embedded hyperlinks. The command shell allowed users to execute various commands such as file management or communication with other users on the network. The document browser provided an interactive user interface for navigating through linked documents.\n\nOne of the key features of DARPA NLS was its use of hypertext markup language (HTML), which later became the standard format for web content.

Vulnerability scanning is a process in which a Penetration Tester uses various tools to assess computers, computer systems, networks or applications for weaknesses. There are a number of types of vulnerability scanners available today, distinguished from one another by a focus on particular targets. While functionality varies between different types of vulnerability scanners, they share a common, core purpose of enumerating the vulnerabilities present in one or more targets. Vulnerability scanners are a core technology component of\nVulnerability management. Port scanning is the first basic step to get the details of open ports on the target system. Port scanning is used to find a hackable server with a hole or vulnerability. A port is a medium of communication between two computers. Every service on a host is identified by a unique 16-bit number called a port. A port scanner is a piece of software designed to search a network host for open ports. This is often used by administrators to check the security of their networks and by hackers to identify running services on a host with the view to compromising it. Port scanning is used to find the open ports, so that it is possible to search exploits related to that service and application. Network scanning is a penetration testing activity in which a penetration tester or an attacker identifies active hosts on a network, either to attack them or to perform security assessment.
