{"pageProps":{"questions":[{"id":"fOXE6uoeezsiSRIfClmo","answer_description":"Auditing, which can be supported to varying degrees by DLP solutions, is not a core component of them. Data loss prevention (DLP) solutions have core components of discovery and classification, enforcement, and monitoring. Discovery and classification are concerned with determining which data should be applied to the DLP policies, and then determining its classification level. Monitoring is concerned with the actual watching of data and how it's used through its various stages. Enforcement is the actual application of policies determined from the discovery stage and then triggered during the monitoring stage.","choices":{"A":"Monitoring","D":"Discovery and classification","C":"Auditing","B":"Enforcement"},"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"518002","timestamp":"1720241820.0","content":"Correct as per page 58 CBK 3rd edition.","poster":"[Removed]","upvote_count":"3"},{"poster":"AWSPro24","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis is a pretty lame question. Most modern DLP does support some auditing so you can see how you are doing against compliance targets. Obviously it can't track false negatives.
