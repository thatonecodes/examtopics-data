This is typically implemented by limiting available menus, data views, encryption, or by physically constraining the user interfaces.\nThis is common on devices such as an automated teller machine (ATM). The advantage of a constrained user interface is that it limits potential avenues of attack and system failure by restricting the processing options that are available to the user.\nOn an ATM machine, if a user does not have a checking account with the bank he or she will not be shown the \"Withdraw money from checking\" option. Likewise, an information system might have an \"Add/Remove Users\" menu option for administrators, but if a normal, non-administrative user logs in he or she will not even see that menu option. By not even identifying potential options for non-qualifying users, the system limits the potentially harmful execution of unauthorized system or application commands.\nMany database management systems have the concept of \"views.\" A database view is an extract of the data stored in the database that is filtered based on predefined user or system criteria. This permits multiple users to access the same database while only having the ability to access data they need (or are allowed to have) and not data for another user. The use of database views is another example of a constrained user interface.\nThe following were incorrect answers:\nAll of the other choices presented were bogus answers.\nThe following reference(s) were used for this question:\nHernandez CISSP, Steven (2012-12-21).

Which seems to indicate there could be two good answers to this question.\nHowever if you read the NISTR document mentioned in the references below, it is also mentioned that: MAC is the most mentioned NDAC policy. So MAC is a form of NDAC policy.\nWithin the same document it is also mentioned: \"In general, all access control policies other than DAC are grouped in the category of non- discretionary access control (NDAC). As the name implies, policies in this category have rules that are not established at the discretion of the user. Non-discretionary policies establish controls that cannot be changed by users, but only through administrative action.\"\nUnder NDAC you have two choices:\nRule Based Access control and Role Base Access Control\nMAC is implemented using RULES which makes it fall under RBAC which is a form of NDAC. It is a subset of NDAC.\nThis question is representative of what you can expect on the real exam where you have more than once choice that seems to be right. However, you have to look closely if one of the choices would be higher level or if one of the choice falls under one of the other choice. In this case NDAC is a better choice because\nMAC is falling under NDAC through the use of Rule Based Access Control.\nThe following are incorrect answers:\n\nMANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL -\nIn Mandatory Access Control the labels of the object and the clearance of the subject determines access rights, not a central authority. Although a central authority (Better known as the Data Owner) assigns the label to the object, the system does the determination of access rights automatically by comparing the\nObject label with the Subject clearance. The subject clearance MUST dominate (be equal or higher) than the object being accessed.\nThe need for a MAC mechanism arises when the security policy of a system dictates that:\n1. Protection decisions must not be decided by the object owner.\n2. The system must enforce the protection decisions (i.e., the system enforces the security policy over the wishes or intentions of the object owner).\nUsually a labeling mechanism and a set of interfaces are used to determine access based on the MAC policy; for example, a user who is running a process at the\nSecret classification should not be allowed to read a file with a label of Top Secret. This is known as the \"simple security rule,\" or \"no read up.\"\nConversely, a user who is running a process with a label of Secret should not be allowed to write to a file with a label of Confidential. This rule is called the \"*- property\" (pronounced \"star property\") or \"no write down.\" The *-property is required to maintain system security in an automated environment.\n\nDISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL -\nIn Discretionary Access Control the rights are determined by many different entities, each of the persons who have created files and they are the owner of that file, not one central authority.\nDAC leaves a certain amount of access control to the discretion of the object's owner or anyone else who is authorized to control the object's access. For example, it is generally used to limit a user's access to a file; it is the owner of the file who controls other users' accesses to the file. Only those users specified by the owner may have some combination of read, write, execute, and other permissions to the file.\nDAC policy tends to be very flexible and is widely used in the commercial and government sectors. However, DAC is known to be inherently weak for two reasons:\nFirst, granting read access is transitive; for example, when Ann grants Bob read access to a file, nothing stops Bob from copying the contents of Anns file to an object that Bob controls. Bob may now grant any other user access to the copy of Anns file without Anns knowledge.\nSecond, DAC policy is vulnerable to Trojan horse attacks. Because programs inherit the identity of the invoking user, Bob may, for example, write a program for\nAnn that, on the surface, performs some useful function, while at the same time destroys the contents of Anns files. When investigating the problem, the audit files would indicate that Ann destroyed her own files. Thus, formally, the drawbacks of DAC are as follows:\nDiscretionary Access Control (DAC) Information can be copied from one object to another; therefore, there is no real assurance on the flow of information in a system.\nNo restrictions apply to the usage of information when the user has received it.\nThe privileges for accessing objects are decided by the owner of the object, rather than through a system-wide policy that reflects the organizations security requirements.\nACLs and owner/group/other access control mechanisms are by far the most common mechanism for implementing DAC policies. Other mechanisms, even though not designed with DAC in mind, may have the capabilities to implement a DAC policy.\n\nRULE BASED ACCESS CONTROL -\nIn Rule-based Access Control a central authority could in fact determine what subjects can have access when assigning the rules for access. However, the rules actually determine the access and so this is not the most correct answer.\nRuBAC (as opposed to RBAC, role-based access control) allow users to access systems and information based on pre determined and configured rules. It is important to note that there is no commonly understood definition or formally defined standard for rule-based access control as there is for DAC, MAC, and RBAC.\n\"Rule-based access\" is a generic term applied to systems that allow some form of organization-defined rules, and therefore rule-based access control encompasses a broad range of systems. RuBAC may in fact be combined with other models, particularly RBAC or DAC. A RuBAC system intercepts every access request and compares the rules with the rights of the user to make an access decision. Most of the rule-based access control relies on a security label system, which dynamically composes a set of rules defined by a security policy. Security labels are attached to all objects, including files, directories, and devices.\nSometime roles to subjects (based on their attributes) are assigned as well. RuBAC meets the business needs as well as the technical needs of controlling service access. It allows business rules to be applied to access controlfor example, customers who have overdue balances may be denied service access. As a mechanism for MAC, rules of RuBAC cannot be changed by users. The rules can be established by any attributes of a system related to the users such as domain, host, protocol, network, or IP addresses. For example, suppose that a user wants to access an object in another network on the other side of a router.\nThe router employs RuBAC with the rule composed by the network addresses, domain, and protocol to decide whether or not the user can be granted access. If employees change their roles within the organization, their existing authentication credentials remain in effect and do not need to be re configured. Using rules in conjunction with roles adds greater flexibility because rules can be applied to people as well as to devices. Rule-based access control can be combined with role- based access control, such that the role of a user is one of the attributes in rule setting. Some provisions of access control systems have rule- based policy engines in addition to a role-based policy engine and certain implemented dynamic policies [Des03]. For example, suppose that two of the primary types of software users are product engineers and quality engineers. Both groups usually have access to the same data, but they have different roles to perform in relation to the data and the application's function. In addition, individuals within each group have different job responsibilities that may be identified using several types of attributes such as developing programs and testing areas. Thus, the access decisions can be made in real time by a scripted policy that regulates the access between the groups of product engineers and quality engineers, and each individual within these groups. Rules can either replace or complement role-based access control. However, the creation of rules and security policies is also a complex process, so each organization will need to strike the appropriate balance.\nReferences used for this question:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/7316/NISTIR-7316.pdf and\nAIO v3 p162-167 and OIG (2007) p.186-191\nalso\nKRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Page 33.","question_images":[],"question_id":60,"timestamp":"2023-11-23 22:20:00"}],"exam":{"numberOfQuestions":161,"id":189,"isBeta":false,"name":"SSCP","provider":"Isc","isMCOnly":true,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":12},"__N_SSP":true}
