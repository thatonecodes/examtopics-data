In this approach, a secret key is generated for symmetric encryption, and public key encryption is used to securely transmit or exchange this secret key. Once the secret key is securely shared, it is used for encrypting and decrypting the actual message, which is much more efficient in terms of computational resources and speed compared to asymmetric encryption for encrypting the entire message.","comment_id":"1053437"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1706572680.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nisnt this B?","poster":"bradseth","comments":[{"content":"Because large quantities of sensitive information must be passed, the use of Asymmetric keys will make the process too slow.

The diskless workstation knows its hardware address, so it broadcasts this information so that a listening server can assign it the correct IP address.\nAs with ARP, Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) frames go to all systems on the subnet, but only the RARP server responds. Once the RARP server receives this request, it looks in its table to see which IP address matches the broadcast hardware address. The server then sends a message that contains its IP address back to the requesting computer. The system now has an IP address and can function on the network.\nThe Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) was created after RARP to enhance the functionality that RARP provides for diskless workstations. The diskless workstation can receive its IP address, the name server address for future name resolutions, and the default gateway address from the BOOTP server. BOOTP usually provides more functionality to diskless workstations than does RARP.\nThe evolution of this protocol has unfolded as follows: RARP evolved into BOOTP, which evolved into DHCP.\nThe following are incorrect answers:\nNAT is a tool that is used for masking true IP addresses by employing internal addresses.\nARP does the opposite of RARP, it finds the MAC address that maps with an existing IP address.\nData Link layer The Data Link layer is not a protocol; it is represented at layer 2 of the OSI model. In the TCP/IP model, the Data Link and Physical layers are combined into the Network Access layer, which is sometimes called the Link layer or the Network Interface layer.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nHarris, Shon (2012-10-25).

The issue is when two nodes want to transmit at the same time. If both channels kick on their random timer for x amount of time. Channel 1 ends up having a smaller wait time because it's randomized and it starts to transmit its frame. Channel 2 is just kicking it waiting and sees the frame come in. Now channel 2 starts to talk, but channel 1 isn't finished so they collide. Now they set the timer again and give it another shot, if they collide again channel 2 waits longer for the next randomized wait time. Now channel 1 gets more freedom to talk, and it will most likely cause yes, another collision until channel 2's timer is so long that channel 1 basically owns that entire path.\n\nThe only way they could have played on words here to make CSMA/CD the victor is if they had used \"ethernet network\" instead of \"wired network\" Token runs on (typically) type 6 or type 3 STP/UTP cable which is used in telephone circuits.","poster":"catastrophie","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1681418520.0"}]}],"poster":"bzpunk","upvote_count":"7","content":"Token ring doesn't make sense as it specifically lists \"multiple nodes.\" The whole point of token ring is that you don't communicate if you don't have the token.\n\nCSMA/CA is for Wi-Fi\nCSMA/CD is for Ethernet\n\nSince it says wired, the only answer that makes sense is CSMA/CD","comment_id":"353185"},{"content":"The mechanism created to overcome the problem of collisions that occur on wired networks when traffic is simultaneously transmitted from different nodes is D.
