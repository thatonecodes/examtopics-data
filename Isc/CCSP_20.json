However, while it improves availability and flexibility, it doesn't directly translate into the cost savings during a disaster recovery scenario.\n\nResource pooling, on the other hand, is about sharing computing resources across many customers and dynamically reallocating them as needed. In the event of a disaster, the provider's ability to quickly reassign pooled resources to affected services can significantly reduce downtime and the costs associated with maintaining redundant infrastructure.
