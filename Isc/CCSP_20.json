However, while it improves availability and flexibility, it doesn't directly translate into the cost savings during a disaster recovery scenario.\n\nResource pooling, on the other hand, is about sharing computing resources across many customers and dynamically reallocating them as needed. In the event of a disaster, the provider's ability to quickly reassign pooled resources to affected services can significantly reduce downtime and the costs associated with maintaining redundant infrastructure. This dynamic and efficient utilization of resources is what typically results in substantial time and cost savings during disaster recovery.","timestamp":"1740063240.0","poster":"MaciekMT"},{"timestamp":"1732309320.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Resource pooling in cloud computing allows multiple customers (tenants) to share a common pool of computing resources (e.g., storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth) dynamically allocated based on demand.\n\nIn the event of a disaster, resource pooling enables organizations to quickly access and scale up resources in the cloud without needing to invest in additional hardware or maintain expensive on-premises infrastructure.
