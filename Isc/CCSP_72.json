With this type of implementation, additional security and architecture concerns come into play because the interaction between the operating system and the hypervisor becomes a critical link. The hypervisor no longer has direct interaction and control over the underlying hardware, which means that some performance will be lost due to the operating system in the middle needing its own resources, patching requirements, and operational oversight.","discussion":[{"comment_id":"679758","content":"Type 2 hypervisors also require a means to share folders, clipboards and other user information between the host and guest OSes. Sharing data increases the risk of hacking and spreading malicious code, so VMs demand a certain level of trust from Type 2 hypervisors.","upvote_count":"3","poster":"JKRowlings","timestamp":"1727355240.0"},{"comment_id":"603376","poster":"akg001","upvote_count":"4","timestamp":"1716050940.0","content":"A.
