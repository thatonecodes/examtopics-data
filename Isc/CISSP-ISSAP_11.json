Using public key infrastructure (PKI) authentication.\nC. Using secret keys for authentication.\n\nThese methods help enhance authentication security and protect against unauthorized interception or manipulation of communication. Basic authentication (option B) is more susceptible to interception and is not as secure as using advanced cryptographic methods like public key infrastructure or secret keys.\n\nOption D (Off-channel verification) is not a standard term in the context of common security measures against man-in-the-middle attacks. The commonly employed methods are public key infrastructure and secret keys.","comment_id":"1126170","upvote_count":"1","poster":"n00r1","timestamp":"1721327340.0"}],"exam_id":186,"answer":"ACD","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/131554-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-62-discussion/","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-01-18 21:29:00","choices":{"A":"Using public key infrastructure authentication.","B":"Using basic authentication.","D":"Using Off-channel verification.","C":"Using Secret keys for authentication."},"answer_images":[]},{"id":"4q1nspF6T4bj8cog3kwe","timestamp":"2022-09-28 17:01:00","exam_id":186,"question_id":52,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/83923-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-66-discussion/","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727535660.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

While steganography is a method of hiding information within other non-secret data (such as embedding information in an image or audio file), it typically does not involve a reversible transformation like a cipher.\n\nSteganography focuses on concealing the existence of information rather than encrypting it. The goal is to hide the fact that there is a secret message, not necessarily to make the message itself unintelligible without the proper key or method.\n\nOn the other hand, ciphers, as mentioned earlier, involve reversible transformations. They take plaintext, apply an encryption algorithm, and produce ciphertext, and this process can be reversed with the appropriate key or algorithm to recover the original plaintext. That's why the correct answer to the question is A. Cipher.","timestamp":"1720743720.0","poster":"byfener","upvote_count":"1"},{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
