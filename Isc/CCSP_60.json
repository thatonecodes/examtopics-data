Although this is a perfectly acceptable best practice in a traditional data center, this reliance is not something that will port to a cloud environment. The failure of an organization to properly understand and adapt to the difference in network controls when moving to a cloud will likely leave an application with security holes and vulnerabilities. The use of a remote key management system, monitoring, or certain programming languages would not constitute insufficient due diligence by itself.","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

Portability is the biggest challenge to using DLP to protect data at rest in a cloud computing environment. DLP, or data loss prevention, is a security technology that is designed to prevent sensitive data from being accidentally or intentionally leaked or accessed by unauthorized users. However, one of the key features of cloud computing is portability, which allows organizations to move their data and applications between different cloud environments and even between on-premises systems and the cloud. This makes it difficult for DLP systems to effectively protect data at rest in the cloud, as the data may be constantly moving between different locations and systems. To address this challenge, organizations can use a combination of DLP technologies, data encryption, and other security measures to protect their data in the cloud.","timestamp":"1717949160.0","poster":"DA95","comment_id":"740328","upvote_count":"5"},{"comment_id":"1360932","poster":"MaciekMT","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nResource pooling presents the biggest challenge to Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for data at rest in cloud environments because multiple customers share the same underlying physical infrastructure (e.g., storage, compute, and network resources). This makes it difficult to apply traditional DLP techniques, as organizations often lack direct control over where and how their data is physically stored.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Portability → Affects the ability to move data between providers but does not directly impact DLP for data at rest.\nC.
