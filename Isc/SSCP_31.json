IPSec will generate an integrity check value (ICV), which is really the same thing as a MAC value, over a portion of the packet. Remember that the sender and receiver generate their own values. In IPSec, it is called an ICV value. The receiver compares her ICV value with the one sent by the sender. If the values match, the receiver can be assured the packet has not been modified during transmission. If the values are different, the packet has been altered and the receiver discards the packet.\nThe AH protocol calculates this ICV over the data payload, transport, and network headers. If the packet then goes through a NAT device, the NAT device changes the IP address of the packet. That is its job. This means a portion of the data (network header) that was included to calculate the ICV value has now changed, and the receiver will generate an ICV value that is different from the one sent with the packet, which means the packet will be discarded automatically.\nThe ESP protocol follows similar steps, except it does not include the network header portion when calculating its ICV value. When the NAT device changes the IP address, it will not affect the receivers ICV value because it does not include the network header when calculating the ICV.\nHere is a tutorial on IPSEC from the Shon Harris Blog:\nThe Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) protocol suite provides a method of setting up a secure channel for protected data exchange between two devices. The devices that share this secure channel can be two servers, two routers, a workstation and a server, or two gateways between different networks. IPSec is a widely accepted standard for providing network layer protection. It can be more flexible and less expensive than end-to end and link encryption methods.\nIPSec has strong encryption and authentication methods, and although it can be used to enable tunneled communication between two computers, it is usually employed to establish virtual private networks (VPNs) among networks across the Internet.\nIPSec is not a strict protocol that dictates the type of algorithm, keys, and authentication method to use. Rather, it is an open, modular framework that provides a lot of flexibility for companies when they choose to use this type of technology. IPSec uses two basic security protocols: Authentication Header (AH) and\nEncapsulating Security Payload (ESP). AH is the authenticating protocol, and ESP is an authenticating and encrypting protocol that uses cryptographic mechanisms to provide source authentication, confidentiality, and message integrity.\nIPSec can work in one of two modes: transport mode, in which the payload of the message is protected, and tunnel mode, in which the payload and the routing and header information are protected. ESP in transport mode encrypts the actual message information so it cannot be sniffed and uncovered by an unauthorized entity. Tunnel mode provides a higher level of protection by also protecting the header and trailer data an attacker may find useful. Figure 8-26 shows the high- level view of the steps of setting up an IPSec connection.\nEach device will have at least one security association (SA) for each VPN it uses. The SA, which is critical to the IPSec architecture, is a record of the configurations the device needs to support an IPSec connection. When two devices complete their handshaking process, which means they have agreed upon a long list of parameters they will use to communicate, these data must be recorded and stored somewhere, which is in the SA.\nThe SA can contain the authentication and encryption keys, the agreed-upon algorithms, the key lifetime, and the source IP address. When a device receives a packet via the IPSec protocol, it is the SA that tells the device what to do with the packet. So if device B receives a packet from device C via IPSec, device B will look to the corresponding SA to tell it how to decrypt the packet, how to properly authenticate the source of the packet, which key to use, and how to reply to the message if necessary.\nSAs are directional, so a device will have one SA for outbound traffic and a different SA for inbound traffic for each individual communication channel. If a device is connecting to three devices, it will have at least six SAs, one for each inbound and outbound connection per remote device. So how can a device keep all of these\nSAs organized and ensure that the right SA is invoked for the right connection? With the mighty secu rity parameter index (SPI), thats how. Each device has an\nSPI that keeps track of the different SAs and tells the device which one is appropriate to invoke for the different packets it receives. The SPI value is in the header of an IPSec packet, and the device reads this value to tell it which SA to consult.\nIPSec can authenticate the sending devices of the packet by using MAC (covered in the earlier section, \"The One-Way Hash\"). The ESP protocol can provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality if the devices are configured for this type of functionality.\nSo if a company just needs to make sure it knows the source of the sender and must be assured of the integrity of the packets, it would choose to use AH. If the company would like to use these services and also have confidentiality, it would use the ESP protocol because it provides encryption functionality. In most cases, the reason ESP is employed is because the company must set up a secure VPN connection.\nIt may seem odd to have two different protocols that provide overlapping functionality. AH provides authentication and integrity, and ESP can provide those two functions and confidentiality. Why even bother with AH then? In most cases, the reason has to do with whether the environment is using network address translation (NAT). IPSec will generate an integrity check value (ICV), which is really the same thing as a MAC value, over a portion of the packet. Remember that the sender and receiver generate their own values. In IPSec, it is called an ICV value. The receiver compares her ICV value with the one sent by the sender. If the values match, the receiver can be assured the packet has not been modified during transmission. If the values are different, the packet has been altered and the receiver discards the packet.\nThe AH protocol calculates this ICV over the data payload, transport, and network headers. If the packet then goes through a NAT device, the NAT device changes the IP address of the packet. That is its job. This means a portion of the data (network header) that was included to calculate the ICV value has now changed, and the receiver will generate an ICV value that is different from the one sent with the packet, which means the packet will be discarded automatically.\nThe ESP protocol follows similar steps, except it does not include the network header portion when calculating its ICV value. When the NAT device changes the IP address, it will not affect the receivers ICV value because it does not include the network header when calculating the ICV.\nBecause IPSec is a framework, it does not dictate which hashing and encryption algorithms are to be used or how keys are to be exchanged between devices.\nKey management can be handled manually or automated by a key management protocol. The de facto standard for IPSec is to use Internet Key Exchange (IKE), which is a combination of the ISAKMP and OAKLEY protocols. The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) is a key exchange architecture that is independent of the type of keying mechanisms used. Basically, ISAKMP provides the framework of what can be negotiated to set up an IPSec connection (algorithms, protocols, modes, keys). The OAKLEY protocol is the one that carries out the negotiation process. You can think of ISAKMP as providing the playing field (the infrastructure) and OAKLEY as the guy running up and down the playing field (carrying out the steps of the negotiation).\nIPSec is very complex with all of its components and possible configurations. This complexity is what provides for a great degree of flexibility, because a company has many different configuration choices to achieve just the right level of protection.

The network layer does not provide reliability. It only privides the best route to get the traffic to the final destination address.\nFor your exam you should know the information below about OSI model:\nThe Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers. The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the International Organization for Standardization\n(ISO), maintained by the identification ISO/IEC 7498-1.\nThe model groups communication functions into seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of that path. Two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal.\n\nOSI Model -\n\nImage source: http://www.petri.co.il/images/osi_model.JPG\n\nPHYSICAL LAYER -\nThe physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model, is concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium.\nIt describes the electrical/optical, mechanical, and functional interfaces to the physical medium, and carries the signals for all of the higher layers. It provides:\nData encoding: modifies the simple digital signal pattern (1s and 0s) used by the PC to better accommodate the characteristics of the physical medium, and to aid in bit and frame synchronization. It determines:\nWhat signal state represents a binary 1\nHow the receiving station knows when a \"bit-time\" starts\nHow the receiving station delimits a frame\n\n\nDATA LINK LAYER -\nThe data link layer provides error-free transfer of data frames from one node to another over the physical layer, allowing layers above it to assume virtually error- free transmission over the link. To do this, the data link layer provides:\nLink establishment and termination: establishes and terminates the logical link between two nodes.\nFrame traffic control: tells the transmitting node to \"back-off\" when no frame buffers are available.\nFrame sequencing: transmits/receives frames sequentially.\nFrame acknowledgment: provides/expects frame acknowledgments. Detects and recovers from errors that occur in the physical layer by retransmitting non- acknowledged frames and handling duplicate frame receipt.\nFrame delimiting: creates and recognizes frame boundaries.\nFrame error checking: checks received frames for integrity.\nMedia access management: determines when the node \"has the right\" to use the physical medium.\n\nNETWORK LAYER -\nThe network layer controls the operation of the subnet, deciding which physical path the data should take based on network conditions, priority of service, and other factors. It provides:\nRouting: routes frames among networks.\nSubnet traffic control: routers (network layer intermediate systems) can instruct a sending station to \"throttle back\" its frame transmission when the router's buffer fills up.\nFrame fragmentation: if it determines that a downstream router's maximum transmission unit (MTU) size is less than the frame size, a router can fragment a frame for transmission and re-assembly at the destination station.\nLogical-physical address mapping: translates logical addresses, or names, into physical addresses.\nSubnet usage accounting: has accounting functions to keep track of frames forwarded by subnet intermediate systems, to produce billing information.\n\nCommunications Subnet -\nThe network layer software must build headers so that the network layer software residing in the subnet intermediate systems can recognize them and use them to route data to the destination address.\nThis layer relieves the upper layers of the need to know anything about the data transmission and intermediate switching technologies used to connect systems. It establishes, maintains and terminates connections across the intervening communications facility (one or several intermediate systems in the communication subnet).\nIn the network layer and the layers below, peer protocols exist between a node and its immediate neighbor, but the neighbor may be a node through which data is routed, not the destination station. The source and destination stations may be separated by many intermediate systems.\n\nTRANSPORT LAYER -\nThe transport layer ensures that messages are delivered error-free, in sequence, and with no losses or duplications. It relieves the higher layer protocols from any concern with the transfer of data between them and their peers.\nThe size and complexity of a transport protocol depends on the type of service it can get from the network layer. For a reliable network layer with virtual circuit capability, a minimal transport layer is required. If the network layer is unreliable and/or only supports datagrams, the transport protocol should include extensive error detection and recovery.\nThe transport layer provides:\nMessage segmentation: accepts a message from the (session) layer above it, splits the message into smaller units (if not already small enough), and passes the smaller units down to the network layer. The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.\nMessage acknowledgment: provides reliable end-to-end message delivery with acknowledgments.\nMessage traffic control: tells the transmitting station to \"back-off\" when no message buffers are available.\nSession multiplexing: multiplexes several message streams, or sessions onto one logical link and keeps track of which messages belong to which sessions\n(see session layer).\nTypically, the transport layer can accept relatively large messages, but there are strict message size limits imposed by the network (or lower) layer. Consequently, the transport layer must break up the messages into smaller units, or frames, prepending a header to each frame.\nThe transport layer header information must then include control information, such as message start and message end flags, to enable the transport layer on the other end to recognize message boundaries. In addition, if the lower layers do not maintain sequence, the transport header must contain sequence information to enable the transport layer on the receiving end to get the pieces back together in the right order before handing the received message up to the layer above.\n\nEnd-to-end layers -\nUnlike the lower \"subnet\" layers whose protocol is between immediately adjacent nodes, the transport layer and the layers above are true \"source to destination\" or end-to-end layers, and are not concerned with the details of the underlying communications facility. Transport layer software (and software above it) on the source station carries on a conversation with similar software on the destination station by using message headers and control messages.\n\nSESSION LAYER -\nThe session layer allows session establishment between processes running on different stations. It provides:\nSession establishment, maintenance and termination: allows two application processes on different machines to establish, use and terminate a connection, called a session.\nSession support: performs the functions that allow these processes to communicate over the network, performing security, name recognition, logging, and so on.\n\nPRESENTATION LAYER -\nThe presentation layer formats the data to be presented to the application layer. It can be viewed as the translator for the network. This layer may translate data from a format used by the application layer into a common format at the sending station, then translate the common format to a format known to the application layer at the receiving station.\nThe presentation layer provides:\nCharacter code translation: for example, ASCII to EBCDIC.\nData conversion: bit order, CR-CR/LF, integer-floating point, and so on.\nData compression: reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.\nData encryption: encrypt data for security purposes. For example, password encryption.\n\nAPPLICATION LAYER -\nThe application layer serves as the window for users and application processes to access network services. This layer contains a variety of commonly needed functions:\nResource sharing and device redirection\n\nRemote file access -\n\nRemote printer access -\n\nInter-process communication -\n\nNetwork management -\n\nDirectory services -\nElectronic messaging (such as mail)\n\nNetwork virtual terminals -\nThe following were incorrect answers:\nApplication Layer - The application layer serves as the window for users and application processes to access network services.\nNetwork layer - The network layer controls the operation of the subnet, deciding which physical path the data should take based on network conditions, priority of service, and other factors.\nPhysical Layer - The physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model, is concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium.
