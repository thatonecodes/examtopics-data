It ensures that computing resources (CPU, memory, storage, and networking) are distributed efficiently based on workload demands.\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA. Dynamic clustering → Clustering refers to grouping multiple servers or nodes together for high availability and failover, but it does not actively balance resources in real time.\nB. Dynamic balancing → Not a widely recognized term in cloud computing; resource balancing is part of dynamic optimization.\nC. Dynamic resource scheduling → While similar, scheduling focuses on pre-allocating resources for workloads rather than real-time optimization.","comment_id":"1364041","timestamp":"1740934020.0","poster":"MaciekMT","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1297881","poster":"sweetykaur","content":"Dynamic resource scheduling.
