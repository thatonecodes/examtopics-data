This is a cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without requiring decryption. It has three types, depending on how the encryption approach is designed: partially homomorphic encryption (PHE), somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). FHE is the type emerging as a solution provided by large service providers and is the target of intense continuous research that currently focuses on using FHE to enable safe big data machine learning. Homomorphic encryption is far from mainstream due to performance challenges, requiring more processing power than most organizations can afford or manage.","timestamp":"1728128100.0","poster":"a_vi","comment_id":"1189892","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"akg001","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"605498","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
