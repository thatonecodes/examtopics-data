The process involves an active analysis of the system for any potential vulnerabilities that may result from poor or improper system configuration, known and/or unknown hardware or software flaws, or operational weaknesses in process or technical countermeasures. This analysis is carried out from the position of a potential attacker, and can involve active exploitation of security vulnerabilities. Any security issues that are found will be presented to the system owner together with an assessment of their impact and often with a proposal for mitigation or a technical solution. The intent of a penetration testing is to determine feasibility of an attack and the amount of business impact of a successful exploit, if discovered.

It monitors and inspects incoming and outgoing traffic across the entire network, looking for signs of unauthorized access, malware infections, data leakage attempts or other suspicious behavior from potential attackers.\n\nIn contrast, host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) operate by monitoring activities occurring within individual computing devices themselves at an operating system level rather than analyzing external traffic flowing into those devices over a network like NIDS does. This approach enables HIDs to track more granular details such as user login attempts or file changes made within specific contexts( like signatures of known viruses), making them useful in detecting threats originating internally within organizational infrastructures.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"74gjd_37","timestamp":"1727804580.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
