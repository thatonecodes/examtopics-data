Social engineering attack\n\n\nThe type of attack that can be used to break the best physical and logical security mechanism to gain access to a system is a social engineering attack. This type of attack involves manipulating individuals into divulging sensitive information or gaining unauthorized access by exploiting human vulnerabilities rather than technical vulnerabilities.","poster":"74gjd_37","comment_id":"1051013","upvote_count":"1"}],"unix_timestamp":1698003540,"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124380-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-14-discussion/","exam_id":186,"answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"gCklKH9lJhsG2OuDKSoR","answer_ET":"C","isMC":true,"topic":"1","choices":{"A":"Not using laptops.","D":"A sign in log.","B":"Keeping all doors locked with a guard.","C":"Using a man-trap."},"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729626000.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1051014","content":"Selected Answer: C\nFrom an ISC2 CISS-ISSAP perspective, the most effective measure to prevent a similar breach in the scenario described would be option C - Using a man-trap.\n\nA man-trap is a physical security measure that consists of two interlocking doors or gates. It allows only one person at a time into a restricted area, ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot enter. In this case, if the laptop thief had encountered a man-trap at the exit, it would have prevented them from leaving with the stolen laptop.","poster":"74gjd_37","comments":[{"poster":"74gjd_37","content":"Option A - Not using laptops may not be feasible as laptops are often necessary for productivity and mobility purposes.\n\nOption B - Keeping all doors locked with a guard could help increase physical security; however, it may still allow unauthorized individuals to gain access if they manage to get past or distract the guard.\n\nOption D - A sign-in log alone does not provide any physical deterrent or preventive measures. Although it can assist with identifying who was present during certain incidents, it would not actively prevent someone from stealing equipment like in this scenario.","timestamp":"1729626000.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1051015"}]}],"question_id":7,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"exam_id":186,"timestamp":"2023-10-22 21:40:00","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1698003600,"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124381-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-15-discussion/","question_text":"You are the Security Consultant advising a company on security methods.

Fully meshed topology\n\nA partially meshed topology involves connecting some, but not all, nodes in the network to each other. While this can be a valid choice in certain scenarios, it may not provide the best balance for regional topologies in terms of redundancy and performance.\n\nIn a partially meshed topology, there may be some nodes that are not directly connected to each other, leading to a lower level of redundancy compared to a fully meshed topology. Redundancy is crucial for network resilience, and a partially meshed topology might not offer as many alternate paths in case of link failures.\n\nFor a WAN network where the goal is to achieve a balance between the number of virtual circuits, redundancy, and performance, a fully meshed topology is often preferred because it maximizes redundancy and allows for efficient communication between nodes.\n\nIn summary, while a partially meshed topology might be suitable in certain situations, a fully meshed topology is typically more aligned with the requirements stated in the question.","poster":"byfener","comment_id":"1120400"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIn terms of achieving a balance in the number of virtual circuits between regional topologies, a partially meshed topology could be a valid choice.\n\nA partially meshed topology involves selectively connecting certain sites with direct links while allowing others to connect through intermediate nodes or hubs. This approach provides flexibility in designing the network based on requirements such as traffic patterns or site importance.\n\nBy choosing specific connections strategically, you can control the number of virtual circuits established within each regional topology. This flexibility enables you to optimize resources and manage costs efficiently. It also allows for easier scalability since new connections can be added as needed without having to establish direct links for all locations.\n\nTherefore, if your primary consideration is achieving balance in terms of the number of virtual circuits among regional topologies, selecting Option D - Partially Meshed Topology would indeed be appropriate.","comment_id":"1051021","poster":"74gjd_37","timestamp":"1713815220.0"},{"comment_id":"677987","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
