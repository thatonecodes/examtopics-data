As the name implies, policies in this category have rules that are not established at the discretion of the user. Non-discretionary policies establish controls that cannot be changed by users, but only through administrative action.\nBoth Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Rule Based Access Control (RuBAC) fall within Non Discretionary Access Control (NDAC). If it is not DAC or MAC then it is most likely NDAC.\n\nIT IS NOT ALWAYS BLACK OR WHITE -\nThe different access control models are not totally exclusive of each others. MAC is making use of Rules to be implemented. However with MAC you have requirements above and beyond having simple access rules. The subject would get formal approval from management, the subject must have the proper security clearance, objects must have labels/sensitivity levels attached to them, subjects must have the proper security clearance. If all of this is in place then you have\nMAC.\nBELOW YOU HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES:\n\nMAC = Mandatory Access Control -\nUnder a mandatory access control environment, the system or security administrator will define what permissions subjects have on objects. The administrator does not dictate users access but simply configure the proper level of access as dictated by the Data Owner.\nThe MAC system will look at the Security Clearance of the subject and compare it with the object sensitivity level or classification level. This is what is called the dominance relationship.\nThe subject must DOMINATE the object sensitivity level. Which means that the subject must have a security clearance equal or higher than the object he is attempting to access.\nMAC also introduce the concept of labels. Every objects will have a label attached to them indicating the classification of the object as well as categories that are used to impose the need to know (NTK) principle. Even thou a user has a security clearance of Secret it does not mean he would be able to access any Secret documents within the system. He would be allowed to access only Secret document for which he has a Need To Know, formal approval, and object where the user belong to one of the categories attached to the object.\nIf there is no clearance and no labels then IT IS NOT Mandatory Access Control.\nMany of the other models can mimic MAC but none of them have labels and a dominance relationship so they are NOT in the MAC category.\nNISTR-7316 Says:\nUsually a labeling mechanism and a set of interfaces are used to determine access based on the MAC policy; for example, a user who is running a process at the\nSecret classification should not be allowed to read a file with a label of Top Secret. This is known as the \"simple security rule,\" or \"no read up.\" Conversely, a user who is running a process with a label of Secret should not be allowed to write to a file with a label of Confidential. This rule is called the \"*-property\" (pronounced\n\"star property\") or \"no write down.\" The *-property is required to maintain system security in an automated environment. A variation on this rule called the \"strict *- property\" requires that information can be written at, but not above, the subject’s clearance level. Multilevel security models such as the Bell-La Padula\nConfidentiality and Biba Integrity models are used to formally specify this kind of MAC policy.\nDAC = Discretionary Access Control\nDAC is also known as: Identity Based access control system.\nThe owner of an object is define as the person who created the object. As such the owner has the discretion to grant access to other users on the network.\nAccess will be granted based solely on the identity of those users.\nSuch system is good for low level of security. One of the major problem is the fact that a user who has access to someone's else file can further share the file with other users without the knowledge or permission of the owner of the file. Very quickly this could become the wild wild west as there is no control on the dissimination of the information.\nRBAC = Role Based Access Control\nRBAC is a form of Non-Discretionary access control.\nRole Based access control usually maps directly with the different types of jobs performed by employees within a company.\nFor example there might be 5 security administrator within your company. Instead of creating each of their profile one by one, you would simply create a role and assign the administrators to the role. Once an administrator has been assigned to a role, he will IMPLICITLY inherit the permissions of that role.\nRBAC is great tool for environment where there is a a large rotation of employees on a daily basis such as a very large help desk for example.\nRBAC or RuBAC = Rule Based Access Control\nRuBAC is a form of Non-Discretionary access control.\nA good example of a Rule Based access control device would be a Firewall. A single set of rules is imposed to all users attempting to connect through the firewall.\nNOTE FROM CLEMENT:\nLot of people tend to confuse MAC and Rule Based Access Control.\nMandatory Access Control must make use of LABELS. If there is only rules and no label, it cannot be Mandatory Access Control. This is why they call it Non\nDiscretionary Access control (NDAC).\nThere are even books out there that are WRONG on this subject. Books are sometimes opiniated and not strictly based on facts.\nIn MAC subjects must have clearance to access sensitive objects. Objects have labels that contain the classification to indicate the sensitivity of the object and the label also has categories to enforce the need to know.\nToday the best example of rule based access control would be a firewall. All rules are imposed globally to any user attempting to connect through the device.\nThis is NOT the case with MAC.\nI strongly recommend you read carefully the following document:\nNISTIR-7316 at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/7316/NISTIR-7316.pdf\nIt is one of the best Access Control Study document to prepare for the exam. Usually I tell people not to worry about the hundreds of NIST documents and other reference. This document is an exception. Take some time to read it.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nKRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Page 33. and\nNISTIR-7316 at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/7316/NISTIR-7316.pdf and\nConrad, Eric; Misenar, Seth; Feldman, Joshua (2012-09-01).

RABC being a subset of\nNDAC, it was easy to eliminate RBAC as it was covered under NDAC already.\nSome people think that RBAC is synonymous with NDAC but RuBAC would also fall into this category.\nDiscretionary Access control is for environment with very low level of security. There is no control on the dissemination of the information. A user who has access to a file can copy the file or further share it with other users.\nRule Based Access Control is when you have ONE set of rules applied uniformly to all users. A good example would be a firewall at the edge of your network. A single rule based is applied against any packets received from the internet.\nMandatory Access Control is a very rigid type of access control. The subject must dominate the object and the subject must have a Need To Know to access the information. Objects have labels that indicate the sensitivity (classification) and there is also categories to enforce the Need To Know (NTK).\nSource: KRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Page 33.","choices":{"A":"Mandatory Access Control","C":"Non-Discretionary Access Control","B":"Discretionary Access Control","D":"Rule-based Access control"},"topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"fa8df4c","content":"I think the key word in this question is \"Role\" which would be more appropriate for NDAC.","comment_id":"1113095","timestamp":"1720030800.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"nanson","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1078050","content":"The access control type that involves a central authority determining access based on roles or an organizational security policy is:\n\nA.
