Key fobs \n\nKey fobs are small devices that generate one-time passwords (OTPs) at regular intervals, typically synchronized with server-side systems. Users enter these OTPs along with their existing credentials during authentication. Key fobs act as token-based authenticators, providing an extra layer of security beyond traditional login details.\n\nIn the context of the scenario where Trade Well Inc. wants users to provide a third key apart from ID and password to access their website, key fobs can serve this purpose effectively by requiring users to have possession of both their credentials and the physical key fob device.","comment_id":"1051229","timestamp":"1729640460.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"74gjd_37"}],"isMC":true},{"id":"9PNeTmZ1hE7xLeUCakpL","answer_description":"","choices":{"A":"The transport layer","C":"The session layer","D":"The application layer","B":"The presentation layer"},"answer_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124417-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-58-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2023-10-23 01:47:00","answer":"A","discussion":[{"poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1051239","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA: The transport layer","timestamp":"1729640820.0"}],"isMC":true,"question_images":[],"question_id":48,"question_text":"Which of the following layers of the OSI model corresponds to the Host-to-Host layer of the TCP/IP model?","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"exam_id":186,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1698018420},{"id":"jIwfT7yNdGN5j2z2kJ49","answer_ET":"D","answer_description":"","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":186,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.
