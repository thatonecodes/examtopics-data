The transition from one state to another state is defined by transition functions.\nA system state is defined to be \"secure\" if the only permitted access modes of subjects to objects are in accordance with a security policy.\nTo determine whether a specific access mode is allowed, the clearance of a subject is compared to the classification of the object (more precisely, to the combination of classification and set of compartments, making up the security level) to determine if the subject is authorized for the specific access mode.\nThe clearance/classification scheme is expressed in terms of a lattice. The model defines two mandatory access control (MAC) rules and one discretionary access control (DAC) rule with three security properties:\nThe Simple Security Property - a subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level (no read-up).\nThe property (read \"star\"-property) - a subject at a given security level must not write to any object at a lower security level (no write-down). The property is also known as the Confinement property.\nThe Discretionary Security Property - use an access control matrix to specify the discretionary access control.\nThe transfer of information from a high-sensitivity document to a lower-sensitivity document may happen in the Bell-LaPadula model via the concept of trusted subjects. Trusted Subjects are not restricted by the property. Untrusted subjects are.\nTrusted Subjects must be shown to be trustworthy with regard to the security policy. This security model is directed toward access control and is characterized by the phrase: \"no read up, no write down.\" Compare the Biba model, the Clark-Wilson model and the Chinese Wall.\nWith Bell-LaPadula, users can create content only at or above their own security level (i.e. secret researchers can create secret or top-secret files but may not create public files; no write-down). Conversely, users can view content only at or below their own security level (i.e. secret researchers can view public or secret files, but may not view top-secret files; no read-up).\n\nStrong Property -\nThe Strong Property is an alternative to the Property in which subjects may write to objects with only a matching security level. Thus, the write-up operation permitted in the usual Property is not present, only a write-to-same level operation. The Strong Property is usually discussed in the context of multilevel database management systems and is motivated by integrity concerns.\n\nTranquility principle -\nThe tranquility principle of the Bell-LaPadula model states that the classification of a subject or object does not change while it is being referenced. There are two forms to the tranquility principle: the \"principle of strong tranquility\" states that security levels do not change during the normal operation of the system and the\n\"principle of weak tranquility\" states that security levels do not change in a way that violates the rules of a given security policy.\nAnother interpretation of the tranquility principles is that they both apply only to the period of time during which an operation involving an object or subject is occurring. That is, the strong tranquility principle means that an object's security level/label will not change during an operation (such as read or write); the weak tranquility principle means that an object's security level/label may change in a way that does not violate the security policy during an operation.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biba_Model\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark-Wilson_model\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewer_and_Nash_model","exam_id":189,"answer":"B"}],"exam":{"isBeta":false,"isMCOnly":true,"name":"SSCP","isImplemented":true,"provider":"Isc","lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","id":189,"numberOfQuestions":161},"currentPage":7},"__N_SSP":true}
