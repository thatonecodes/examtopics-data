Elasticity. Elasticity is a key concept in cloud computing that refers to the ability of a cloud service to scale up or down in response to changes in demand. This is particularly important for organizations that are considering using cloud services for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) planning and solutions, as it allows them to quickly and easily increase or decrease their use of cloud resources as needed to support their business operations. Elasticity is typically achieved through the use of automation and other technologies that enable cloud services to automatically scale up or down in response to changes in demand.
