Key value: In an object storage system, each object is stored with a unique identifier, known as a key. This key-value pairing allows for the storage and retrieval of objects based on their unique key.\n\nD. Tree structure: A tree structure is typically used in hierarchical file systems and directories, not in object storage systems. Object storage is flat, meaning there isn't a hierarchy of folders and subfolders.\n\nIn the context of object storage systems, objects themselves are typically stored in a flat namespace without inherent hierarchical organization. Here's why:\n\n Unlike traditional file systems that use a hierarchical directory structure (tree structure), object storage systems do not impose directories or folders on objects.\n\nAre designed to scale horizontally across multiple storage nodes. A flat namespace simplifies the management and distribution of objects across these nodes, allowing for efficient scaling and access.\n\n Objects in object storage systems often include metadata (attributes or tags) that describe the object's characteristics or usage. Metadata provides flexibility and additional context without the need for hierarchical organization.","poster":"TheFivePips","comment_id":"1233632","timestamp":"1718889840.0"},{"poster":"rodlee","timestamp":"1691144880.0","content":"FALSEEEEE its D and bnot A","comment_id":"972010","upvote_count":"1"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Key value is the correct answer","timestamp":"1689259620.0","comment_id":"950765","poster":"nelombg"},{"content":"Key-value","timestamp":"1685098440.0","poster":"nelombg","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"907289"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Pika26","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
