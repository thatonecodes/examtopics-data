This means that if an applet is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the JVM or in the operating system itself, it could potentially gain access to sensitive information or perform malicious actions on the user's machine without any limitations. Option A is not correct as SSL and S-HTTP are not related to Java applets. Option C is not specific to Java applets and applies to any executable downloaded from the internet.

Java does not check the bytecode at runtime or provide other safety mechanisms for program isolation from the client system.\n\nJava applets can pose a security threat because they run in a controlled environment known as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is supposed to provide a sandboxed and secure execution environment. However, if there are vulnerabilities in the JVM or if the Java applet contains malicious code, it can potentially break out of the sandbox and interact with the client system in harmful ways.

Because those two activities are a part of testing and testing is a part of the acceptance phase, the only answer above that can be correct is \"acceptance phase\".\nThe other answers are not correct because:\nThe \"project initiation and planning phase\" is just the idea phase. Nothing has been developed yet to be evaluated, tested, accredited, etc.\nThe \"system design specification phase\" is essentially where the initiation and planning phase is fleshed out. For example, in the initiation and planning phase, we might decide we want the system to have authentication. In the design specification phase, we decide that that authentication will be accomplished via username/ password. But there is still nothing actually developed at this point to evaluate or accredit.\nThe \"development & documentation phase\" is where the system is created and documented. Part of the documentation includes specific evaluation and accreditation criteria. That is the criteria that will be used to evaluate and accredit the system during the \"acceptance phase\".\nIn other words - you cannot evaluate or accredit a system that has not been created yet. Of the four answers listed, only the acceptance phase is dealing with an existing system. The others deal with planning and creating the system, but the actual system isn't there yet.\nReference:\nOfficial ISC2 Guide Page: 558 - 559\nAll in One Third Edition page: 832 - 833 (recommended reading)","choices":{"D":"acceptance phase","B":"system design specification phase","A":"project initiation and planning phase","C":"development & documentation phase"}},{"id":"C7iLSL3dafdFKSVjYeGw","choices":{"B":"system design specifications phase","D":"in parallel with every phase throughout the project D","C":"development and documentation phase","A":"project initiation and planning phase"},"question_id":90,"timestamp":"2022-03-28 00:08:00","answer_ET":"D","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"576459","content":"Selected Answer: D\nIs the answer option D ?","upvote_count":"5","poster":"JoseIRONMAN","timestamp":"1679954880.0"},{"comment_id":"992887","content":"Selected Answer: D\nInformation security should ideally be integrated into every phase of the system development life cycle (SDLC) to provide maximum benefit to the organization.
