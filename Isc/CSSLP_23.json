It emphasizes on creating the scope and the additional elements required to define the parameters of the plan. The scope and plan initiation phase embodies a check of the company's operations and support services. The scope activities include creating a detailed account of the work required, used to facilitate business units to understand the impact of a disruptive event. This phase includes the execution of a vulnerability assessment. This process makes out the mission-critical areas and business processes that are important for the survival of business. It is similar to the risk assessment process. The function of a business impact assessment process is to create a document, which is used to help and understand what impact a disruptive event would have on senior management signoff, and implementing a maintenance procedure for updating the plan as required.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/121945-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-27-discussion/","answer_images":[],"question_id":111,"answers_community":["D (50%)","A (50%)"]},{"id":"2E5l5iy0r3wbbtrf071w","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/121946-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-28-discussion/","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nInformation Assurance (IA) refers to the process of protecting and managing information systems by ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, and non-repudiation.

Certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.

A warm site is a location that has infrastructure and equipment in place but is not actively running. The district can quickly move their data and systems to the warm site in case of an IT center disaster, but it will require some additional time and effort to get everything up and running smoothly. This option is less expensive than a hot site (which provides immediate backup capabilities) or off-site storage (which requires constant maintenance).
