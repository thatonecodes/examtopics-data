Data Owner is the main person responsible and who utilizes the information. And Data Custodian is the one which gives maintenance, administration, and set controls over the data. In this case, the custodian would never be the cloud vendor. \n\nFor example: for employees data, the Owner is HR, the Custodian is the security team or IT, and the cloud vendor acts as processor/subprocessor."}],"content":"The term Data Custodian, is being used with different meaning by different folks. In general the Cloud Customer ( the consumer of Cloud services ) is the data owner in all types IaaS, PaaS, SaaS. They are responsible for the data. The Cloud provider is the Data Custodian. In this question the Data Custodian seems to refer to the Data Owners, the Cloud Customer!.","timestamp":"1608217260.0","comment_id":"112421"},{"timestamp":"1739971740.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"MaciekMT","comment_id":"1358767","content":"Selected Answer: B\nData custodians are typically expected to have detailed knowledge of the systems that store and process their data—this includes how the data is hosted, secured, and maintained. In a PaaS or SaaS model, however, much of the underlying infrastructure, configuration, and even some application components are completely opaque to the customer."},{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nKnowledge of systems\n\nExplanation:\nIn a cloud environment, particularly with PaaS or SaaS, the underlying infrastructure and systems are managed by the cloud provider. This makes it difficult for data custodians to gain detailed knowledge of the systems hosting their data. They are often abstracted from the hardware, software configurations, and other operational details, which complicates tasks such as:\n\nAssessing security risks.\nVerifying compliance.\nUnderstanding system-specific behaviors.\nThis abstraction layer poses a challenge for custodians to fully understand and manage the environment compared to traditional on-premises systems.","poster":"MaciekMT","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1343610","timestamp":"1737377640.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"cloudenthusiast","content":"Selected Answer: B\nCloud providers do not provide the information of their system to clients.","comment_id":"1159856","timestamp":"1724676960.0"},{"poster":"Pika26","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA: Data classification","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1700660160.0","comment_id":"903996"},{"poster":"secisfun","content":"C.
