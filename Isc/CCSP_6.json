It also allows migrations of systems to other underlying infrastructure during maintenance and includes monitoring and management capabilities. In short, distributed resource scheduling is the ability to manage resources across a cluster or environment in a way that optimizes reliable and consistent service delivery.","upvote_count":"2","poster":"ikamalbhatt","timestamp":"1730525040.0"}],"answer_description":"Dynamic resource scheduling (DRS) is used within all clustering systems as the method for clusters to provide high availability, scaling, management, and workload distribution and balancing of jobs and processes. From a physical infrastructure perspective, DRS is used to balance compute loads between physical hosts in a cloud to maintain the desired thresholds and limits on the physical hosts.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/31794-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-121-discussion/","choices":{"C":"Dynamic optimization","B":"Dynamic clustering","D":"Dynamic resource scheduling","A":"Dynamic balancing"},"question_id":26,"question_text":"What process is used within a clustered system to provide high availability and load balancing?","question_images":[],"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1600624680,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2020-09-20 19:58:00","answer":"D","exam_id":184,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"o4fRRnyv8oKjpeGhXOwl","answer":"B","isMC":true,"question_id":27,"question_text":"Which of the following is NOT a function performed by the handshake protocol of TLS?","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answer_ET":"B","exam_id":184,"topic":"1","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nencryption - of data","comment_id":"574146","upvote_count":"2","poster":"kepalon","timestamp":"1727158020.0"},{"content":"The answer B. would be better presented as \"Data encryption\" or \"Session data encryption.\" The TLS handshake does employ encryption, for secrets and keys, using asymmetric encryption.
