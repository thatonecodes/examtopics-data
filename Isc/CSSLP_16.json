Code Review.\n\nWhile Peer Review can also provide valuable insights towards improving security, it is not specifically designed to eliminate common vulnerabilities identified in the question. The primary goal of peer review is to ensure that code adheres to coding standards and team conventions while meeting functional requirements.\n\nPeer reviews are typically performed by members of the same development team who collaborate on projects. Peers may catch errors that went unnoticed during programming or testing phases, but they may not be familiar with all current security best practices or up-to-date threats/targets. Code reviews for security purposes require specialized knowledge regarding known vulnerabilities and how attackers might exploit them, which a peer reviewer might not have.\n\nTherefore, peer reviews complement (but do not replace) other software review processes such as management review, code review, and software audit review that address commonly-known cybersecurity concerns like format string exploits, race conditions, memory leaks, and buffer overflows by focusing explicitly on eliminating these types of weaknesses from within source codebases.","timestamp":"1727704620.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

They are primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing policies, procedures, and standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data or critical systems. However, while CISOs do play a vital role in directing information security activities within their organizations, they typically do not work alone in this regard.\n\nThe role of the Information Security Steering Committee is to ensure that information security risks are managed consistently across all business units within an organization. The committee helps define organizational policies and priorities related to cybersecurity issues. It coordinates efforts between different departments involved in implementing these policies across multiple business lines or geographies.","poster":"74gjd_37","comment_id":"1021549","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727704680.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"4e3rv21rq3vq2q","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

A hot site is located off site and provides the best protection. It is an exact replica of the current data center. In case a disaster struck to the data center, administrators just need to take the backup of recent data in hot site and the data center is back online in a very short time. It is very expensive to create and maintain the hot site. There are lots of third party companies that provide disaster recovery expensive disaster recovery solution, usually having only a single room with no equipment. All equipment is brought to the site after the disaster. It can be on site hot and cold sites. Warm sites will have hardware and connectivity already established, though on a smaller scale than the original production site or even a hot site. These sites will have backups on hand, but they may not be complete and may be between several days and a week old. An example would be backup tapes sent to the warm site by courier.","topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"74gjd_37","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe answer is B.
