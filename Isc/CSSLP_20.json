It was first introduced by Butler W. Lampson in 1971. According to the access matrix model, the protection state of a computer system can be abstracted as a set of objects 'O', that is the set of entities that needs to be protected (e.g. processes, files, memory pages) and a set of subjects 'S' that consists of all active entities (e.g. users, processes). Further there exists a set of rights 'R' of the form r(s,o), where s S, o O is a state machine model used for enforcing access control in government and military applications. The model is a formal state transition model of computer security policy that describes a set of access control rules which use security labels on objects and clearances for subjects. Security labels range from the most sensitive (e.g.,\"Top Secret\"), down to the least sensitive (e.g., \"Unclassified\" or \"Public\"). The Bell-La Padula model focuses on data confidentiality and controlled\nWilson model provides a foundation for specifying and analyzing an integrity policy for a computing system. The model is primarily concerned with formalizing the notion of information integrity. Information integrity is maintained by preventing corruption of data items in a system due to either error or malicious intent. The model's enforcement and certification rules define data items and processes that provide the basis for an integrity policy. The core of the model is based on the rules designed to ensure data integrity. Data and subjects are grouped into ordered levels of integrity. The model is designed so that subjects may not corrupt data in a level ranked higher than the subject, or be corrupted by data from a lower level than the subject.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/121930-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-12-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"and r(s,o) R.

By auditing printer usage logs and determining who accessed which printers and when, organizations can help ensure the physical security of documents and prevent unauthorized access or misuse.\n\nIn contrast, while downloading data from the internet represents its own potential risks (such as downloading malware), it may not always be necessary to audit this activity for every organization. The need for auditing internet downloads would largely depend on each individual organization's specific needs and risk profile - some companies may have more stringent policies around limiting employee web browsing than others depending on their industry or compliance requirements.","poster":"74gjd_37","comment_id":"1021733","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer":"ACD"},{"id":"w9QnqvRlYl5bFy7I4dNo","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-09-30 19:12:00","choices":{"C":"United States Congress","B":"National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)","D":"Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS)","A":"National Security Agency (NSA)"},"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_ET":"improve quality of life.
