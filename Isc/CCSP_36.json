Private clouds would likely have the resources available for specific uses and could not be assumed to have a large pool of resources available for expansion. A community cloud would have the same issues as a private cloud, being targeted to similar organizations. A hybrid cloud, because it spans multiple clouds, would not fit the bill either, without the use of individual cloud models.","choices":{"C":"Private","A":"Public","D":"Community","B":"Hybrid"},"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/29155-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-257-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1597947420,"exam_id":184,"question_id":176,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2020-08-20 20:17:00"},{"id":"Ci5m8xOAsYi7JBwW47yN","answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2022-05-19 19:53:00","choices":{"C":"Different operational procedures","B":"Different certifications","A":"Multiple jurisdictions","D":"Different capabilities"},"topic":"1","question_text":"What is a serious complication an organization faces from the compliance perspective with international operations?","answer_description":"When operating within a global framework, a security professional runs into a multitude of jurisdictions and requirements, which often may not be clearly applicable or may be in contention with each other. These requirements can involve the location of the users and the type of data they enter into systems, the laws governing the organization that owns the application and any regulatory requirements they may have, and finally the appropriate laws and regulations for the jurisdiction housing the IT resources and where the data is actually stored, which may be multiple jurisdictions as well. Different certifications would not come into play as a challenge because the major IT and data center certifications are international and would apply to any cloud provider. Different capabilities and different operational procedures would be mitigated by the organization's selection of a cloud provider and would not be a challenge if an appropriate provider was chosen, regardless of location.","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1652982780,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/75924-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-258-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":184,"isMC":true,"answer":"A","question_id":177,"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
