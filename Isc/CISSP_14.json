Build in appropriate levels of fault tolerance. Building in fault tolerance is a secure design principle because it helps ensure that a product can continue to function even if a component fails or is compromised. This is an important aspect of security, as it helps prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in the product to gain unauthorized access or cause other types of harm. Restricting the use of modularization, not relying on previously used code, and utilizing obfuscation whenever possible can also be important security measures, but they are not necessarily secure design principles in and of themselves.","poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1711216980.0","comment_id":"1015089"},{"comments":[{"poster":"RVoigt","timestamp":"1693062300.0","comment_id":"822720","upvote_count":"1","content":"I have to change to BDSec's point - CISSP Official Study Guide pg 343 - Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to suffer a fault but continue to operate.

This can help to ensure the continuity of operations and the availability of the system, which are important for security and reliability.\nOn the other hand, the other options given may not be considered as secure design principle, as Restricting the use of modularization can make it harder to maintain and update the system, not relying on previously used code can make it harder to ensure compatibility and stability, and Utilizing obfuscation whenever possible can make it harder to debug and troubleshoot the system.","poster":"Dee83"},{"timestamp":"1689070380.0","upvote_count":"2","content":"C.\nI will go with C.

Action attributes: attributes that describe the action being attempted e.g. read, delete, view, approve\n3. Object attributes: attributes that describe the object (or resource) being accessed e.g. the object type (medical record, bank account), the department, the classification or sensitivity, the location\n4.
