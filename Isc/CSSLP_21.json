It describes the technology that prevents the uses of digital content that were not desired or foreseen by the content provider. DRM does not refer to other forms of copy protection which can be circumvented without modifying the file or device, such as process of digitally signing executables and scripts in order to confirm the software author, and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it concurrently on a host computer.

It focuses on data confidentiality and access to classified information, in contrast to the Biba Integrity model, which describes rules for the protection of data integrity. In the Bell-La Padula model, the entities in an information system are divided into subjects and objects. The Bell-La Padula model is built on the concept of a state machine with a set of allowable states in a computer network system. The transition from one state to another state is defined by transition functions. The model defines two mandatory access control (MAC) rules and one discretionary access control (DAC) rule with three security properties: 1.The Simple Security Property: A subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level (no read-up). 2.The *-property (star-property): A subject at a given security level must not write to any object at a lower security level (no write-down). The *-property is also known as the Confinement property. 3.The Discretionary Security Property: It uses an access matrix to specify the discretionary access control.","answer":"B","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727716800.0","comments":[{"content":"The Bell-La Padula model is a security model designed to protect the confidentiality of information in computer systems. It was developed by David Bell and Len La Padula in 1973, primarily for use by the United States Department of Defense.\n\nThe model consists of three elements: subjects, objects, and labels. Subjects are entities that can access objects, such as users or processes. Objects are data resources that need to be protected from unauthorized access or modification, such as files or databases. Labels define the security levels assigned to both subjects and objects.\n\nIn the Bell-La Padula model, each user is assigned a clearance level based on their job requirements and responsibilities.
