Although considerable mechanisms are in place to ensure isolation and separation, the data and applications are ultimately using shared resources.\nBroad network access refers to the ability to access cloud services from any location or client. Portability refers to the ability to easily move cloud services between different cloud providers, whereas elasticity refers to the capabilities of a cloud environment to add or remove services, as needed, to meet current demand.","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1"},{"id":"eavF26kkJWW99gJ2wIGn","answer_description":"Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural scheme that applies the components, connectors, and data conduits for many web applications used on the Internet.

Object storage is designed for handling large amounts of unstructured data—like VM images—and offers scalability, durability, and a flat namespace that makes managing these images straightforward. In many cloud environments, VM images (such as Amazon Machine Images in AWS) are stored in an object storage system (e.g., Amazon S3) until they are deployed.
