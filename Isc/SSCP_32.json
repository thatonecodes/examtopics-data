This involves use of different networks, circuits or end points should the normal network be unavailable. Diverse routing routes traffic through split cable facilities or duplicate cable facilities. This can be accomplished with different and/or duplicate cable sheaths. If different cable sheaths are used, the cable may be in the same conduit and therefore subject to the same interruptions as the cable it is backing up. The communication service subscriber can duplicate the facilities by having alternate routes, although the entrance to and from the customer premises may be in the same conduit. The subscriber can obtain diverse routing and alternate routing from the local carrier, including dual entrance facilities. This type of access is time-consuming and costly. Long haul network diversity is a diverse long-distance network utilizing T1 circuits among the major long-distance carriers. It ensures long-distance access should any one carrier experience a network failure. Last mile circuit protection is a redundant combination of local carrier T1s microwave and/or coaxial cable access to the local communications loop. This enables the facility to have access during a local carrier communication disaster. Alternate local carrier routing is also utilized.\nSource: Information Systems Audit and Control Association, Certified Information Systems Auditor 2002 review manual, chapter 5: Disaster Recovery and\nBusiness Continuity (page 259).","topic":"6","timestamp":"2022-08-01 23:31:00","exam_id":189,"question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following methods of providing telecommunications continuity involves the use of an alternative media?","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nLast mile circuit protection involves using alternative media to ensure continuity of telecommunications services.

Unfortunately, most early implementations to meet that need were designed for a trusted network. Protocols/ programs, such as TELNET, RSH, and rlogin, transmit unencrypted over the network, which allows traffic to be easily intercepted. Secure shell (SSH) was designed as an alternative to the above insecure protocols and allows users to securely access resources on remote computers over an encrypted tunnel. SSHs services include remote log-on, file transfer, and command execution. It also supports port forwarding, which redirects other protocols through an encrypted SSH tunnel. Many users protect less secure traffic of protocols, such as X Windows and VNC (virtual network computing), by forwarding them through a SSH tunnel.\nThe SSH tunnel protects the integrity of communication, preventing session hijacking and other man-in-the-middle attacks. Another advantage of SSH over its predecessors is that it supports strong authentication. There are several alternatives for SSH clients to authenticate to a SSH server, including passwords and digital certificates. Keep in mind that authenticating with a password is still a significant improvement over the other protocols because the password is transmitted encrypted.\n\nThe following were wrong answers:\ntelnet is an incorrect choice. SSH is commonly used as an more secure alternative to telnet. In fact Telnet should not longer be used today. rlogin is and incorrect choice. SSH is commonly used as a more secure alternative to rlogin.\nRSH is an incorrect choice. SSH is commonly used as a more secure alternative to RSH.\n\nReference(s) used for this question:\nHernandez CISSP, Steven (2012-12-21).

While this inspection is scaled back for subsequent packets to improve performance, this is the best of the four answers.\nWhen packet filtering is used, a packet arrives at the firewall, and it runs through its ACLs to determine whether this packet should be allowed or denied. If the packet is allowed, it is passed on to the destination host, or to another network device, and the packet filtering device forgets about the packet. This is different from stateful inspection, which remembers and keeps track of what packets went where until each particular connection is closed. A stateful firewall is like a nosy neighbor who gets into peoples business and conversations. She keeps track of the suspicious cars that come into the neighborhood, who is out of town for the week, and the postman who stays a little too long at the neighbor ladys house. This can be annoying until your house is burglarized. Then you and the police will want to talk to the nosy neighbor, because she knows everything going on in the neighborhood and would be the one most likely to know something unusual happened.\n\"Inspected at only one Open Systems Interconnetion (OSI) layer\" is incorrect. To perform stateful packet inspection, the firewall must consider at least the network and transport layers.\n\"Decapsulated at all Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers\" is incorrect. The headers are not stripped (\"decapsulated\" if there is such a word) and are passed through in their entirety IF the packet is passed.\n\"Encapsulated at all Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) layers\" is incorrect. Encapsulation refers to the adding of a layer's header/trailer to the information received from the above level. This is done when the packet is assembled not at the firewall.\nReference(s) used for this question:\n\nCBK, p. 466 -\nHarris, Shon (2012-10-25).
