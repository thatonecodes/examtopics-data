This requirement helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data leakage between different functions.\n\nMoreover, Requirement 2.2.2 of the PCI DSS states that organizations must ensure that security configurations are not applied to other servers in a manner that would negatively impact the security of the cardholder data environment. This requirement emphasizes the importance of applying individual security configurations to each virtual server to ensure that the security of each server is not compromised.","comment_id":"1015137"},{"comment_id":"786912","poster":"Dee83","upvote_count":"1","content":"A. Implement one primary function per virtual server and apply individual security configuration for each virtual server.\n\nThis approach allows for more granular control of security and reduces the attack surface. Each virtual server can be configured with a unique security configuration that is tailored to its specific function, which minimizes the risk of a compromise affecting multiple servers or functions. Additionally, if one virtual server is compromised, the attacker would have access to only the resources and data on that specific virtual server, which limits the overall impact.\nImplementing multiple functions within the same virtual server, and apply the same security configuration for each virtual server, may lead to a scenario where a vulnerability in one service can be used to compromise the security of other services or the whole system, and it would be harder to identify and isolate the breach.","timestamp":"1706127360.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe answer is D.

Both are critically important in a legal investigation. However, the sequence in which they matter is the distinction.\n\nBefore an analyst can even worry about maintaining a proper chain-of-custody, they first need to ensure they have the proper legal and/or organizational authority to collect the evidence in the first place. Collecting evidence without proper authorization can render the evidence inadmissible in court or potentially lead to legal consequences for the analyst or their organization.\n\nOnce the evidence is legally and properly collected, the chain-of-custody becomes paramount. It ensures that the evidence has been handled, stored, and transferred in a way that maintains its integrity and authenticity.\n\nIn essence, without proper authorization to collect, the chain-of-custody is moot because the evidence shouldn't have been collected in the first place. That's why \"Authorization to collect\" is the FIRST consideration in the context of the question.","poster":"williom","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1696364700.0"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1015200","poster":"74gjd_37","content":"Selected Answer: B\nThe importance of chain-of-custody in investigations is defined in various legal and regulatory frameworks.

The chain-of-custody is critical in establishing the reliability and authenticity of evidence. Additionally, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides guidelines for the management of digital evidence, including the importance of maintaining the chain-of-custody.
