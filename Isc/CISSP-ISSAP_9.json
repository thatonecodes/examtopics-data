It is typically used by network devices to send error messages or control packets to other network devices. While ICMP can be used for multicasting in some cases, its primary function is not related to multicasting.\n\nARP, on the other hand, is a protocol used for resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses in a local area network (LAN). It allows devices on a LAN to map an IP address of another device to its corresponding MAC address. ARP operates at the link layer of the TCP/IP model and does not specifically deal with multicasting functionality.","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1049127","timestamp":"1729459260.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe correct answer is D.

Risk analysis: Risk analysis is a process that involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to determine appropriate actions for mitigating those risks. While risk analysis plays an important role in overall security management, it does not directly relate to modifying messages or providing security during communications.\nB. Firewall security: Firewalls are network security devices designed to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic based on preset rulesets. They serve as a barrier between trusted internal networks (such as company intranets) and untrusted external networks (such as the Internet). While firewalls contribute to overall network security, they do not specifically address message modification or communication security.\nD.
