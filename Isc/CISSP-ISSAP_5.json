It encapsulates data within an encrypted tunnel, but this encryption is meant to protect the integrity of transmitted data rather than specifically encrypting email contents.\n\nIPSec (Internet Protocol Security) is also commonly used for VPNs and offers strong security features. However, it operates at the network layer rather than the application layer where emails reside. Although it can be configured to encrypt email traffic between networks or systems, implementing IPSec solely for email encryption may require additional configuration and setup.\n\nNTFS (New Technology File System), on the other hand, is a file system used in Windows operating systems for organizing and storing files on disk drives. NTFS does not have native capabilities for encrypting emails."}],"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1049119","poster":"74gjd_37","timestamp":"1729458780.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. PGP\n\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a widely recognized and highly secure encryption protocol that is commonly used for securing email communications. It provides end-to-end encryption, which means that the message is encrypted at the sender's end and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient using their private key."}],"question_text":"You work as a Network Administrator for NetTech Inc.

Asymmetric and D. Symmetric:\n\nC. Asymmetric encryption (also known as public-key encryption) is used during the SSL handshake process to establish a secure connection between the client and server. It involves using a pair of keys - a private key kept by the server and a public key distributed to clients.\n\nD. Symmetric encryption is used after the SSL handshake process to encrypt data transmission between the client and server. It involves using a single shared secret key that both parties use for encryption and decryption."}],"question_text":"Andrew works as a Network Administrator for Infonet Inc.
