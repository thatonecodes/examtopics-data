Hence, it becomes tedious to report negative results when material conditions (faults) actually exist. Detection risk includes two types of risk: Sampling risk: This risk occurs when an auditor falsely accepts or erroneously rejects an audit sample. Nonsampling risk: This risk occurs when an auditor fails to detect a condition because of not applying the appropriate event, a method or a (technical) process that, although being abreast with science, still conceives these dangers, even if all theoretically possible safety measures would be applied (scientifically conceivable measures). The formula to calculate residual risk is (inherent risk) x (control risk) where inherent risk is (threats auditing, is the risk that the account or section being audited is materially misstated without considering internal controls due to error or fraud. The assessment of incorrect. A secondary risk is a risk that arises as a straight consequence of implementing a risk response. The secondary risk is an outcome of dealing with the original risk. Secondary risks are not as rigorous or important as primary risks, but can turn out to be so if not estimated and planned properly.","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1727329560.0","poster":"74gjd_37","comment_id":"1017412","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Audit risk is a function of the risks of material misstatement and detection risk’. Hence, audit risk is made up of two components – risks of material misstatement and detection risk.\n...\nDetection risk is defined as ‘the risk that the procedures performed by the auditor to reduce audit risk to an acceptably low level will not detect a misstatement that exists and that could be material, either individually or when aggregated with other misstatements.’"}],"question_id":1,"answer_ET":"procedure or using procedures inconsistent with the audit objectives (detection faults).

It can promote certain risks onto risk response planning. Qualitative Risk Analysis uses the likelihood and impact of the identified risks in a fast and cost-effective manner. Qualitative Risk\nAnalysis establishes a basis for a focused quantitative analysis or Risk Response Plan by evaluating the precedence of risks with a concern to impact on the project's scope, cost, schedule, and quality objectives. The qualitative risk analysis is conducted at any point in a project life cycle. The primary goal of qualitative risk analysis is to determine proportion of effect and theoretical response.

They also may not reflect new or updated industry-specific knowledge.\n\nC. Rolling wave planning: This option is a process of progressive elaboration where work is planned incrementally over time, reflecting data from completed activities to inform future tasks; it doesn't really address prioritizing risks nor give initial insights about how important each potential risk might be.\n\nD. Quantitative analysis: While this involves numerical modeling techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations for assessing probability and impact of identified risks, it can take more time and resources to complete than qualitative analysis because many factors must be considered beforehand so basically, being too detailed will slow down decision-making processes which goes against our original objectives indicated by management."}],"content":"Selected Answer: A\nQualitative Risk Analysis (Option A) technique prioritizes risks based on their probability of occurrence, impact on project objectives, and other subjective factors such as stakeholder perception. It also uses expert judgment to evaluate and rank risks using techniques like SWOT analysis or risk scoring matrices. The output of qualitative risk analysis helps project managers identify which risks require further action and what type of response is required to mitigate them effectively while balancing costs and benefits. Overall, this process provides management with valuable information necessary to make informed decisions about how best to respond to potential risks within the project budget constraints.","timestamp":"1727425320.0","poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1018600"}],"choices":{"D":"Quantitative analysis","B":"Historical information","C":"Rolling wave planning","A":"Qualitative risk analysis"},"unix_timestamp":1695802920},{"id":"1z6AXT8dWCruujvRvlnR","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"question_id":3,"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"poster":"74gjd_37","content":"Selected Answer: A\nOption A: Take-grant protection model\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-grant_protection_model\n\nThe model represents a system as directed graph, where vertices are either subjects or objects.

In this project scenario, creating a user manual for the software is essential and mandatory; avoiding it altogether would halt or significantly delay product development, which is not feasible nor desirable.\n\nAs such, hiring an external writer to complete a user guide ensures that you are taking specific actions and mitigations to minimize any adverse impact on time schedules due to delays in completing this necessary requirement. This response strategy acknowledges that there will be risks involved but seeks ways to manage those risks rather than avoid them entirely.

In this case, by hiring an external writer, you have transferred some of the responsibilities and accountability related to writing user guides to them.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that not all risks can be effectively transferred, as there is always the potential for something preventing effective transference from happening.
