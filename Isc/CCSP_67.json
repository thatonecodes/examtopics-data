Thn question might originally asks for the \"exception\", or the answer is C.\n\nThe current answer explanation shows four IaaS merits w/o the priority, whch out of three of them are in the choices.\n\nAlso, in the (ISC)2 official app has a question as below, which suggest the ownership cost transfer is the best merit of the IaaS:\nWhen using an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution, what is the key benefit for the customer?\n(A) Scalability\n(B) Metered service\n(C) Energy and cooling efficiencies\n(D) Transfer of ownership cost\nExplanation\nD. The primary benefit to the customer of using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the transfer of cost of ownership. In a cloud environment, the customer uses and is billed only for what they use as opposed to the full cost of implementation, saving them a significant amount in terms of cost of ownership. While scalability, metered service, and energy and cooling efficiencies are a part of the benefit of a cloud computing environment, they are not the primary benefit or business driver behind Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) adoption."},{"content":"The answer is in correct because \"metered and priced on the basis of units consumed\" applies to all three cloud services not just IaaS","poster":"bark101","comment_id":"161808","upvote_count":"9","comments":[{"content":"however, the other three answers are not correct at all. so, from all options provided.

This metered pricing allows for cost efficiency and flexibility, as businesses only pay for what they use.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nB. Increased energy and cooling system efficiencies â†’ While cloud providers benefit from economies of scale and energy efficiency, this is not a direct benefit to the IaaS customer.\nC. Transferred cost of ownership â†’ While IaaS reduces capital expenses (CapEx) by shifting infrastructure costs to operational expenses (OpEx), customers still pay for what they use.\nD.

The iSCSI protocol encapsulates SCSI commands and assembles the data in packets for the TCP/IP layer. Packets are sent over the network using a point-to-point connection.
