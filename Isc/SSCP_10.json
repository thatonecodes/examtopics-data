Incomparable is when you have two disjointed sensitivity labels, that is a category in one of the labels is not in the other label. \"Because neither label contains all the categories of the other, the labels can't be compared. They're said to be incomparable\"\nCOMPARABILITY:\nThe label:\nTOP SECRET [VENUS ALPHA]\nis \"higher\" than either of the labels:\nSECRET [VENUS ALPHA] TOP SECRET [VENUS]\nBut you can't really say that the label:\nTOP SECRET [VENUS]\nis higher than the label:\nSECRET [ALPHA]\nBecause neither label contains all the categories of the other, the labels can't be compared. They're said to be incomparable. In a mandatory access control system, you won't be allowed access to a file whose label is incomparable to your clearance.\nThe Multilevel Security policy uses an ordering relationship between labels known as the dominance relationship. Intuitively, we think of a label that dominates another as being \"higher\" than the other. Similarly, we think of a label that is dominated by another as being \"lower\" than the other. The dominance relationship is used to determine permitted operations and information flows.\n\nDOMINANCE -\nThe dominance relationship is determined by the ordering of the Sensitivity/Clearance component of the label and the intersection of the set of Compartments.\nSample Sensitivity/Clearance ordering are:\nTop Secret > Secret > Confidential > Unclassified\ns3 > s2 > s1 > s0\nFormally, for label one to dominate label 2 both of the following must be true:\nThe sensitivity/clearance of label one must be greater than or equal to the sensitivity/clearance of label two.\nThe intersection of the compartments of label one and label two must equal the compartments of label two.\nAdditionally:\nTwo labels are said to be equal if their sensitivity/clearance and set of compartments are exactly equal. Note that dominance includes equality.\nOne label is said to strictly dominate the other if it dominates the other but is not equal to the other.\nTwo labels are said to be incomparable if each label has at least one compartment that is not included in the other's set of compartments.\nThe dominance relationship will produce a partial ordering over all possible MLS labels, resulting in what is known as the MLS Security Lattice.\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nThe number of classification in the two labels is different. Is incorrect because the categories are what is being compared, not the classifications.\nNeither label contains all the classifications of the other. Is incorrect because the categories are what is being compared, not the classifications. the number of categories in the two labels is different. Is incorrect because it is possibe a category exists more than once in one sensitivity label and does exist in the other so they would be comparable.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nOReilly - Computer Systems and Access Control (Chapter 3)\nhttp://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csb/chapter/ch03.html\nand\nhttp://rubix.com/cms/mls_dom","unix_timestamp":1682516880,"answer_images":[],"question_id":46,"isMC":true},{"id":"SZ0EL9JsZim6d760oBDm","unix_timestamp":1715943840,"timestamp":"2024-05-17 13:04:00","answer_ET":"A","answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_text":"Which of the following is NOT a type of motion detector?","answer_images":["https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02070/0003000001.jpg","https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/02070/0003200001.jpg"],"exam_id":189,"choices":{"A":"Photoelectric sensor","D":"Ultrasonic Sensor.","C":"Microwave Sensor.","B":"Passive infrared sensors"},"question_images":[],"question_id":47,"answer_description":"A photoelectric sensor does not \"directly\" sense motion there is a narrow beam that won't set off the sensor unless the beam is broken. Photoelectric sensors, along with dry contact switches, are a type of perimeter intrusion detector.\nAll of the other answers are valid types of motion detectors types.\nThe content below on the different types of sensors is from Wikepedia:\n\nIndoor Sensors -\nThese types of sensors are designed for indoor use. Outdoor use would not be advised due to false alarm vulnerability and weather durability.Passive infrared detectors\n\n\n\nPassive Infrared Sensor -\nThe passive infrared detector (PIR) is one of the most common detectors found in household and small business environments because it offers affordable and reliable functionality. The term passive means the detector is able to function without the need to generate and radiate its own energy (unlike ultrasonic and microwave volumetric intrusion detectors that are \"active\" in operation). PIRs are able to distinguish if an infrared emitting object is present by first learning the ambient temperature of the monitored space and then detecting a change in the temperature caused by the presence of an object. Using the principle of differentiation, which is a check of presence or nonpresence, PIRs verify if an intruder or object is actually there. Creating individual zones of detection where each zone comprises one or more layers can achieve differentiation. Between the zones there are areas of no sensitivity (dead zones) that are used by the sensor for comparison.\n\nUltrasonic detectors -\nUsing frequencies between 15 kHz and 75 kHz, these active detectors transmit ultrasonic sound waves that are inaudible to humans. The Doppler shift principle is the underlying method of operation, in which a change in frequency is detected due to object motion. This is caused when a moving object changes the frequency of sound waves around it. Two conditions must occur to successfully detect a Doppler shift event:\nThere must be motion of an object either towards or away from the receiver.\nThe motion of the object must cause a change in the ultrasonic frequency to the receiver relative to the transmitting frequency.\nThe ultrasonic detector operates by the transmitter emitting an ultrasonic signal into the area to be protected. The sound waves are reflected by solid objects (such as the surrounding floor, walls and ceiling) and then detected by the receiver. Because ultrasonic waves are transmitted through air, then hard-surfaced objects tend to reflect most of the ultrasonic energy, while soft surfaces tend to absorb most energy.\nWhen the surfaces are stationary, the frequency of the waves detected by the receiver will be equal to the transmitted frequency. However, a change in frequency will occur as a result of the Doppler principle, when a person or object is moving towards or away from the detector. Such an event initiates an alarm signal. This technology is considered obsolete by many alarm professionals, and is not actively installed.\n\nMicrowave detectors -\nThis device emits microwaves from a transmitter and detects any reflected microwaves or reduction in beam intensity using a receiver. The transmitter and receiver are usually combined inside a single housing (monostatic) for indoor applications, and separate housings (bistatic) for outdoor applications. To reduce false alarms this type of detector is usually combined with a passive infrared detector or \"Dualtec\" alarm.\nMicrowave detectors respond to a Doppler shift in the frequency of the reflected energy, by a phase shift, or by a sudden reduction of the level of received energy.\nAny of these effects may indicate motion of an intruder.\n\nPhoto-electric beams -\nPhotoelectric beam systems detect the presence of an intruder by transmitting visible or infrared light beams across an area, where these beams may be obstructed. To improve the detection surface area, the beams are often employed in stacks of two or more. However, if an intruder is aware of the technology's presence, it can be avoided. The technology can be an effective long-range detection system, if installed in stacks of three or more where the transmitters and receivers are staggered to create a fence-like barrier. Systems are available for both internal and external applications. To prevent a clandestine attack using a secondary light source being used to hold the detector in a 'sealed' condition whilst an intruder passes through, most systems use and detect a modulated light source.\n\nGlass break detectors -\nThe glass break detector may be used for internal perimeter building protection. When glass breaks it generates sound in a wide band of frequencies. These can range from infrasonic, which is below 20 hertz (Hz) and can not be heard by the human ear, through the audio band from 20 Hz to 20 kHz which humans can hear, right up to ultrasonic, which is above 20 kHz and again cannot be heard. Glass break acoustic detectors are mounted in close proximity to the glass panes and listen for sound frequencies associated with glass breaking. Seismic glass break detectors are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.\nTypically, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass break detectors \"feel\" these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.\nThe more primitive detection method involves gluing a thin strip of conducting foil on the inside of the glass and putting low-power electrical current through it.\nBreaking the glass is practically guaranteed to tear the foil and break the circuit.\nSmoke, heat, and carbon monoxide detectors\n\n\nHeat Detection System -\nMost systems may also be equipped with smoke, heat, and/or carbon monoxide detectors. These are also known as 24 hour zones (which are on at all times).\nSmoke detectors and heat detectors protect from the risk of fire and carbon monoxide detectors protect from the risk of carbon monoxide. Although an intruder alarm panel may also have these detectors connected, it may not meet all the local fire code requirements of a fire alarm system.\nOther types of volumetric sensors could be:\n\nActive Infrared -\nPassive Infrared/Microware combined\n\nRadar -\n\nAccoustical Sensor/Audio -\nVibration Sensor (seismic)\nAir Turbulence","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/140787-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-40-discussion/","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1731848640.0","comment_id":"1212852","content":"There is zero reason for a question like this to be on the exam.

The attacker might not know what\nAlice and Bob were talking about, but can know that they were talking and how much they talked. In certain circumstances this can be very bad. Consider for example when a military is organising a secret attack against another nation: it may suffice to alert the other nation for them to know merely that there is a lot of secret activity going on.\nAs another example, when encrypting Voice Over IP streams that use variable bit rate encoding, the number of bits per unit of time is not obscured, and this can be exploited to guess spoken phrases.\nPadding messages is a way to make it harder to do traffic analysis. Normally, a number of random bits are appended to the end of the message with an indication at the end how much this random data is. The randomness should have a minimum value of 0, a maximum number of N and an even distribution between the two extremes. Note, that increasing 0 does not help, only increasing N helps, though that also means that a lower percentage of the channel will be used to transmit real data. Also note, that since the cryptographic routine is assumed to be uncrackable (otherwise the padding length itself is crackable), it does not help to put the padding anywhere else, e.g. at the beginning, in the middle, or in a sporadic manner.\nThe other answers are all techniques used to do Penetration Testing.\nReferences:\nKRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, pages 233, 238. and https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Padding_%28cryptography%29#Traffic_analysis","topic":"1","discussion":[{"poster":"Moezey","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1366498","timestamp":"1741411320.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\ntraffic padding is just adding extra data, its not a ddos technique so meaningless in terms of pentesting"},{"comment_id":"1096129","content":"Selected Answer: D\nI think D :Sniffing","poster":"mansour975","timestamp":"1718341320.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1704246780.0","comment_id":"941315","poster":"jsingh26","upvote_count":"1","content":"How is war dialing not the correct answer?","comments":[{"content":"Because war dialing is a technique used to find and identify vulnerable computer systems or networks by systematically dialing a range of phone numbers and listening for modem tones or responses.
