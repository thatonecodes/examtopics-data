However, it does not play a role in authentication.\n\nüîπ What Data Masking Can Do:\n\nA. Secure Remote Access ‚Üí Helps ensure sensitive data is protected when accessed remotely.\nB. Test Data in Sandboxed Environments ‚Üí Allows the use of realistic but anonymized data for testing without exposing actual sensitive information.\nD. Enforcing Least Privilege ‚Üí Supports role-based access by restricting access to de-identified or masked data based on user permissions.\nüîπ Why Not \"Authentication of Privileged Users\"?\n\nAuthentication is the process of verifying a user‚Äôs identity (e.g., passwords, MFA, biometrics).\nData masking does not verify user identity‚Äîit only hides or alters data visibility based on access policies."},{"comment_id":"903291","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC: Authentication of privileged users","poster":"Pika26","timestamp":"1732203900.0","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"620117","content":"it's pretty 'round about'.
