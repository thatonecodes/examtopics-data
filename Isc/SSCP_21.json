Thus, it is usually easy to retrofit a network to include network-based IDSs with minimal effort.\nNetwork-based IDSs are not vulnerable to attacks is not true, even thou network-based IDSs can be made very secure against attack and even made invisible to many attackers they still have to read the packets and sometimes a well crafted packet might exploit or kill your capture engine.\nNetwork-based IDSs are well suited for modern switch-based networks is not true as most switches do not provide universal monitoring ports and this limits the monitoring range of a network-based IDS sensor to a single host. Even when switches provide such monitoring ports, often the single port cannot mirror all traffic traversing the switch.\nMost network-based IDSs can automatically indicate whether or not an attack was successful is not true as most network-based IDSs cannot tell whether or not an attack was successful; they can only discern that an attack was initiated. This means that after a network-based IDS detects an attack, administrators must manually investigate each attacked host to determine whether it was indeed penetrated.\nReference:\nNIST special publication 800-31 Intrusion Detection System pages 15-16\nOfficial guide to the CISSP CBK.

Statistical anomaly-based intrusion detection.\n\nStatistical anomaly-based intrusion detection involves establishing a baseline of \"normal\" behavior within a system and then identifying deviations or anomalies from this baseline. It detects intrusions by flagging activities or behaviors that significantly differ from the established norms. This approach aims to identify potential threats or attacks by observing deviations in system behavior or patterns. It's widely used due to its ability to adapt to new or evolving threats without relying heavily on predefined attack signatures or patterns."}],"question_images":[],"answer_description":"There are two conceptual approaches to intrusion detection. Knowledge-based intrusion detection uses a database of known vulnerabilities to look for current attempts to exploit them on a system and trigger an alarm if an attempt is found. The other approach, not as common, is called behaviour-based or statistical analysis-based. A host-based intrusion detection system is a common implementation of intrusion detection, not a conceptual approach.\nSource: KRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, John Wiley & Sons, 2001, Chapter 3:\nTelecommunications and Network Security (page 63).\nAlso: HARRIS, Shon, All-In-One CISSP Certification Exam Guide, McGraw-Hill/Osborne, 2002, chapter 4: Access Control (pages 193-194).","timestamp":"2023-11-28 01:27:00","choices":{"D":"Host-based intrusion detection","C":"Statistical anomaly-based intrusion detection","A":"Behavior-based intrusion detection","B":"Knowledge-based intrusion detection"},"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_text":"Which conceptual approach to intrusion detection system is the most common?","answer":"C","answer_ET":"B","question_id":105,"isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/127361-exam-sscp-topic-3-question-41-discussion/","topic":"3"}],"exam":{"provider":"Isc","isMCOnly":true,"isBeta":false,"id":189,"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","numberOfQuestions":161,"name":"SSCP"},"currentPage":21},"__N_SSP":true}
