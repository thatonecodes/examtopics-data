Metadata, on the other hand, is automatically generated and includes a wide range of details (like file size, creation date, file type, and sometimes even labels). This breadth of information makes metadata a more efficient and comprehensive method for automated data discovery, as it doesn’t rely solely on the presence of human-assigned labels.","comment_id":"1359270","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"1304006","upvote_count":"1","content":"Labels","timestamp":"1730125680.0","poster":"rkumar16d"},{"content":"Should be Labels","poster":"rkumar16d","timestamp":"1729880940.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1302979"},{"content":"Should be Labels.","timestamp":"1726713180.0","comment_id":"1286101","poster":"Dasccsp","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"jimmyraj18","content":"C.Labels","comment_id":"1205179","timestamp":"1714584060.0","upvote_count":"2"},{"poster":"akg001","timestamp":"1652958900.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
