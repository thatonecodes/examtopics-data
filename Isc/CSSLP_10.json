Qualitative risk analysis. This type of analysis prioritizes risks according to their likelihood and potential impact on the project objectives, without quantifying them numerically. It provides an opportunity for subjective judgments from stakeholders to inform the process and help frame subsequent steps in risk response planning. A quantitative risk analysis involves numerical estimates, simulations or modeling techniques for a more rigorous examination of project risks; while a probability-impact matrix considers both probability (likelihood) and impact (consequence), typically using a four-quadrant chart that makes it easy to visualize and prioritize risks. The seven-risk responses are associated with the process of dealing with risks once they have been analyzed as part of a broader Risk Management Plan.","upvote_count":"1"},{"comment_id":"629142","timestamp":"1688902740.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
