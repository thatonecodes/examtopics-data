Single-pass wipe\n\nExplanation:\nSecurity:\nA single-pass wipe overwrites the data on the hard drive with random or specified data (e.g., all zeroes). This ensures the data is effectively erased and makes it virtually impossible for unauthorized recovery using standard techniques.\n\nDrive Functionality:\nUnlike degaussing or physically destroying the drive, a single-pass wipe preserves the operational integrity of the drive. This allows the hard drive to remain functional, maximizing the resale value to the vendor.\n\nEfficiency:\nA single-pass wipe is faster than multi-pass wiping methods, which perform multiple overwrites. Most modern studies suggest that a single overwrite is sufficient to prevent data recovery on modern drives.\n\nMulti-pass wipes:\nWhile multi-pass wipes offer slightly higher security, they are overkill for most modern hard drives, as a single-pass wipe is sufficient. Multi-pass wiping also takes significantly more time and could cause unnecessary wear on the drive.","comments":[{"poster":"J_Ko","content":"The question specifically states \"most secure\" -even if not by much, multiple passes are more secure than single pass.

By granting administrative privileges on the web server, the support team would be able to access the logs without having complete control over the underlying OS or other applications running on the same VM.\n\n\nGranting administrative privileges on the hypervisor or the OS would give the support team access to more than just the application logs, which could pose a security risk.
