Therefore, a CSRF vulnerability that affects highly privileged users, such as administrators, could result in a full application compromise. During a successful CSRF attack, the victim’s web browser is tricked by a malicious website into unwanted action – it sends HTTP requests to the web application as intended by the attacker. Normally, such a request would involve submitting forms present on the web application to alter some data.\nhttps://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/cross-site-request-forgery/"},{"content":"The answer should be Cross-site scripting not CSRF.","comment_id":"28547","timestamp":"1591783500.0","upvote_count":"14","poster":"muyenzo"},{"timestamp":"1740298980.0","comment_id":"1360430","poster":"MaciekMT","content":"Selected Answer: D\nCSRF exploits a user's authenticated session to trick their browser into executing unauthorized actions on a trusted site without their knowledge.
