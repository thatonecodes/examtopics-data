Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE)\n\nExplanation:\n\nLayer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is often used in conjunction with Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) for creating secure virtual private network (VPN) connections. MPPE is a protocol that provides encryption for the data sent over the L2TP connection, ensuring the confidentiality and security of the communication.\n\nThis is a trick question.

IPSec\n\nPeter will use IP Security (IPSec) to accomplish the task because IPSec provides a framework for securing IP communications and ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted across a public network. It offers encryption capabilities that can be used to encrypt data sent through the Internet. By implementing IPSec with L2TP, Peter can establish secure tunneling for remote users connecting to the private network of Net World Inc., thereby protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.","comments":[],"poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1713647700.0"}],"answer_ET":"A","unix_timestamp":1697836500,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124144-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-4-discussion/","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"answer_description":""},{"id":"vvZWhWxjnEqw3EkyxByV","question_text":"Which of the following types of halon is found in portable extinguishers and is stored as a liquid?","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"C":"Halon 11","D":"Halon 1211","B":"Halon 1301","A":"Halon-f"},"timestamp":"2020-07-10 00:43:00","topic":"1","answer_description":"","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answer":"D","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729637640.0","content":"D.\n\nIt is stored as a liquid under pressure and vaporizes when discharged to suppress fires.","comment_id":"1051191","poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1"},{"comments":[{"comment_id":"648551","upvote_count":"1","content":"Halon 1301 is used only in fixed extinguisher installations typically cargo holds or engines and is a total flooding agent.","timestamp":"1692381420.0","poster":"Stevey"}],"timestamp":"1625870580.0","poster":"cisspdubai","content":"What is the difference between Halon 1301 and 1211?\nhalon 1211 is a liquefied, compressed gas contain- ing carbon, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. it has a slightly greater toxicity than halon 1301 and is used with hand-held portable fire extinguishers and wheeled and outdoor mobile streaming devices.","comment_id":"131008","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":[],"exam_id":186,"question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1594334580,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/25278-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-40-discussion/","question_id":32},{"id":"KHF7t4aZzaVwoU6T8dNB","timestamp":"2023-10-23 00:56:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124406-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-41-discussion/","answer_description":"","isMC":true,"answer":"C","question_text":"Mark has been hired by a company to work as a Network Assistant.

Which of the following protocols should he disable to ensure that the password is encrypted during remote access?","discussion":[{"comment_id":"1051192","content":"Selected Answer: C\ndisable C. PAP (Password Authentication Protocol).\n\nPAP sends passwords in clear text format, without encryption, which makes it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. Disabling PAP ensures that the password is not transmitted insecurely over the network.\n\nOn the other hand, several authentication protocols provide stronger security by encrypting passwords during remote access. The available options are:\n\nA. SPAP (Shiva Password Authentication Protocol): This protocol uses one-way hashing to protect passwords in transit and offers better security than PAP.\nB. MSCHAP (Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol): Introduced as an improvement over CHAP, MSCHAP encrypts passwords using reversible encryption.\nD. MSCHAP V2: An even more secure version of MSCHAPP that provides mutual authentication through the use of digital certificates.\n\nTherefore, disabling PAP and enabling any of the stronger authentication protocols like SPAP or MSCHAP/MSCAHPP V2 would help ensure that the password is encrypted during remote access configuration on a laptop for a dial-up connection.","timestamp":"1729637760.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"74gjd_37"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":33,"exam_id":186,"unix_timestamp":1698015360,"answer_ET":"C","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"MSCHAP V2","A":"SPAP","B":"MSCHAP","C":"PAP"}},{"id":"Ot7OC4yRHg6nB41gtbBy","choices":{"A":"Structured walk-through test","D":"Parallel test","B":"Simulation test","C":"Full-interruption test"},"question_images":[],"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/83918-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-42-discussion/","answer":"C","isMC":true,"unix_timestamp":1664376840,"answer_ET":"C","question_text":"Which of the following disaster recovery tests includes the operations that shut down at the primary site, and are shifted to the recovery site according to the disaster recovery plan?","answer_images":[],"topic":"1","question_id":34,"answer_description":"","exam_id":186,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"74gjd_37","content":"Selected Answer: C\nrom an ISC2 CISS-ISSAP perspective, the scenario described aligns with C. Full-interruption test.\n\nIn a full-interruption test, all operations at the primary site are deliberately shut down to simulate a complete failure or disaster situation. These operations are then shifted and resumed at the recovery site according to the organization's established disaster recovery plan. This test helps evaluate the effectiveness of the plan in managing a full-scale disruption and measures how well systems can be brought up and functional at the recovery site.\n\nLet's briefly describe the other options for clarity:\n\nA. Structured walk-through test: A structured walk-through involves discussing and reviewing procedures without actual execution, typically involving key personnel going through various aspects of a plan or process.\nB. Simulation test: A simulation test aims to replicate specific scenarios or events related to potential disasters but does not involve actually shutting down operations.\nD. Parallel test: In parallel testing, both primary and secondary sites are operational simultaneously as part of normal business processes to assess functionality and performance without experiencing an actual disruption.","timestamp":"1729638480.0","comment_id":"1051202"},{"timestamp":"1695912840.0","poster":"Banzaaai","comment_id":"681819","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
