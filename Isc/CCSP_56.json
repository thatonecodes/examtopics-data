This ensures that sensitive information is removed before repurposing or disposing of storage media.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nB. Nullification → Not a standard term in data sanitization.\nC. Blanking → This term is sometimes used interchangeably with clearing, but zeroing specifically refers to overwriting with zeroes.\nD. Deleting → Simply removes file pointers but does not actually erase the data, making it recoverable with forensic tools."},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1318851","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA. Overwriting\n\nOverwriting involves replacing existing data on a storage medium with a pattern of data, typically zeros, to prevent recovery of the original data. This process is often called \"zeroing\" because it frequently involves writing zeros over the data to ensure it is securely erased.","timestamp":"1732734480.0","poster":"Sivath"},{"content":"Not sure how it is Overwriting:\nOverwriting: Writing random data over the actual data.

This prevents the application from affecting the host system and limits potential security risks, such as malware execution or unintended system modifications.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Abstracting → Involves separating functionality or resources but does not specifically isolate an application for testing.\nB.
