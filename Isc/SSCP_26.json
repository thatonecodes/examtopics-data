A differential backup leaves the archive bits unchanged on the files it copies.\nSource: KRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, John Wiley & Sons, 2001, Chapter 3:\nTelecommunications and Network Security (page 69).\nAlso see: http://e-articles.info/e/a/title/Backup-Types/\nBackup software can use or ignore the archive bit in determining which files to back up, and can either turn the archive bit off or leave it unchanged when the backup is complete. How the archive bit is used and manipulated determines what type of backup is done, as follows\n\nFull backup -\nA full backup, which Microsoft calls a normal backup, backs up every selected file, regardless of the status of the archive bit. When the backup completes, the backup software turns off the archive bit for every file that was backed up. Note that \"full\" is a misnomer because a full backup backs up only the files you have selected, which may be as little as one directory or even a single file, so in that sense Microsoft's terminology is actually more accurate. Given the choice, full backup is the method to use because all files are on one tape, which makes it much easier to retrieve files from tape when necessary. Relative to partial backups, full backups also increase redundancy because all files are on all tapes. That means that if one tape fails, you may still be able to retrieve a given file from another tape.\n\nDifferential backup -\nA differential backup is a partial backup that copies a selected file to tape only if the archive bit for that file is turned on, indicating that it has changed since the last full backup. A differential backup leaves the archive bits unchanged on the files it copies. Accordingly, any differential backup set contains all files that have changed since the last full backup. A differential backup set run soon after a full backup will contain relatively few files. One run soon before the next full backup is due will contain many files, including those contained on all previous differential backup sets since the last full backup. When you use differential backup, a complete backup set comprises only two tapes or tape sets: the tape that contains the last full backup and the tape that contains the most recent differential backup.\n\nIncremental backup -\nAn incremental backup is another form of partial backup. Like differential backups, Incremental Backups copy a selected file to tape only if the archive bit for that file is turned on. Unlike the differential backup, however, the incremental backup clears the archive bits for the files it backs up. An incremental backup set therefore contains only files that have changed since the last full backup or the last incremental backup. If you run an incremental backup daily, files changed on\nMonday are on the Monday tape, files changed on Tuesday are on the Tuesday tape, and so forth. When you use an incremental backup scheme, a complete backup set comprises the tape that contains the last full backup and all of the tapes that contain every incremental backup done since the last normal backup. The only advantages of incremental backups are that they minimize backup time and keep multiple versions of files that change frequently. The disadvantages are that backed-up files are scattered across multiple tapes, making it difficult to locate any particular file you need to restore, and that there is no redundancy. That is, each file is stored only on one tape.\n\nFull copy backup -\nA full copy backup (which Microsoft calls a copy backup) is identical to a full backup except for the last step. The full backup finishes by turning off the archive bit on all files that have been backed up. The full copy backup instead leaves the archive bits unchanged. The full copy backup is useful only if you are using a combination of full backups and incremental or differential partial backups. The full copy backup allows you to make a duplicate \"full\" backupe.g., for storage offsite, without altering the state of the hard drive you are backing up, which would destroy the integrity of the partial backup rotation.\nSome Microsoft backup software provides a bizarre backup method Microsoft calls a daily copy backup. This method ignores the archive bit entirely and instead depends on the date- and timestamp of files to determine which files should be backed up. The problem is, it's quite possible for software to change a file without changing the date- and timestamp, or to change the date- and timestamp without changing the contents of the file. For this reason, we regard the daily copy backup as entirely unreliable and recommend you avoid using it.","question_images":[]},{"id":"qsbZQvC3p8O2GE8A4U0h","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2022-08-01 00:27:00","answer_description":"Scanning is definitively a very active attack. The attacker will make use of a scanner to perform the attack, the scanner will send a very large quantity of packets to the target in order to illicit responses that allows the attacker to find information about the operating system, vulnerabilities, misconfiguration and more. The packets being sent are sometimes attempting to identify if a known vulnerability exist on the remote hosts.\nA passive attack is usually done in the footprinting phase of an attack. While doing your passive reconnaissance you never send a single packet to the destination target. You gather information from public databases such as the DNS servers, public information through search engines, financial information from finance web sites, and technical infomation from mailing list archive or job posting for example.\nAn attack can be active or passive.\nAn \"active attack\" attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.\nA \"passive attack\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. (E.g., see: wiretapping.)\nThe following are all incorrect answers because they are all passive attacks:\nTraffic Analysis - Is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication. It can be performed even when the messages are encrypted and cannot be decrypted. In general, the greater the number of messages observed, or even intercepted and stored, the more can be inferred from the traffic. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of military intelligence or counter-intelligence, and is a concern in computer security.\nEavesdropping - Eavesdropping is another security risk posed to networks. Because of the way some networks are built, anything that gets sent out is broadcast to everyone. Under normal circumstances, only the computer that the data was meant for will process that information. However, hackers can set up programs on their computers called \"sniffers\" that capture all data being broadcast over the network. By carefully examining the data, hackers can often reconstruct real data that was never meant for them. Some of the most damaging things that get sniffed include passwords and credit card information.\nIn the cryptographic context, Eavesdropping and sniffing data as it passes over a network are considered passive attacks because the attacker is not affecting the protocol, algorithm, key, message, or any parts of the encryption system. Passive attacks are hard to detect, so in most cases methods are put in place to try to prevent them rather than to detect and stop them. Altering messages, modifying system files, and masquerading as another individual are acts that are considered active attacks because the attacker is actually doing something instead of sitting back and gathering data. Passive attacks are usually used to gain information prior to carrying out an active attack.\"\nWiretapping - Wiretapping refers to listening in on electronic communications on telephones, computers, and other devices. Many governments use it as a law enforcement tool, and it is also used in fields like corporate espionage to gain access to privileged information. Depending on where in the world one is, wiretapping may be tightly controlled with laws that are designed to protect privacy rights, or it may be a widely accepted practice with little or no protections for citizens. Several advocacy organizations have been established to help civilians understand these laws in their areas, and to fight illegal wiretapping.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nHARRIS, Shon, All-In-One CISSP Certification Exam Guide, 6th Edition, Cryptography, Page 865 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_%28computing%29 and http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-wiretapping.htm and https://pangea.stanford.edu/computing/resources/network/security/risks.php and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis","answer_images":[],"question_id":127,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/77844-exam-sscp-topic-4-question-99-discussion/","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721422260.0","comment_id":"781676","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nScanning is considered a passive attack because it does not involve any alteration or manipulation of the target system or network.

A public-key certificate\n\nA public-key certificate, often simply called a certificate, binds a subject's name (such as an individual or entity) to a public key value. It provides a means of verifying that a given public key indeed belongs to the entity claimed in the certificate. Public-key certificates are a fundamental component of public key infrastructure (PKI) systems and play a critical role in secure communication, digital signatures, and identity verification on the internet and in various secure systems.","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"B":"A public key infrastructure","C":"A secret key infrastructure","D":"A private key certificate A","A":"A public-key certificate"},"exam_id":189,"question_text":"Which of the following binds a subject name to a public key value?","answer_description":"Remember the term Public-Key Certificate is synonymous with Digital Certificate or Identity certificate.\nThe certificate itself provides the binding but it is the certificate authority who will go through the Certificate Practice Statements (CPS) actually validating the bindings and vouch for the identity of the owner of the key within the certificate.\nAs explained in Wikipedia:\nIn cryptography, a public key certificate (also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate) is an electronic document which uses a digital signature to bind together a public key with an identity information such as the name of a person or an organization, their address, and so forth. The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual.\nIn a typical public key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the signature will be of a certificate authority (CA). In a web of trust scheme such as PGP or GPG, the signature is of either the user (a self-signed certificate) or other users (\"endorsements\") by getting people to sign each other keys. In either case, the signatures on a certificate are attestations by the certificate signer that the identity information and the public key belong together.\nRFC 2828 defines the certification authority (CA) as:\nAn entity that issues digital certificates (especially X.509 certificates) and vouches for the binding between the data items in a certificate.\nAn authority trusted by one or more users to create and assign certificates. Optionally, the certification authority may create the user's keys.\nX509 Certificate users depend on the validity of information provided by a certificate. Thus, a CA should be someone that certificate users trust, and usually holds an official position created and granted power by a government, a corporation, or some other organization. A CA is responsible for managing the life cycle of certificates and, depending on the type of certificate and the CPS that applies, may be responsible for the life cycle of key pairs associated with the certificates\nSource: SHIREY, Robert W., RFC2828: Internet Security Glossary, may 2000. and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/120782-exam-sscp-topic-5-question-124-discussion/","topic":"5","unix_timestamp":1694757120,"timestamp":"2023-09-15 07:52:00"},{"id":"RAO1sk0ui0ymUe1Q5vYe","answer_images":[],"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/120783-exam-sscp-topic-5-question-125-discussion/","question_text":"What can be defined as a digital certificate that binds a set of descriptive data items, other than a public key, either directly to a subject name or to the identifier of another certificate that is a public-key certificate?","answer_description":"The Internet Security Glossary (RFC2828) defines an attribute certificate as a digital certificate that binds a set of descriptive data items, other than a public key, either directly to a subject name or to the identifier of another certificate that is a public-key certificate.
