In SDLC, it is the environment where developers and testers work on creating, modifying, and testing software applications before deploying them into a production environment.\n\nFrom a CISSP perspective, lower environments are testing and development environments that replicate the configurations of production systems as closely as possible. By applying the patch to a lower environment first, the security engineer can evaluate its performance and ensure that it doesn't negatively impact any critical system functionality or cause conflicts with existing applications. This approach also allows them to identify and fix any issues before deploying the patch into a production environment where live users may be affected.","timestamp":"1711282800.0","comment_id":"1015668","poster":"74gjd_37"},{"upvote_count":"2","comment_id":"804860","timestamp":"1691703000.0","comments":[{"content":"A is correct","poster":"jackdryan","comment_id":"896359","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699847340.0"}],"content":"D: It should be the Production environment, since the new patch has been researched and approved with recommendations...","poster":"SaintDaSinner"},{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe patch should be applied FIRST in the lower environment. This is because the lower environment is typically used for testing and staging, and any issues or problems with the patch can be identified and addressed before it is deployed in more critical environments such as the production environment. It is important to test patches and updates in a controlled environment before deploying them to the live production systems to ensure that they do not cause any disruptions or issues. This is especially important when working with vulnerability and patch management, as it is important to ensure that vulnerabilities are properly patched and that the patch does not cause any additional problems.","timestamp":"1688835240.0","poster":"DJOEK","comment_id":"769730"},{"comment_id":"714891","content":"Selected Answer: A\nLower environments are complete replicas of production and are designed to test new releases before installing them in production. They're only accessible internally and not to external consumers.\n\nThe idea is simple, you build out a smaller scale model of your production solution. A percentage of your user base is provisioned on this system and they use it for day-to-day operations. In every way, the “lower environment” solution should be treated like production. Meaning, it is connected into your production network and uses the same security measures applied in production, Integrates with LDAP, uses the corporate antivirus, etc. etc. It should be subjected to the same change control policies or a special subset of those policies. The main difference is that the lower environment is where new software versions, feature sets, configurations, etc. pop up after they are researched and vetted in the lab.","timestamp":"1683681000.0","upvote_count":"2","poster":"Jamati"},{"poster":"sec_007","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD\nIt is not clear what method they are using for patch approval.
