A single NIDS sensor can oversee an entire subnet, whereas HIDS must be installed and maintained on each individual host.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Segregated from host systems: While true, this is not the primary advantage. NIDS operates separately from the monitored hosts, but HIDS provides deeper insight into host-level activities.\nB. Network access: Both NIDS and HIDS have network access in different ways—NIDS at the packet level, and HIDS at the system level. Network access itself isn't the key differentiator.\nD. External to system patching: While NIDS is external to host patching, this does not directly impact its primary function or advantage over HIDS.","timestamp":"1740299520.0","comment_id":"1360434","poster":"MaciekMT","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1734629100.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"lolanczos","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThis is A. A network-based IDS (NIDS) operates independently of the systems it monitors. This segregation provides an advantage because the IDS is not directly affected by issues on the host, such as system crashes, resource limitations, or compromises, ensuring continued monitoring and detection.\n\nThe others are ruled out.\n\nB. Network access: Both host-based and network-based IDSs can monitor network traffic, but NIDS specifically analyzes packets as they traverse the network. This is not an exclusive advantage over host-based IDS.\nC. Scalability: NIDS can scale by monitoring entire network segments, but scalability is not an inherent advantage over host-based IDS since both can be designed for scalability.\nD. External to system patching: While NIDS is external to hosts, system patching is not a primary factor distinguishing its advantage. Both systems need updates to remain effective.","comment_id":"1329078"},{"comment_id":"1317440","poster":"Sivath","content":"An advantage of a network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) over a host-based IDS, assuming all capabilities are equal, is:\n\nA.
