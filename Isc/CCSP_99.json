Let's address the question directly:\n\nWhen is a virtual machine susceptible to attacks while a physical server in the same state would not be?\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. When it is powered off\n\nExplanation:\n\n Powered-off Virtual Machine (VM): Even when a virtual machine is powered off, its virtual disks and configurations are still stored on the hypervisor's storage system. While access to these resources is typically secured, vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited through administrative interfaces or if snapshots are not properly managed or encrypted.\n\n Powered-off Physical Server: A powered-off physical server, on the other hand, typically requires physical access to the server hardware to compromise its data or security.
