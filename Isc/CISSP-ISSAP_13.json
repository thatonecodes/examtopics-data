Digital signature.\n\nDigital signatures are used to authenticate asymmetric keys. They provide a means to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages or documents by using a cryptographic algorithm that uses both private and public keys. The digital signature ensures that the message has not been tampered with during transmission and that it was indeed sent by the claimed sender.","poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1049136","timestamp":"1729460100.0"}],"answer":"A","unix_timestamp":1697837700,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"9TTXHnU0Yy1FNplWufRH","question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"SSL","D":"IPSec","B":"HTTPS","A":"L2TP"},"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1721328600.0","comment_id":"1126187","upvote_count":"1","poster":"n00r1","content":"The protocol commonly used by VPNs for tunneling is:\n\nD.
