This policy also provides singleness of focus. For instance, a network administrator who is concerned with providing users access to resources should never be the security administrator.

Separation of Duties is a preventative control.\nMandatory Vacations: Prevents an operator from having exclusive use of a system. Periodically, that individual is forced to take a vacation and relegate control of the system to someone else. This policy is a detective control.\nJob rotation: Similar in purpose to mandatory vacations, but with the added benefit of cross-training employees.\nLeast privilege: Allowing users to have only the required access to do their jobs.\nNeed to know: In addition to clearance, users must also have “need to know” to access classified data.\nDual control: Requiring more than one user to perform a task.","poster":"xaccan","upvote_count":"4"},{"content":"u shud do CISSP before CCSP to get answer to such questions.","poster":"ludoodul","timestamp":"1705751280.0","comment_id":"271921","upvote_count":"4"},{"poster":"xaccan","timestamp":"1719598380.0","comment_id":"393174","upvote_count":"2","content":"you need to study CISSP to know why manadatory vacation is correct"},{"timestamp":"1712046720.0","upvote_count":"3","poster":"pooppants","comment_id":"326444","content":"its to reduce single point of failures.
