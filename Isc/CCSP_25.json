It is commonly used to prevent one entity from consuming enormous amounts of resources and having an operational impact on other tenants within the same cloud system. Limits can either be hard or somewhat flexible, meaning a customer can borrow from other customers while still having their actual limit preserved. A reservation is a guarantee to a cloud customer that a certain level of resources will always be available to them, regardless of what operational demands are currently placed on the cloud environment. Both cap and throttle are terms that sound similar to limit, but they are not the correct terms in this case.","answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Throttle","B":"Cap","A":"Limit","D":"Reservation"},"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2021-03-28 10:06:00","answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","question_text":"In order to prevent cloud customers from potentially consuming enormous amounts of resources within a cloud environment and thus having a negative impact on other customers, what concept is commonly used by a cloud provider?"},{"id":"9CNNwPUCSgLotjkYCQ0e","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/75886-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-208-discussion/","answer_description":"","topic":"1","answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Host system","C":"Application server","D":"Database server","A":"Network firewall"},"timestamp":"2022-05-19 14:38:00","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1740126420.0","comment_id":"1359682","content":"Selected Answer: B\nDLP solutions that monitor data at rest are generally deployed on host systems.
