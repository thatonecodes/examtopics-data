Live testing is not part of static testing but rather is associated with dynamic testing. Production system scanning is not appropriate because static testing is done against offline systems.\nInjection attempts are done with many different types of testing and are not unique to one particular type. It is therefore not the best answer to the question.","exam_id":184,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.

In many instances, the cloud provider will supply audit reports or some general information about their physical security practices, especially to those customers or potential customers that may have regulatory requirements, but otherwise the cloud customer will have very little insight into the physical environment.

It permanently replaces sensitive data with masked values, ensuring that test environments do not contain real PII or confidential data.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Dynamic → Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) masks data only at query time, meaning the original data remains unchanged in the database—not suitable for creating a separate test dataset.\nB. Tokenized → Tokenization replaces sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent (token), but it typically maintains a mapping back to the original data, making it less ideal for testing where true anonymization is needed.\nC.

Without data being organized in such a manner, it is extremely difficult for programmatic tools to automatically synthesize and make determinations from it. The overall quantity of data, as well as the number of sources, does not pose an enormous challenge for data discovery programs, other than requiring a longer time to process the data.
