Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nESAPI offers a set of libraries that includes functionality such as user authentication and input validation, which significantly reduces the risk of common web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. It simplifies coding by incorporating standardized security practices into existing applications rather than requiring extensive changes to be made manually.\n\nWatermarking, encryption wrappers, and code obfuscation are not specifically designed for adding security features to applications but have other uses in different contexts related to software development.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"74gjd_37","content":"ESAPI is an open-source library developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) community. It provides standard security functions for software developers to easily implement into their applications, aiming to reduce common web application vulnerabilities. The core team consists of experienced professionals who have been working on software security and testing projects for several years. ESAPI includes input validation, output encoding, access control, cryptographic functionalities and audit logging components ready for implementation. Due to its adaptability across various languages like Java, PHP & Python it has become well-supported when implementing secure web-based infrastructures.","comment_id":"1021719","timestamp":"1727714640.0"}],"poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1021718"}],"isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following provides an easy way to programmers for writing lower-risk applications and retrofitting security into an existing application?","unix_timestamp":1696092240,"question_images":[],"question_id":166,"answer_images":[]},{"id":"EH3pr7vGvpuRruJxr5ms","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_ET":"C","timestamp":"2023-10-01 19:46:00","answer_images":[],"question_id":167,"topic":"2","question_text":"In which of the following deployment models of cloud is the cloud infrastructure operated exclusively for an organization?","exam_id":188,"choices":{"D":"Hybrid cloud","A":"Public cloud","C":"Private cloud","B":"Community cloud"},"answer":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/122114-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-81-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1696182360,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727804760.0","comment_id":"1022574","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

It identifies four procedures that must be defined for each software project to ensure that a sound SCM process is implemented. They are as follows: 1.Configuration identification: Configuration identification is the process of identifying the attributes that define every aspect of a configuration item. A configuration item is a product (hardware and/or software) that has an end-user purpose. These attributes are recorded in configuration documentation and baselined. 2.Configuration change control: Configuration change control is a set of processes and approval stages required to change a configuration item's attributes and to re-baseline them. 3.Configuration status accounting: Configuration status accounting is the ability to record and report on the configuration baselines associated with each configuration item at any moment of time. 4.Configuration audits: Configuration audits are broken into functional and physical configuration audits. They occur either at delivery or at the moment of effecting the change. A functional configuration audit ensures that functional and performance attributes of a configuration item are achieved, while a physical configuration audit ensures that a configuration item is installed in accordance with the requirements of its detailed design documentation.","isMC":true,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/122115-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-82-discussion/","answer":"ABCD","choices":{"C":"Configuration identification","D":"Configuration audits","A":"Configuration status accounting","E":"Configuration implementation","B":"Configuration change control","F":"Configuration deployment"},"answers_community":["ABCD (100%)"],"topic":"2","answer_ET":"ABCD","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727804820.0","comment_id":"1022576","content":"Selected Answer: ABCD\nA.

Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses who want to be prepared for anything that could happen. Contingency plans include specific strategies and actions to deal with specific variances to assumptions resulting in a particular problem, emergency, or state of affairs. They also include a monitoring process and \"triggers\" for initiating planned actions.
