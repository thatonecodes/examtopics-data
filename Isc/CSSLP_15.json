Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together (\"big bang\"). Normally the former is considered a better practice since it allows interface issues to be localized more quickly and fixed. Integration testing works to expose defects in the interfaces and interaction between the integrated components (modules). Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and tested until the software works as a system. regressions, or old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the an object-oriented environment, this is usually at the class level, and the minimal unit tests include the constructors and destructors. These types of tests are usually written by developers as they work on code (white-box style), to ensure that the specific function is working as expected. One function might have multiple tests, to catch corner cases or other branches in the code. Unit testing alone cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but rather is used to assure that including specifications, requirements, and design to derive test cases. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional. The test designer selects valid and invalid inputs and determines the correct output. There is no knowledge of the test object's internal structure. This method of test design is applicable to all levels of software testing: unit, integration, functional testing, system and acceptance. The higher the level, and hence the bigger and more complex the box, the more one is forced to use black box testing to simplify. While this method can uncover unimplemented parts of the specification, one cannot be sure that all existent paths are tested.","answer_ET":"Answer: A is incorrect.

The data custodian implements the information classification scheme after the initial assignment by the data owner is the statement that best describes the difference between the role of a data owner and a data custodian.\n\nThe data owner is responsible for classifying information based on its sensitivity, value, and criticality to an organization. Once this task is done, they define access rights and control policies for each classification level (e.g., Public, Confidential, Private). In contrast, a data custodian has operational responsibility for protecting classified assets or sensitive information according to rules established by owners while ensuring compliance with industry regulations.
