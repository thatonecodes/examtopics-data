The token does not authenticate the token owner but the system.\n\nIn the context of static password tokens, the token itself is typically a physical device or a piece of information (such as a password) that is known to both the user and the system. The user presents the token (e.g., enters the password) to the system, and the system verifies whether the presented token matches the one it expects.\n\nSo, the token (password in this case) is used by the user to authenticate themselves to the system. The token doesn't authenticate the user; rather, it is used by the user to authenticate to the system.","upvote_count":"1"}],"exam_id":189,"answers_community":[],"answer_ET":"A","timestamp":"2024-01-04 02:49:00","isMC":true,"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"The owner identity is authenticated by the token","D":"The token does not authenticates the token owner but the system.","C":"The owner will authenticate himself to the system.","B":"The owner will never be authenticated by the token."},"answer_description":"Password Tokens -\nTokens are electronic devices or cards that supply a user's password for them. A token system can be used to supply either a static or a dynamic password.\nThere is a big difference between the static and dynamic systems, a static system will normally log a user in but a dynamic system the user will often have to log themselves in.\nStatic Password Tokens:\nThe owner identity is authenticated by the token. This is done by the person who issues the token to the owner (normally the employer). The owner of the token is now authenticated by \"something you have\". The token authenticates the identity of the owner to the information system. An example of this occurring is when an employee swipes his or her smart card over an electronic lock to gain access to a store room.\nSynchronous Dynamic Password Tokens:\nThis system is a lot more complex then the static token password. The synchronous dynamic password tokens generate new passwords at certain time intervals that are synched with the main system. The password is generated on a small device similar to a pager or a calculator that can often be attached to the user's key ring. Each password is only valid for a certain time period, typing in the wrong password in the wrong time period will invalidate the authentication. The time factor can also be the systems downfall. If a clock on the system or the password token device becomes out of synch, a user can have troubles authenticating themselves to the system.\nAsynchronous Dynamic Password Tokens:\nThe clock synching problem is eliminated with asynchronous dynamic password tokens. This system works on the same principal as the synchronous one but it does not have a time frame. A lot of big companies use this system especially for employee's who may work from home on the companies VPN (Virtual private\nNetwork).\nChallenge Response Tokens:\nThis is an interesting system. A user will be sent special \"challenge\" strings at either random or timed intervals. The user inputs this challenge string into their token device and the device will respond by generating a challenge response. The user then types this response into the system and if it is correct they are authenticated.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nhttp://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=security&seqNum=146 and\nKRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Page 37.","question_id":67,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/130258-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-81-discussion/","question_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following would be true about Static password tokens?"},{"id":"h1ORbzWLLhKU1nOzRY16","question_id":68,"choices":{"D":"MicroBiometrics","C":"Macrometrics","A":"Biometrics","B":"Micrometrics"},"isMC":true,"topic":"1","timestamp":"2023-11-18 00:51:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/126491-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-84-discussion/","answer_images":[],"exam_id":189,"unix_timestamp":1700265060,"question_text":"What is called an automated means of identifying or authenticating the identity of a living person based on physiological or behavioral characteristics?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1727466240.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: A\nBiometrics","comment_id":"1184403","poster":"e098e9c"},{"timestamp":"1726600560.0","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1176067","content":"Selected Answer: A\nBiometrics; Biometrics are defined as an automated means of identifying or authenticating the identity of a living person based on physiological","poster":"o0cscore0o"},{"poster":"DefenestrateIT","content":"This question is a duplicate.","comment_id":"1073723","timestamp":"1715982660.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_ET":"The Answer: Biometrics; Biometrics are defined as an automated means of identifying or authenticating the identity of a living person based on physiological or","answer_description":"behavioral characteristics.\nSource: KRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Pages\n37,38.","answer":"A","question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"xwtt0qQwfz4HR3la92Wq","topic":"1","answer":"A","exam_id":189,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/96701-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-87-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"poster":"Turbowet","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1287531","content":"Selected Answer: A\nFalse Rejection Rate (FRR) or Type I Error.","timestamp":"1726976940.0"},{"comment_id":"786142","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe percentage of valid subjects that are falsely rejected is called the False Rejection Rate (FRR) or Type I Error.","timestamp":"1674531120.0","poster":"bradseth","upvote_count":"2"}],"question_id":69,"choices":{"C":"Crossover Error Rate (CER)","D":"True Rejection Rate (TRR) or Type III Error A","B":"False Acceptance Rate (FAR) or Type II Error","A":"False Rejection Rate (FRR) or Type I Error"},"question_text":"What is called the percentage of valid subjects that are falsely rejected by a Biometric Authentication system?","question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-01-24 04:32:00","unix_timestamp":1674531120,"answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","isMC":true},{"id":"EQqhyvBB1ggPZgEKTTPv","answer":"D","answers_community":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":70,"question_text":"A timely review of system access audit records would be an example of which of the basic security functions?","question_images":[],"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1724946360.0","comment_id":"1274602","content":"not part","upvote_count":"1","poster":"ferdzbernz"},{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"Niitetteh","content":"Answer D","comment_id":"881696","timestamp":"1682517240.0"}],"choices":{"A":"avoidance.","C":"prevention.","D":"detection.","B":"deterrence."},"exam_id":189,"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-04-26 15:54:00","answer_description":"By reviewing system logs you can detect events that have occured.\nThe following answers are incorrect:\navoidance.
