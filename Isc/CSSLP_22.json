Such transformations are known as inherent and targeted, respectively. An example of an inherent preventive transformation is reordering a for-loop to run backward. Such reordering is possible if the loop has no loop-carried data dependencies. A deobfuscator could perform the same analysis and reorder the loop to forward execution. However, if a bogus data dependency is added to the reversed loop, the identification of the loop and its reordering would be prevented.\n\nSource: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1999001815A1/en"}],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"Preventive transformation increases the difficulty for a de-obfuscation tool so that it cannot extract the true application from the obfuscated version.","question_text":"Which of the following types of obfuscation transformation increases the difficulty for a de-obfuscation tool so that it cannot extract the true application from the obfuscated version?"},{"id":"lYhvx6y9ksDb90ebgaOH","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1021760","poster":"74gjd_37","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Hackers and crackers use this technique to obtain unauthorized information.\nPort scanning is the first basic step to get the details of open ports on the target system. Port scanning is used to find a hackable server with a hole or vulnerability.\nA port is a medium of communication between two computers. Every service on a host is identified by a unique 16-bit number called a port. A port scanner is a piece of software designed to search a network host for open ports. This is often used by administrators to check the security of their networks and by hackers to identify running services on a host with the view to compromising it. Port scanning is used to find the open ports, so that it is possible to search exploits related to distance calls. As telephone networks have become computerized, phreaking has become closely linked with computer hacking.

DDoS attack occurs when multiple compromised systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more Web servers. These systems are compromised by attackers using a variety of methods. It is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. This type of attack can cause the following to occur: Saturate network resources. Disrupt connections between two computers, guessing attack. This type of attack uses a dictionary of common words to find out the password of a user. It can also use common words in either upper or lower attack, an IDS accepts a packet and assumes that the host computer will also accept it. But in reality, when a host system rejects the packet, the IDS accepts the evasion attack is one in which an IDS rejects a malicious packet but the host computer accepts it. Since an IDS has rejected it, it does not check the contents of the packet. Hence, using this technique, an attacker can exploit the host computer. In many cases, it is quite simple for an attacker to send such data packets that can easily perform evasion attacks on an IDSs.","timestamp":"2023-09-30 19:31:00","question_text":"Which of the following types of attacks is targeting a Web server with multiple compromised computers that are simultaneously sending hundreds of FIN packets with spoofed IP source IP addresses?","question_id":108,"answer_ET":"thereby preventing communications between services.

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack involves multiple compromised computers, often referred to as a botnet or zombie army, that target a single server with an overwhelming number of requests or traffic to disrupt normal operation and deny service to legitimate users.

TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify, and select computer systems being considered for the processing, storage, and retrieval of sensitive or classified information. It was replaced with the development of the\nCommon Criteria international standard originally published in 2005. The TCSEC, frequently referred to as the Orange Book, is the centerpiece of the DoD\nStates Department of Defense (DoD) to describe and accredit networks and systems. The SSAA is part of the Department of Defense Information Technology\nSecurity Certification and Accreditation Process, or DITSCAP (superseded by DIACAP). The DoD instruction (issues in December 1997, that describes DITSCAP and provides an outline for the SSAA document is DODI 5200.40. The DITSCAP application manual (DoD 8510.1- M), published in July 2000, provides additional of information systems. It provides an approach for federal agencies. It determines how federal agencies are meeting existing policy and establish goals. The main advantage of FITSAF is that it addresses the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It also addresses the guidelines provided by the National developed by the United States federal government for use by all non-military government agencies and by government contractors. Many FIPS standards are modified versions of standards used in the wider community (ANSI, IEEE, ISO, etc.). Some FIPS standards were originally developed by the U.S. government. For instance, standards for encoding data (e.g., country codes), but more significantly some encryption standards, such as the Data Encryption Standard (FIPS 46-3) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (FIPS 197). In 1994, NOAA (Noaa) began broadcasting coded signals called FIPS (Federal Information Processing\nSystem) codes along with their standard weather broadcasts from local stations. These codes identify the type of emergency and the specific geographic area\n(such as a county) affected by the emergency.","timestamp":"2023-09-30 19:32:00","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"Rainbow Series publications.
