Conducting an offline attack on the hashed password information is the best method for brute forcing passwords. This method involves obtaining a copy of the hashed password data and using specialized tools to perform a dictionary, rule-based, or pure brute force attack. This method is effective because it allows for a large number of password guesses to be made quickly and without alerting the system being attacked or triggering account lockout mechanisms. It also reduces the risk of detection and IP blocking by the target system.
