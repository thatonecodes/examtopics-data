Not the social connotations of it.

Once the password is used it is no longer valid, and it expires if not entered in the acceptable time frame.\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nVariable callback system. Although variable callback systems are more flexible than fixed callback systems, the system assumes the identity of the individual unless two-factor authentication is also implemented. By itself, this method might allow an attacker access as a trusted user.\nFixed callback system. Authentication provides assurance that someone or something is who or what he/it is supposed to be. Callback systems authenticate a person, but anyone can pretend to be that person. They are tied to a specific place and phone number, which can be spoofed by implementing call-forwarding.\nCombination of callback and Caller ID. The caller ID and callback functionality provides greater confidence and auditability of the caller's identity. By disconnecting and calling back only authorized phone numbers, the system has a greater confidence in the location of the call. However, unless combined with strong authentication, any individual at the location could obtain access.\nThe following reference(s) were/was used to create this question:\n\nShon Harris AIO v3 p. 140, 548 -\nISC2 OIG 2007 p. 152-153, 126-127","question_images":[],"exam_id":189,"timestamp":"2024-10-26 22:39:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/150330-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-33-discussion/"},{"id":"RwAGLyHfws7K3BClt2xv","exam_id":189,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","question_id":44,"discussion":[{"content":"answer is D","comment_id":"714818","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Niitetteh","timestamp":"1731196380.0"},{"comment_id":"519360","poster":"CryptoCurt","content":"Selected Answer: D\nTwo factor Auth requires two separate forms of authentication","upvote_count":"3","timestamp":"1704697560.0"}],"choices":{"D":"It relies on two independent proofs of identity.","B":"It requires two measurements of hand geometry.","C":"It does not use single sign-on technology.","A":"It uses the RSA public-key signature based on integers with large prime factors."},"timestamp":"2022-01-08 08:06:00","answer":"D","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/69660-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-36-discussion/","question_text":"Which of the following is true of two-factor authentication?","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1641625560,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"ulrJAlZMjXTslsO8QkQl","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"519361","content":"Selected Answer: C\nIt is a Third party Authentication service","timestamp":"1720415220.0","upvote_count":"5","poster":"CryptoCurt"},{"comment_id":"1336992","content":"Selected Answer: C\nKerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide secure authentication for users and services in a distributed environment.
