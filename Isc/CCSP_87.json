While annotated asset inventories, flashlights, and documentation equipment are critical, hard drives are not typically included because:\n\nBackup data is usually stored off-site or in the cloud, rather than on physical hard drives within the BC/DR kit.\nModern BC/DR plans rely on remote access to backups and recovery sites, not manual hard drive swapping.\nHard drives can be bulky, fragile, and require specific hardware to access, making them impractical for a BC/DR kit.\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Annotated Asset Inventory → Provides a list of critical assets for recovery and prioritization.\nB. Flashlight → Essential for visibility during power outages or physical inspections.\nD.
