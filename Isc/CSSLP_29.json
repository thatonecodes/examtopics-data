Abbreviated.\n\n\nNIST SP 800-53A is a security and privacy control assessment guideline published by NIST. According to this guideline, there are three types of interviews that may be conducted during an assessment:\n\n1. Abbreviated Assessment – An abbreviated assessment consists of informal and ad hoc interviews with key personnel to determine whether controls are implemented.\n2. Basic Assessment – A basic assessment involves structured interviews with a sample of system users, which assesses the level of compliance with policies and procedures.\n3. Comprehensive Assessment – A comprehensive assessment includes structured interviews with stakeholders representing all functional areas included in the scope of testing specified in the security plan.\n\nAn abbreviated interview is informal and ad hoc where one can ask questions informally on different aspects for control implementation while assessing software applications or systems developed under software engineering principles to ensure their proper functionality and protection against possible cyber threats or attacks.","timestamp":"1727798100.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/122081-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-55-discussion/"},{"id":"x39C1tTwRqg4sNhgUwMD","question_images":[],"question_id":142,"answer":"BDE","exam_id":188,"timestamp":"2023-10-01 19:08:00","topic":"2","answers_community":["BDE (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1696180080,"isMC":true,"choices":{"C":"It delegates control to other BIOS, if it is required.","B":"It identifies, organizes, and selects boot devices.","E":"It verifies the integrity of the BIOS code itself.","A":"It provides a user interface for system's configuration.","F":"It interrupts the execution of all running programs.","D":"It discovers size and verifies system memory."},"question_text":"Which of the following are the principle duties performed by the BIOS during POST (power-on-self-test)?

The general idea is to break down a larger problem into smaller, more manageable components that can be easily piped together to support complex sequence processing. In this architecture style, connectors serve as the pipes or conduits through which data flows between filters. Therefore, it's likely that a device receiving inputs from multiple connectors and generating transformed outputs would use this architecture pattern.","timestamp":"1727802600.0","poster":"74gjd_37","comments":[{"comment_id":"1022522","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727802660.0","poster":"74gjd_37","content":"Although the Layered architecture style also supports input processing, it is typically used when building applications that have multiple layers of abstraction to create a clear separation between functionality. Each layer only communicates with the adjacent layers, and requests/data passes through them vertically from one layer to another.
