Although the term malicious captures much of the intent of penetration testing from the perspective of an attacker, it is not the best answer. Static and dynamic are two types of system testing--where static is done offline and with knowledge of the system, and dynamic is done on a live system without any previous knowledge is associated--but neither describes the type of testing being asked for in the question.","answer":"C","unix_timestamp":1599351000,"question_id":236,"question_images":[],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/30654-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-310-discussion/","topic":"1","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1732278000.0","poster":"akg001","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.

Typically, the hardware vendor (e.g., Dell, HP, Cisco) is separate from the hypervisor vendor (e.g., VMware, Microsoft, Citrix, Red Hat), making option A the most accurate statement.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nB. The hardware vendor and software vendor are the same: Not necessarily true—many Type 1 hypervisors, like VMware ESXi or Microsoft Hyper-V, can run on hardware from multiple vendors.\nC. The hardware vendor provides an open platform for software vendors: While some hardware vendors optimize for certain hypervisors, this is not a defining characteristic of Type 1 hypervisors.\nD.
