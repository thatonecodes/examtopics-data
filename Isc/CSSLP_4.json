It includes the time for trying to fix the problem without a recovery, the recovery itself, tests and the communication to the users. Decision time for user representative is not included. The business continuity timeline usually runs parallel with an incident management timeline and may start at the same, or different, points. In accepted business continuity planning methodology, the RTO is established during the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) by the owner of a process (usually in conjunction with the Business Continuity planner). The\nRTOs are then presented to senior management for acceptance. The RTO attaches to the business process and not the resources required to support the methodology the technology support team develops. This is the time frame the technology support takes to deliver the recovered infrastructure to the business.\nObjective (RPO) describes the acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. It is the point in time to which data must be recovered as defined by the organization. The RPO is generally a definition of what an organization determines is an \"acceptable loss\" in a disaster situation. If the RPO of a company is 2 hours and the time it takes to get the data back into production is 5 hours, the RPO is still 2 hours. Based on this RPO the data must be restored to within 2 hours of the disaster."},{"id":"bMNWtezUPVoxMissDZyB","answer_images":[],"question_text":"Which of the following processes culminates in an agreement between key players that a system in its current configuration and operation provides adequate protection controls?","timestamp":"2022-07-09 10:14:00","choices":{"C":"Certification and accreditation (C&A)","A":"Information Assurance (IA)","D":"Risk Management","B":"Information systems security engineering (ISSE)"},"question_id":18,"unix_timestamp":1657354440,"exam_id":188,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"answer_ET":"implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.

Certification and Accreditation (C&A or CnA) is a process for implementing information security.\nIt is a systematic procedure for evaluating, describing, testing, and authorizing systems prior to or after a system is in operation. The C&A process is used extensively in the U.S. Federal Government. Some C&A processes include FISMA, NIACAP, DIACAP, and DCID 6/3. Certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. Accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals, based on the information-related risks. It ensures that only the approved users have access to the approved information at the approved time.

The Act prohibits a number of activities, including trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and false advertising. Trademarks were traditionally protected in the United States only under State common law, growing out of the tort of unfair competition.
