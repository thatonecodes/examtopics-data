Copyright laws\n\nPatent laws can indeed be used to protect algorithms if they meet specific requirements established by patent offices. However, obtaining software patents for algorithms and techniques of programming is often a challenging task since the majority of countries require that an algorithm or programming technique meets stringent standards like novelty and non-obviousness.\n\nIn addition, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether algorithms can even fall under subject matter eligible for patent protection in some jurisdictions like Europe (European Patent Convention- Art 52) whereas in the US many court cases establish this right to protect intellectual property using patterns/algorithms through inventiveness demonstrated when innovations occur during innovation fits within statutory guidelines involving sufficiently defined parameters.","timestamp":"1727711880.0"}],"answers_community":[],"choices":{"D":"Copyright laws","B":"Patent laws","A":"Code Security law","C":"Trademark laws"},"answer_images":[]},{"id":"RIpjswqHfksm6ZCx3jqS","unix_timestamp":1696089540,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"question_id":82,"topic":"1","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","exam_id":188,"choices":{"C":"DoS","B":"Benign","A":"Access","D":"Reconnaissance"},"answer":"C","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1727711940.0","comment_id":"1021650","poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe type of signature used in an Intrusion Detection System to trigger on attacks that attempt to reduce the level of a resource or system, or to cause it to crash is C.

Patent\n\nPatenting an invention helps to protect it against infringement by competitors who may attempt to copy or steal intellectual property. Patents indicate exclusive rights over a particular technology for a fixed period of time in exchange for public disclosure of its workings.\n\nTherefore, information related to new inventions within organizations is kept confidential so that appropriate measures can be taken if there are any vulnerabilities that were exploited while developing core technology.
