A break in a network cable: If there is a break in the network cable, the continuity of the network is disrupted, and communication may fail.\n\nD. An open-ended cable without terminators: If there is an open-ended cable without terminators, it can lead to signal reflection issues and disrupt the proper functioning of the network.\n\nOption B (75 ohm terminators at open ends) is not typically associated with Bus topology.

Role-Based Access Control\n\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an access control model that allows access permissions to be assigned based on roles. In RBAC, users are assigned specific roles, and each role has certain permissions associated with it. This model is effective for managing access to resources by ensuring that users have the necessary permissions based on their roles within an organization.\n\nOption C, Discretionary Access Control (DAC), also allows users to have control over their own objects and resources, but RBAC is more specifically focused on assigning permissions based on roles rather than individual discretion.\n\nSo, in the context of Mark wanting users to access only the resources required for their roles, the most appropriate choice is D. Role-Based Access Control.","comment_id":"1120366","poster":"byfener"},{"comment_id":"1049133","content":"Selected Answer: D\nD. RBAC\n\nRBAC is a widely-accepted access control model that assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization. It allows administrators to define various roles and assign appropriate privileges and access rights to each role. Users are then assigned specific roles, which determine the actions they can perform and the resources they can access.\n\nThis approach aligns with Mark's objective of granting users only the necessary resources for their job functions while ensuring consistent enforcement of security policies across the network infrastructure.\n\nIn a mandatory access control model, security labels or classifications are assigned to both subjects (users/processes) and objects (resources). These labels determine the level of access that subjects can have to specific resources. The enforcement of access controls in MAC is typically based on pre-defined system-wide policies.\n\nOn the other hand, RBAC allows administrators to assign permissions and privileges based on roles rather than individual security labels. Users are then assigned specific roles which grant them appropriate levels of access based on their job functions within the organization.","upvote_count":"1","poster":"74gjd_37","timestamp":"1713648660.0"},{"timestamp":"1702029840.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nI would go with B since he doesn't bring up anything related to his duties but just specifies that he only wants users to access what is required...

These labels determine the level of access and interactions that subjects can have with specific documents or information based on predefined system-wide policies.\n\nThis type of access control model is commonly used in environments where data confidentiality and integrity are critical, such as government agencies or organizations handling sensitive information.\n\nIn the context of Mark wanting users to only access necessary resources, MAC would not be directly applicable since it primarily focuses on controlling access to classified documents rather than broader resource management.","timestamp":"1713648840.0"},{"poster":"jim22444","comment_id":"921529","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1702398780.0","content":"Didn't notice the \"them\" in assigning permissions.
