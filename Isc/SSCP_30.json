HOWEVER, IPSec Tunnel mode works at the NETWORK layer, not transport layer.","timestamp":"1721777580.0","poster":"swiggharo"}],"answer_description":"IPSec can be run in either tunnel mode or transport mode. Each of these modes has its own particular uses and care should be taken to ensure that the correct one is selected for the solution:\nTunnel mode is most commonly used between gateways, or at an end-station to a gateway, the gateway acting as a proxy for the hosts behind it.\nTransport mode is used between end-stations or between an end-station and a gateway, if the gateway is being treated as a hostfor example, an encrypted\nTelnet session from a workstation to a router, in which the router is the actual destination.\nAs Figure 1 shows, basically transport mode should be used for end-to-end sessions and tunnel mode should be used for everything else. (Refer to the figure for the following discussion.)\nFigure 1 Tunnel and transport modes in IPSec.\nFigure 1 displays some examples of when to use tunnel versus transport mode:\nTunnel mode is most commonly used to encrypt traffic between secure IPSec gateways, such as between the Cisco router and PIX Firewall (as shown in example A in Figure 1). The IPSec gateways proxy IPSec for the devices behind them, such as Alice's PC and the HR servers in Figure 1. In example A, Alice connects to the HR servers securely through the IPSec tunnel set up between the gateways.\nTunnel mode is also used to connect an end-station running IPSec software, such as the Cisco Secure VPN Client, to an IPSec gateway, as shown in example\nB.\nIn example C, tunnel mode is used to set up an IPSec tunnel between the Cisco router and a server running IPSec software. Note that Cisco IOS software and the PIX Firewall sets tunnel mode as the default IPSec mode.\nTransport mode is used between end-stations supporting IPSec, or between an end-station and a gateway, if the gateway is being treated as a host. In example\nD, transport mode is used to set up an encrypted Telnet session from Alice's PC running Cisco Secure VPN Client software to terminate at the PIX Firewall, enabling Alice to remotely configure the PIX Firewall securely.\n\nAH Tunnel Versus Transport Mode -\nFigure 2 shows the differences that the IPSec mode makes to AH. In transport mode, AH services protect the external IP header along with the data payload. AH services protect all the fields in the header that don't change in transport. The header goes after the IP header and before the ESP header, if present, and other higher-layer protocols.\nIn tunnel mode, the entire original header is authenticated, a new IP header is built, and the new IP header is protected in the same way as the IP header in transport mode.\nFigure 2 AH tunnel versus transport mode.\nAH is incompatible with Network Address Translation (NAT) because NAT changes the source IP address, which breaks the AH header and causes the packets to be rejected by the IPSec peer.\nESP Tunnel Versus Transport Mode\nFigure 3 shows the differences that the IPSec mode makes to ESP. In transport mode, the IP payload is encrypted and the original headers are left intact. The\nESP header is inserted after the IP header and before the upper-layer protocol header. The upper-layer protocols are encrypted and authenticated along with the\nESP header. ESP doesn't authenticate the IP header itself.\n\nNOTE -\nHigher-layer information is not available because it's part of the encrypted payload.\nWhen ESP is used in tunnel mode, the original IP header is well protected because the entire original IP datagram is encrypted. With an ESP authentication mechanism, the original IP datagram and the ESP header are included; however, the new IP header is not included in the authentication.\nWhen both authentication and encryption are selected, encryption is performed first, before authentication. One reason for this order of processing is that it facilitates rapid detection and rejection of replayed or bogus packets by the receiving node. Prior to decrypting the packet, the receiver can detect the problem and potentially reduce the impact of denial-of-service attacks.\nFigure 3 ESP tunnel versus transport mode.\nESP can also provide packet authentication with an optional field for authentication. Cisco IOS software and the PIX Firewall refer to this service as ESP hashed message authentication code (HMAC). Authentication is calculated after the encryption is done. The current IPSec standard specifies SHA-1 and MD5 as the mandatory HMAC algorithms.\nThe main difference between the authentication provided by ESP and AH is the extent of the coverage. Specifically, ESP doesn't protect any IP header fields unless those fields are encapsulated by ESP (tunnel mode). Figure 4 illustrates the fields protected by ESP HMAC.\nFigure 4 ESP encryption with a keyed HMAC.\n\nIPSec Transforms -\nAn IPSec transform specifies a single IPSec security protocol (either AH or ESP) with its corresponding security algorithms and mode. Example transforms include the following:\nThe AH protocol with the HMAC with MD5 authentication algorithm in tunnel mode is used for authentication.\nThe ESP protocol with the triple DES (3DES) encryption algorithm in transport mode is used for confidentiality of data.\nThe ESP protocol with the 56-bit DES encryption algorithm and the HMAC with SHA-1 authentication algorithm in tunnel mode is used for authentication and confidentiality.\n\nTransform Sets -\nA transform set is a combination of individual IPSec transforms designed to enact a specific security policy for traffic. During the ISAKMP IPSec security association negotiation that occurs in IKE phase 2 quick mode, the peers agree to use a particular transform set for protecting a particular data flow. Transform sets combine the following IPSec factors:\nMechanism for payload authenticationAH transform\nMechanism for payload encryptionESP transform\nIPSec mode (transport versus tunnel)\nTransform sets equal a combination of an AH transform, plus an ESP transform, plus the IPSec mode (either tunnel or transport mode).\nThis brings us to the end of the second part of this five-part series of articles covering IPSec.

They are a collection of products on a single computer and not necessarily a typical firewall. A UTM can address all of the layers but typically a firewall cannot.\nFirewalls are security checkpoints at the boundaries of internal networks through which every packet must pass and be inspected, hence they create bottlenecks between the internal and external networks. But since external connections are relatively slow compared to modern computers, the latency caused by this bottleneck can almost be transparent.\nBy implementing the concept of border security, they centralize security services in machines optimized and dedicated to the task, thus relieving the other hosts on the network from that function.\nSource: STREBE, Matthew and PERKINS, Charles, Firewalls 24seven, Sybex 2000, Chapter 1: Understanding Firewalls.","answer":"C","choices":{"B":"Firewalls allow for centralization of security services in machines optimized and dedicated to the task.","C":"Firewalls protect a network at all layers of the OSI models.","D":"Firewalls are used to create security checkpoints at the boundaries of private networks.","A":"Firewalls create bottlenecks between the internal and external network."},"exam_id":189,"question_text":"Which of the following statements pertaining to firewalls is incorrect?","answers_community":[],"unix_timestamp":1656124020,"topic":"6","question_id":149,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/77067-exam-sscp-topic-6-question-223-discussion/","answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"C","discussion":[{"comment_id":"621932","upvote_count":"1","poster":"lowbattery","comments":[{"poster":"catastrophie","timestamp":"1728852960.0","comment_id":"694277","content":"It can sound as \"stoopit\" as you want but when an outside attack spins up all your virtual machines on a server and pushed that server over capacity and the resource consumption causes overheating and equipment failure, thats a physical hardware failure.

There is no reason for any internet users to send ICMP ECHO Request to your interal hosts from the internet. If they wish to find out if a service is available, they can use a browser to connect to your web server or simply send an email if they wish to test your mail service.\nEcho replies outbound could be used as part of the SMURF amplification attack where someone will send ICMP echo requests to gateways broadcast addresses in order to amplify the request by X number of users sitting behind the gateway.\nBy allowing inbound echo requests and outbound echo replies, it makes it easier for attackers to learn about the internal network as well by performing a simply ping sweep. ICMP can also be used to find out which host has been up and running the longest which would indicates which patches are missing on the host if a critical patch required a reboot.\nICMP can also be use for DDoS attacks, so you should strictly limit what type of ICMP traffic would be allowed to flow through your firewall.\nOn top of all this, tools such as LOKI could be use as a client-server application to transfer files back and forward between the internat and some of your internal hosts. LOKI is a client/server program published in the online publication Phrack . This program is a working proof-of-concept to demonstrate that data can be transmitted somewhat secretly across a network by hiding it in traffic that normally does not contain payloads. The example code can tunnel the equivalent of a\nUnix RCMD/RSH session in either ICMP echo request (ping) packets or UDP traffic to the DNS port. This is used as a back door into a Unix system after root access has been compromised. Presence of LOKI on a system is evidence that the system has been compromised in the past.\nThe outbound echo request and inbound echo reply allow internal users to verify connectivity with external hosts.\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nAllow echo request outbound The outbound echo request and inbound echo reply allow internal users to verify connectivity with external hosts.\nDrop echo request inbound There is no need for anyone on the internet to attempt pinging your internal hosts.\nAllow echo reply inbound The outbound echo request and inbound echo reply allow internal users to verify connectivity with external hosts.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nhttp://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=49&id=6\nSTREBE, Matthew and PERKINS, Charles, Firewalls 24seven, Sybex 2000, Chapter 10: The Perfect Firewall.","answer":"D","choices":{"A":"Allow echo reply outbound","D":"Allow echo reply inbound","B":"Allow echo request outbound","C":"Drop echo request inbound"},"question_text":"In the context of network enumeration by an outside attacker and possible Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which of the following firewall rules is not appropriate to protect an organization's internal network?","exam_id":189,"answers_community":["D (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1673480940,"topic":"6","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/94849-exam-sscp-topic-6-question-239-discussion/","question_id":150,"answer_images":[],"answer_ET":"A","discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"kmanb","comment_id":"772978","timestamp":"1720734540.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nWouldn't this be D?","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","poster":"bradseth","content":"no. its A","timestamp":"1722645660.0","comment_id":"796652"}]}],"question_images":[],"isMC":true,"timestamp":"2023-01-12 00:49:00"}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025","name":"SSCP","provider":"Isc","isMCOnly":true,"numberOfQuestions":161,"isBeta":false,"id":189},"currentPage":30},"__N_SSP":true}
