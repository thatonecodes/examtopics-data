Hashing functions are extremely important to the use of public key cryptography. In particular, to the creation of digital signatures and digital certificates.

The message digest serves as a unique representation of the document's content. The signer then encrypts the message digest with their private key to create a digital signature.\n\nVerification of the signature involves recalculating the hash of the received document and comparing it to the decrypted digital signature using the signer's public key. If the recalculated hash matches the decrypted signature, it provides evidence that the document has not been tampered with since the signature was applied.\n\nHashing ensures data integrity, as even a small change in the document would result in a significantly different hash value. This helps establish non-repudiation, as the signer cannot later deny their involvement since the signature is based on the unique hash value of the document.","comment_id":"944248","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Bach1968","timestamp":"1704515700.0"},{"poster":"HughJassole","content":"So this is interesting, the question asks for non-repudiation in digital signatures, and in this case Asymmetric cryptography is correct.\n\nIf it asked for audit logs, it seems that the answer would have been message digest, which was my original thought.
