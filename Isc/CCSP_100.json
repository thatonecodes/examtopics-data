For example, when I first read this I thought that maybe the cipher strength would be the biggest concern \"if\" someone were to use a weak cipher that was easy to defeat. But I used an \"if\" in my logic. The question doesn't state anything about the cipher used, so we can't assume that a weak cipher would be the biggest concern when protection of encryption keys is critical across ALL encryption ciphers.","upvote_count":"5","poster":"Purespace","timestamp":"1728798060.0"},{"comment_id":"603430","timestamp":"1700337360.0","poster":"akg001","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.

Cloud service manager. A cloud service manager is responsible for overseeing the deployment, operations, and management of cloud services. This typically involves gathering metrics on cloud service performance, managing cloud deployments and deployment processes, and ensuring that the cloud services are meeting the needs of the organization.
