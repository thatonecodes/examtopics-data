In the context of information security and the CIA triad, tenets are core principles that guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of security practices.\n\nThe CIA triad consists of three key tenets:\n\n Confidentiality: This tenet ensures that sensitive information is kept private and inaccessible to unauthorized individuals or entities.\n Integrity: The integrity tenet focuses on maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data by protecting it from unauthorized modification or tampering.\n Availability: Availability emphasizes ensuring timely access to information and resources whenever needed by authorized users without disruptions caused by attacks, failures, or other factors.\n\n By adhering to these foundational principles (tenets), organizations can establish a comprehensive approach to safeguarding their systems and data while achieving desired levels of protection against security threats.","comment_id":"1051075","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1729629060.0"}],"content":"Selected Answer: ACD\nThe correct answers regarding which tenets are covered by the CIA triad are:\n\nA.
