This should be left to data entry personnel.\nSystem operators represent a class of users typically found in data center environments where mainframe systems are used. They provide day-to-day operations of the mainframe environment, ensuring that scheduled jobs are running effectively and troubleshooting problems that may arise. They also act as the arms and legs of the mainframe environment, load and unloading tape and results of job print runs. Operators have elevated privileges, but less than those of system administrators. If misused, these privileges may be used to circumvent the systems security policy. As such, use of these privileges should be monitored through audit logs.\nSome of the privileges and responsibilities assigned to operators include:\nImplementing the initial program load: This is used to start the operating system. The boot process or initial program load of a system is a critical time for ensuring system security. Interruptions to this process may reduce the integrity of the system or cause the system to crash, precluding its availability.\nMonitoring execution of the system: Operators respond to various events, to include errors, interruptions, and job completion messages.\nVolume mounting: This allows the desired application access to the system and its data.\nControlling job flow: Operators can initiate, pause, or terminate programs. This may allow an operator to affect the scheduling of jobs. Controlling job flow involves the manipulation of configuration information needed by the system. Operators with the ability to control a job or application can cause output to be altered or diverted, which can threaten the confidentiality.\nBypass label processing: This allows the operator to bypass security label information to run foreign tapes (foreign tapes are those from a different data center that would not be using the same label format that the system could run). This privilege should be strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized access.\nRenaming and relabeling resources: This is sometimes necessary in the mainframe environment to allow programs to properly execute. Use of this privilege should be monitored, as it can allow the unauthorized viewing of sensitive information.\nReassignment of ports and lines: Operators are allowed to reassign ports or lines. If misused, reassignment can cause program errors, such as sending sensitive output to an unsecured location. Furthermore, an incidental port may be opened, subjecting the system to an attack through the creation of a new entry point into the system.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nHernandez CISSP, Steven (2012-12-21).
