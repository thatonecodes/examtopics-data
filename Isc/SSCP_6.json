It supports mandatory access control by determining the access rights from the security levels associated with subjects and objects. It also supports discretionary access control by checking access rights from an access matrix. The Biba model, introduced in 1977, the Sutherland model, published in 1986, and the Brewer-Nash model, published in 1989, are concerned with integrity.\nSource: ANDRESS, Mandy, Exam Cram CISSP, Coriolis, 2001, Chapter 2: Access Control Systems and Methodology (page 11).","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which access control model was proposed for enforcing access control in government and military applications?","question_images":[],"exam_id":189,"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1"},{"id":"xYXUTzPm03s91SEiZoDm","answer_ET":"D","choices":{"B":"6' to 7' high","C":"8' high and above with strands of barbed wire","A":"3' to 4' high","D":"Double fencing"},"question_id":29,"exam_id":189,"unix_timestamp":1700791860,"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1732414260.0","comment_id":"1078977","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe effectiveness of a fence for maximum security depends on various factors beyond just height, such as the site's characteristics, purpose, and the level of security required. However, among the options provided, **C. 8' high and above with strands of barbed wire** tends to be more effective for maximum security. \n\nA higher fence makes it more challenging for intruders to climb or breach, and the addition of barbed wire provides an extra deterrent against unauthorized access. However, the selection of the fence should also consider other factors like surveillance, lighting, and other security measures for a comprehensive security approach.","poster":"nanson"}],"answer":"C","timestamp":"2023-11-24 03:11:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/127097-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-185-discussion/","answers_community":["C (100%)"],"answer_description":"The most commonly used fence is the chain linked fence and it is the most affordable. The standard is a six-foot high fence with two-inch mesh square openings.\nThe material should consist of nine-gauge vinyl or galvanized metal. Nine-gauge is a typical fence material installed in residential areas.\nAdditionally, it is recommended to place barbed wire strands angled out from the top of the fence at a 45 angle and away from the protected area with three strands running across the top. This will provide for a seven-foot fence. There are several variations of the use of \"top guards\" using V-shaped barbed wire or the use of concertina wire as an enhancement, which has been a replacement for more traditional three strand barbed wire \"top guards.\"\nThe fence should be fastened to ridged metal posts set in concrete every six feet with additional bracing at the corners and gate openings. The bottom of the fence should be stabilized against intruders crawling under by attaching posts along the bottom to keep the fence from being pushed or pulled up from the bottom. If the soil is sandy, the bottom edge of the fence should be installed below ground level.\nFor maximum security design, the use of double fencing with rolls of concertina wire positioned between the two fences is the most effective deterrent and cost- efficient method. In this design, an intruder is required to use an extensive array of ladders and equipment to breach the fences.\nMost fencing is largely a psychological deterrent and a boundary marker rather than a barrier, because in most cases such fences can be rather easily penetrated unless added security measures are taken to enhance the security of the fence. Sensors attached to the fence to provide electronic monitoring of cutting or scaling the fence can be used.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nHernandez CISSP, Steven (2012-12-21).
