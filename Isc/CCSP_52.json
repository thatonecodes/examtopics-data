These three states are critical for encryption, access control, and compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Data in transit: Needs encryption and secure transmission protocols for compliance.\nB. Data in use: Security controls (e.g., memory encryption, processing safeguards) must be in place while data is being accessed or processed.\nC. Data at rest: Must be encrypted and protected through access controls, backup policies, and data retention rules.\nWhy \"Data Custodian\" Is Not a Major Focus?\nData Custodian refers to an operational role responsible for managing and safeguarding data but is not a regulatory compliance focus by itself.\nRegulatory frameworks emphasize data protection mechanisms rather than specific job roles like a data custodian.","poster":"MaciekMT"},{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nD.

This traditionally has led to increased costs for an organization because physical hardware must be purchased and operational but is not used. By using a cloud system, an organization will only pay for systems when they are being used and only for the duration of use, thus eliminating the need for extra hardware and costs. Portability is the ability to easily move services among different cloud providers. Broad network access allows access to users and staff from anywhere and from different clients, and although this would be important for a BCDR situation, it is not the best answer in this case. On-demand self-service allows users to provision services automatically and when needed, and although this too would be important for BCDR situations, it is not the best answer because it does not address costs or the biggest benefits to an organization.","answer_ET":"B","topic":"1","question_text":"Cloud systems are increasingly used for BCDR solutions for organizations.\nWhat aspect of cloud computing makes their use for BCDR the most attractive?","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1607411640.0","comment_id":"237985","content":"The most attractive reason is cost.

On-demand self-service\n\nOn-demand self-service allows organizations to quickly provision and scale resources as needed without the need for human intervention from the service provider. This flexibility is crucial for BCDR because it enables businesses to rapidly respond to and recover from disruptions by accessing additional resources, such as storage or computing power, on-demand.
