It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\nThe Internet is an insecure place. Many of the protocols used in the Internet do not provide any security. Tools to \"sniff\" passwords off of the network are in common use by systems crackers. Thus, applications which send an unencrypted password over the network are extremely vulnerable. Worse yet, other client/ server applications rely on the client program to be \"honest\" about the identity of the user who is using it. Other applications rely on the client to restrict its activities to those which it is allowed to do, with no other enforcement by the server.\nSome sites attempt to use firewalls to solve their network security problems. Unfortunately, firewalls assume that \"the bad guys\" are on the outside, which is often a very bad assumption. Most of the really damaging incidents of computer crime are carried out by insiders. Firewalls also have a significant disadvantage in that they restrict how your users can use the Internet. (After all, firewalls are simply a less extreme example of the dictum that there is nothing more secure then a computer which is not connected to the network --- and powered off!) In many places, these restrictions are simply unrealistic and unacceptable.\nKerberos was created by MIT as a solution to these network security problems. The Kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove its identity to a server (and vice versa) across an insecure network connection. After a client and server have used Kerberos to prove their identity, they can also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data integrity as they go about their business.\nKerberos is freely available from MIT, under a copyright permission notice very similar to the one used for the BSD operating and X11 Windowing system. MIT provides Kerberos in source form, so that anyone who wishes to use it may look over the code for themselves and assure themselves that the code is trustworthy.\nIn addition, for those who prefer to rely on a professional supported product, Kerberos is available as a product from many different vendors.\nIn summary, Kerberos is a solution to your network security problems. It provides the tools of authentication and strong cryptography over the network to help you secure your information systems across your entire enterprise. We hope you find Kerberos as useful as it has been to us. At MIT, Kerberos has been invaluable to our Information/Technology architecture.\nKryptoKnight is a Peer to Peer authentication protocol incorporated into the NetSP product from IBM.\nSESAME is an authentication and access control protocol, that also supports communication confidentiality and integrity. It provides public key based authentication along with the Kerberos style authentication, that uses symmetric key cryptography. Sesame supports the Kerberos protocol and adds some security extensions like public key based authentication and an ECMA-style Privilege Attribute Service. The complete Sesame protocol is a two step process. In the first step, the client successfully authenticates itself to the Authentication Server and obtains a ticket that can be presented to the Privilege Attribute Server. In the second step, the initiator obtains proof of his access rights in the form of Privilege Attributes Certificate (PAC). The PAC is a specific form of Access Control\nCertificate as defined in the ECMA-219 document. This document describes the extensions to Kerberos for public key based authentication as adopted in\nSesame.\nSESAME, KryptoKnight, and NetSP never took off and the protocols are no longer commonly used.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/CCS/people/kenh/kerberos-faq.html#whatis and\nSource: KRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Page 40.","choices":{"C":"KryptoKnight","B":"SESAME","A":"Kerberos","D":"NetSP"},"question_text":"Which of the following is a trusted, third party authentication protocol that was developed under Project Athena at MIT?","isMC":true,"exam_id":189,"answers_community":[],"timestamp":"2023-11-18 01:18:00"},{"id":"Z3XEznLIGCwncXwGuH8O","question_id":74,"timestamp":"2023-11-10 11:58:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Validation and Integrity","B":"Authentication and Availability","A":"Confidentiality and Integrity","D":"Auditability and Integrity"},"topic":"1","answers_community":["A (67%)","B (33%)"],"discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: A\nKerberos primarily addresses Authentication and Authorization, which aligns with the Confidentiality and Integrity aspects of the CIA triad.

It provides public key based authentication along with the Kerberos style authentication, that uses symmetric key cryptography. Sesame supports the Kerberos protocol and adds some security extensions like public key based authentication and an ECMA-style Privilege Attribute Service.\n\nThe users under SESAME can authenticate using either symmetric encryption as in Kerberos or Public Key authentication. When using Symmetric Key authentication as in Kerberos, SESAME is also vulnerable to password guessing just like Kerberos would be. The Symmetric key being used is based on the password used by the user when he logged on the system. If the user has a simple password it could be guessed or compromise. Even thou Kerberos or\nSESAME may be use, there is still a need to have strong password discipline.\nThe Basic Mechanism in Sesame for strong authentication is as follow:\nThe user sends a request for authentication to the Authentication Server as in Kerberos, except that SESAME is making use of public key cryptography for authentication where the client will present his digital certificate and the request will be signed using a digital signature. The signature is communicated to the authentication server through the preauthentication fields. Upon receipt of this request, the authentication server will verifies the certificate, then validate the signature, and if all is fine the AS will issue a ticket granting ticket (TGT) as in Kerberos. This TGT will be use to communicate with the privilage attribute server\n(PAS) when access to a resource is needed.\nUsers may authenticate using either a public key pair or a conventional (symmetric) key. If public key cryptography is used, public key data is transported in preauthentication data fields to help establish identity.\nKerberos uses tickets for authenticating subjects to objects and SESAME uses Privileged Attribute Certificates (PAC), which contain the subjects identity, access capabilities for the object, access time period, and lifetime of the PAC. The PAC is digitally signed so that the object can validate that it came from the trusted authentication server, which is referred to as the privilege attribute server (PAS). The PAS holds a similar role as the KDC within Kerberos. After a user successfully authenticates to the authentication service (AS), he is presented with a token to give to the PAS. The PAS then creates a PAC for the user to present to the resource he is trying to access.\n\nReference(s) used for this question:\nhttp://srg.cs.uiuc.edu/Security/nephilim/Internal/SESAME.txt\nand\nKRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Page 43.","exam_id":189,"topic":"1","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1674209100}],"exam":{"isImplemented":true,"numberOfQuestions":161,"isMCOnly":true,"id":189,"provider":"Isc","name":"SSCP","isBeta":false,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":15},"__N_SSP":true}
