Non-repudiation\n\nAuthentication is not incorrect in the context of proving that the sender really sent a particular message, but it may not be the most precise answer.\n\nAuthentication does play a crucial role in verifying the identity of a sender, ensuring that they are who they claim to be. However, authentication alone does not provide explicit evidence or mechanisms to prove that a specific message was sent by a particular sender.\n\nWhile authentication establishes trust and confirms the identity of individuals or systems involved in communication, non-repudiation provides proof and assurance regarding actions performed by those authenticated entities.\n\nNon-repudiation mechanisms like digital signatures can link an individual's identity to specific messages or data, making it difficult for them to deny their involvement later on. These mechanisms offer legal liability protection by providing evidence that proves both message integrity and origin."}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124382-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-19-discussion/","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"question_text":"Which of the following terms refers to a mechanism which proves that the sender really sent a particular message?","timestamp":"2023-10-22 22:07:00","choices":{"D":"Non-repudiation","A":"Integrity","B":"Confidentiality","C":"Authentication"},"unix_timestamp":1698005220,"question_images":[],"question_id":11,"exam_id":186,"isMC":true,"topic":"1","answer_ET":"D"},{"id":"zZoIi0UcmLoMLJMkFYfb","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"question_id":12,"answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Web caching","D":"Spoofing","A":"Hacking","B":"Packet filtering"},"answer_images":[],"timestamp":"2022-09-22 21:26:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.Packet filtering \n\nPacket filtering is the process of examining each packet that passes through a firewall and determining whether it should be allowed or denied based on a set of predefined rules. It involves analyzing the characteristics of each packet, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols, to make decisions on whether to permit or block them.\n\nPacket filtering is one of the fundamental methods used to control network traffic and enforce security policies. It is an essential component of a firewall's functionality and helps in preventing unauthorized access to a network by allowing or restricting specific types of packets.","timestamp":"1729458660.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"74gjd_37","comment_id":"1049117"},{"comment_id":"676512","timestamp":"1695410760.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
