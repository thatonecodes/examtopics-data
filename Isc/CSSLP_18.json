It tracks all of the individual\nConfiguration Items (CI) in an IT system, which may be as simple as a single server, or as complex as the entire IT department. In large organizations a control risks. It includes analyzing the value of assets to the business, identifying threats to those assets, and evaluating how vulnerable each asset is to those threats. Risk Management is part of Service Design and the owner of the Risk Management is the Risk Manager. Risks are addressed within several processes in\nITIL V3; however, there is no dedicated Risk Management process. ITIL V3 calls for \"coordinated risk assessment exercises\", so at IT Process Maps we decided used for efficient handling of all changes. A change is \"an event that results in a new status of one or more configuration items (CI's)\" approved by management, cost effective, enhances business process changes (fixes) - with a minimum risk to IT infrastructure.

When a deviation occurs, experienced personnel and software tools are used to investigate, resolve, and handle the issue promptly before it affects system performance. Therefore, exception management involves investigating and handling both process deviations and infrastructure/connectivity issues in real-time. Risk Management deals with managing unknown risks in advance by identifying vulnerabilities along with their likelihoods of occurrence; Configuration Management manages changes to hardware configuration items (CIs); Change Management facilitates controlled modifications to IT environments without change-related disruptions on services generally but not specifically for handling exceptions or deviations.","timestamp":"1727712240.0","poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"1"}],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1"},{"id":"a2MlBdpTvdISoeIpR0O2","answer":"D","question_text":"Which of the following rated systems of the Orange book has mandatory protection of the TCB?","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"exam_id":188,"answer_description":"A B-rated system of the orange book has mandatory protection of the trusted computing base (TCB).\nTrusted computing base (TCB) refers to hardware, software, controls, and processes that cause a computer system or network to be devoid of malicious software or hardware.

The TCB ensures that information processed by the system remains protected, making it one of the essential parts of secure systems.\n\nIn context with this question about Orange Book ratings, mandatory protection for TCB refers to the fact that certain levels of rated systems require strict enforcement measures in place for maintaining hardware and software integrity.

These attempts may take the form of attacks, as examples, by crackers, malware and/or disgruntled employees. An IDS cannot directly detect attacks within properly encrypted traffic. An intrusion detection system is used to detect several types of malicious behaviors that can compromise the security and trust of a computer system. This includes network attacks against vulnerable services, data driven attacks on applications, host based attacks such as privilege escalation, unauthorized logins and access to sensitive files, and malware (viruses, trojan horses, whether routed packets are forwarded or blocked at the router's interfaces.

Non-repudiation is the concept of ensuring that a party in a dispute cannot refuse to acknowledge, or refute the validity of a statement or contract. As a service, it provides proof of the integrity and origin of data. Although this concept can be applied to any transmission, mechanism that ensures that only the intended and authorized recipients are able to read data. The data is so encrypted that even if an unauthorized user gets the organization, employees, network, and systems before an attack is performed efficiently. It is the first step in the process of intrusion and involves unauthorized discovery and mapping of systems, services, or vulnerabilities. These discovery and mapping techniques are commonly known as scanning and enumeration.\nCommon tools, commands, and utilities used for scanning and enumeration include ping, telnet, nslookup, rpcinfo, File Explorer, finger, etc. Reconnaissance activities take place before performing a malicious attack.
