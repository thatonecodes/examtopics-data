They verify that the data has not been altered and that it originates from a trusted source.\n\nWhy Not the Others?\nA. Data in use: Digital signatures are typically applied before data is used rather than during active processing.\nC.

The digital signature does not really protect anything but rather alert the recipient to tampering. Signatures can are applied with or without encryption. The checking of the signature is not performed during transit. The signature is checked by the recipient when the data is checked. The digital signature is used when data is used.","upvote_count":"2","timestamp":"1708472940.0"},{"poster":"nelombg","comment_id":"911461","content":"B.

This is because digital signatures provide a way to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data during transmission, which is particularly important when data is being sent over an insecure network such as the internet.\n\nDigital signatures work by using cryptography to create a unique \"signature\" of the data that can be verified by the recipient to ensure that the data has not been tampered with or altered during transmission. This helps to prevent unauthorized access, interception, or modification of the data while it is in transit.\n\nIn contrast, digital signatures may not be as necessary for data that is in a \"stored\" state, such as data that is saved on a secure server or database. In this case, other security mechanisms such as access controls, encryption, and backups may be more important for protecting the data.","timestamp":"1683394380.0","upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"890915","poster":"ikamalbhatt"},{"timestamp":"1658909460.0","comment_id":"637922","upvote_count":"2","content":"TLS also used digital certificates.
