Security misconfiguration"}],"answer_ET":"A","topic":"1","timestamp":"2022-05-19 19:37:00","answer_description":"Security misconfigurations occur when applications and systems are not properly configured or maintained in a secure manner. This can be due to a shortcoming in security baselines or configurations, unauthorized changes to system configurations, or a failure to patch and upgrade systems as the vendor releases security patches. Insecure direct object references occur when code references aspects of the infrastructure, especially internal or private systems, and an attacker can use that knowledge to glean more information about the infrastructure. Unvalidated redirects and forwards occur when an application has functions to forward users to other sites, and these functions are not properly secured to validate the data and redirect requests, allowing spoofing for malware or phishing attacks.\nSensitive data exposure occurs when an application does not use sufficient encryption and other security controls to protect sensitive application data.","answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/75921-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-248-discussion/","choices":{"D":"Sensitive data exposure","B":"Insecure direct object references","A":"Security misconfiguration","C":"Unvalidated redirects and forwards"},"unix_timestamp":1652981820,"question_text":"Which of the following threat types can occur when baselines are not appropriately applied or when unauthorized changes are made?","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"]},{"id":"GRmjJsz6XUaiO2fjItHa","answers_community":["C (40%)","B (40%)","D (20%)"],"timestamp":"2020-08-13 23:56:00","answer":"C","question_text":"Which of the following is considered an internal redundancy for a data center?","question_id":167,"topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1597355760,"exam_id":184,"question_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Power feeds","C":"Network circuits","D":"Generators","B":"Chillers"},"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1313170","timestamp":"1731781020.0","poster":"RoPsur","content":"Selected Answer: B\nthey are part of the internal cooling infrastructure","upvote_count":"1"},{"timestamp":"1696153920.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nB require internal redundancy, but not an internal redundancy for other.\nD Generators is an internal redundancy for power/ups fail.","comments":[{"poster":"arien_chen","timestamp":"1696255020.0","comment_id":"1023138","content":"correct my answer to B.\nRefer to the answer of #57, generators is not 'internal' redundancy.\n'internal' means inside the data center.\nAnswer is B.

Prioritization. In a cloud environment, resources are often shared among many different customers.

Resource contention\nimplies that there are too many requests for resources based on the\nactual available amount of resources currently in the system. If resource\ncontention takes place, share values are used to prioritize compute\nresource access for all guests assigned a certain ratio of shares. The\nshares are weighed and used as a percentage against all outstanding\nshares assigned and in use by all powered-on guests to calculate the\namount of resources each individual guest will be given access to. The\nhigher the share value assigned to a guest, the larger the percentage of\nthe remaining resources that guest will be given access to during the\ncontention period"},{"timestamp":"1640818500.0","comment_id":"512826","poster":"AWSPro24","upvote_count":"2","content":"This is the strangest question.
