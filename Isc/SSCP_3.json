A memory card holds information but cannot process information. A smart card holds information and has the necessary hardware and software to actually process that information.\nA memory card holds a users authentication information, so that this user needs only type in a user ID or PIN and presents the memory card to the system. If the entered information and the stored information match and are approved by an authentication service, the user is successfully authenticated.\nA common example of a memory card is a swipe card used to provide entry to a building. The user enters a PIN and swipes the memory card through a card reader. If this is the correct combination, the reader flashes green and the individual can open the door and enter the building.\nMemory cards can also be used with computers, but they require a reader to process the information. The reader adds cost to the process, especially when one is needed for every computer. Additionally, the overhead of PIN and card generation adds additional overhead and complexity to the whole authentication process.\nHowever, a memory card provides a more secure authentication method than using only a password because the attacker would need to obtain the card and know the correct PIN.\nAdministrators and management need to weigh the costs and benefits of a memory card implementation as well as the security needs of the organization to determine if it is the right authentication mechanism for their environment.\nOne of the most prevalent weaknesses of memory cards is that data stored on the card are not protected. Unencrypted data on the card (or stored on the magnetic strip) can be extracted or copied. Unlike a smart card, where security controls and logic are embedded in the integrated circuit, memory cards do not employ an inherent mechanism to protect the data from exposure.\nVery little trust can be associated with confidentiality and integrity of information on the memory cards.\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\"Smart cards provide two-factor authentication whereas memory cards don't\" is incorrect. This is not necessarily true. A memory card can be combined with a pin or password to offer two factors authentication where something you have and something you know are used for factors.\n\"Memory cards normally hold more memory than smart cards\" is incorrect. While a memory card may or may not have more memory than a smart card, this is certainly not the best answer to the question.\n\"Only smart cards can be used for ATM cards\" is incorrect. This depends on the decisions made by the particular institution and is not the best answer to the question.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nShon Harris, CISSP All In One, 6th edition , Access Control, Page 199 and also for people using the Kindle edition of the book you can look at Locations 4647-\n4650.\nSchneiter, Andrew (2013-04-15).

It was developed by David Elliott Bell and Leonard J. LaPadula, subsequent to strong guidance from Roger R. Schell to formalize the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) multilevel security (MLS) policy. The model is a formal state transition model of computer security policy that describes a set of access control rules which use security labels on objects and clearances for subjects. Security labels range from the most sensitive (e.g.\"Top Secret\"), down to the least sensitive (e.g.,\n\"Unclassified\" or \"Public\").\nThe BellLaPadula model focuses on data confidentiality and controlled access to classified information, in contrast to the Biba Integrity Model which describes rules for the protection of data integrity. In this formal model, the entities in an information system are divided into subjects and objects.\nThe notion of a \"secure state\" is defined, and it is proven that each state transition preserves security by moving from secure state to secure state, thereby inductively proving that the system satisfies the security objectives of the model. The BellLaPadula model is built on the concept of a state machine with a set of allowable states in a computer network system. The transition from one state to another state is defined by transition functions.\nA system state is defined to be \"secure\" if the only permitted access modes of subjects to objects are in accordance with a security policy. To determine whether a specific access mode is allowed, the clearance of a subject is compared to the classification of the object (more precisely, to the combination of classification and set of compartments, making up the security level) to determine if the subject is authorized for the specific access mode.\nThe clearance/classification scheme is expressed in terms of a lattice. The model defines two mandatory access control (MAC) rules and one discretionary access control (DAC) rule with three security properties:\nThe Simple Security Property - a subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level (no read-up).\nThe -property (read \"star\"-property) - a subject at a given security level must not write to any object at a lower security level (no write-down). The -property is also known as the Confinement property.\nThe Discretionary Security Property - use of an access matrix to specify the discretionary access control.\nThe following are incorrect answers:\nAccountability is incorrect. Accountability requires that actions be traceable to the user that performed them and is not addressed by the Bell-LaPadula model.\nIntegrity is incorrect. Integrity is addressed in the Biba model rather than Bell-Lapadula.\nAvailability is incorrect. Availability is concerned with assuring that data/services are available to authorized users as specified in service level objectives and is not addressed by the Bell-Lapadula model.\nReferences:\n\nCBK, pp. 325-326 -\n\nAIO3, pp. 279 - 284 -\nAIOv4 Security Architecture and Design (pages 333 - 336)\nAIOv5 Security Architecture and Design (pages 336 - 338)\nWikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell-La_Padula_model","topic":"1","question_images":[],"exam_id":189,"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/117868-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-131-discussion/","answer_ET":"C"},{"id":"WrZyVUWtFG3epHkz0KLl","answer_ET":"B","answer_description":"D or \"minimal protection\" is reserved for systems that were evaluated under the TCSEC but did not meet the requirements for a higher trust level.\nA is incorrect.
