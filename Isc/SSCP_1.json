Because the subject does not need to have direct contact with the optical reader, direct light can impact the reader.\nAn Iris recognition is a form of biometrics that is based on the uniqueness of a subject's iris. A camera like device records the patterns of the iris creating what is known as Iriscode.\nIt is the unique patterns of the iris that allow it to be one of the most accurate forms of biometric identification of an individual. Unlike other types of biometics, the iris rarely changes over time. Fingerprints can change over time due to scaring and manual labor, voice patterns can change due to a variety of causes, hand geometry can also change as well. But barring surgery or an accident it is not usual for an iris to change. The subject has a high-resoulution image taken of their iris and this is then converted to Iriscode. The current standard for the Iriscode was developed by John Daugman. When the subject attempts to be authenticated an infrared light is used to capture the iris image and this image is then compared to the Iriscode. If there is a match the subject's identity is confirmed. The subject does not need to have direct contact with the optical reader so it is a less invasive means of authentication then retinal scanning would be.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nAIO, 3rd edition, Access Control, p 134.\nAIO, 4th edition, Access Control, p 182.\nWikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_recognition\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nconcern that the laser beam may cause eye damage. The optical readers do not use laser so, concern that the laser beam may cause eye damage is not an issue. the iris pattern changes as a person grows older. The question asked about the physical installation of the scanner, so this was not the best answer. If the question would have been about long term problems then it could have been the best choice. Recent research has shown that Irises actually do change over time: http://www.nature.com/news/ageing-eyes-hinder-biometric-scans-1.10722 there is a relatively high rate of false accepts. Since the advent of the Iriscode there is a very low rate of false accepts, in fact the algorithm used has never had a false match. This all depends on the quality of the equipment used but because of the uniqueness of the iris even when comparing identical twins, iris patterns are unique.","answer_ET":"D","topic":"1","question_text":"A potential problem related to the physical installation of the Iris Scanner in regards to the usage of the iris pattern within a biometric system is:","unix_timestamp":1682516640,"timestamp":"2023-04-26 15:44:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/107591-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-1-discussion/","question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"exam_id":189},{"id":"iFX0MxbJWp4Wh25nj0Ms","topic":"1","answer_ET":"A","exam_id":189,"timestamp":"2023-04-26 15:55:00","question_text":"A confidential number used as an authentication factor to verify a user's identity is called a:","question_id":2,"answer":"A","answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"answers_community":[],"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1274603","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1724946360.0","poster":"ferdzbernz","content":"not part"},{"timestamp":"1682517300.0","comment_id":"881699","content":"Answer A","upvote_count":"1","poster":"Niitetteh"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/107602-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-10-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1682517300,"choices":{"C":"Password","D":"Challenge","A":"PIN","B":"User ID"},"answer_description":"PIN Stands for Personal Identification Number, as the name states it is a combination of numbers.\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nUser ID This is incorrect because a Userid is not required to be a number and a Userid is only used to establish identity not verify it.\nPassword.
