Regression testing focuses on retesting previously tested functionality after changes or new features have been introduced into the software, helping ensure that existing functionality performs as expected.\n\nRegression testing can be very efficient because it uses automated tools to select specific test cases from a large pool of possible scenarios, minimizing costs associated with running unnecessary tests while prioritizing those most likely to identify issues.\n\nTo maintain effective security measures and control risks around their systems, organizations must implement comprehensive Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices. Implementing regression testing as an essential part of SDLC continuous integration allows developers to quickly identify potential issues before moving code into production environments.","poster":"74gjd_37","comment_id":"1021720","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1727714820.0"}],"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/121926-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-9-discussion/","exam_id":188,"isMC":true,"answer_ET":"changes.

Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, or old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code.\nRegression testing tests the system efficiency by systematically selecting the suitable and minimum set of tests that are required to effectively cover the affected developer takes the smallest unit of an application, isolates it from the rest of the application code, and tests it to determine whether it works as expected. Unit testing is performed before integrating these independent units into modules. The most common approach to unit testing requires drivers and stubs to be written. the application before its implementation into the production environment. It is done either by a client or an application specialist to ensure that the software meets against a software design. Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together (\"big bang\"). Normally the former is considered a better practice since it allows interface issues to be localized more quickly and fixed. Integration testing works to expose defects in the interfaces and interaction between the integrated components (modules). Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and tested until the software works as a system.","answers_community":["D (100%)"],"answer":"D"},{"id":"cGBbSqat2ES9RvmVQQUh","question_id":172,"topic":"2","timestamp":"2025-03-15 17:44:00","answer_ET":"get usernames, passwords, etc. Answer: D is incorrect.

Keystroke logging is a method of logging and recording user keystrokes. It can be performed with software or hardware devices. Keystroke logging devices can record everything a person types using his keyboard, such as to measure employee's productivity on certain clerical tasks. These types of devices can also be used to come from an authentic source by forging the IP address, email address, caller ID, etc. In IP spoofing, a hacker modifies packet headers by using someone else's\nIP address to hide his identity. However, spoofing cannot be used while surfing the Internet, chatting on-line, etc. because forging the source IP address causes packet sniffing is known as sniffers. There are many packet-sniffing programs that are available on the Internet. Some of these are unauthorized, which can be harmful for a network's security.","choices":{"C":"Spoofing","D":"Wiretapping","B":"Keystroke logging","A":"Packet sniffing"},"isMC":true,"discussion":[{"comment_id":"1398932","timestamp":"1742057040.0","poster":"01be656","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nkeystroke"}],"question_text":"Which of the following is used by attackers to record everything a person types, including usernames, passwords, and account information?","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/169104-exam-csslp-topic-2-question-93-discussion/","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1742057040,"exam_id":188,"answer":"B","answers_community":["B (100%)"]},{"id":"aTVTAXFejH5Oh0sTiSEy","unix_timestamp":1725203100,"choices":{"C":"Configuration identification","D":"Configuration auditing","B":"Documentation control","A":"Configuration control"},"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1276133","timestamp":"1725203100.0","content":"Selected Answer: A\nConfiguration control is the method used to ensure that system changes are approved before implementation, that only approved changes are implemented, and that the changes are complete and accurate.","poster":"DiPalma184"}],"question_images":[],"topic":"3","answer_description":"Documentation control is a method of ensuring that system changes should be agreed upon before being implemented, only the proposed and approved changes are implemented, and the implementation is complete and accurate. Documentation control is involved in the strict events for proposing, monitoring, and approving system changes and their implementation. It helps the change process by supporting the person who synchronizes the analytical task,\nConfiguration auditing is the quality assurance element of configuration management. It is occupied in the process of periodic checks to establish the consistency and completeness of accounting information and to validate that all configuration management policies are being followed. Configuration audits are broken into functional and physical configuration audits. They occur either at delivery or at the moment of effecting the change. A functional configuration audit ensures that functional and performance attributes of a configuration item are achieved, while a physical configuration audit ensures that a configuration item is installed in management. Configuration control is a set of processes and approval stages required to change a configuration item's attributes and to re-baseline them. It supports the change of the functional and physical attributes of software at various points in time, and performs systematic control of changes to the identified configuration item is a product (hardware and/or software) that has an end-user purpose. These attributes are recorded in configuration documentation and baselined. Baselining an attribute forces formal configuration change control processes to be effected in the event that these attributes are changed.","answer_images":[],"question_id":173,"answer":"A","timestamp":"2024-09-01 17:05:00","exam_id":188,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_ET":"approves system changes, reviews the implementation of changes, and oversees other tasks such as documenting the controls.
