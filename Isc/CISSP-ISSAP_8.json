Off-site storage.\n\nOff-site storage involves storing documents, data backups, and other physical media in a different physical location than the primary computer center or data center. This is done to mitigate risks such as natural disasters, theft, or physical damage that could impact both the primary site and its stored information simultaneously.\n\nBy keeping document copies and backup media off-site, organizations ensure that critical information can be retrieved and restored in case of a disaster at the primary location. Off-site storage adds an additional layer of protection for sensitive or essential data by minimizing single points of failure.","poster":"74gjd_37"},{"timestamp":"1695912900.0","poster":"Banzaaai","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"681821","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB.
