But C is the better answer.\n\nB. GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act): This U.S. federal law, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, focuses on protecting consumers' personal financial information held by financial institutions. It includes provisions to protect personal data, requires financial institutions to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers, and safeguards sensitive data.\n\nC. SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act): This is the correct answer. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is a U.S. federal law that established comprehensive auditing and financial regulations for public companies.
