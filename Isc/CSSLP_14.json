It is a method of distributing MIDlet suites. MIDlet suite providers install their MIDlet suites on Web servers and provide a hypertext link for downloading. A user can use this link to download the MIDlet suite either through the\nInternet microbrowser or through WAP on his device. Over-the-air provisioning is required for end-to-end encryption or other security purposes in order to deliver properties for unique identification and the use of concealment to avoid tampering attacks are the security challenges in digital rights management (DRM).","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"copyrighted software to a mobile device.
