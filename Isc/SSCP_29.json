TACACS+ can do this because it separates authentication and authorization functions, while RADIUS canâ€™t because it combines them. So RADIUS does not allow to control your users on which commands can be executed on a router and which cannot.\n\nAnother important advantage is that TACACS+ encrypts the entire payload of the TACACS+ packet, which provides secure communication between the Network Access Server (NAS) and the TACACS+ server. RADIUS, on the other hand, encrypts only the password, so intercepting packets can reveal important information.","timestamp":"1731170040.0","comment_id":"1208904"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1154749","content":"I meant C for the previous question please delete this","poster":"j904","timestamp":"1724154000.0"},{"content":"Selected Answer: C\nThis question was seen earlier and is C","timestamp":"1724153940.0","poster":"j904","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1154747"}],"choices":{"A":"TACACS+","D":"TACACS","C":"PAP","B":"RADIUS"},"question_images":[],"exam_id":189,"answer":"C","answer_images":[],"question_id":142,"topic":"6","isMC":true,"timestamp":"2024-02-20 14:39:00","answer_ET":"A"},{"id":"ZN7yEyzYbYVK9hOyl6Xi","isMC":true,"answer_ET":"C","unix_timestamp":1605522540,"timestamp":"2020-11-16 11:29:00","question_id":143,"answers_community":[],"discussion":[{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"451484","poster":"Yupata","content":"B is correct","timestamp":"1727277360.0"},{"timestamp":"1722704100.0","comment_id":"419316","poster":"steumi12","upvote_count":"1","content":"Yep.
