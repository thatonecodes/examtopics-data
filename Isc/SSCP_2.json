Another model that fits within the NDAC category is Rule-Based Access Control (RuBAC or RBAC). Most of the CISSP books use the same acronym for both models but\nNIST tend to use a lowercase \"u\" in between R and B to differentiate the two models.\nYou can certainly mimic MAC using RBAC but true MAC makes use of Labels which contains the sensitivity of the objects and the categories they belong to. No labels means MAC is not being used.\nOne of the most fundamental data access control decisions an organization must make is the amount of control it will give system and data owners to specify the level of access users of that data will have. In every organization there is a balancing point between the access controls enforced by organization and system policy and the ability for information owners to determine who can have access based on specific business requirements. The process of translating that balance into a workable access control model can be defined by three general access frameworks:\n\nDiscretionary access control -\n\nMandatory access control -\n\nNondiscretionary access control -\nA role-based access control (RBAC) model bases the access control authorizations on the roles (or functions) that the user is assigned within an organization.\nThe determination of what roles have access to a resource can be governed by the owner of the data, as with DACs, or applied based on policy, as with MACs.\nAccess control decisions are based on job function, previously defined and governed by policy, and each role (job function) will have its own access capabilities.\nObjects associated with a role will inherit privileges assigned to that role. This is also true for groups of users, allowing administrators to simplify access control strategies by assigning users to groups and groups to roles.\nThere are several approaches to RBAC. As with many system controls, there are variations on how they can be applied within a computer system.\nThere are four basic RBAC architectures:\n1. Non-RBAC: Non-RBAC is simply a user-granted access to data or an application by traditional mapping, such as with ACLs. There are no formal \"roles\" associated with the mappings, other than any identified by the particular user.\n2. Limited RBAC: Limited RBAC is achieved when users are mapped to roles within a single application rather than through an organization-wide role structure.\nUsers in a limited RBAC system are also able to access non-RBAC-based applications or data. For example, a user may be assigned to multiple roles within several applications and, in addition, have direct access to another application or system independent of his or her assigned role. The key attribute of limited\nRBAC is that the role for that user is defined within an application and not necessarily based on the users organizational job function.\n3. Hybrid RBAC: Hybrid RBAC introduces the use of a role that is applied to multiple applications or systems based on a users specific role within the organization. That role is then applied to applications or systems that subscribe to the organizationâ€™s role-based model. However, as the term \"hybrid\" suggests, there are instances where the subject may also be assigned to roles defined solely within specific applications, complimenting (or, perhaps, contradicting) the larger, more encompassing organizational role used by other systems.\n4. Full RBAC: Full RBAC systems are controlled by roles defined by the organizations policy and access control infrastructure and then applied to applications and systems across the enterprise. The applications, systems, and associated data apply permissions based on that enterprise definition, and not one defined by a specific application or system.\nBe careful not to try to make MAC and DAC opposites of each other -- they are two different access control strategies with RBAC being a third strategy that was defined later to address some of the limitations of MAC and DAC.\nThe other answers are not correct because:\nMandatory access control is incorrect because though it is by definition not discretionary, it is not called \"non-discretionary access control.\" MAC makes use of label to indicate the sensitivity of the object and it also makes use of categories to implement the need to know.\nLabel-based access control is incorrect because this is not a name for a type of access control but simply a bogus detractor.\nLattice based access control is not adequate either. A lattice is a series of levels and a subject will be granted an upper and lower bound within the series of levels. These levels could be sensitivity levels or they could be confidentiality levels or they could be integrity levels.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nAll in One, third edition, page 165.\nFerraiolo, D., Kuhn, D. & Chandramouli, R.

For example, a table identifies the object, specifies access rights allowed for a subject, and permits access based on the user's posession of a capability (or ticket) for the object.\" CBK, pp. 191-192. The distinction that makes this an incorrect choice is that access is based on posession of a capability by the subject.\nTo put it another way, as noted in AIO3 on p. 169, \"A capabiltiy table is different from an ACL because the subject is bound to the capability table, whereas the object is bound to the ACL.\"\nAn access control matrix is incorrect. The access control matrix is a way of describing the rules for an access control strategy. The matrix lists the users, groups and roles down the left side and the resources and functions across the top. The cells of the matrix can either indicate that access is allowed or indicate the type of access. CBK pp 317 - 318.\nAIO3, p. 169 describes it as a table if subjects and objects specifying the access rights a certain subject possesses pertaining to specific objects.\nIn either case, the matrix is a way of analyzing the access control needed by a population of subjects to a population of objects. This access control can be applied using rules, ACL's, capability tables, etc.\nA role-based matrix is incorrect. Again, a matrix of roles vs objects could be used as a tool for thinking about the access control to be applied to a set of objects.\nThe results of the analysis could then be implemented using RBAC.\nReferences:\nCBK, Domain 2: Access Control.\nAIO3, Chapter 4: Access Control","unix_timestamp":1704423780,"answer":"C","answer_ET":"B","question_images":[],"timestamp":"2024-01-05 04:03:00","answer_images":[],"question_id":9,"exam_id":189},{"id":"zlBB8dBtuvpBPOZcy4GO","question_images":[],"choices":{"D":"They are basically the same.","B":"Access control lists are related/attached to an object whereas capability tables are related/attached to a subject.","C":"Capability tables are used for objects whereas access control lists are used for users.","A":"Access control lists are related/attached to a subject whereas capability tables are related/attached to an object."},"isMC":true,"question_id":10,"unix_timestamp":1691710260,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/117866-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-125-discussion/","answers_community":["B (100%)"],"timestamp":"2023-08-11 01:31:00","exam_id":189,"answer":"B","answer_ET":"B","answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"978137","poster":"Rixster","timestamp":"1723332660.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: B\nB is correct"}],"topic":"1","answer_description":"Capability tables are used to track, manage and apply controls based on the object and rights, or capabilities of a subject.
