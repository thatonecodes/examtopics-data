Containment.\n\nContainment involves implementing measures to prevent further damage and minimize the impact of an incident. In the case of a DOS attack, this could involve isolating affected systems or networks, blocking traffic from known malicious IP addresses, adjusting firewall rules to filter out malicious traffic patterns, or utilizing load balancers to distribute incoming requests more effectively.\n\nOnce containment has been achieved and immediate threats have been neutralized, the incident handler can then proceed to other phases such as identification (to determine how and why the incident occurred), recovery (to restore affected services or systems), and preparation (to implement preventive measures for future incidents).\n\n in this specific scenario where it has already been identified that the problem is a Denial of Service (DOS) attack, the next phase in the Incident handling process should not be Identification.\n\nSince you have already identified that it is a DOS attack from a network linked to your internal enterprise network, the next phase should indeed be A. Containment. The Containment phase involves taking immediate actions to mitigate and limit further damage caused by the incident, as mentioned earlier."}],"unix_timestamp":1698012600,"answer_images":[],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-10-23 00:10:00","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124400-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-34-discussion/","isMC":true,"exam_id":186,"answer_ET":"A","choices":{"A":"Containment","D":"Identification","B":"Preparation","C":"Recovery"},"question_id":26},{"id":"GBpbyRf5qdO8Oi6Etq29","answer_description":"","topic":"1","question_text":"You have decided to implement video surveillance in your company in order to enhance network security.

CHAP.\n\nCHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) is a protocol commonly used in authentication processes, often in remote access scenarios. It uses the Message Digest (MD5) hashing function to compare two values - one generated by the client and the other stored on the server. The comparison helps verify the identity of the client trying to establish a connection with an authenticator.\n\nPEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol), EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), and EAP-TLS (EAP-Transport Layer Security) are also authentication protocols, but they do not specifically involve comparing values calculated using MD5 hashing for their operation.","timestamp":"1729635120.0","upvote_count":"2"}],"answers_community":[],"answer":"A","exam_id":186,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124401-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-37-discussion/","answer_ET":"A","answer_description":"","question_images":[],"choices":{"B":"PEAP","C":"EAP","A":"CHAP","D":"EAP-TLS"},"answer_images":[],"isMC":true,"topic":"1"},{"id":"WLEhoerId0WzmzoJ9jhW","question_id":30,"answer_ET":"C","choices":{"C":"Cryptography","B":"OODA loop","A":"Risk analysis","D":"Firewall security"},"unix_timestamp":1698014100,"discussion":[{"timestamp":"1729636500.0","upvote_count":"1","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC. Cryptography.\n\nCryptography involves securing communication by encrypting messages to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. It uses mathematical algorithms to transform plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable without the cryptographic key. This ensures confidentiality and integrity of data being transmitted over networks or stored in storage systems.\n\nCryptographic techniques also enable secure authentication by verifying the identity of parties involved in a communication using digital signatures or certificates. Additionally, cryptography provides non-repudiation services so that senders cannot deny having sent a particular message.\n\nWhile tools such as risk analysis (A), OODA loop (B), and firewall security (D) play important roles in information and cybersecurity, they do not provide encryption capabilities for modifying messages like cryptography does.","poster":"74gjd_37","comment_id":"1051181"}],"question_images":[],"timestamp":"2023-10-23 00:35:00","answer_description":"","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124404-exam-cissp-issap-topic-1-question-38-discussion/","exam_id":186,"question_text":"Which of the following is a technique used for modifying messages, providing Information and Cyber security, and reducing the risk of hacking attacks during communications and message passing over the Internet?","answer_images":[],"answer":"C","topic":"1","isMC":true,"answers_community":["C (100%)"]}],"exam":{"isMCOnly":true,"provider":"Isc","id":186,"isImplemented":true,"isBeta":false,"name":"CISSP-ISSAP","numberOfQuestions":108,"lastUpdated":"12 Apr 2025"},"currentPage":6},"__N_SSP":true}
