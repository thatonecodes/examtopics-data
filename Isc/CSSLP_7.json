Its uniqueness makes the product noticeable among the same type of products. For example, Pentium and Athlon are brand names of the CPUs that are manufactured by Intel and AMD, respectively. The trademark law protects a company's trademark by making it illegal for other companies to use it without taking prior permission of the trademark owner. A trademark is registered so that information which is not generally known. It helps a business to obtain an economic advantage over its competitors or customers. In some jurisdictions, such holder the exclusive right to produce copies of his or her works of original expression, such as a literary work, movie, musical work or sound recording, painting, photograph, computer program, or industrial design, for a defined, yet extendable, period of time.

After giving the program an area code and 3 digit prefix, the program then serially dialed every phone number in that prefix in order, recording which phone numbers were answered by a computer modem. Soon after, most likely because it was popularized by the movie, serial dialing was outlawed. Hackers got around this by simply randomizing the order the program dialed all the numbers. Later the terms \"demon dialing\" and \"war dialing\" became synonymous."}],"answer":"A","answer_ET":"Information about these modems can then be used to attempt external unauthorized access.
