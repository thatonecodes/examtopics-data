In essence, any time data is considered \"new,\" it is in the create phase. This can come from data that is newly created, data that is imported into a system and is new to that system, or data that is already present and modified into a new form or value. Modifying the metadata does not change the actual data.","topic":"1","exam_id":184,"timestamp":"2022-05-18 19:16:00","answer":"C","isMC":true,"choices":{"B":"Importing data","D":"Constructing new data","A":"Modifying metadata","C":"Modifying data"},"discussion":[{"poster":"lolanczos","content":"Selected Answer: A\nIt's A. Metadata refers to data about data, such as file size, creation date, and author information. Modifying metadata involves changing these descriptive attributes without creating new data. According to the (ISC)² CCSP Official Study Guide, the Create phase is focused on the generation or importation of new data, not on altering existing descriptive information.","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1734622800.0","comment_id":"1329025"},{"poster":"sweetykaur","content":"You\nWhich of the following actions will NOT make data part of the \"create\" phase of the cloud data lifecycle?\n\nA.

The challenge during the \"destroy\" phase for SaaS customers is ensuring that their data within the application is properly deleted when it is no longer needed. This includes ensuring that all copies and backups of the data are securely erased to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.\n\nWhile IaaS customers have direct control over virtualized infrastructure resources, including data storage and virtual machines, securely deleting data in IaaS can be more straightforward compared to SaaS because customers have direct access to the underlying infrastructure and can manage data deletion processes more directly."}],"comment_id":"1163189","content":"The question should say cloud service provider for SAAS to be correct.
