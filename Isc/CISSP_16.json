Allowed number of characters\n\nThis type of negative testing is an example of testing for the allowed number of characters. This test is to ensure that user entry fields will not accept invalid input of any length. This test is used to check the validation of the input fields and to ensure that the application is not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"will not accept input of any length is \"A\" but will not accept invalid input of any length is \"C\"","comment_id":"882051","poster":"babaseun","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","content":"C is correct","timestamp":"1683940200.0","comment_id":"896317","poster":"jackdryan"}],"timestamp":"1682547660.0"}],"poster":"Dee83","timestamp":"1674591840.0","comment_id":"786917","upvote_count":"4"},{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1674391080.0","comment_id":"784294","poster":"827","content":"Selected Answer: C\nReasonable data – Some applications and web pages include fields that have a reasonable limit, for example, entering 200 or a negative number as the value for the “Your age:” field is not allowed.
