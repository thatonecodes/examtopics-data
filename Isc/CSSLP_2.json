This provides protection against an attacker compromising a single machine, as the redundant processes on other systems would still be intact.\nData redundancy (option A) primarily protects against data loss or corruption, but doesn't inherently prevent unauthorized software insertion or data alteration on a compromised machine.\nHardware redundancy (option B) provides backup hardware components, but doesn't directly address software-based attacks or data alteration.\nApplication redundancy (option D) is similar to process redundancy, but the question specifically mentions process redundancy as an option.\nTherefore, process redundancy (C) is the best answer, as running redundant processes on separate systems provides protection against an attacker compromising and altering data on a single physical machine.","timestamp":"1720799400.0","upvote_count":"1","poster":"c4310dc","comment_id":"1246865"},{"poster":"74gjd_37","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: B\nOption B: Hardware Redundancy - should be the answer.\n\nThe key is the work \"physical\" in the question. This type of redundancy can prevent attacks on physical machines because even if an attacker gains physical control of a single machine and inserts unauthorized software in it; the redundant system remains unaffected and secure.","comments":[{"content":"The other options, Data redundancy, Process redundancy and Application redundancy are incorrect because they do not specifically prevent attacks in which an attacker can get physical control of a machine.\n- Data redundancy refers to storing duplicate copies of the same data to ensure that it is always accessible but this does not address security issues arising from physical compromise.\n- Process redundancy involves having multiple identical processes set up as backups for each other so that if one fails the others can take over; again, this does not provide protection against attacks on physical machines.\n- Application Redundancy involves running multiple instances of the same application to ensure high availability and scalability. While this could reduce disruption caused by software failures or scheduled maintenance on applications systems it may have little impact on preventing physical breach induced attack vectors .","comment_id":"1018657","poster":"74gjd_37","timestamp":"1695806820.0","upvote_count":"1"}],"comment_id":"1018656","timestamp":"1695806760.0"},{"comment_id":"629035","poster":"4e3rv21rq3vq2q","timestamp":"1657348980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nC.
