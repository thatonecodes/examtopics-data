The TLS record protocol is the actual secure communications method for transmitting data; it's responsible for the encryption and authentication of packets throughout their transmission between the parties, and in some cases it also performs compression. Negotiation and binding are not protocols under TLS.","question_id":266,"timestamp":"2022-05-22 12:58:00","discussion":[{"content":"Selected Answer: D\nThe Handshake Protocol in TLS (Transport Layer Security) is responsible for negotiating and establishing a secure connection between two parties (client and server).
