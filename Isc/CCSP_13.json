Cloud interoperability is the ability of a customer’s system to interact with a cloud service or the ability for one cloud service to interact with other cloud services by exchanging information according to a prescribed method to obtain predictable results.\n---------\nPortability, on the other hand, is moving the data and/or applications from one system to another and having it remain useable or executable. Cloud data portability is the ability to easily move data from one cloud service to another without needing to re-enter the data. Cloud application portability is the ability to migrate an application from one cloud service to another or between a customer’s environment and a cloud service.\n---------------------------------------","comment_id":"243565","poster":"NYF"},{"comment_id":"368754","timestamp":"1622206020.0","poster":"topcat","content":"Answer is given:\nInteroperability\nMove or reuse components of an application on the same time\nPortability\nEasily and seamlessly move between different cloud providers.\n\nKey word is components","upvote_count":"11"},{"timestamp":"1740931320.0","content":"Selected Answer: D\nPortability in cloud computing refers to the ability to reuse or move components of an application or service across different cloud environments with minimal modification.
