Introduction\nThe Kerberos V5 protocol [RFC4120] involves use of a trusted third party known as the Key Distribution Center (KDC) to negotiate shared session keys between clients and services and provide mutual authentication between them.\nThe corner-stones of Kerberos V5 are the Ticket and the Authenticator. A Ticket encapsulates a symmetric key (the ticket session key) in an envelope (a public message) intended for a specific service. The contents of the Ticket are encrypted with a symmetric key shared between the service principal and the issuing KDC. The encrypted part of the Ticket contains the client principal name, among other items. An Authenticator is a record that can be shown to have been recently generated using the ticket session key in the associated Ticket. The ticket session key is known by the client who requested the ticket. The contents of the Authenticator are encrypted with the associated ticket session key. The encrypted part of an Authenticator contains a timestamp and the client principal name, among other items.\nAs shown in Figure 1, below, the Kerberos V5 protocol consists of the following message exchanges between the client and the KDC, and the client and the application service:\nThe Authentication Service (AS) Exchange\nThe client obtains an \"initial\" ticket from the Kerberos authentication server (AS), typically a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). The AS-REQ message and the AS-\nREP message are the request and the reply message, respectively, between the client and the AS.\nThe Ticket Granting Service (TGS) Exchange\nThe client subsequently uses the TGT to authenticate and request a service ticket for a particular service, from the Kerberos ticket-granting server (TGS). The\nTGS-REQ message and the TGS-REP message are the request and the reply message respectively between the client and the TGS.\nThe Client/Server Authentication Protocol (AP) Exchange\nThe client then makes a request with an AP-REQ message, consisting of a service ticket and an authenticator that certifies the client's possession of the ticket session key. The server may optionally reply with an AP-REP message. AP exchanges typically negotiate session-specific symmetric keys.\nUsually, the AS and TGS are integrated in a single device also known as the KDC.\n+--------------+\n+--------->| KDC |\nAS-REQ / +-------| |\n/ / +--------------+\n/ / ^ |\n/ |AS-REP / |\n| | / TGS-REQ + TGS-REP\n| | / /\n| | / /\n| | / +---------+\n| | / /\n| | / /\n| | / /\n| v / v\n++-------+------+ +-----------------+\n| Client +------------>| Application |\n| | AP-REQ | Server |\n| |<------------| |\n+---------------+ AP-REP +-----------------+\nFigure 1: The Message Exchanges in the Kerberos V5 Protocol\nIn the AS exchange, the KDC reply contains the ticket session key, among other items, that is encrypted using a key (the AS reply key) shared between the client and the KDC. The AS reply key is typically derived from the client's password for human users. Therefore, for human users, the attack resistance strength of the Kerberos protocol is no stronger than the strength of their passwords.\nSource: KRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, John Wiley & Sons, 2001, Chapter 2:\nAccess control systems (page 40).\n\nAnd -\nHARRIS, Shon, All-In-One CISSP Certification Exam Guide, McGraw-Hill/Osborne, 2002, chapter 4: Access Control (pages 147-151). and http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4556.txt","choices":{"C":"Kerberos uses public key cryptography.","B":"Kerberos is mostly a third-party authentication protocol.","A":"A client can be impersonated by password-guessing.","D":"Kerberos provides robust authentication."},"timestamp":"2023-08-30 15:50:00","question_id":22,"unix_timestamp":1693403400,"question_images":[],"answer_images":[],"topic":"1"},{"id":"lBmZKiem087ta75ZO9uu","answer_ET":"C","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/119439-exam-sscp-topic-1-question-157-discussion/","isMC":true,"question_text":"Which of the following statements pertaining to Kerberos is false?","discussion":[{"poster":"Rixster","timestamp":"1725025980.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nThe statement that is FALSE is: C.

Identity-based access control (IBAC) is access control based on the identity of the user (typically relayed as a characteristic of the process acting on behalf of that user) where access authorizations to specific objects are assigned based on user identity.\nRule Based Access Control (RuBAC) and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) are examples of non-discretionary access controls.\nRule-based access control is a type of non-discretionary access control because this access is determined by rules and the subject does not decide what those rules will be, the rules are uniformly applied to ALL of the users or subjects.\nIn general, all access control policies other than DAC are grouped in the category of non-discretionary access control (NDAC). As the name implies, policies in this category have rules that are not established at the discretion of the user. Non-discretionary policies establish controls that cannot be changed by users, but only through administrative action.\nBoth Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Rule Based Access Control (RuBAC) fall within Non Discretionary Access Control (NDAC). If it is not DAC or MAC then it is most likely NDAC.\nBELOW YOU HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES:\n\nMAC = Mandatory Access Control -\nUnder a mandatory access control environment, the system or security administrator will define what permissions subjects have on objects. The administrator does not dictate users access but simply configure the proper level of access as dictated by the Data Owner.\nThe MAC system will look at the Security Clearance of the subject and compare it with the object sensitivity level or classification level. This is what is called the dominance relationship.\nThe subject must DOMINATE the object sensitivity level. Which means that the subject must have a security clearance equal or higher than the object he is attempting to access.\nMAC also introduce the concept of labels. Every objects will have a label attached to them indicating the classification of the object as well as categories that are used to impose the need to know (NTK) principle. Even thou a user has a security clearance of Secret it does not mean he would be able to access any Secret documents within the system. He would be allowed to access only Secret document for which he has a Need To Know, formal approval, and object where the user belong to one of the categories attached to the object.\nIf there is no clearance and no labels then IT IS NOT Mandatory Access Control.\nMany of the other models can mimic MAC but none of them have labels and a dominance relationship so they are NOT in the MAC category.\nDAC = Discretionary Access Control\nDAC is also known as: Identity Based access control system.\nThe owner of an object is define as the person who created the object. As such the owner has the discretion to grant access to other users on the network.\nAccess will be granted based solely on the identity of those users.\nSuch system is good for low level of security. One of the major problem is the fact that a user who has access to someone's else file can further share the file with other users without the knowledge or permission of the owner of the file. Very quickly this could become the wild wild west as there is no control on the dissimination of the information.\nRBAC = Role Based Access Control\nRBAC is a form of Non-Discretionary access control.\nRole Based access control usually maps directly with the different types of jobs performed by employees within a company.\nFor example there might be 5 security administrator within your company. Instead of creating each of their profile one by one, you would simply create a role and assign the administrators to the role. Once an administrator has been assigned to a role, he will IMPLICITLY inherit the permissions of that role.\nRBAC is great tool for environment where there is a a large rotation of employees on a daily basis such as a very large help desk for example.\nRBAC or RuBAC = Rule Based Access Control\nRuBAC is a form of Non-Discretionary access control.\nA good example of a Rule Based access control device would be a Firewall. A single set of rules is imposed to all users attempting to connect through the firewall.\nSource: KRUTZ, Ronald L. & VINES, Russel D., The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Page 33. and\nNISTIR-7316 at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/7316/NISTIR-7316.pdf and http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Identity-based_access_control","exam_id":189,"question_images":[],"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_images":[],"discussion":[{"comment_id":"994194","timestamp":"1725027000.0","poster":"Rixster","upvote_count":"2","content":"Selected Answer: A\nA.
