This can help eliminate manual user access reviews and improve compliance by automating the process of granting, modifying, and revoking user access based on defined policies and rules. It can also provide visibility into user access and activity, making it easier to identify and address any potential compliance issues.","comments":[{"upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1699846980.0","poster":"jackdryan","content":"C is correct","comment_id":"896352"}]},{"comment_id":"1213353","poster":"TheManiac","upvote_count":"1","timestamp":"1731948060.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nImplement a role-based access control (RBAC) system should be the answer"},{"comment_id":"1093878","content":"C.
