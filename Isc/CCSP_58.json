Problem management is focused on identifying and mitigating known problems and deficiencies before they occur. Deployment management is a subcomponent of change management and is where the actual code or configuration change is put into place. Change management involves the processes and procedures that allow an organization to make changes to its IT systems and services in a controlled manner.","timestamp":"2020-10-08 16:39:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"unix_timestamp":1602167940,"choices":{"D":"Change management","C":"Problem management","B":"Deployment management","A":"Incident management"},"question_text":"Which component of ITIL involves handling anything that can impact services for either internal or public users?"},{"id":"NywZHfteZsugPWY5DRXb","choices":{"C":"Transfer","B":"Handshake","D":"Record","A":"Negotiation"},"question_id":287,"exam_id":184,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/34755-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-357-discussion/","answer_ET":"D","answer_images":[],"answer_description":"The TLS record protocol is the actual secure communications method for transmitting data; it's responsible for encrypting and authenticating packets throughout their transmission between the parties, and in some cases it also performs compression.
