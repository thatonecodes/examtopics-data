Unsupported libraries refer to software libraries or components that are no longer actively maintained or updated by their developers. These libraries may have become outdated or obsolete, making them vulnerable to security vulnerabilities and issues that could be exploited by attackers. Unsupported libraries are a concern in software development and supply chain security because they pose a risk to the security and stability of the applications and systems that depend on them. Organizations should actively monitor and update their software components, including libraries, to mitigate these risks and ensure the security of their software supply chain.","timestamp":"1717935060.0","comment_id":"1091840","upvote_count":"3"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1077631","timestamp":"1716393600.0","content":"OSG 9th edition. pg 99 , \"This could happen if your supplier reuses components (like libraries) developed elsewhere...\"\nTough one, but I'm going with...A","poster":"shmoeee"},{"upvote_count":"3","comment_id":"1015028","content":"Selected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A: \"Unsupported libraries are often used\". The use of unsupported libraries in software development can pose a significant security risk to organizations. Unsupported libraries may have vulnerabilities that are not patched or addressed by the developer, which can be exploited by attackers. Additionally, unsupported libraries may not receive timely updates or support, which can leave them vulnerable to exploits.
