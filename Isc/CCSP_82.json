Hardening the operating system means making it more secure. Limiting administrator access, closing unused ports, and removing unnecessary services and libraries all have the potential to make an OS more secure. But removing antimalware agents would actually make the system less secure. If anything, antimalware agents should be added, not removed.","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/76154-exam-ccsp-topic-1-question-465-discussion/","answer_images":[],"choices":{"D":"Removing unnecessary services and libraries","A":"Limiting administrator access","C":"Removing antimalware agents","B":"Closing unused ports"},"question_text":"Hardening the operating system refers to all of the following except:","exam_id":184,"timestamp":"2022-05-23 10:34:00","question_images":[],"unix_timestamp":1653294840},{"id":"82NUIzM61rAGbnmSpOD7","discussion":[{"timestamp":"1741540860.0","content":"Selected Answer: C\nA SOC 3 report is the most likely SSAE audit report that a cloud provider will share with customers, because:\n\n✔ It is a public summary of the more detailed SOC 2 Type 2 report.\n✔ It provides high-level assurances about the provider's security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy controls.\n✔ Unlike SOC 2 reports, which are restricted, SOC 3 reports are designed for public distribution, making them ideal for marketing and trust-building.","comment_id":"1373348","poster":"MaciekMT","upvote_count":"1"},{"poster":"TheProfezzor","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1206197","content":"This is from the \"ISC2 Official Guide to CCSP CBK - 2nd Edition\".

While SLAs, shared administration, and audits contribute to enhancing trust, real-time video surveillance does not directly affect a customer's ability to assess a provider's security or service reliability.\n\nWhy the Other Options Enhance Trust:\nA. SLAs (Service Level Agreements) → Define performance guarantees, security commitments, and responsibilities between the provider and customer.\nB. Shared Administration → Allows the customer to maintain some level of control over their environment, improving visibility and trust.\nC. Audits → Independent security and compliance audits (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS) provide assurance that the provider follows best practices."},{"timestamp":"1732525740.0","content":"Selected Answer: B\nShared","upvote_count":"1","poster":"piipo","comment_id":"1218065"},{"timestamp":"1683572640.0","comment_id":"714119","content":"Selected Answer: D\nAgree, D","upvote_count":"3","poster":"AJ2021"},{"upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"701779","timestamp":"1682197080.0","poster":"serget12","content":"I guess the use of the word \"enhanced\" is the issue.
