But organizations often have difficulties to accurately measure the effectiveness and the cost of their information security activities.\nThe classical financial approach for ROI calculation is not particularly appropriate for measuring security-related initiatives: Security is not generally an investment that results in a profit. Security is more about loss prevention. In other terms, when you invest in security, you dont expect benefits; you expect to reduce the risks threatening your assets.\nThe concept of the ROI calculation applies to every investment. Security is no exception. Executive decision-makers want to know the impact security is having on the bottom line. In order to know how much they should spend on security, they need to know how much is the lack of security costing to the business and what are the most cost-effective solutions.\nApplied to security, a Return On Security Investment (ROSI) calculation can provide quantitative answers to essential financial questions:\nIs an organization paying too much for its security?\nWhat financial impact on productivity could have lack of security?\nWhen is the security investment enough?\nIs this security product/organisation beneficial?\nThe following are other concerns about computer security but not the first and foremost:\nThe costs and benefits of security should be carefully examined in both monetary and non-monetary terms to ensure that the cost of controls does not exceed expected benefits.\nSecurity should be appropriate and proportionate to the value of and degree of reliance on the IT systems and to the severity, probability, and extent of potential harm.\nRequirements for security vary, depending upon the particular IT system. Therefore it does not make sense for computer security to cover all identified risks when the cost of the measures exceeds the value of the systems they are protecting.\nReference(s) used for this question:\nSWANSON, Marianne & GUTTMAN, Barbara, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), NIST Special Publication 800-14, Generally Accepted\nPrinciples and Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems, September 1996 (page 6). and http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/introduction-to-return-on-security-investment","isMC":true,"question_text":"Computer security should be first and foremost which of the following:","question_id":111,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/148948-exam-sscp-topic-4-question-132-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1728521280,"timestamp":"2024-10-10 02:48:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Be examined in both monetary and non-monetary terms.","A":"Cover all identified risks","B":"Be cost-effective.","D":"Be proportionate to the value of IT systems."}},{"id":"nHNQDYf8IaIaMTzLSpOH","answer_ET":"Explanation","answer_images":[],"exam_id":189,"answer":"A","url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/78166-exam-sscp-topic-4-question-136-discussion/","question_text":"The MOST common threat that impacts a business's ability to function normally is:","question_id":112,"timestamp":"2022-08-22 14:01:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":["A (100%)"],"answer_description":"The MOST common threat that impacts a business's ability to function normally is power.

What system are you going to contain a potential intrusion to?\n-- Ok so lets say you chose to take \"System A\" offline.\n-- What if thats not the point of entry and not the only system compromised?\n-- What is someone has persistent access via a network router and continuing to push malicious code to other systems?\nLogically you need to follow:\n1. IDS alarm\n2. Determine if its actually an issue and to what extent. If its an actual intrution and not just a \"possible\" then continue on.\n3. Attempt to contain and cut off access if needed or possible. Sometimes you have no clue where access could be originating from. Email link clicked so no web attack? Removable media? Through ISP network? \nLong story short, you need to ensure the potential threat and intrusion is real and assess the situation before shutting systems down all willy nilly.","poster":"catastrophie","comments":[{"comments":[{"content":"Contain what?

You must make sure that a crime has in fact been committed before implementing your reaction plan.\nInformation, as collected and interpreted through analysis, is key to your decisions and actions while executing response procedures. This first analysis will provide information such as what attacks were used, what systems and data were accessed by the intruder, what the intruder did after obtaining access and what the intruder is currently doing (if the intrusion has not been contained).\nThe next step is to communicate with relevant parties who need to be made aware of the intrusion in a timely manner so they can fulfil their responsibilities.\nStep three is concerned with collecting and protecting all information about the compromised systems and causes of the intrusion. It must be carefully collected, labelled, catalogued, and securely stored.\nContaining the intrusion, where tactical actions are performed to stop the intruder's access, limit the extent of the intrusion, and prevent the intruder from causing further damage, comes next.\nSince it is more a long-term goal, eliminating all means of intruder access can only be achieved last, by implementing an ongoing security improvement process.\nReference used for this question:\nALLEN, Julia H., The CERT Guide to System and Network Security Practices, Addison-Wesley, 2001, Chapter 7: Responding to Intrusions (pages 271-289).","isMC":true,"question_text":"When a possible intrusion into your organization's information system has been detected, which of the following actions should be performed first?","question_id":114,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/77826-exam-sscp-topic-4-question-146-discussion/","unix_timestamp":1659179880,"timestamp":"2022-07-30 13:18:00","answer_images":[],"choices":{"A":"Eliminate all means of intruder access.","B":"Contain the intrusion.","D":"Communicate with relevant parties.","C":"Determine to what extent systems and data are compromised."}},{"id":"LGHPmSje5f2hvK8RiDnt","answer_ET":"C","answer_images":[],"exam_id":189,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/isc/view/124524-exam-sscp-topic-4-question-147-discussion/","answer":"B","question_text":"When first analyzing an intrusion that has just been detected and confirming that it is a true positive, which of the following actions should be done as a first step if you wish to prosecute the attacker in court?","question_id":115,"timestamp":"2023-10-24 07:04:00","isMC":true,"answers_community":["B (100%)"],"answer_description":"When an intrusion has been detected and confirmed, if you wish to prosecute the attacker in court, the following actions should be performed in the following order:\nCapture and record system information and evidence that may be lost, modified, or not captured during the execution of a backup procedure. Start with the most volative memory areas first.\nMake at least two full backups of the compromised systems, using hardware-write-protectable or write-once media. A first backup may be used to re-install the compromised system for further analysis and the second one should be preserved in a secure location to preserve the chain of custody of evidence.\nIsolate the compromised systems.\nSearch for signs of intrusions on other systems.\nExamine logs in order to gather more information and better identify other systems to which the intruder might have gained access.\nSearch through logs of compromised systems for information that would reveal the kind of attacks used to gain access.\nIdentify what the intruder did, for example by analyzing various log files, comparing checksums of known, trusted files to those on the compromised machine and by using other intrusion analysis tools.\nRegardless of the exact steps being followed, if you wish to prosecute in a court of law it means you MUST capture the evidence as a first step before it could be lost or contaminated. You always start with the most volatile evidence first.\nNOTE:\nI have received feedback saying that some other steps may be done such as Disconnecting the system from the network or shutting down the system. This is true. However, those are not choices listed within the 4 choices attached to this question, you MUST avoid changing the question. You must stick to the four choices presented and pick which one is the best out of the four presented.\nIn real life, Forensic is not always black or white. There are many shades of grey.
